Brooks Story by Mark Andrus : ( ),  - apartment doorway
As it opens and an enormously -,   steps out, bungled up against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life
- 'm just going to get some flowers, dear
'll be back in twenty minutes
It's tulip season today
'm so happy
And now she turns and faces the hallway
her sweetness dissolves in a flash
replaced by repulsion and that quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her apartment
closing the door as we consider her vacated
- in the hallway
Well past 50
unliked, unloved, unsettling
huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever met
Right now all his considerable talent and strength is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open
Come here, sweetheart
come on
Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting
Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt who has ignores him
Wanna go for a ride
Okay, sweetie
The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two
The sensing a kindred spirit starts to  and
(a malevolent tone) You've pissed your last floor, you dog-eared monkey
The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute
'll bet you wish you were some sort of real dog now, huh
Don't worry
this is New York
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, you know
You ugly, smelly fuck
And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets go
We hear a   of  "" from the  fade to nothingness
as another apartment door opens emitting the loud sounds of a  and , early 30s
Simon has been born and raised with Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man
( ),  - Frantic
he bolts into the hall
Melvin is just about to enter his apartment
Verdell
Here, good doggie
He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall
Mr
Udall
excuse me
Hey there
(as Melvin turns) Have you seen Verdell
What's he look like
Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite Simon's
My dog
you know
mean my little dog with the adorable face
Don't you know what my dog looks like
got it
You're talking about your dog
thought that was the name of the colored man 've been seeing in the hall
Simon looks
-- and sees his black friend
Which color was that
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food
Simon has had it
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall
(not missing a beat) How're you doing
Franks shows my work, Mr
Udall think you know that
(overlapping) Simon, you've got to get dressed
(to Simon) What  know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me,  don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show
Are we being neighbors for now
(to Frank) Do you still think  was exaggerating
can only smile
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch
Hope you find him
love that dog
Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin
(directly) You don't love anything, Mr
Udall
Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the hallway
love throwing your dog down the garbage chute
' ,  - Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to five with each lock
He turns the lights quickly on and off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens the medicine chest
Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps
He unwraps one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the process two more times
' ,   - group of   enters -- followed by a holding Verdell who looks and finds: who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves quickly toward the group and his dog
Thank the good Lord
wow
my honey
where have you been
(thinking the greeting's for him) He always liked me
As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the Handyman
, Frank's junior partner, barking a laugh at the Party Goer --   some love
As the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside
Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body
he puts Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny in protest
Just for a second, okay
The   "no
" Simon, delighted, picks him up again
(kissing him on the mouth) Look at him
where was little baby
(smiling) In the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit
Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in cheek, trying to suppress his amusement
Go ahead, John, you earned your fun
(looking at Verdell) How did he get down in the basement
mean even if he got on the elevator how
Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him down the garbage chute
My God
No
He stares out
Frank frustrated following
'  -  - Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he writes
'Somewhat in the dark, she had confessed and he had forgiven
This is what you live for, he said
Two heads on a pillow where there is only the safety of being with each other
How, she wondered, could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her
' He barely reacts as we hear a   at he reads
(
) Mr
Udall
But Melvin's into it
His fingers flying as he reads
'At last she was able to define love
Love was
' More
(
) Mr
Udall, 'd like to talk to you please
'Love was
' He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of love -- but the knocking throws him
Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed- stool-pusher
He burst from his chair
( ) -  - As Simon hears  through the door and takes a step back
Melvin throws open the door
He looks demonic
(loud and angry) Yeeeess
Maybe this can wait
Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door
found Verdell, Mr
Udall
Well, that's a load off
Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery
Did you
do something to him
Do you realize that  work at him
(eyes downcast) No,  didn't
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden
No
actually,  even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d
Well,  work all the time
So never, never again interrupt me
Okay
mean, never
Not 30 years from now
not if there's fire
Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States
and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone
don't knock not on this door
Not for anything
Got me
Sweetheart
Yes
It's not a subtle point you're making
Okay, then
Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut
So the theory of confrontations is that now he'll think twice before messing with me
Frank smiles affectionately
Simon turns serious
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he
Won't worry about it
You go ahead
Frank waits till Simon   and then knocks loudly on Melvin's door
There is a sharp change in his demeanor
(
) Oh, 'm pissed
Now  am really pissed
Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open
Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward
Melvin is scared
Operating on survival mode
No touch
No touch
No touch
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but  grew up in Hell
My grandmother had more attitude
You don't intimidate me
(calling) Police
Police
Fucking crooked police
doughnut-munching morons help me
(to Frank) Assault and battery and you're black
Shhhh now
like Simon
like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again
Meanwhile, 'll try and think how you can make this up to him
(suddenly loud) hate doing this
'm an art dealer
(beat) Have a nice day
Party
He tosses Melvin back and walks out
Melvin straightens his shirt as he steps out into the hall
Frank smiles as he re-enters the other apartment
Melvin appears impressed
'  - crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin
His walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear
At times he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a path through people
We will be very pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks
His eyes focused on the terrain
'  - talks with another  -- a customer
You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be the most carefree time of the day
She is telling a story about her son for the umpteenth time
(to the Mother's little girl) Look at you, you're all better
It's that new medication
You know all my son's stuff, right
The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but Carol interrupts her
No, no, no,  got a date tonight
'm walking out the door this morning and he says to me, 'Mom, promise not to get one of my fevers or coughs during your date
' Isn't that sweet
Little blonde angle
(to child, affectionately) Eat everything
Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a  and  sitting at the table
It just came out of me
said you love me the way a remote control loves a
As long as switch every time
Wonderful
People who talk in metaphors can shampoo my crotch
(on their look) Eat up
They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where two waitresses,  and , are talking
Pay me back next week
owe you
told you today
them's the rules
Oh, excuse me, Melvin
She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way
He gulps at the contact (since no one else ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness
'm starving
(firmly to Lisa) Will you please take it
Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out of the way
This way you take a cab home so you have time to get ready for the date
"Ready" is not my problem
She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh
If we could read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk
To Carol he is as harmless as furniture
(to Melvin) Go sit down
You know you're not allowed back here
Spencer's more excited about it than  am
He says, "Mom,  promise not to get a fever or couch during your date
" The other  and the    all go "awww
" know
He's just the best
've got Jews at my table
It's not your table
It's the place's table
Behave
This once, you can sit at someone else's station
The two waitresses signal their protests
Or you can just wait your turn
Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper
he hangs near their table
his discomfort builds in this limbo
then: How much more you got to eat
Your appetite isn't as big as your noses, is it
What
(to Woman) Let's go -- The Woman starts to protest
Let's leave
We're going
Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed
As he opens his utensils
Bryan says he doesn't care how long you've been coming you ever act like this again you're barred for life
'm gonna miss the excitement, but 'll handle it
There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the place who can handle him
She starts to clear the table
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it
Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that
We're all gonna die soon
will
You will
It sure sounds like your son will
Stunned
Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her
Melvin senses that he's gone way too far
He wipes his knife
If you ever mention my son again, you will never be able to eat here again
Do you understand
Give me some sign you understand or leave now
Do you understand me
(adds truthful label) you crazy freak
Do you
beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing down
Okay
'll get your order
She walks away
Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip
He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself
'  - She is underneath a , cuter  on the living room sofa
He is expertly into foreplay
She begins to make noises as she responds
each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in
She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway -- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the emergence of this sexy self that she laughs
The Young Man stops and looks at her
What
don't know
You got me
His eyes try to burn into hers
She is getting excited but doesn't know how to play it
He pushes one of the fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her mouth
She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt opening her mouth
She stops him
Let me just do whatever  do by myself
'll catch up to you someplace  promise
(as he's put off) Oh, no
don't look like that
No
'm sorry if 'm a goof
And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about egg in your beer, hotter
Things are getting wild when we hear from the distance a child, ,  and Kissing
kissing boys
Oh my
Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues
(
) (softly) Grandma, grandma
Maybe you better check
Like what did you think  was going to do
/'  - Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway
she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother, , is listening to music on headphones
she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough
'm sorry
was hearing just everything you were doing so  put these on to give you privacy
Carol now goes into her son's room
'  - The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights
two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing contraption) a waste basket
a night stand filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit
along with some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small  wedged into the tiny space
'm sorry
Don't be silly
How bad
Not bad
Carol feels his head
that's okay
Then he coughs -- trying to suppress it
then a bigger cough
they each know what that signals
She brings up a waste basket as he throws up
she comforts him
He apologizes
She loves him
- As she re-enters
He is taking a cigarette from a pack
(a bit panicked) You can't smoke
He can't take smoke
He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his hand
She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste
She barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth
Oh, God
don't even notice anymore
She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel
Tries to make light
That'll teach you
Don't apologize
(perturbed) That wasn't an apology
She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her -- how uncomfortable he is
Hey
this is just a little throw- up -- it's nothing to be so embarrassed about
Really
(as he shifts uncomfortably) Thanks for the dinner
Let me write down which trains you take to get back
No way
She brightens
'll take a cab
She deflates as he moves past her
Too much reality for a Friday night
- cold night in hell
Three young men bullshit near the approach to the tunnel
Their names are , and , who is the oldest at 28
Vincent is dopey and the most likeable of the gritty little trio
Why is every customer surprised read books
(amazed) You read books
Oh, wow
know this guy
Look
He even bought me dinner
They all focus on a black  as it slows and stops in front of them
checks them out carefully through the front window
He is talking on the speaker phone
(slightly exasperated) Look,  just can't
promised Simon 'd find him a model
(
) (on speaker phone, flirting) Carl, take me off the speaker
Did  tell you that these are house seats
'mon, you could use a break
Hello
Carl, are you there
hello
Seeing the hustlers: just found a model
(to Carl) Hey, how it's goin'
Hey, hi
remember
only need one
You picked me up, maybe a few weeks,  don't know, some time ago
You were very flattering about our
encounter
Maybe just you and me
but this is for a painting
need a pretty face
Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest
'  - There is a  at the door -- Simon crosses to answer
He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who scratches at the door
Simon opens the door to Vincent
Sorry,  was out in the studio doing some work and  forgot about our appointment
He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away -- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment
usually make such a big deal out of picking models but Carl's so thorough
'll bet he drove you nuts checking your references
And he turns and sees the naked model
(taken aback) This isn't a nude
Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes
Just kidding around
(then mutters) So much for love
'  -  ( ) Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy Simon
Exactly what is your previous experience
How about that pose
(sing-song) This is not fun
(then) Give me some direction
Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive
He tries not to show it
Nothing
just watch till something strikes me
Do anything you think of -- try different thing
Until  say, "hold that pose
" Then just try and comfortably hold it
(trying another space) The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means  haven't done it right
is that correct haven't done it right
No
Okay
What  do is watch and wait for, um
You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching
an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had
They are just sort of realer and more alive
And when you notice it so are you
If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity
Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes
He feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation
know exactly what you mean
There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity
Hold it
Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to celebrate
- Carol and , another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar
Leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life
Carol is rapt
As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give him notice
Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary on her every action
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me
Listening to the story from the upset friend
now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you
" No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe
(reluctant forgiveness) Okay
Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an uncharacteristic rabbit punch
What's with the plastic picnic ware
Why not try ours
afraid it isn't clean
see the help -- judgement call
Just give yourself a little pep talk
"Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out
" What's wrong with your son, anyway
What do you care
Melvin just looks at her
He's gotta fight to breathe
His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection
Is this bothering you
(caught) No
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where  get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor
Nice chatting with you
His name
Spencer
Okay
(quietly) Spence
She exits
'  -  -  (  ) The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent
beat and then a strange figure crosses between the  and the scene -- gone before we can examine him further
You can put on anything you want now
might be sort of done here
Vincent quickly and expertly picks a  to meet his immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every second of silence during the transition
then Vincent even  the
Simon does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down -- which Vincent does
- where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses to look past the terrace to the studio
Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting
' ,  - -- Simon cleaning up his stuff
So you're practically finished, huh
Yes
well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good
Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another perspective
he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod of self-approval -- he's finished
Vincent is desperate to distract
dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his ears
He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention
As Simon keeps walking
Vincent shoots over to the canvas
Wait --  want to see the painting
Just a second -- he has to go
Please
Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a bullet
Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown to see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized
" '  -   - Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as stops them with a vicious  and
Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon
(to Vincent) What's the matter, sweetheart
He instantly stops
Shocked
Frozen
His eyes on the stranger, Doug, looking at him
Now Vincent comes in
Doug greets him
Yo
Simon turns to Vincent
Why are you doing this
No
No
No
Hey, that painting in there
just want to tell you
Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack
(to Vincent) What are you doing
Cruising him
And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club, as the brief savage attack begins
as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in fear
The three attackers leave
Now silence
single from
( ) -  - mass of   clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator
It's impossible to tell if Simon is awake or dead
Melvin is standing against the wall near his door a cop, , interviewing him
Okay
So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name
How come you make a mistake like that
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause  don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole
(stunned) What
Just move on
No one here killed him
Oh, is he dead
Ask him
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again
( ) -  - - Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash and , who is more upset making pathetic little
As we    Verdell
Frank is talking to the Sweet-Faced Woman
- 've been praying for him since heard
So 've got to get to the hospital
If you could take the dog just for tonight
- Oh, Lord -- 've got all these antique knick-knacks
Or else 'd be glad
Maybe if you kept locked in the bathroom
No
Okay
Thanks
(as he turns away and she closes the door he adds) Old bitch
Damn dog
short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings
starts  as a pissed Frank approaches his mugger: You're taking him
yes
you're taking him -- this will clear the books
One night
You want to say "no" to me
Try
because 've never felt as nuts as  do right this second
almost want you to try saying "no
" (quietly) 'm not saying nothing to you
Thanks for looking after him
Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and places Verdell inside
'  - : as Frank pulls the door partially closed to block Verdell's escape
The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him
We with the dog during the
dialogue: As his head turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue continues
(
) Hey, where are you going
You can't do this
(calls after Frank) can't take a dog
(a confession) Nobody's ever been in here before
(
) (threatening) You don't want to mess with me today
'll figure something else out tomorrow
'  -   - Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows
Now Melvin sees him
You're dead
-- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking along the far wall
Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming
don't have dog food
And won't want dog food here
You'll eat what we have
You'll eat what we eat
Melvin exits
Verdell is in a major funk
'  -  - Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the room
Don't you touch anything
'  -   - Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- ominously
Melvin sets the bowl down and exits
Verdell breathes excitedly though looking alternately in all directions
his recent past making him suspect this feast is a trick
He sniffs cautiously -- then dives in --    on a dime   his
from
we hear the sound of   as steam escapes the bathroom -- then -- as Melvin returns
ignoring Verdell he sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly
It's odd
Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl with his tail to Melvin
Then Melvin begins to play and sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain
Verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure
But just as mood lifts and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out the lights and exits
- Frank on the phone
(into phone) Put the solid red dots on three of them and the hold blue dots on two others
Well, we're not going to sell anything if they know we're two weeks into a show and have no sales
No, you can't reduce a price at this stage
We're in free fall here
Any calls
We can see him
'll meet you in there
- As Jackie enters
How you doing, great one
haven't looked at myself yet figured  could tell from your reaction
He turns toward her
Much of his body -- taped -- his painting hand wrapped
Simon's face is something of a horror
Swollen, one savage discolored cut
We are into yuccchhh
The sight is a jolt
Jackie breaks into tears
sobs, actually
That bad, huh
They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in the doorway
Hey, hey
(as he sees him) Haaa
bad but temporary
The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago
the hand will come back
they're sure
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror
(a small voice) No
She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- then thinks better of it
Wait,  have a smaller one
But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror -- he starts to look -- then thinks better of it
So, what's new anyway
How's Verdell
(sheepish) Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him
(suddenly alive and upset) How could you do that
He'll hurt him
No,  promise
not a chance own this guy
There was no one else
'm on the move too much
Trust me
You are very certain my dog is okay
because you have no idea
Yes
Your dog is fine, Simon
Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive underwater
First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself
Okay, waiting gives the devil time
Now
He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror
he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him awed by his misfortune
Oh my
Where'd  go
Ummmm
'  - Verdell tied up in front
'  - Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with his plastic knife and fork
Carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee
Melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye of his dog
So what are you doing with a dog
Suckered in
Set up
Pushed around
You're not worried that someone might take him
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake
Sorry
It's okay -- 'll sit here
He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can keep an eye on Verdell
Carol is amazed
You know he's a little dog
Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in
How old are you
Oh, please
If  had to guess by your eyes, 'd say you were fifty
Carol looks at him
And if  had to guess by your eyes
'd say you were kind
So, so much for eyes
But as long as you bring up age
how old are you
(quickly) Otherwise, you're not ugly
(laughs out loud) Okay, pal
accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast
What's with the dark
He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own
Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol
My son had a full blown attack
And this time, for extra fun, they gave us the wrong antibiotics, so get him home
She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes nuts
No
no
leave it
the bacon's for the dog
She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty
Last week  was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so decide 'm going to make a little joke
You all set here
Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story
He pockets the remaining bacon
- As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a beat before Melvin, a remarkably event
Verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk
It's a beautiful day for our walk
Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior
again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the sidewalk
Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level
Don't be like me, don't you be like me
You stay just the way you are because you are a perfect man
'm gonna take you home and get you something to eat
what you love
(charmed) Ohhh
'd like to be treated like that
(all smiles to Verdell) Let's go home and do some writing
'  -   - Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself with great satisfaction as he goes
Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his master's fingers on the keyboard
He reads his writing aloud to the dog
"He turned off the gas jets and carried her outside
He kissed her brow and when her eyes opened and found him, he said, 'there are easier ways to break a date
' She laughed
The only sensible ambition he had ever known was now realized
He had made the girl happy
And what a girl
'You've saved my life,' she said, 'you'd better make it up to me
'" Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine
(singing to Verdell) Done
(playing with him some) Yes,  hate the doggy
yes, hate the doggy
He exits
(
) Sixty-two books
done
As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our couple's play time for
'  - / / - As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul mood he'd had on falling asleep
In the living room, the maid, , is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and talk of how long Nora can stay on
-  - Frank knocking on Melvin's door
He opens it
How's Verdell doing
He's a pain in the ass
As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's surprise
Simon's home
was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust
(leaping at the chance) It's been five weeks
another few won't kill me
No
He wants him back
He'll be by tomorrow
(too loudly, weirdly) Okay by me
Frank exits
'  -   - Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him
Melvin walks to the door
He turns the lock
then checks that they are locked
checks again to make sure he turned them in the correct direction
turns from the door
then back to check once more
And again
and again
anguished, until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on
- '  -  - Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a wheelchair and shudders
That's some face they left hanging on you
You look like
(interrupting) Could you take it just a little easy, Mr
Udall
beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply
Thank you
Verdell
sweetheart
(to Melvin) By the way, thanks for saving me
called
never touched you didn't leave my name or nothing
(not listening) Verdell
Totally weirded out
hiding behind Melvin
now Melvin shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other
Simon smiles at the dog
he is emotionally caught up in the reunion
Hi, sweetheart
Verdell isn't eager
The first gnawing pains of rejection
'  - Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get Verdell to approach him
Instead the dog goes to the door and scratches at it
Jackie starts to pick the dog up
No
Please, don't force him
(to dog) You little stinker
He's given you everything
'  -   - ' Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl
Melvin's lips compress
he sits on the piano bench and hits a few keys
looks at Verdell's empty spot again
there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels the panic rise in him
all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates
Over the dog
an ugly dog
It's hilarious
But now the humor detours
An actual sob is choked back
he gets up -- following a definite pattern across the room
He is conducting a small but highest-stakes fight for survival
Momentarily a scared, beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door
- Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then turning into a building with a copper sign reading "Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group
" Worst sidewalk in New York and look where they put in
'  - Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word
Help
If you want to see me you will not do this
You will make an appointment
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like  have any choice in barging in
There's not going to be a debate
You must leave
The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to follow
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease
can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app -- (suddenly) You changed the room around
Two years ago
Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough he must go through a careful exercise noting every new element before he's at all comfortable
as he studies each object
The Doctor is professionally intrigued despite himself
also regrew my beard
but you're not interested in changes in me
so it's like  always told you
when it comes to people you
Shhhhhhh
don't have this mountain of available time got to get to my restaurant on time
Do you know how hard it is for me to be here
Yes
(as Melvin starts for the office) No
'   - More  in the almost-crowded waiting room
Melvin passes through -- visibly drawn and upset
He stops
Eyes on them
Then: (to other patients) What if this is as good as it gets
They look stricken
He exits
'  - As he walks to his booth and sits down
Enormous relief
, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils and arranges them
In a corner booth, four big are having a meal together
Cheryl looks at his utensils
What the heck are those for
No
No
Get Carol
'm filling in
We don't know if she's coming back
She might have to get a job closer to home
What are you trying to do to me
What the heck do you mean
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something
just let her do my one meal here
'll pay whatever
'll wait
(as she doesn't budge; he screams) Do it
The  comes over, gesturing to the table of police that he can handle it
All attention is on Melvin
Out
Be silent or leave
'll be quiet
Just let me wait
No problem
Get her here -- have her get me two sausages, four bacon, two eggs over easy and coffee
'm not a prick here -- 'm a great customer
This day is a disaster
can't handle this, too
Get out immediately or there's going to be trouble
Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless situation and rises
There's going to be trouble
He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other employees applaud his defeat
As he passes a  near the door he hands him 20 dollars
Carol's last name
Connelly
- An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi
' neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community
Melvin, ever the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of community life --  in front of a bar,  giving their  a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local store -- two   discuss dating
'  - As he exits --  the  and is  in
'   - / - Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing
She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a thermometer
'm hungry
(on Carol's astonished look) You've upset my whole day haven't eaten
What are you doing here
Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge he had imagined she might make
This is not a sexist thing
If you were a waiter  would still be here saying
Are you totally gone
This is my private home
am trying to keep emotions out of this
Even though this is an important issue to me and  have strong feelings about the subject
What subject
That  wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs
Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get
Yes,  do, as a matter of fact
and to prove it  have not gotten personal and you have
Why aren't you at work
You're not sick -- you don't look sick
just very tired and bitter
My son is sick, okay
Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy man at her threshold
What about your mother
How do you know about my mother
hear you talk when 'm waiting
She crosses to the sink to dump the ice
Melvin takes a step inside
Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into the room
Sorry, honey
'll be right there
(uncomfortably) How ya doing
Spencer just stares at him
(miffed) You should answer when someone talks to you
Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then emphatically gestures him to "clear out
" Melvin backs out the door
Sorry
There is a limit, Melvin, and  can't handle you teaching my son manners
She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son and leads him back to his room
' mother and son sitting on the edge of Spencer's bed
She holds a digital thermometer to his ear
They both count down the seconds

Bingo

9 We are going to treat ourselves to a cab ride
-    - As Carol carries her young son through a class of uniformed  from a Catholic elementary school
She spots Melvin about to enter a cab
Melvin, wait
The school kids pick up the chant in unison
Melvin, wait
Melvin, wait
Melvin, wait
He turns to face them
Shut up, kids
They immediately obey as Carol approaches him
Melvin
give us a lift
We've got to go see our friends at the hospital
Melvin is thrown
he pauses a beat
then holds the rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside
The maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face
'll ride up front
Cover your mouth when you cough, kid
- As they settle in and drive off
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please and quickly please
- As Carol enters the hospital
(calling back) owe you three dollars
Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son
Yeah, yeah
any chance you'll get back to work today
(furiously) No
Stay away from me
'  - Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for Melvin
Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair
she has some index cards in her laps which she occasionally consults and shuffles
feel terrible that  have to
Simon
Forget about the dog for a second
Simon forces his attention to Jackie
Sorry
What are those cards
(a bit embarrassed) Frank's idea
He thought  should have notes so  did this right
maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you
(scared shitless) Terrify me
See, he's right
need the cards
(reading from cards) Simon, you're broke
as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed
(
) The medical bill are 61 thousand now
've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you
(
) Well,  can't reach them
Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off
He turns for: (to Verdell) Here, baby
what is it, Verdell
You miss the tough guy
(trying to be Melvin-like) Well, here  am, you little pissant mop, happy to see me
How about another ride down the chute
Oh, God
don't mean it, sweetheart
(on Jackie's look) 'm sorry
know
Verdell hides behind a chair
Frank loves you
You know that
but 've spoken to him and he feels that -- (reading from card) -- as a businessman, with limited resources
'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't
Just tell me
As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card
(overwhelmed) Wow
Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet the dog and the dog ducks
'  - He is trying to write
He can't
His world has been upset
He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act
He is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits
'  - We are looking at , the receptionist
She is listening with interest to an
conversation while answering phone calls, "Premier Publishing
" (
) Yes, you write more than anyone else
Yes, you make us a lot of money, but isn't there someone more appropriate to
(
) need this
Just say, "Melvin, 'll try," okay
(
) (resigned) Melvin, 'll try
They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc
She pauses at the elevator
Now, on a pleasant note, our son got accepted at Brown
My husband
(curtly) Great, wonderful
don't need you to wait with me
She nods, pissed, waves and leaves
As Melvin waits, Zoe summons her moxie
can't resist
You usually move through here so quickly and  have so many questions  want to ask you
You have no idea what your work means to me
What's it mean
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be
(taps her head and heart) in here
Oh God, this is like a nightmare
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that
As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button etc
How do you write women so well
(as he turns toward her) think of a man and take away reason and accountability
The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close
'  - depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home
She is suddenly wary --    -- as we
' car at the curb with "" license plate
As Carol breaks into a run
'  , / - As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering sound coming from her
As she enters the apartment
Hello
Hello
(
) Mrs
Connelly, 'm in here
The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk on opening day of the hunting season
'  - What
Please
Now
Tell me
Mrs
Connelly
'm Martin Bettes Dr
Bettes
Not your name
what are you telling me your name for
Where is he
He's in the bathroom
He's fine
(overlapping) Tell me how bad it is
let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and  know better
and  let him talk me into it
He was whining and
you don't need this
Give me a second to catch hold
And so she does
Wow does she
and gives us some notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to subdue it as Dr
Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding
finally a deep breath as Spencer enters from the bathroom
All at hyper speed now
Salvation as farce
(to his mother) Hi
(they kiss) Did you know there are doctors who come to your house
No,  didn't
(to Bettes) So why are you h
Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room
She is ebullient which, if life allowed, would be her natural state
didn't know you had a secret admire
Huh
You met the gift
He's good
And 'm an expert on doctors
(to Spencer) Stay out of this
Doctor
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher
(as Carol reacts) She says  have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work
What work do you do
'm a waitress
Dr
Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace
In Manhattan
(
) Dr
Bettes
In here
enters
Sorry it took so long
don't know Brooklyn
It's okay, Terry
(hands her blood vail) Tell the lab 'd like the report back today
Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity
You're going to get the results today
As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from each other at a small table
soft voices
relaxation
Bettes is examining medicine bottles
How long has he been having problems
Since forever
Have they done blood tests on him
Yes
Only in the emergency room or when he was well
Emergency room only
Have they done skin testing for allergies
No
They haven't done the standard scratch test
Where they make small injections into the skin
No
asked
They said it's not covered under my plan
And it's not necessary anyway
It's amazing these things weren't done
Fucking
bastard piece of shit
'm sorry
forgive me
No
Actually,  think that's their technical name
Once the tests come back, is there someone  can reach in your office for the results
Me
My home number is on this card
His home number
Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh
Beverly has a hard time stopping
(to doctor) Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves
Water
Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room
No
She starts towards Spencer's room
You don't have to do it this second
it's not dangerous or anything
It's just something that's advisable
Look, there's a lot to be checked but
Hey, your son is going to feel a good deal better at the very least
She pats his head
Then embraces him with fierce intimacy
Doc
(then) So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll
They're considerable
But Mr
Udall wants to be billed
She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin
'  - Simon practices walking using his cane
tearstained Nora hugs him good-bye
You poor, poor man
Let's use just one poor, okay
Anyway, dear, thanks for everything
Forgive my recent crankiness and as soon as things are on track again 'll call
She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something
What's wrong
Who's going to walk Verdell
Simon hadn't thought of this either
No, no
( ) -  - Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door
Melvin opens the door
Nora is still sniffling
He misinterprets
Is he dead yet
No
Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him
Absolutely
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet
Sure thing
You're a wonderful man
Two o'clock is a good time
Here's the key in case he's asleep
Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"
Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey
Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here
He closes the door in her face
She stands there
thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then continues on her way
' The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing
There is a seriously goofy man behind this
You are not allowed to block out that fact
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help
It lets a crazy man into our lives
Come on
Why fight when we know how it will come out
This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls
You don't send this one back
-  - '  - Shades drawn
Simon is a wheelchair
the
He goes to answer
the phone across the bed so that reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult struggle
he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he answers
Hello
yes
sure
finally, huh
Why, "finally"
Because called you so many times
Maybe 20
(relief) Oh, boy
was hoping it was something like that
You didn't get one of them, huh
'Cause mean it wasn't only your office -- it was your home, hotel and the cigar club you like in San Francisco
No -- Sarcastic
Of course
believe you
No, don't fire anyone
Please
Maybe 'm wrong about the 20 times
Take a breath
(more) So, you miss me a little
Hey, strike the question -- How's the case going
Really
Fantastic
didn't hear
haven't been watching
Great
Just great
'm so happy
Whoopie
Me
Well, 'm mending
No,  look fine
Well, some of the damage might still be noticeable if you look closely
He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and beaten face
Carl,  need some help and you're the logical one to turn to
(aghast) No
Not 'cause  blame you for what happened
hardly get how you can ever think that
No, 'm not being sarcastic
(trying to figure it out) guess because you hired the guy who did this you think
No,  am a sarcastic person
Well, if you must know, the reason  said you were the logical person is because you always told me how you thought  was this great person who made you feel good about humanity and everything
You do remembering saying that
Well, whew
Okay, so Carl
hate asking but this money thing is ridiculously serious
He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance
"Will you please loan me money will pay you back
will give you whatever percentage of my income  don't absolutely need until  do
It will take a while
But  don't know what 'll do if you say"
that
(as he listens) understand
yes
No,  do
(a bit of boldness) But you know, you know -- you didn't even ask how much, Carl
Well, Frank has no right to discuss how much 'm in hock
no, you're right -- not the point
So
what have you been up to
Uh-huh
Oh, the group show
how was it
Well, 'm not surprised that there's that much talent around
great
Look -- gotta go
no, you shouldn't feel that way at all
take care, you, too
you, too
Good-bye
(as he hangs up) Pal o' mine
It's very quiet
- lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional release --    him as if to rendezvous with the moment of catharsis
but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the just as he begins sobbing to focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering the room
Maybe 'll bring him some food by
Thank you for walking him
Simon wheels away from Melvin
If you'll excuse me 'm not feeling so well
It smells like shit in here
Go away
That cleaning woman doesn't
Please, just leave
Where are all your queer party friends
(his first shout) Get out
Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping
Verdell looks at Simon with concern
Melvin is thrown
Moved
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression
Rot in hell, Melvin
No need to stop being a lady
quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time
Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows
Is this fun for you
Well, you lucky devil
It just gets better and better
am losing my apartment and Frank wants me to promise to paint hotter subjects and to beg my parents, who haven't called, for help
and  won't
And  don't want to paint anymore
Melvin has made for the door
Simon blocks him
So the life  was trying for is over
The life  had is gone and am feeling so damn sorry for myself that it is difficult to breathe
Right times for you -- huh, Melvin
The gay neighbor is terrified
(a sudden screamed word surprises them both) Terrified
Lucky you, you're here for rock bottom
me wallowing in self-pity in front of you, you absolute horror of a human being
As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with discomfort
Well, 'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up
Get out
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy
You want to know why the dog prefers me
it's not affection
It's a trick
Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's rapt
Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair
carry bacon in my pocket
(pleased) Oh, my gosh
(hands him bacon) Now we'll both call him
Come on, sweetheart
Yo, yo, yo
Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin
who is totally surprised and staggered by the implications
True love and such
Would you leave now, please
Stupid dog
(to Simon) don't get it
He exits
looking apologetically at Simon in stoic ruin
'  -   - Carol in bed on the pullout sofa
She is in turmoil
there is , but no rain
She walks to the kitchen
She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits
- The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep
Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving her nightgown on the floor
There is something sexy here, the woman in Carol churning
She plops on a summer dress -- no time for underwear
- Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it
- Carol crossing to Manhattan
She looks as if she's on her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the subject
-  '  - () Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the rains come
We are in a familiar neighborhood
' As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on it
-  () As she enters building and realizes it's not just that she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet -shirt contest
the fabric clinging to her breasts, like the old movie poster of The Deep
-  - As Carol passes Simon's door
stands in front of Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness and knocks on the door
then  the
Finally Carol hears    on the other side of the door
Uh, Udall
(
) Carol the waitress
Yes
As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her breasts and gasps
She grasps the fabric and holds it straight out just as Melvin opens the door
His hair is static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it self-conscious pats
The doctors had your billing address
'm sorry about the hour
was working
can't you just drop me a thank-you note
That's not why 'm here
(tearing suddenly) though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer
(very uncomfortable) Note
Put it in the note
Why did yo do this for me
To get you back at work so you can wait on me
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds
'm worried that you did this because
She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long silence
Finally
You waiting for me to say something
(as she shakes her head) What sort of thing do you want
Look, 'll be at the restaurant tomorrow
don't think  can wait until tomorrow
This needs clearing up
What needs clearing up
(strong and true) 'm not going to sleep with you
will never, ever sleep with you
Never
Not ever
Melvin's reaction
Well, he'll never get credit for the brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to scream -- -- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt during his half turn away from her -- and then answer hoarsely
'm sorry
We don't open for the no-sex oaths until 9 a
m
Carol is amused, surprised
maybe, in some small way ever taken by his style
but top priority is clarity
'm not kidding
Okay
Anything else
Just how grateful  am
Her mission completed -- she turns
So you'll be at work
Yes
'  - It's a 3:22 a
m
as the two digital clocks on Melvin's night stand tell us
He gets up -- the first time we've seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his body angles from the bed in a deliberate way
He is having anxiety
He sits at the piano and plays very briefly
Stops -- wipes some sweat from his forehead
Walks to his computer room -- turns the light on and then quickly off
Walks to his refrigerator
' , ,   - As he grabs a cardboard take-out box
- /'
He knocks of Simon's door
It opens quickly
' took a chance you were up
Simon walks painfully back to a chair
brought you Chinese soup
Thanks
have never been so tired in my life
Okay, if  sit here
Got any easier questions
Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him
haven't been sleeping haven't been clear or felt like myself
'm in trouble
Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back
But the tiredness -- boy
Not just sleepy
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain
(brightening) Yeah
He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to take it from here
'm glad we did this
He rises and makes an awkward exit
Good talking to you
He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned
'  - Carol seated working on a letter
She is trying to express her gratitude
An enormous sheaf of completed pages sit next to her
She is so involved she doesn't even look up as a young man, , knocks on the door and is let in by Beverly
They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly hear Spencer greeting him
We   and read over Carol's shoulder -- "'m sorry to have gotten sloppy and emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my conscionce (sic) forever if  didn't tell you how gratefull (sic)
" You're not still writing that thank-you note
'm on the last page
How do you spell conscience
-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e
got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out
still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone
How do you spell it again
Spencer is okay
You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time
If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little
(struts and pumps her arms) You ought to get Mr
Udall to send you over a psychiatrist
(more emotionally than she intended) don't need one 'cause  know what's really going on here have to finish this letter or 'll go nuts
(looking at paper; weepy) This can't be right -- con- science
Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself on the brink of crying
Carol
What
Carol is amazed at herself
that she might not be able to stem the flow
wide-eyed with apprehension, she looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission for Carol to let it go
last defiant snort from Carol -- and then she is overwhelmed
The headline comes first
don't know
It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time
Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody
Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and  felt myself giving them a dirty look --  had no idea everything was
Go ahead
(great, forceful hand gestures) moving in the wrong direction
Away from when even remembered what it was like to have a man to
anything
hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake
was feeling like really bad that Dr
Bettes is married
(this next one's tough) Which is probably why  make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to
Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems
He has to make up for his mom not getting any
(weeps at her insight) Oh, boy
Who needs these thoughts
Spencer's doing fine
So what are you saying, that you're frustr
Leave me be
Why are you doing this
Why are you picking at my sores
What is it that you want
You want what
What's with you
hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all  want is to not do this has some purpose
(puffy; red; furious) What is it, Mom
No kidding
Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked husky voiced question
What is it you want
What
want us to go out
beat, then
(simply) Okay
' , ' ,  - As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their cry
(to Sean) We're going out
(looking at their red eyes) Looks like fun
She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting
Okay -- we're out of here
love you
Spencer nods -- involved with Sean
Carol as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading
Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then to her son to ask: Do you love me
Uh-huh
Carol exits
-  '
() - Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows simple and unprecedented experience in their recent lives
Nice to get out, isn't it
Carol nods tightly
then they wrap arms around each other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar
'  -    - As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 14-page letter
In the b
g
Melvin and Frank are seated at the same table and in earnest conversation
Lisa keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages
Don't get it wet
Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol
So it's okay
You almost have me liking him
You sure come from the heart never knew what you went through with everything
wanted him to know how much he'd done
(looking over) Can you believe he's eating with someone
& It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off
Sure -- take him to the vet
did
And his stomach is out of whack
So they need him for a couple of days
Do it
Melvin
She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope
What's this
(sotto) thank-you note for what you did for me
He hands it back to her deliberately
She takes it and walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note
After Carol leaves
She's nice
(to Frank) Really nice
Shouldn't that be a good thing
telling someone, 'no thanks required
' It looks like it really went over
You're sure making the rounds
Simon says you brought him soup last night
hope he doesn't write you a note
Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing message
What
"What
" Look at you
You sense a mark
Hey -- you called me
About a dog
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now
you helped with the dog
And now there are other things
'm just as concerned as you are about Simon
Concerned
'm just the hall monitor here
It's not only financial assistance
What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money
It's not going to happen on the phone
Yeah
If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules
Good
Yes
And tomorrow
have a high maintenance selling painter coming through
So 'm out
Can you take him
Think white and get serious
Carol enters scene
Take my car -- a convertible
Do you drive
(loudly) Like the wind but 'm not doing it
Getting loud, getting loud
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore
want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so can get out of this city
She exits
Frank prepares to depart
Okay
'll take him
Get him packed -- ready -- tomorrow morning
Frank stumbles back
self-satisfied, he relaxes
(excited) Okay
so 'll see you tomorrow
Let's not drag this out
We don't enjoy another that much
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know
Last word freak
Frank adjusts and exits
Carol approaches calling a "good-bye" to him
So
Anything else
Yes
'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore
Okay
Hey, what  did for you is working out
(a breath; then) What you did changed my life
She offers him the note
No
no thank you notes
Well, part of what  said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has
And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person 've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever
Lovely
also wrote one part
wrote 'm sorry
was talking about was sorry when  got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so  wrote that
(reading from the letter, Melvin wildly uncomfortable) was sorry for busting you on that
and 'm sorry for busting in on you that night
when said  was never
was sorry and 'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler
Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- emotionally moved by her own words
and 'm sorry for never spotting, right there at the table in the restaurant, the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us
You know what, 'm just going to start from the beginning
have not been able to express my gratefulness to you
even as  look at the word "grateful" now it doesn't begin to tell you what  feel for you
And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses
Nice of you
thank you
Thank you
Now  want you to do something for me
She looks at him for a very strange, long beat
Oh, 'm sorry
Didn't  say, "what
"  thought  said, "what
"
What
want you to go on this trip
No, sir
can't do this alone
'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me
need you to chaperon
Separate everything but cars
You said you liked convertibles
Now 'm on the hook
The stiff one eye
Two days
can't
work
You take off when you have to
My son
Bettes tells me he's doing fine
(no other way) Melvin, 'd rather not
What's that got to do with it
Funny,  thought it was a strong point
Write me a note and ain't she sweet
need a hand and where'd she go
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me
Is there another way to see it
No
'  - '  - Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf of the closet
Well, here's a little suitcase shocked that it's been used
She holds up a dress -- a pretty one
then decides it's too pretty and puts it back
Now she looks in another drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries of the ages
She hesitates then talks to herself
-- Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday "girl Jockies
" She fingers the good stuff -- puts it back -- then the everyday -- hesitates
(furiously exasperated) There's not way to pack for this trip
well, 'll tell you -- 'm not packing the camera
As she exits the room -- '  -  - As she picks up the phone
'  -  - Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a camera)
He has a list of what he needs
All items -- underwear, socks, etc
with four checks next to each one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds another check
The
This is an amazing development
He has almost no recent experience with receiving a nighttime phone call
He makes a little comment to himself as he moves
Woo-woo
He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is -- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his throat
As she hears his throat being cleared
It is not a pretty sound
(The following conversation is
) Hello
Are you still coming
Yes
Melvin visibly relaxes
Melvin
'd like to know exactly where we are going
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland
So  know what you're going to ask next
(correcting himself) That you might ask -- 'm not certain
There's
there's no need to bring anything dressy
or mean --  didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes
Oh
(a beat) We might
Yes
We can
Let's
Okay, gotcha
What did you think was going to ask
Whether crabs are in season there now
Oh
Okay, then -- Melvin
Good night
'  - '  - Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters
How was it talking to him
Stop treating this like 'm going away with a man
He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me
hate this, Mom --  hate this
He's a freak show -- the worst person  ever met
Well, maybe he has nice friends
'   - Beverly and Spencer wait with her
The bus approaches
She kisses them
(to Spencer) You stand there and 'll wave to you from the back window
As she boards the bus
Call me as soon as you're settled
(to Spencer) love you
The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them open
(to bus driver) Sensitive, huh
The bus pulls out
He runs after the bus -- waving at his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing himself
'   - female  in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as Melvin finishes filling out some forms
On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners
Anything unusual in the dog's diet
No
Everybody gets their own cage
Certainly
(pointing to Chihuahua) Put him in with that one, not that one
(pointing to large dog) Builds his confidence
( ) - Carol disembarks
( ) - As she walks and turns a corner
The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death chamber
But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do not buckle
She does not whimper
No prison "screws" will have to support her weight
Still, the prospect couldn't be grimmer
' Melvin next to a spiffy convertible
Top down
Trunk open
He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the building
'm sorry that 'm not taking you
(upset) So am , Frank
Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him
They embrace
Soak it up -- it's your last chance at a hug for a few days
As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor changes
that quickly there is a shyness
Hi
Thanks for being on time
Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag
Hello
Oh, my God, who did that to you
, uh
was
attacked
Walked in on people robbing me was hospitalized
almost died
Let's do the small talk in the car
Load up
Carol puts her bag in the car
was going to do that for you
(taken aback) It's okay
No problem
Where should we sit
(totally non-plussed) -- uh,
Well, there is no place cards or anything
(to Simon) Let me go in back
You look like you need all the room you can manage
That's very thoughtful
Never a break
Never
Carol steps into the back
Melvin disappointed that he's not sitting next to Carol
Carol is wedged in the small back seat
She struggles to get her feet in
You're really jammed back there
He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel
She is startled by the gesture
Thanks, Melvin
Welcome
And off they go
Simon and Carol stunned by the manners
12TH Turning onto Fifth
got the whole ride programmed
as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all carefully labelled
He selects and begins to play the one marked "
" It is a song which we clearly and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick burst of "
" Melvin  the  and chuckles
Just wanted to see what you'd do
No, we have greatness here
He goes for another  labelled " " The car turns onto Seventh as we hear (
) Hey,  like this music
And, as the  , Simon looks out
- The three of them
Carol chattering away
don't know the last time 've been out of the city
Hey, my arms are tanning
used to tan great
We gotta stop soon so'se can check on Spencer
(during the above) 'm sorry
can't hear you can't turn my head all the way yet
tell her we can't hear her
Doesn't matter
She's enjoying herself
Consider it part of the music
- short time later
Carol is now driving
'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way
But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight
Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance
Nonsense
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands
Simon does not raise his hand
Simon and Carol have thus declared their majority
Do you want to know what happened with my parents
Yes
really would
Well
No, let me pull over so  can pay full attention
Car pulling over toward parking spot
-  -  - She takes the car curbside and parks
Now go ahead
Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol
He looks innocent
Several beats -- Melvin almost says something -- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him
Finally
Well,  always painted
Always
And my mother always encouraged it
She was sort of fabulous about it actually
and she used to
was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it
and she was very natural
She used to pose nude for me
and  thought or assumed my father was aware of it
This stuff is pointless
Hey -- you let him
You like sad stories -- you want mine
Go ahead, Simon
Really
Please
Don't let him stop you
Ignore him
Okay
Well, one day my father came in on one of those painting sessions when  was nine -- and he just started screaming at her -- at us -- at evil
And
(very quickly) my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if  made a mistake on the piano
Go ahead, Simon
Your father walked in on you and was yelling and
really, come on
was trying to defend my mother and make peace, in the lamest way
said, "she's not naked -- it's art
" And then he started hitting me
And he beat me unconscious
After that he talked to me less and less -- he knew before  left for college, my dad came into my room
He held out his hand
It was filled with money
big wad of sweaty money
(gathers himself) And he said to me, " don't want you to ever come back
"  grabbed him and  hugged him
He turns and walked out
Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles
She looks out her window -- then kisses her fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek
nice, understated, gesture of friendship
Well, you know --  still stay what  said
You've got to get past it all when it comes to your parents
We all have these horror stories to get over
Melvin shifts  the
That's not true
Some of us have great stories
pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad
Just not anybody in this car
But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad
and that's what makes it hard
Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good
No
Not it at all, really
(a veteran's irony) Not at all, huh
Let's go to the hotel
And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money
-  /'  - Two bedrooms and the sofa opens
Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up
(to Simon) No answer
Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow
Can  have that one
Yes
sure
(to Simon) 'll take the sofa
Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever have slept in
She goes to the phone and dials
(into phone) Hello
Hi, Spencer
Why are you out of breath
You did
That is great
So great
So -- no, wait a second, Spence
-   '   - Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially neat suitcase
Melvin is uncomfortable
Can  ask you a personal question
Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared
Do you ever get an erection for a woman
Melvin
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not
You consider your life easy
give you that one
(eyes suitcase) Nice packing
-   - Carol enters the common living room
Melvin is sitting there
Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new factors in her life
My son was outside playing soccer
never saw him playing ball
Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time
Take me out dancing
Dancing
can't, 'm exhausted
Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him
Melvin is visibly disturbed by her gesture
(to Simon) don't blame you
This is a monumental first day out
You sad or anything
No
Nervous
It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along
What a nice compliment
She gives Simon a kiss
Melvin deals with jealousy
She turns to him
'm happy
And you're my date
Let's get dressed
She exits the room
Melvin unnerved
'm going to jump in the shower
'll be right with you
- As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main room of the suite and hears the  running -- she sits down to wait -- through
Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom through a cloud of steam
They exit
- As they drive up
Good evening, sir
They sell hard shell crabs here
Yes
- As they enters
Good evening
Hi
You have hard shells, right
Stop asking everyone
Just him and that's it
Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out
Yes, we do
And  can give you a tie and jacket
What
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available
He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them
No
'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask 'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either
You promised a nice place -- can't you just
(to Head Waiter) You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you
Actually,  don't think so
(to Carol) Wait here
- As Melvin takes his car back from the valet
-   - As the car goes right across the street to a shopping mall
- '  - Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly
Good evening
need a coat and tie
that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for Melvin is impossible
Come on in
No
No
(pointing) That jacket and give me a tie
- As he pulls up - a new  taking his car
#2 Good evening
You have hard shells
#2 'm not sure
Everyone else says you do
#2 Then  guess we do
As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol
She is having a martini at the bar
Sitting on a stool -- watching  dance
Happy by herself
Turning down a  who wants to buy her another
And Melvin watches
Watches his date
Shall  get her for you
No, it's all right
'll just watch
He enjoys watching her for a few more beats
She turns -- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture
and she smiles and walks toward him
has lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her
She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, giddy as the   and couples dance in the b
g
She notices the waiter in her trail
(mouthing the words to Melvin) My drink is following me
Melvin watches her approach
It is all too exquisite
He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily
You look s
She stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then
You look great
They arrives at the table
He holds out her chair for her
You wanna dance
've been thinking about that since you brought it up before
(rising) And
No
(and before she can digest that) don't get this place
They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress
don't get it
Melvin has no idea he has insulted her
Sandbagged in extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave
No
Wait
What
Why
didn't mean it
You gotta sit down
You can still give me the dirty look
just sit down and give it to me
Melvin, pay me a compliment need one and quick
You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings
(really pissed, mutters) That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away
Never fails
That's not compliment, Melvin
That's just trying to sound smart so  feel stupid
compliment is something nice about somebody else
Now or never
Okay
He waves her down
(sitting) And mean it
Can we order first
She thinks and then nods
The waiter is across the room
This does not stop Melvin
(calling) Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer
(to Carol) Baked or fries
Fries
(calling) One baked -- one fries
(shouting back) 'll tell your waiter
(to Carol) Okay,  got a real great compliment for you and it's true
am so afraid you're about to say something awful
Don't be pessimistic
It's not your style
Okay
Here goes
Clearly a mistake
(this is hell for him) have this -- what
Ailment
And my doctor -- a shrink
who used to see all the time
he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help
hate pills
Very dangerous things, pills
"Hate,"  am using the word "hate" about pills
My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know
The next morning  started taking these pills
(a little confused) don't quite get how that's a compliment for me
Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- then: You make me want to be a better man
Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard
She stumbles a bit -- flattered, momentarily moved and his for the taking
That's maybe the best compliment of my life
Then 've really overshot here 'cause  was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out
Carol laughs
So how are you doing with those pills
Well,  hopahopahopa
Takes months to know
They work little by little
(holds his head; then) Talking like this is exhausting
Carol moves to the chair next to him
She sits very close -- he tenses
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid
Never
Here's the trouble with never
for the kiss
Their faces are close -- she looks at him
She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him -- he is wide-eyed and afraid
His face almost moves away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight
But now his head moves back and he receives her kiss
It is brief
Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself
Melvin can't bear the pleasure
You don't owe me that
That wasn't payment
When you first came into breakfast, when saw you --  thought you were handsome
Then, of course, you spoke
So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed
Tell me, why did you bring me
Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable
as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal
Well, ah
that's a personal question
Tell me even if you're scared
Tell me why you wanted me here
It's okay
She kisses him again
If you ask me
'll say, "yes
" (dissembling) There are lots of reason
had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might
(humiliated) Sex with Simon
It's one idea
That's why you brought me
Look at me
Is that really why you brought me
Like 'm a what and owe you what
don't know why  brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all
It came out first
Hey, you kiss him -- me
He says he loves you
You two hit it off
But you don't want to
fine
Forget what  said about sex with Simon
It was a mistake
(wiping away tears) 'll never forget you said it
It was a mistake
But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant
Melvin alone and miserable
'   - He finishes dialing
He is extremely tense -- not breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let the anxiety immobilize him
the   twice, then a humorless male voice: ' (humorless male voice) Hi
This is Fred Bishop
(perky woman's voice) and Betty
(Fred again) We are sorry to be unable to take your call right now
Please leave a message and we'd appreciate your including the time/date and purpose of your call
(Simon mouths the word "date," then Betty speaks before the beep Bye-bye
Ah, this is Simon
'm here in town
(he waits) and, folks, you haven't come home later than 10 in your lives
Please pick up -- really
Okay
'm going to call again in the morning
need to see you
Or, at least get you to answer the phone
He hangs up
His parents want no part of him and he needs help
- '  - As Carol enters with some energy
We  her as she goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing things in
- '  - Hello
Hello
Carol thrusts open the door and enters
Was this supposed to be your room
Our room
don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door
Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so
Can you not be violent
don't think so
You need help with the pants
(emphatically) No
'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal
Uh-huh
'm sorry
are you okay
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow  have to face my parents
Don't ask me 'm sick of my own complaints got to get me a new set of thoughts
Why
What have you been thinking about
How to die, mostly
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate
Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath
(turning off the light) Good night
Good night
We are  Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have
' Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair -- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast exposed
(a whisper) Hold it
He leaves the bed
What's he up to
he takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol
've got to sketch you
No
Absolutely not
'm shyer than you think
give the wrong impression sometimes and
haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks
Stop staring
Do a vase
But you're beautiful
your skin glows
Thanks
But  just want to take a bath and
That long neck -- the line of you
you're porcelain
your back goes on forever
You're classic
you're why cavemen chiseled on walls
All right, cut me a break
Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly but deliberately she lowers the towel
He's right
She's breathtaking
- Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink
He's been talking to the bartender
So then, the next thing  know, she's sitting right next to me, and then, well, it's not right to go into the details, but  screwed up
got nervous
said the wrong thing and if  hadn't, could be in bed now with a woman who if you could make her smile you got a life
Instead, 'm here with you, no offense, a moron pushing the last legal drug
He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his heart breaking
- '  -    - He's excited -- smiling
We hear Carol -- also revved
(
) don't care how you put it -- We're being naughty here, pal
Carol holding a pose for Simon
He is holding a ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter
His style cramped by his cast
No
No
This is great, this is so great
can't get the angle with this cast
He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle no more
Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- a lion's roar of liberation
He is back at his center
-   - Melvin is having a room service breakfast
The door opens
Simon enters
new Simon -- better than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow
Did you have sex with her
Carol follows his out
Her arms are filled with the hotel soaps, shampoos, etc
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there
(a beat) Did you have sex with her
To hell with sex
Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze
We held each other
It was better than sex
What  need he gave me great
just love her
(beat) How're you doing
Melvin reacts
- Simon finishes dialing the phone
a brief wait, then: Hello, hi, Mom --  can barely hear you
Do you have to whisper
No -- don't apologize -- it was the luckiest thing for all of us that you didn't answer last night
can't hear you
okay, dear, just listen to me then
Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in her suitcase
get why you're angry
It's no snap to explain why  was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run
so Mom
Truly no grudges -- truly
little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard  was hurt, but the important thing  want you to know is your son is happy
'm working again
'll make do --  don't want a thing
Wouldn't take it if it was offered
'll drop you a note from wherever  land and then it's up to you
hope we patch things up but know that if we don't,  wish you both the very best
can't hear you
You heard me, though, right
Good -- take good care
'Bye
He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over to Carol and Melvin
Now he's going to want to stay
And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever
So it's a good five hours back
It gives us a chance to take it easy and
'm going back with you
But what about
'll take care of myself -- What are you talking about
You got real problems
know
'm a little bit nervous
Suddenly everything seems so easy
Carol, a load has been lifted
One night with me
You think you're kidding
Melvin stalks out
- The car parked near a phone booth -- (to Frank over the phone) Aww Jesus
No choice
Carol walks up to Simon in the car
got a gift for you
She hands him a base ball cap
(on phone) Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home
(to Simon) Let me see
Ahh, gorgeous
Do it then
Get the dog picked up
can't believe you let it stay there
Melvin hangs up the phone
Good-bye
(to Simon) Well, your luck is holding
They sublet your place
You're homeless
Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now
Another place where
Does it matter
Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a special  labelled "For Emergency Use Only
" As it a confessional love : don't want to hear that music right now
What do you mean
You said you liked it
don't
This one has a special meaning
It's your car but  don't want to hear it
If that means anything
Melvin hesitates and then turns  the  in mid- proclamation of love
( ) - As the car arrives
They get out
Here are the keys to my apartment
'm going to park you in my place while  take Carol home
(hefting bag) 'll take a bus
'll take you
why not
don't care what you did for me
don't think  want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself
(turning to Simon) You have my number
(hugging her) love you
(sotto) Let him take you home
Don't want to
love you
She shakes her head and walks off
Simon looking at Melvin with some sympathy
Don't say anything
'   - Where Verdell's ears prick
- As they enter
(
) told you to go on in
(
) Look, 've got to get a hold of Frank and see where 'm hanging my hat 'cause
The door opens, revealing them: think you gotta camp it here
What are you talking about
The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him
(to Verdell) know the feeling -- you feel like your ol' self again, huh
-- Mommy and Daddy are home
Melvin reacts
Sorry
You're fun to mess with
Melvin gets up
Simon notices some of his paintings
They took your place furnished
Jackie said she grabbed your personal stuff -- they were supposed to set you up here
(leading the way) There's this extra room -- never use
It gets good light
No other answer really
Simon follows
'   - As they enter
the room clean and organized -- a small but lovely garret
Thank you, Melvin
You overwhelm me
They did a nice job
Cozy, huh
love you
Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall
'll tell you, buddy, 'd be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me
'  - As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and Spencer
But clearly something gnaws at her psyche
'  -  - Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart
each around 1:55 a
m
He sits in a chair still fully dressed
forlorn
Verdell in his lap
beat then we hear Simon's whispered voice
(
) Where is my big hairy boy
Melvin is alarmed
He stops breathing as his gay houseguest approaches
(
) Verdell, sweeties
Melvin breathes again
Simon enters the room
Sorry, didn't know you were awake
just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then
Look, we both want the dog -- and
The
they look at each other
Melvin doesn't move
Should  get it
Melvin nods
Simon walks into the next room
several beats as he finds the phone
We hear him pick it up and: (
) Hello
(into phone) Hello
It's me
He took me in
Did you know
Hold on, 'll get him for you
He walks back to Melvin's room
'  - As he enters
It's Carol
Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one mitt
he thrusts it at Simon
Here
Take the dog
As he speeds him out
Good luck
'  -   - As Melvin picks up the phone
He clears his throat loudly
Following is  between Carol and Melvin -- the first such  showing Carol blasted by the throat clearing
Hello
Yeah
Well
(very concerned) How you doing
can trust my brain
That seems like a good choice
don't know whether 'm being sensible or hard on you
The two might go together
See
There's an example
don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now
(what the hell) Cute
You don't have to answer everything  say
Just listen to me
Okay
He nods his head, "yes
" It's really something that you're looking after Simon
And what said on the street
That was a bad thing to say
And it made me sick to my stomach
It was a bad thing to say
And 'd be lying if didn't say that  enjoyed your company
but the truth is you do bother me enormously and  know -- think -- that it's best for me to not have contact with you because you're just not ready and you're a pretty old guy to not be ready
and 'm too old to ignore that
But there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place
So thanks for the trips
She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than ever
It's hard to know whether to die or not
Okay to say something now
Go ahead
should've danced with you
Okay
Good-bye
So long
Carol hangs up
She feels strange
shoe hasn't dropped
Oh, hell
she missed him
'  -   - Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room
He is impatient
You going to come talk to me or not
'm coming
We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be allowed closer to Melvin
Simon releases him
What did she say
'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"
(before Simon can celebrate) and she doesn't want contact with me
(a beat) 'm dying here
Because
(gently) you love her
(sharply) No
and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp
Okay
you tell me why -- (mimics him) "You're dying here
" don't know
Let me sleep on it and figure it out
(then) Because 'm stuck
Can't go back to what  had
She's evicted me from my life
Did you like it that much
(furiously) It was better than this
Look, you, 'm very intelligent
If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing
If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up
'm drowning and you're describing water
(getting pissed) Picking on me won't help
Well, if that's true then 'm really in trouble
But you know where you're lucky
Absolutely not
You know who you want
'll take your seat any day
So do something
don't sleep on it
go over there
don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down
Hey
'm charged here
But she might kill me for showing up this late
Then get in your jammies and 'll read you a story
think you've got a chance
The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard
Okay
Thanks a lot
Here  go
He moves for the door
stops suddenly, jolted
What's wrong
forgot to lock the door
'   (' ) - As he parks
He exits the car -- now wary
looks at his watch
hesitates
walks reluctantly into the apartment house
'   -  - As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great uncertainty
'  - Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe
sitting directly in front of a fan
the windows open, reading one of Melvin's books
There is the briefest possible sound of a
someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly -- so briefly that she's not certain it's her  -- until the same brief sound
She walks to her wide open window and looks over
The convertible at the curb
She hesitates -- '   -  - As Melvin gives up and starts out
turning as the sudden blast of being  into Carol's life sounds
He bolts for the door and enters
'  - She opens the door
she hears the sound of up the stairs
He reaches her side
What do you want, Melvin
Were you asleep
What do you want
'Cause if you were asleep -- 'm sorry
And you could be grouchy
Grouchy
'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible
So then  wouldn't even try
What job
Were you asleep
What are you doing here
Beverly in the hallway looking on -- 'm sorry  woke you -- some other time
He half turns to leave
wasn't asleep
What a break
(losing it a bit) Is it a secret what you're doing here
had to see you
Because
It relaxes me
'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else can think of or imagine
Carol has not ever heard anything like that before
it's sort of sexy in its sincerity
As we see in the b
g
that Beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part
Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone
(serious) Wait a minute, 'm overstating here, maybe the inside stairs don't want to sit with my feet in the gutter
What does that serve
It only
But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens
Stop it
Why can't  have a normal boyfriend
Why
Get out of here
Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me
(butting in) Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit
(as Carol turns to her) Sorry
didn't mean to interrupt
She disappears into her room
Carol snorts a laugh -- gathers herself
beat
(hopefully) Boyfriend
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks
She looks at him -- then: Maybe we could
Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen linoleum and stalls at the door
It feels a little confined here
Let's take a walk
See
It's four in the morning walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner
There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls
Okay
-   - They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual attention to where he steps
' Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement -- it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping on the lines
Carol sighs
It is the sound of possibilities crashing down
Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious -- his habits making him appear unworthy
(gently; almost lovingly) 'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever this is -- is not going to work
He takes this hard
It forces him to half-whisper something he hasn't at all said to himself
given his history
this is an extraordinary intimacy
'm feeling
've been feeling better
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well
(as he scoffs) 'm not the answer for you
She starts to turn
He tugs at her arm
As she turns back to him
Hey, 've got a great compliment for you
You know what
Just let me talk
(gathers himself with uncertainty, then:) 'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth
'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have
in how you are with Spencer -- Spence
(he has reached her) in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good
She stands on the precipice of being transported away from the logic which has been her lifeline
think most people miss that about you and  watch wondering how they can watch you bring them food and clear their dishes and never get that they have just met the greatest woman alive
And the fact that  get it makes me feel great
about me
(a real question filled with concern for her) You got a real good reason to walk out on that
That last question clearly a true question, not the least rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then: No
It's certainly not
No -- don't think so
No
(tentatively) 'm gonna grab you
(with conviction) didn't mean it to be a question
'm gonna grab you
He kisses her
An awkward bomb of a kiss
They separate
tense beat
Then: know  can do better
They embrace again
He does indeed do much better first-class smooch
to see his foot land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his knowledge
They break -- look at each other without a notion of where to take it from here, and the  in unison begin to walk away  , Melvin following a path that avoids cracks
Suddenly the lights of the bakery turn on as it opens for business
Warm rolls
They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks
As they enter the bakery, a  moves toward them to clean the entranceway
