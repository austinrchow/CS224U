They are all twenty-two, or barely twenty-two
Only four months out of college, they are in their freshman year of life
Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze
Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two
Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks
They were in a car accident
zip open again, introducing    (), another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her a certain sexual sophistication
She is accompanied by her dark, interesting  as she joins her friends and the Cops
They're dead, aren't they
Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops
Officers, 'm Alec Newberry with Congressman Langston's office
Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk
think they're okay
Thank God
() Are you aware there's a three- hundred-pound man walking around naked

1 : 1 , a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges from a first-aid room with a bandaged forehead
Wendy
Oh, my God
Are you all right
'm fine
It's the car my father gave me for graduation that's totalled
( ) Find Billy
See if you can sober him up
Kevin always does what Alec tells him to
Meanwhile, Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse
How much do  owe you
He almost killed you
Destroyed your car, and you're paying
Jules, please
As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date who hovers in the distance
Is that your date
The naked man wanders past them
No, that's my date
As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as the Cops approach her
# 1 You pressing charges
No

Hicks' legal counsel and he's not required to take any tests

He's in the van giving blood right now
The Cops start toward the electric doors as Kirbo and Alec follow
Leslie helps Wendy with the bill Jules whispering dramatically to her Date
'll have to be with her all night
They don't know if she's going to make it
She looks fine
Shock
She could black out at any second
'll call you
Jules joins Leslie and Wendy
He's cute
Too young
and don't you both start on your father complex theory

We're dealing with a first offender here, and since Ms
Beamish doesn't want to press charges, whaddya say we just let this one slide, Officers
They reach the back of the mobile van, where we see , a handsome daredevil, playing his saxophone, wearing handcuffs, for two good-looking nurses and Kevin, who is trying to give him black coffee
$1 Okay, you're under arrest
Alec looks to Kevin for information about Billy's condition
() 2 : 2 wouldn't strike a match near his blood
( ) Hey, watch my sax
( ) You girls believe in premarital sax
They laugh as Alec barks at him
Billy -- four months after graduation and you're still acting like every night's a fraternity party
Aren't you even concerned about Wendy
( ) Wendy
Jesus, how bad is it
Severe
She might have finally exceeded the limit on her father's Visa
Billy smiles with relief as the Cops lead him toward their car
Will you both get serious
He's being arrested for drunk driving
Drunk maybe
But  don't know if you could call that driving
Wendy, Leslie and Jules come from the hospital, just in time to see Billy being put into the cop car
Wendy rushes to Billy and they embrace
Sorry, babe
sorry
We'll be right behind you
They all move toward Alec's car except Kirbo, who sud- denly notices'someone
He becomes mesmerized as he falls away from the group and starts back for the hospital

Clarke-like bar/restaurant
Kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables
Alec gets rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables pushed together
He admonishes , the burly owner
Wally
You let undergrad punks at our tables
Relax, Alec
they've only been there ten minutes
Yeah, well, we've been here for four years
Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo drops off a large pitcher of beer
Hey,  need a real drink
Kirbo is long gone
Kevin pours
Waiters are like cops
Never around when you need one
Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a table into their beers -- obviously some ritual
Will somebody get me a screwdriver
And a hammer
You know what it means to have a suspended license for drunk driving on your record
() '  - Rev
10/1/84 : (A2) Yeah, Al
It means  won't ever be able to be a cop in
Hey, Wend, you're not angry are you
No, 'm not angry
Never trust a woman who says she isn't angry

8 : (2) 8 You better call your wife, Billy
Billy reluctantly leaves as Jules laces into Kevin
You're the one who's so angry these days
thought writing for the Washington Post would make you happy
Writing obituaries is not writing, Jules
All my characters die in the and
'd like to write something about the meaning of life for a change
You'll get your chance, Kevin
Alec suddenly spots  , an older version of Alec, across the room
Hey, Tommy
( ) Tommy Bancroft, Senator Hodges' key guy
Come on,  want you to meet him
They leave the table as Jules turns to Kevin
The meaning of life, Kevin, is fun, good times and a little ----
Don't you enjoy anything anymore
Like girls
enjoy being afraid of Russia
It's a harmless fear
Makes America feel better and Russia gets an inflated sense of national worth from our paranoia
Excuse me,  have to call in my latest epitaphs to the death squad
The presses are waiting
He gets up and leaves the table, passing Kirbo
Did you see her at the hospital

He notices a woman's reflection in the glass
He turns to see she is flirting with him from the bar
He smiles back
Kevin arrives and Billy sees a perfect way to get off the phone
Here's Kevin, he wants to say hello
He hands the phone to a more than reluctant Kevin and moves toward the   at the bar
Hey, Wally
a double screwdriver
He joins the Young Woman who is eyeing his sax
So, you believe in premarital sax

You didn't give him any money, did you

That doesn't leave much left
better break this to Alec gently before he finds out the wrong way and destroys his political career by murdering Billy in front of fifty witnesses
She leaves as Jules looks to Wendy
Wendy, this is all too destructive
Life in the-fat lane
You're not fat
My thighs are fat
And no diet works
The only way to lose weight on your thighs is amputation
You have to amputate Billy the Kid
know, but  can't
don't get it

Why didn't you tell me you blew another job
For some insane reason  thought you'd take it badly
Kevin and Kirbo rush in
Don't drown him, he's a father
Alec releases Billy who comes up with his hair wet and gives Alec a major shove
That's right, you are a father and when are you gonna grow up

No pay at first, but a way toward big dough

-    16 Jules sits drinking vodka as Leslie listens
So this crummy welfare hospital called and remember  told you about my father's second wife
My 'stepmonster
' The one who used to lock you in the closet all the time
She gambled away all the money she got out of my father, is on her deathbed and she put me down as next of kin
But what about your father
Unreachable somewhere in South Africa with his new wife, who it turns out is only three years older than me
And if  don't reach him, guess who's going to end up paying for that old witch's funeral
Is there some insane irony to this or what
'm sure your father will take care of everything
Sure, just like he takes care of everything else, including not showing up for my graduation
In the background, Alec has brought in their mattress and some sheets and a pillow
() 16
16 : 16 Thanks, Alec
You're still my Indiana Jones
Always coming to my rescue

Kirbo enters carrying his bike, and Kevin immediately hides the photographs in a straw basket and becomes his sophisticated self
Quick, what's the meaning of life

Kevin looks puzzled as Kirbo hangs up his bike
The girl  fell in love with when we were freshmen
Remember,  met her at that big fountain on main campus
The one that says 'Knowledge, Art, Religion, Life'
she was sitting on the 'Life' side and she smiled at me
You took her to one movie
That's not love, it's infatuation
Kirbo searches madly through records strewn on the floor

He yanks    abruptly
Getting married
becoming a father
Killing his roommate for removing Janis Joplin for the soundtrack from Manhattan
And having the right girl smile at you
She has the whitest teeth 've ever seen

Kevin begins gathering up his endless pieces of paper, notes, etc
If you think 'm going to live through another year of finding poorly written, unmailed love scratchings around this apartment
found her again
It's fate
It's true love
have her hospital schedule
Love is just an illusion created by lawyer-types like yourself to perpetuate another illusion called marriage to create the reality of divorce and the illusory need for divorce lawyers
Did you know there are more people in law school right now than there are lawyers on the planet
You're just bitter, 'cause you haven't had sex for a long time

You think marriage is going to make you faithful

Failure is a virtue in today's society
Human error is a badge of honor

with a coffin
We now see that a long coffee table which has always been covered with junk is indeed a black coffin
That's not how you're supposed to ask
You're supposed to be a young lady who is very impressed with
my mind
Having come from a deep Hungarian film and getting cozy over a brandy, she says
'Is that
a coffin
' And, then  say, 'Yes, it's my coffin' 'Your coffin,' she would gasp, her interest in me growing by leaps and bounds
Then' would sit back stroking her arm and say 'Yes, figured we're going to spend a long time in the ground together so 've made friends with it
've gotten drunk on it
rolled joints on it Even made love on it many times

Except you're the first woman 've ever been able to get up here

Kevin searches for clean glasses in the debris that passes for a kitchen, Leslie finds photos and political cartoons in his straw box

Kevin has an entire homage to her in his secret stash
