have not spoken since  was six years old
No one knows why, not even me
My father says it is a dark talent and the day  take it into my head to stop breathing will be my last
Today he married me to a man 've not yet met
Soon my daughter and  shall join him in his own country
My husband said my muteness does not bother him
He writes and hark this: God loves dumb creatures, so why not he
Were good he had God's patience for silence affects everyone in the end
The strange thing is don't think myself silent, that is, because of my piano shall miss it on the journey
Sc 2                  Sc 2 woman in a dark crepe Victorian dress sits leaning against a tree, her hands cover her face, around her neck she wears a writing pad
She crosses a field with large bare trees, in the far background stands a 3 storey stone house
Sc 3                      Sc 3 small girl roller skates down a dimly lit corridor
parlour maid looks down the hall where the girl has disappeared
Sc 4                  Sc 4 Three men wearing long grey aprons are fitting the packing for a piano
On one of the men's arms is a tattoo of a whale in a wild sea
Sc 5                      Sc 5 The girl wearing her skates sits on a small black pony
An old man is pulling it, but it won't move
(In the background, another aspect of the grey stone house
) Sc 6            '  NIGHTSc 6 The woman lifts back the sheets from the bottom of the sleeping girl's bed
She is still wearing her skates
The woman cuts through the laces and removes the boots
One disembodied skate rolls across the room
Sc 7                  Sc 7 The woman stands at a window lit by moonlight
Her skin appears luminescently white
She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, the objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands unconsciously performing a farewell
Turning from the window she moves to a square piano crowded by packing boxes
In the dim light she begins to play strongly
Her face strains, she is utterly involved, unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie accompaniment to the music
An old maid in night-dress looks in
Abruptly the woman stops playing
The emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall
Sc 8                          Sc 8 Under water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the surface
Sc 9                                   Sc 9 Amidst a riotous sea a woman, , is carried to shore on the shoulders of five seamen
Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her pad and pen
We should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial offering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited black sand backs on to an endless rise of dense native bush
The breakers are chaotic, the men strain to keep their footing, calling to each other
Hold still you smutt
Blast the boat
Look up
Look up
Lay to
Lay to
Up with it you buggerers, hold hard
Damn me won't you hold
Etc
Two of the men are black, all are battered, tattooed and tough, some are drunk
Behind the woman is her daughter, a girl of ten in Scottish dress
She too is carried on the shoulders of seamen
is placed on the sand
She looks down at her feet sinking into the wet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of her
The sound of sea behind is thunderous
Several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand
Her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick
But 's attention is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a huge piano shaped box
They put it down as soon as they get to 5hore but  makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher safer ground
The piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it, one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free hand
Sc 10                                        Sc 10 finish carrying the last crate to shore
Trunks and boxes including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the shore
The  gather together
After a discussion in which they look between  and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the men approaches
Behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or down on the sand
They don't want to be involved
The sight of the women alone on this beach is too hopeless
It's a little rough out there
Could be they can't get through to you in this weather
Maybe they'll come over land
nods
Have you things for shelter
nods
What things have you
signs to her daughter
The little girl speaks clearly and loudly without emotion
She says, "thank you"
Puzzled, the man walks off, then turns and comes back
Does your mother prefer to come on with us to Nelson
signs vigorously to
She says, No
She says she'd rather be boiled alive by natives than get back in your tub
(stunned) You be damn fortuned don't smack your puppy gob, missy
Damn lucky
11 Sc 12                                        Sc 12 is sheltering behind the crated piano, anxiety etched on her face
is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand  has found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play a few notes
The sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to exaggerate their isolation and hopelessness
2- See notes Suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of the piano wetting her shoes
stands, pushing  onto her feet
She is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed
They watch three of their boxes float out to sea
One of the hens has escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves

and  shelter inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges with stones
Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation
is hand signaling a story to  who lies back watching, nervous and afraid
's whole self is involved in the "telling", her face is alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, while her hands and fingers are deft and precise
From outside it is an odd shadow play
(hand signaling) Mother
'm thinking pauses
(speaking) 'm not going to call him Papa
'm not going to call  anything
'm not even going to look at
Sc 15                             Sc 15 Through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen  people and two The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea
Two of the share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a mixture of native and European costume
Of the Europeans one is small and has a shy manner
He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his cheeks
The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy and out of place here in the bush
He staggers, spurts forward then slows to a stop
His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the green foliage
the younger man turns and slows
Are we stopping
Do you want to stop
The  voices and laughter are becoming fainter
watches torn between his concern for  and the split in their party
3-See Notes Shall we stop
Unable to get an answer  runs after the
Tai hoa
Me tatari tatou
, me tutatou  konei
(Wait
We are stopping
we're stopping
) takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through his wet hair
Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us to see 's tumbling face
Taking it in the heel of his hand he secretly looks at it
Just as the party return and settle he stares on ahead possessed and determined
We must get on
The  look at  bewildered
Aue tepatupsiarehe
(The fairy people, what can you expect
) Sc 16                               MORNINGSc 16 It is early morning
The sea is calmer and the tide is again low
The party or two  and fourteen   and  come out on to the beach
About half the  party head straight for the shoreline where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection
All sorts of containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their arms
The rest follow  and  over to the boxes automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, where it sticks in a raked pattern
On his head he carefully places a formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit
The party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its occupants
Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart
You'll have to wake yourself
've got men here to carry your things
and  struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of men and women
The  stare curiously and comment on the women

) man points at 's feet and gestures as if holding one of the little shoes in his hand
Te monohi hoki

see you have a good many boxes, 'd like to know what is in each
As  does not move  is puzzled
-  -  -
nods and looks up coldly, insulted by his slow loud speaking
Well that is good, yes that is good, good
smiling searches 's face for some sign of comprehension but is unnerved by her lack of response
He stops smiling, and, patting his hair walks to the closest box
Several of the  party follow behind  while one of them closely and particularly mimics him
What's in here
points to the writing already on the box saying "Crockery and Pots"
Ohh, yes so it is, written there, crockery
And this one
writes "bedclothes and linen" on the pad around her neck- While she writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her
You're small
never thought you'd be small
He walks to another chest What's here
She writes "clothes"
The  mimic also pretends to write
Finally he comes to the piano box
He lifts a corner experimentally
What's in here then, lead
(gravely) It's my mother's piano

The  touch the exposed legs of the piano
speaks to the other European man
Tell them to carry in pairs
Those three and those two the black and the red, then the suitcases
holds  back a moment
What do you think
nods towards
thinks a moment then turns towards too
She looks tired
She's stunted, that's one thing
walks over to  a big man and the  leader, he stands tall with a great sense of his own importance
(Mana) Anei nga pouaka - ko era e toro
Me era e raa
(Here are the boxes, those three and those two
) Hoal takes an aggressive fighting posture towards , insulted that  should suggest he might carry anything
does not carrying, he is the boss
With great dignity  retreats, too injured to help
Other  come up and  assigns them boxes
gets worried, the piano is being left alone
She writes on her pad, "
" She shows
Oh no, it can't come now
It must come
looks at She wants it to come
Yes and so do , but there are too few of us here to carry it
- writes "
" Her  mimic copies her
Do you mean you don't want your kitchenware or your clothes
Is that what you mean
signs to
We can't leave the piano Let us not discuss this further
am very pleased
slows down as he watches  again sign to , he has the uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted
Mother wants to know if they could come back directly for it
is shocked, his mouth hangs slightly open, paused in mid speech
mimics this mouth drop perfectly
After they have taken the other things
is growing confused and anxious
His two mimics and their growing audience unnerve him further
Kei Riri a te raho Maroke
(shouted loudly at ) (Watch it dry balls is getting touchy
) nods suspiciously towards the  speaker not understanding him, the speaker smiles and nods back
suggest you prepare for a difficult journey
The bush will tear clothes and the mud is deep in places
walks away
stands beside the piano turned away from the activities
pats her hand trying to cheer her
Down on the beach a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking
Some of the young men are racing naked into the sea
(to  about the ) What are they doing
We don't have time for that
Sc 17                                        Sc 17 It is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make their way up into the bush

comes back along the beach, trailed by a young Maori boy,
Mr
Stewart asked if  might show you to the path
( does not move)
May  carry something
turns to , her face angry and defiant, her eyes full of tears
falls back, struck by her show of emotion
and walk past him toward the bush
Sc 18                                Sc 18 The party threads its way through the bush along the cliff
pauses at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand, tiny and desolate
Its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her
Its music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene
Sc 19                                Sc 19 Brown feet squelch through the mud, finally followed by dainty boots caked in dirt
The  leaders of the party have stopped

) hinga te Koroua ra  Pitama i konci
Kare noa Kia hikina te tapu
(Old man Pitama died here

What's he say
Someone died here
It's tapu
But we came down this way didn't we
'm sure we did
The  leaders continue discussing
0h Pitama eh
Tarna heke atu ki ram - tiro his atu
Rapuhia mai he huarahi re
(Go and look, find another track eh
) 'cia tupato he ana taniwba ke raro na
(Go easy there's a ghost down there
) 'Ca, rongo koe i te haunga a tans tutae i te tuatahi
(You smell his shit first
) continues over the top of the  discussion
They want more money
They are trying to make two days out of it
No, no they know another track - to the side of this
and  sit watching, out of breath
The bush is dense, claustrophobic and exotic
One of the  women sits close to apparently not looking at her- Slowly she draws the scarf that is in 's lap into her own
Defiantly she puts it on
Meanwhile another woman makes a very dignified attempt to wipe the freckles from 's face
Sc 20          '                         Sc 20 It is another day and ' hut, bleakly set amidst smoking stumps is full of squeals, chasing and antics
Sc 21          '                     Sc 21 The reverend in frock coat has a wedding dress stuck part way up his arms
It is not a normal wedding dress but a backless one used again and again as a photographic prop
Stewart's   and her companion  are trying to pull it off
Watch your feet
Watch your feet
and  find the family fun frightening and have taken refuge in the bedroom
Careful
Watch his hand
Watch his hand The  tickles his sister as she tries to get the sleeve off his hand
squeals with excitement
Stop it
looks towards  panting with excitement at the fun
(shooing the Reverend out) We'll bring out the bride
The two women now fit the wedding dress on

sits on the bed sulkily
She leans back and crosses her leg
My  father was a famous German composer Ohh the tag is broken
(continues)
They met when my mother was an opera singer
in Luxemburg
The two women pause to look at
signs to  "' " Why
looks away, the two women finish primping the dress
crosses her arms
want to be in the photograph
Sc 22          ' Hut                     Sc 22 half holds an umbrella over  as they make their way to where the camera is setup in front of a chair and a sparse display of three toi-toi
All about the house is muddy, so much so that they must weave their way through on planks and logs
fine veil of rain is falling across the distant bush, the whole valley is shrouded in mist looks through the camera at the  and the photographer who are posing as the couple, complete with tatty bouquet
notices 's arrival and seeing her as a real bride, his bride, he is struckdumb with pride, even the rough tapes at the back or the dress cannot destroy the illusion
Beautiful
The umbrellas are held away, the rain pours down
Sc 23     /                 Sc 23 has brought a chair into the bedroom and sits knee to knee with
thought she met your father in Luxemburg
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra
(frowning) And where did they get married
checks to see if someone is coming
(her Scottish accent becomes thick and expressive) In an enormous forest, with real fairies as bridesmaids each holding a little elf's hand
sits back, regarding  with obvious disapproval and disappointment
She smooths back her hair
No,  tell a lie, it was in a small country church, near the mountains is becoming involved again
She leans forward
Which mountains are those dear
The Alps
Ohhh 've never been there
(she leans forward) Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys That was before the accident
Oh what happened
looks over her shoulder as  continues to talk, so persuasive is 's storytelling that the scene comes vividly to life, albeit in 's dark pupil
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere
But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch
And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb
She- never-spoke-another-word
Ohhh
dear
Not another word From the shock, yes it would be
The story is interrupted by the return of the wedding party who are dripping wet, exactly as the couple in the story
bustles over to take off the wet wedding gown, her face puckered with tragedy
Terrible
Terrible Before she can undo the ties  pulls it from herself so aggressively that the ties and part of the gown comes apart
None of this is a concern to  who is distracted with fear for her piano
She crosses to the little window and stares anxiously at the falling rain
Sc 24                                        Sc 24 Soft piano music has been playing over the previous scene
Now it builds to strength as sea water swirls high around the piano, small and embattled on the dark rainy beach
Sc 23          '                 Sc 25 It's morning of the next day
and  sit amongst tea chests in the bedroom
is signing intently to
signs back, sometimes using words
watches uneasy with their secret communication
As  enters the animation is suspended stands and takes a step back as if to attention
shall be gone for some days
There is some Maori land  want and may buy very reasonably
( shuffles)  am hoping you will use the time to settle in, and, in some ways we may start again and  look at each other
All right
looks at him blankly, then nods
Sc 26          '                         Sc 26 and  dressed in cloaks and bonnets skirt the dense bush trying to find a path in
It is not easy, because the bush is so tight

signs to
Please take us to the beach where we landed
'm sorry,  can't do that
( and  stare evenly at him) don't have the time
(They continue to stare
) Goodbye Sc 28          '                         Sc 28 It is much later when  emerges from his hut with a saddle over his arm
The two women are still there
looks up at him expectantly
mirrors her expression
- can't - take - you there can't do it
He puts the saddle over a rail
He continues to saddle up, sneaking glances at them from under the horse and around its side
They watch him closely, not pleadingly, but stubbornly1 eerily of one mind
Sc 29                                        Sc 29 The sky is blue with long wisps of cloud
The party of three break onto the long expanse of beach where the piano still stands
It has not been without visitors
There are footprints on the sand and some of the boards have been pulled back
passes , walking urgently towards it
Soon,  has removed enough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys
stays back
takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys again
Her whole composition is altered
She is animated, joyful, excited
Down on the wet sand  does a wild dance of her own invention using a seaweed wig
She finishes by rolling down the beach in the sand
views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon
His attention fixes on 's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer
Sc 30                                NOONSc 30 The shadows are long on the sand when ' collects the boards and  are attempting a duet
notices him come towards them with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave
Her mood darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though  has stopped
Abruptly she finishes
In black spirits she replaces her cape and bonnet
is struck by this sudden change, he watches her mesmerised as he replaces the boards
Sc 31                                        Sc 31 From a helicopter, the camera tracks along the beach, following the crashing wave line, to find the piano
32 Sc 33          '  &                Sc 33 The hut puffs smoke out into the valley
The lie of the land traps sound like a shell and the clear high notes of a voice echo out
Suspicious that  is singing,  approaches the house quietly
Through the open kitchen door he sees that the keys of a piano have been etched on the table top
While  "plays" the notes  sings them
puts his pack down
stands to attention, folding the tablecloth back over the table

They are dressed in European style and while their training is in polite proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their demonstrative displays of affection, and their clay tobacco pipes to which they are addicted

(looking carefully at ) Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done
(without pause but referring to the sheet) You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie

Tea

They sing the anthem in snatches
It is background to the conversation

Like it were a piano
It's strange isn't it

He stands back leaning against a wall

'm wondering if she's not brain affected
No sound at all
No, it was a table
(musing) Well, she was very violent with the gown
She tore off a chunk of lace
if hadn't been there 'd have sworn she'd used her teeth and wiped her feet an it
Well it has not yet come to anything
Just a concern
pats her chest
a calming device
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern
There is something to be said for silence Oh indeed

She holds her needle up for  to thread

Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent

Sc 35          '                Sc 35 is at the woodshop cutting firewood
He displays his virtuosity as an axeman, cutting the wood into ever more slender pieces,  is watching and stacking the fallen timber
She flinches as the axe hits the wood, but scurries in to pick up the timber

Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them
On your property

Have you taught before

On your piano, that is the swap
finger signs, her face furious
What does she say
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it
He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant
He wants to improve himself
and you will be able to play on it
( is not responding well) Teach him to look after it
's breathing becomes heavy with anger, she writes Curiously on her pad
' regards her note and her passion with suspicion and disdain (getting up) You can't go on like this, we are a family now, all of us make sacrifices and so will you
You will teach him

's emotions are suddenly removed and she views  blankly, eerily so
Sc 37                                 37 The piano is taken up through the bush by a group of six to eight It's very heavy and awkward and they grunt and struggle with it
HiM na ake 'nun na'

People scatter
Only one stays who warrior like challenges the piano
Sc 38                                  Sc38 The women duck low to avoid a branch as  leads them to ' hut

The path slopes up through a strange, bearded forest where the tops of trees are bare and ghost like

Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good
Sc 39      /     '                       39 The piano is the only cared for item in the rough hut (lifting the lid) It looks good, very nice looking thing

The girls are very excited about the lessons
The "girls" look anything but excited

glances up as she feels him passing behind her
He seems satisfied to watch
His attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to the piano
Again he shifts his chair, taking it round the back and to the other side of the piano
As he moves  watches warily
From this position be doesn't try to touch her, but watches, enjoying her fingers moving on the keys and the small details of motion on her face
Twice he closes his eyes and breathes deeply  is experiencing an unpractised sense of appreciation and lust
When his eyes are closed, glances at him with curiosity and suspicion
