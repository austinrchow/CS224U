wrapping the weird thing up
now at last reaching for the car phone

You tell me, Buckaroo, what in the hell is this going- through-solid-matter-and rendering-all-conventional-defense-perimeters- useless-over-night bullshit
But now Professor Hikita snatching the phone from the Secretary, turning his back to the room
Buckaroo
Did you seem them
Did you

Right into the side of that mountain
Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno, you guys're the Hong Kong Cavaliers
Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle
So  gotta ask, did it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the , the experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently smack into a black void
Nope
Was Buckaroo acting different this morning,  mean, in terms of other mornings
The Cavaliers rolling their eyes, looking at one another
Well, we partied pretty late last night

Lizardo

Lizardo half in, half out, physically unhurt but screaming his head off
99 the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose, while Professor Hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope
100 : 101 the doctor's assistants frantically tugging on his feet, dragging him back into the room only to find this  - a fearsome, changed individual
a beast
102 terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he straightens up, at last wrenching free of the wicker chair, smashing his two assistants' heads together as he jumps over the runway
Hikita watching wild-eyed as Lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy expanse of the factory
103 as he rips a door off its hinges, escaping into the night,      , '  - 	104 Nearly half a century later, the elderly Lizardo regards with smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance of a  who comes in and unplugs his  set

somebody, help
Got a half a tuna sandwich
Same one you had yesterday
Rawhide taking a half-eaten sandwich out of his hat and tossing it to Buckaroo
Smells fermented
(taking a big bite) Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher
Buckaroo, 've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield
Figures
Anybody seen my scope
Coming right up, Buckaroo
Perfect Tommy producing a highly sophisticated
Buckaroo slipping in a transparency

Anybody we know
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer
Rawhide reclaiming his raunchy slide, Buckaroo looking back into the sleek device
ran it through the centrifuge, but  came up blank
It's definitely dead now, although it still conducts electricity even better than copper does
Super performance organic material
Yes, Perfect Tommy, in a way
However
(slipping in another slide) notice
although certain components resist identification, it corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis
(scrutinizing) Too closely
Gotta be more than sheer coincidence
Rawhide, you're keen on bugs
What do you think
Rawhide takes a look as Reno hangs the phone up
Everything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo
Sam's with the Jet Car and she's under lock and key
He's retiming her valves
Buckaroo nodding, as he's interrupted by Perfect Tommy who's now brought over the female reporter
Buckaroo, you got a minute--
Not really
This is pretty important
She wants a picture
Perfect Tommy quickly taking a place beside Buckaroo, smiling into the camera, as Reno and Rawhide exchange disgusted looks

Do we look okay

No question about it
Something very akin to arachnoid tissue

mutated species

' Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery is proud to present, for one night only
the one, the only, the amazing Buckaroo Banzai and his Hong Kong Cavaliers
'' , Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining the Hong Kong Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won't sit still
113 while at the rear of the room, seated by herself, we find an crying, for some reason exempt from the general raucous good will
She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do the job
She's all alone
She needs some help
Her name is 114 On-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves the Cavaliers to cease as well
, the only sound Buckaroo's lips on the silver mike
heard somebody crying
(no response) said is someone out there crying in the darkness
Yes, indeed
Penny's voice, weakly:	115 Here
here at the back
'm sorry
116 Buckaroo squints, spots her
His voice comes mighty over the Raise your hand
where
(raising her hand) This is so embarrassing
Somebody get her a mike
Can we manage that
And a spotlight
What's your name
Penny
'd rather not reveal my last name or my age
For reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to Buckaroo and the Cavaliers as "Peggy," said name immediately eliciting a surprised reaction from the Cavaliers
Buckaroo amazed as well
a not-too-distant pain deep in his soul momentarily manifesting itself, although he makes a brave attempt at nonchalance
as now Penny is given that microphone
Did you say
"Peggy"
My name is Penny
Penny Priddy
There 've said it, but it won't mean anything to you
'm a nobody
The business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing a bit more easily
Nobody's a nobody
Why're you crying
What's wrong
(blowing her nose) Did  say anything was wrong
just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay
'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town,  can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause  met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record
He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well,
He offered you money
Do  look like that kinda girl
(to tell the truth) lost my room this morning
don't know where 'm gonna sleep tonight, but  keep going
What the hell else can  do
've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, 'll always have a job
few snickers
shooting a disapproving look at those guilty of laughing at another person's misfortune
Remember it's always darkest just before the dawn
Believe me, 've been there
Buckaroo moving to a piano
starting to play
This song's for Peggy
And all you others out there a little down on your luck
(exasperated) My name's, Penny
But who cares
117 Buckaroo and his men start to
slower, sexier
118 and Penny opens     , removes first a dog- earned paperback entitled Beyond the Realm of Atomic Particles and Massless Photons, by Buckaroo Banzai
then a , its cover depicting Buckaroo locked in mortal combat with ,
Penny lays both publications on the table, continues to dig around, revealing next a  - 119 as Buckaroo pours it on, looking in her direction
120 Penny takes the gun from her purse and lays it in her lap, tears starting to flood her eyes
121 , all the women enraptured by his voice, his sultry glance, his animal presence
a real heart-breaker

Let me go, let me go, you creeps
Everybody okay up here

Buckaroo too
but his mind still half on Penny Priddy

pulling a on tiny travel wheels, wearing an
Out for a stroll
Where do you think you're going, doc
The moon
129 An amazing thing occurring, as Lizardo's right arm rockets out an catches the astonished guard around the throat, lifting him off the floor, Lizardo's left hand picking up the telephone
Operator
wanna place a person-to-person call to John Bigboote, Yoyodyne Propulsions Systems
Grover's Mill, New Jersey
Tell him it's John Whorfin calling
That's ------
Got it, honey
John
--- Lizardo waiting for the call to go through as he strangles the last breath of air out of the helpless guard, drops him to the linoleum, reaching for the dead man's keys
(into phone) Of course it's me, John Bigboote, you fool
Prepare for my return
The time has come
Haven't you heard
Don't you watch
Banzai and Hikita have done it
'll meet you at the factory
Get that overthruster
And the little Jap
Alive
Banzai's too dangerous
Lizardo ripping the phone out of the wall, hurling it across the room
those inmates playing their video games fleeing like rabbits when they see that
Lizardo obviously no ordinary lunatic, as he proves by simply reaching out and
130 touching     , instantly shorting it out on his way to freedom, suitcase in tow
- 	131 a newspaper, a banner front page headline announcing the amazing Jet Car test
and down in a lower corner,    "--" being summarily escorted out of Artie's Artery 132 a simple steel frame bed, fold-out desk with microscope, scientific books everywhere
Buckaroo trying to tie his bowtie, glancing at the newspaper propped upon his dresser, that picture of Penny Priddy staring back at him
Perfect Tommy and Reno nearby assembling some kind of slide show
the two Cavaliers worrying more about Buckaroo than about what they're doing, as they fumble the slides, several falling to the floor
Pick those up, Reno
didn't drop 'em
Perfect Tommy getting up and peeking at the newspaper over Buckaroo's shoulder
then returning to Reno
their voices low
It's a spittin' image
Doesn't look anything like her to me
Pictures don't lie
Hell they don't
met my first wife that way
It's Peggy to these eyes
Same nose, same hair
Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right
133 Buckaroo overhearing all of this, of course, as the door opens, Rawhide appearing, offering a  -
Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo
Thought you'd wanna be notified
That old pal of the professor's, Dr
Emilio Lizardo
The one you did the brain scan on--
He killed a guard last night, broke outta the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled it a block away
Buckaroo's expression changing at the mention of the name Lizardo
taking the print-out
Then what
Vanished
Thin air
Doctor Lizardo
Wasn't he on  once
You're thinking of Mr
Wizard
This guy's an eccentric genius
Hey, so was Mr
Wizard
Dr
Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours
Have you warned Professor Hikita
First thing  did
(in the dark) Why
What's going on
Anything  oughta know
'mon, Rawhide, spill it
Buckaroo nodding his permission
The professor and Dr
Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension
Almost fifty years ago
Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other
But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr
Lizardo got sucked half in, half out
when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy
His hair was orange
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane
The professor told us they threw away the key
Hey, any lock can be picked
So what's he up to
'm sure we'll find out soon enough
Buckaroo heading for the door
Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his pocket
And another thing
Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without signing
Buckaroo and Reno automatically turning to Perfect Tommy
Wasn't me
'd take a hundred, right

Lizardo escaped

Professor Hikita removing the   from his battered briefcase and laying it on the table
Buckaroo taking a sip of water
Thank you for coming
Before  answer any questions,  think Buckaroo owes us all a few explanations for yesterday's antics
Mr
Secretary
Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen
thirty years ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane notion: the possibility of contacting alien life
not on another planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid matter
life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with Doctor Emilio Lizardo
1st The same Doctor Lizardo that just
One and the same
144 '  , '
145 John 'Connor and John Gomez at the refreshment table now adding several packs of 'Sweet 'n' Low' to their thick coffee as
:	146 don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but 'm talking twister physics
Quantum Mechanics
Now you see, now you don't
This table 'm sitting behind
It appears to be solid matter, right
Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping it, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces off the table
But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table
the protons, quarks, your neutrons and electrons
they comprise only about one quadrillionth of its total volume
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into
Exactly
So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover a to travel inside things like tables
And mountains
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor
2nd What about the Pentagon
The possibility of war in the Eighth Dimension, Mr
Secretary
Hey, better there than here, huh
, the Secretary of Defense eyeing Penny critically as the lights dim
as    slips into the room, approaches the dais, and the   is projected onto the screen

but the outline of a
nonetheless unmistakable

The president of what
The President of the United States

It's real fuzzy

Navy frigate, number 7541, disappeared on a clear day in the North Atlantic

President--

Reno complying, the lights returning to normal, Buckaroo dazed, his hand moving automatically, writing on any surface available
flying when he touches the metal-tipped pen to metal
160 Buckaroo finally settling for his hand,

It's like cheesecloth,  think

Okay, wise guys

as new Jersey administers first aid to Reno and Penny strokes the fallen Cavalier's hair, berating the idle bystanders around them: Is this the kind of society you want

Sorry, John, all these people "need see" Buckaroo in person

Buckaroo
Is the professor here
Where's Penny
Both of 'em safe and sound
What's going on
Everybody's freakin' out
shaken Rawhide, Reno, Perfect Tommy appearing on the stairway
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10
What
How do you know that
It's all on the record
Come on- Buckaroo heading up the stairs
260 with his men, being debriefed on the run: Planet 10
The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy
The invisible body
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey
where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up
And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for
Orson Wells
What about Doctor Lizardo
Lizardo caused it all
Because he was already here on earth, screwing around with his own stupid Overthruster
Faulty design
It sucked
but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo
just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof
Hikita's lab exploded
Stole his body
When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped
Of course
What else
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here
It wasn't to talk to the head honcho
It
Who does

266 as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry of   ,      sizzles up from the grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai
am John Emdall from Planet 10
common grave danger confronts both our worlds
- 	267 Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs
Johnson advances with a load of cold beers and Birdseye burritos
passing by a figure frozen in the shadows
:    '
Mrs
Johnson gone, none the wiser
'  - 	268 Mrs
Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room
Oh, wow
Reno picking her things up, as Mrs
Johnson backs away from the and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the corner of Buckaroo's desk
269 After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension
Death was deemed too good for their ilk
270 Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her
She's not in her room
looked
Will everybody please shut up so  can hear this thing
271 Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely away on another plane of existence
272 Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere in the room
"John Parker"  think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil
With a weird album
how the hell was supposed to know he came from outer space
Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the
John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man
273 And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin further with your Oscillation Overthruster
For our intelligence warns us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back through the Eighth Dimension
and on to Planet 10
If he should attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics
An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American first strike
Exactly, Perfect Tommy
The Soviets will retaliate
Your President Widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike
and within twenty minutes the danger to Planet 10 will be removed
God, if it's not one thing it's another
But
because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your planet
Stop John Whorfin before sunrise
If you fail we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves
End of discussion
274 There's an awful pause
and then a  as John Emdall spirals downward into the grooves of the record again
275 She gotta be kiddin', right
Vaporize the whole damn planet--
You wanna take the chance, Casper
Not me
No way
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula
Mrs
Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car
Wow, you know it
Buckaroo heading for the door
Where're you goin'
To get my guns
His guns
Holy shit

an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the closet, finding it locked
knocking
Open up or 'll shoot it off
'll shoot yours off if  had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova thought you liked me for myself
But why should you, huh
jerk like me
Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, seeing   on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet- so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo
his pretty companion Penny, look- ' You look
Who is she
That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's maybe coming to an end and  can't stand here and talk to a closet door
' Yeah, whose world is coming to an end
You only wanted me because remind you of her
Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away
Penny,  was going to get into that, but  haven't had time
with arachtoids and all
but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we got married, and that's about all  can say
Right now
(no response) Penny
silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking
slowly opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female clothing
Married--
So that's it
Buckaroo Banzai, a married man
Where is she
With the kids some place
Buckaroo turning
Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you
She was killed, Penny
Oh, my
Don't go to pieces
haven't got time tonight
pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces
Where's my damn ammo
Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here
How did she die
wanna know
You don't wanna know
Yes,  do
Gimme a chance
'm stronger than you think
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night
Hanoi Shan--
The guy in your comic books
Boss of the World Crime League
Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death
The Pivot of Mystery himself
You're putting me on
He's a cartoon character
wish he was
He's real enough

changes his torn and shredded jacket
Penny looking at a on the night stand
then at the framed photograph of Peggy
God, she's so young and beautiful
don't remember her at all
Which guess is good, under the circumstances
bet you'll never forget her though
One look at Buckaroo says it all
Never
gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-'ve got mixed emotions- don't know if  can handle this
Oh, boy
gotta go
We're on borrowed time
Go where
Where're you going
(squatting close to her) Please, Penny
You just gotta trust me now
Okay
And don't panic
Because it's gonna be all right
What
If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai
Yeah
and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself
Believe in Penny Priddy
Absolutely
Penny looks into his eyes
You've got your six guns strapped on
You're ridding off on another adventure
Oh, my God, it's all real
it really is real
should go with you
Please
It's too dangerous
That's just what you would say
This is so unreal

Yeah
Just grazed me
The Professor's under the floor too

Any antidote for these things
John Parker holding the stinger in his palm
No, none

He drops it to the floor, stomps it to death

We will, old fried, we will
Sure do pack a mean wallop

Don't shoot

a fleeting glimpse of

lying on his belly, surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of government, staring down at a special mirror that reflects his Secretary of Defense, the Secretary pressing a point further an igniting a Camel with a lighter from the President's nightstand
It's not Buckaroo Banzai per se, Mr
President
It's his men
some of then foreigners
Asiatics, their names changed, their true backgrounds shrouded in secrecy

appears with two little pills
These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr
President
That's okay, Bonnie,  won't be operating any heavy machinery today
(desperate) We've never had a weapon like the Jet Car in the past, Mr
President
Light-weight, highly mobile, stick on some anti-tank missiles, a couple grenade launchers, hell, we could buy ourselves two hundred Jet Cars for the price of ten tanks, send 'em swarming all over Ivan like bumble bees, sir, right clear through their precious little Iron Curtain like it was Swiss cheese
They gotta be just scared shitless
As are all sane men today
Hey, and me too
That's why 'm saying until Buckaroo Banzai agrees to submit his boys to at least a routine government security check, that Jet Car should be in the hands of Defense, and if they won't sell us the technology, then Mr
President, by God, sir, we have got to take it
In the national interest
The lighter in the Secretary's hand suddenly , startling him and prompting the President to claim the gizmo and point it at

President
How's my favorite patient
Any tenderness
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo
What's it like out there in the real world
Secretary of Defense McKinley stepping around behind the bed, coming into Buckaroo's field of vision
Not too terrific, sir
apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire
You're gonna have to repeat that,  think, Buckaroo

technicians accumulating  on 10
To cut right to the bottom line on this, sir, we have reason to believe that there are moving freely among us, vicious red aliens disguised as the owners and operators of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems
Perfect Tommy, Reno, even Casper Lindley, coming in and out of the picture, transforming themselves into a crack commando unit donning assault/chemical-warfare uniforms
little Scooter Lindley among them, too, doing like his dad

Secretary, no
Real aliens
Giant red arachtoids camouflaged as human beings

Secretary, is this enormous rocketship to escape back through the Eighth Dimension and then on to Planet 10

John Parker on  appearing as nothing more than a wild and wooly Rastafarian
Buckaroo

President

This situation is explosive
Explosive
What are you saying, man
Some kind of race war in New Jersey--
No, sir

President
what
thermonuclear holocaust, sir
These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo
We know each other pretty well,  think
John

don't know what to say, Buckaroo
aliens from Planet 10, nuclear extortion, spiders in thunder clouds, a girl named "John"

Electromagnetic bacterial crap
Programmable
We inhale the bacteria

Secretary

'm not worth it, Buckaroo
Forget me
Penny--
Are you all right
