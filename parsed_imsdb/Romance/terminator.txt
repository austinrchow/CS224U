Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible
bounded on one side by a chain-link fence and on the other by the one-story public school build- ings
Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha- dows
This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood
, where a trash dumpster looms in a  , part of the clutter behind the gymnasium
enters
, prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows
, which freezes, alert, sensing something just beyond human perception
sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening
Papers blow across the pavement

Windows rattle in their frames

-                                 2 as the sound of stray electrical  subsides
comes to rest on the figure of a   kneeling, faced away, in the previously empty yard
He stands, slowly
The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built, moving with graceful precision
- , his facial features reiterate the power of his body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue and depthless
His hair is military short
This man is the
He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and notices that a fine white ash covers his skin
He brushes at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning his surroundings

The school is perched at the edge of a pro- montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem- ing and glistening under a sullen sky
The night clouds are shot through with occasional flashes of , presaging a thunderstorm
Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing down at the city as the

to include its ex-owner and his two compatriots,   , lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground
They sport nondescript
torn -shirts, fatigue pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets
The leader notices something and sits up
(pointing) Hey, hey
what's wrong with this picture
- , seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose- fully toward them
-  ' , as he approaches them
They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground liquid shadows
Nice night for a walk, eh
Terminator stops right in front of them
(without inflec- tion) Nice night for a walk
They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor
Washday tomorrow, huh
Nothing clean, right
Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried
Reptilian
Nothing clean
Right
This guy's a couple bricks short
Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the others
Your clothes
Give them to me
The punks exchange glances, dismayed
(coldly) Now
(bracing) Fuck you, asshole
Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple with blinding speed
The blow flings him with a  into the jungle gym
He drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching
The leader whips out his  and slashes in one motion
Terminator ducks back and catches the knife- wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip
Then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone
- , as the knife clatters down
The punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground
-  , Terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing, but motionless
Their bodies are in total shadow
The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended with an agonizing pressure
Terminator jerks his fist back with a   and the other drops
The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror
He backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds he is in a corner
Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous
The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes
Thunder peals overhead

/ -                              4 light  begins to fall
Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground, pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike the collar of the punk's jacket
The rain streams down over his face, running into and over his eyes
They do not blink

/ -                      5 Another part of the city
Seedy apartments and storefronts
The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic
into the mouth of a narrow alley lined with trash containers and fire escapes
From a recessed doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement
An angry, inarticulate '  rises occasionally above the rain sounds
- ,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork around him
shockwave hurls trash into the air
Painted over windows shatter
Rat scurry, blinded
drops   as if out of the sky and smacks the pavement with a muddy splash

is 22, but his face has been aged by ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim
crinkled burn scar traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead
Other scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body
The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin as electrical  lace back and forth between the fire escapes behind him,  and
The sound fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising scream of animal agony
Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley
: 5A/                                                   5A/ 6                                                       6 7
-                                7 as he leaps to the fire escape and clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another who appears to be entangled in the ironwork
The man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering gasp
reveals that he has been skewered through the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the shoulder by a railing
He has materialized in the same space occupied by the fire escape structure
The figure slumps, motionless
Reese quickly checks for signs of life
The man is dead
Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk huddled in the doorway
pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working girls, passes by the alley mouth
They do a double take when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride, completely jaded
He's certainly not a potential customer
Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk
Say, buddy
did you see a real bright light

/ -                                 8 brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an cruiser glides slowly by on the street
The search- light illuminates the figure of Reese, crouching over the sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers
The cruiser chirps to a stop
The doors fly open and two cops leap out
Hold it, right there
Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot
The cops draw their guns and race into the alley after him
or , rushing with Reese along the narrow alley
He vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans
Whips around a corner
Leaps the hood of a parked car in the cross alley

Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him
Sandwiched
Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the lock, and vanishes into the darkness within
The newly arrived cops are a -9 unit
They open the back door of the squad car to release a large black Doberman

-                           12 Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount department store
searchlight stabs in the front window as he dashes into the maze of aisles
Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door
, as he crab-runs low among the moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness
He bolts the open space behind a display window
Sees the outside searchlight sweep toward him
Freezes

As the light passes, Reese silently moves on

Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks and shadows,    with him

-   , a dark blur with teeth, extremely Doberman, flies toward Reese
He spins
Catches it by the throat in mid-air
Arcs it to the floor with unflinching precision
- , suddenly on its back and held by the throat, and stares at Reese, who leans very close
Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis- ing dominance
Some ancient communication seems to pass between the two
Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting a long overcoat from a rack
The dog backs away from him, stiff-legged and confused
: 14
-                           14 as he rounds a corner on the run, still shrugging into his long coat
Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed
Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air like a cat
The cop
Misses
Goes down under Reese's tackle and they slide together on the polished floor
Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun, aiming it at the other's face two-handed
What day is it
The date
Thursday

May twelfth
(viciously) What year
whines off the metal side of an escalator behind Reese's head
He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the amazed cop lying on the floor
Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the

Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the escalators

Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the , an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips it under his coat
Cradled in a vertical position, the shortened weapon is virtually invisible
He walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain

Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan white pages: , , ,

Thanks, Chuck

Sarah looks over his shoulder as he modifies the week's schedule
Mmm
Same schedule's okay
Alright

It's not brain surgery, Chuck
Breen hands her an apron ceremoniously
Here you go

He indicates the display case and wall racks with a minimal gesture
The Uzi 9 millimeter

Terminator examines each in turn, working the actions with curt, precise movements
(continuing) Any one of them's ideal for home defense
Which'll it be
All
The clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile
Maybe 'll close early
Cash or charge
Instead of replying, Terminator takes a box of shotgun shells from a stack on the display case
Sorry,  can't sell the ammo with the guns
You'll have to---Hey
Terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the shotgun

In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'
She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a third
customer tugs on her apron for attention and she barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe
Honey, can  get that coffee now
Yes sir, just a second
She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines in lock-step
Who gets the Burly Burger

Does mine come with fires
He's got the Barbecue Beef, 've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe
Okay, who gets the Burly Beef
Miss, we're ready to order
In the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks over someone's water glass
(mopping fran- tically) Oh, sorry
That's not real leather, is it
As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of Sarah's apron She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned and sags with defeat

His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push
He heaves it up with a guttural cry
Lowering his weights with a , Matt lies panting, arms dangling at his side, eyes closed

Sleep therapy
Matt opens his eyes
(continuing) You think somebody's gonna do this for you
Look at those shriveled bi's
And you haven't worked lat's or ab's since Wednesday
(smiling) Hello, sweetheart
Had a rough day
(softening) Come here, wimp
She leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's bad for the other guys' discipline
Sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak
Hi, Matt
Matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down
(grinning broadly) Heeey
It's my favorite Sarah
Hi, babe
Ginger pulls the pin on Mat's weights and re-inserts it beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight
Alright, warm-ups are over
Back to work, Bunky
Ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away
'Bye beautiful
You too, Ginger

She is wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the greater part of her legs
Sarah is in a skirt and bra
The phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room to get it
(answering the phone) Hello

Sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out matter-of-factly: Ginger
It's Matt
She resumes listening

) Oh my God
Sarah
Oh, shit

Sure, Bunky

Sarah hold up another one
How about this
Great
You're a big help
(advisory tone) Alright, the beige one

Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front of her

Give me the short version
Six shots at less than ten feet

Don't track it all over
It's un- professional
He turn back to Vukovich, gesturing at the body

Got a pos- itive on her
She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal-- (interrupting) That can't be right
That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon

You and Matt have a good time

Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife in submarine depths of smoky haze
Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar
her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay phone and dials

It slashes viciously downward
Matt rolls and the pillow is   where his throat had been
Whoah
Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again
Matt grabs the wrist in both hands
The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of the killer's single arm
And still the blade moves closer to his throat
With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways and the blade snaps with a  against the headboard

as it opens and a figure stands silhou- etted briefly against a streetlight
Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure
-  as he mechanically raises his beer
His knuckles are white
He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat
There is a glint of metal in the shadows within
Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past him, out-of-focus
Sarah looks up
- '  sliding slowly along polished steel, a caress
His finger slips through the triggerguard of the riot gun
, as the man stops in front of her in close
He sits slowly in the booth opposite her
The angle is (uncertainly) Lieutenant Vukovich
- It is not Lt
Vukovich
Terminator sits motionless for a

The bore seems enormous

Sarah screams as the
45 round blows stuffing out of the booth seat inches from her face
Her hair is singed by burning gunpowder
An involuntary cry is punched out of her by the double concussions
Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises from booth
' , as he fires, cocks the slide, fires again, advancing on Sarah's booth
Terminator is blown backward over the center divider, crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the table opposite, and onto the floor
Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth
Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table- full of drunk patrons
He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one in the arm
The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering, gaping
Sarah stops screaming
Reese stand motionless, gun aimed
In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun is abnormally loud
, very still
Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the  machine pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang- ing on a shoulder strap
He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire
Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing
burst from the  rakes the bar where he stood
An orgy of shattering glass
Total pandemonium
as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence
Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes her wrists
, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the one-handed
Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion erupt with hits from the

He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning her
Reese fires, ducks, fires again

Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun

He drops a spent clip
Reaches for another with his bloody hand
as he vaults the row of booths and starts firing
At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into Terminator's belly

The air is thick with smoke
Reese tosses the , for which he has no ammo, into the fire
He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her
, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical
When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide

Come with me if you want to live
She looks where he is pointing

Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to her feet without slowing

Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor
Slams and blot-latches it
An instant later an impact from the far side tears the latch-screws half out of the wall
They run on

But the image is bizarre, alien
Bright and hyper-real

The margins of the  are crammed with columns of - type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms
The data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow
There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see
The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are digitized and enhanced as well

There is little room to run
Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells
Behind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining

As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard, pitching her on her face to the pavement
He flings open the car door

Drops to the ground
Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row just before Terminator reaches it
The car , filling the alley with fire
An inferno funneled between the enclosing walls
behind the car door as flames roar over the hood
, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the wall of flame
Reese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car
Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together and we recognize it as his stolen
The engine catches
rockets out of the flames
Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead, impacts on the hood of Reese's car
His hair and coat are burning

His eyes flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back and the world spins outside
With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a clipped, military voice
Are you injured
Are you shot
No response
He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs, chest
Sarah flinches
She feels the
She pushes his hand away and opens the door
Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her
Hard
(continuing) Do exactly what  say
Exactly
Don't move un- less  say
Don't make a sound unless  say
Do you understand
As he speaks he is locking the door and fastening Sarah's seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would for a child
She doesn't answer
(continuing/ shouting) Do you understand
(a whisper) Yes
Don't hurt me
'm here to help you

Firelight from the back of Stoker's lights the street garishly
young cop  stands beside the car talking via radio with the mike cord pulled through the side window
He speaks with a distinctive twang--a displaced southerner
don't know, it looks like it might spread to this furniture warehouse across the alley, the paint on the wall's starting to blister up
The sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate the face of Terminator, motionless in the dark right in front of us
Eyes open
Listening
(continuing) Better get another truck round to this side
Terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and strides purposefully toward the cop,  following
The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over him and opens the door
Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143
Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into gear, and pulls out
,   , as it accelerates rapidly, until the lines across the street are flashing under it in a staccato rhythm

haven't done anything
No
But you will
It's very important that you live

Flesh, skin, hair
blood
Grown for the cyborgs
Look, Reese,  know you want to help, but
(cutting her off) Pay attention
The 600 series had rubber skin
We spotted them easy
But these are new
They look human
Sweat, bad breath, everything
Very hard to spot
had to wait 'til he moved on you before could zero him
Hey, 'm not stupid, y'know
They can't build anything like that yet
No
Not yet
Not for about forty years
Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car
Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit too cool
So, it's from the future, is that right
One possible future
Four your point of view
don't know the tech stuff
And you're from the future too
Right
They come to a red light and Reese stops
(patronizingly) Right
Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock and has the door half open before Reese can react
He catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car
Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength
His grip doesn't slacken
Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door
His face shows no reaction
Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face
The light turns green and Reese drives on
Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth
(coldly) Cyborgs don't feel pain do
Don't
do that
again
He wipes his hand on his pants
(weakly, plead- ing) Just let me go
(slow, but intense) Listen
Understand
That Terminator is out there
It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with
it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear
and it absolutely will not stop
Ever
Until you are dead
Sarah slump in utter resignation

Maybe

Why does it want me
They are lying very close, a forced intimacy
Reese's voice is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear
cruiser passes so close they can hear its radio clearly
There's so much

Reese musters his thoughts
And starts
There was a war

Nuclear war

Hooked into everything
Trusted to run it all
They say it got smart

Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side
Decided out fate in a microsecond

Grew up there

Motionless
Her eyes are fixed on the middle distance
She's been crying
Now she's emptied out
The door opens
At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes involuntarily
Vukovich enters with Traxler and , a criminal psychologist
Silberman is smooth of skin and manner, young, ambitious and
fat
He is enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly
Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee
He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders
Here, drink some of this
(voice flat, desperate) Lieutenant, are you sure it's them
Maybe  should see the bodies
They've already been identi- fied
There's no doubt
Sarah  begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly
(to herself) Of, God
Ginger
kiddo, 'm so sorry
Vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and it starts to spill
(gently) Sarah
(pause) Sarah, this is Dr
Silber- man
'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you
Do you feel up to it
(almost in- audible) guess so
(to Silberman) You're a doctor
criminal psychologist
Is Reese crazy
That's what we're going to find out

It's Terminator, and he's a mess
bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest, shoulder and right wrist

His eyebrows are singed off
Hair a charred stubble

With small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis- assemble the damaged mechanism around the 12-guage hit

Reese, his arms handcuffed behind him, sits opposite Dr
Silberman
Behind Silberman is a large mirror leans against the wall
So
You're a soldier
Fighting for whom
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27-- (interrupting) The year 2027

Just behind the glass is a     , aimed at Reese, and a  holding a   and

(to Vukovich) That Silberman just crack me up
(pause) He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire
Screwed it first, then set it on-- (leaning forward) Shut up
: 157 it had no choice
The defensive grid was smashed
We'd taken the mainframes
We'd won
Taking out Connor then would make no difference
Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence
We captured the lab complex
Found the
what- ever it was called
the time-displacement equipment
The Terminator had already gone through
They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place
Sumner didn't make it
Then how are you supposed to get back
Can't
Nobody goes home
Nobody else comes through
It's just him and me

He is close to a mirror, practically touching it, staring intently
- -  lying on the dresser
Terminator's fingers lift it
as it rises to his face, holds   left eye
With a smooth motion the knife point enters the eyeball and cuts away the ruins sclera and cornea, as well as part of the damaged eyelids
He wipes with a rag to clear the electronic eye's vision
Revealing the faintly glowing lens mechanism, suspended in a chrome socket by tiny servos
The eye whirs quietly as it tracks
, showing various repairs
Terminator's right hand, its wrist  crudely, holds a needle and sewing thread and starts to work on abdominal wound out of frame below
He slips a glove over the damaged hand
motoring cap over the blistered scalp
fresh shirt to hide his body wounds
This is followed by a new overcoat
- , contemplating his reflection in the mirror
With the hat pulled down, the collar pulled up, and favoring his right profile he looks unhurt
though a bit gaunt and pale
turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye in its metal socket into view
He slips on a pair of tight, wrap-around sunglasses
as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained mattress
He picks up the Remington 12 gauge, the -180 and the
38 off the springs and leaves by the fire escape

revealing Sarah, Silberman, Vukovich and Traxler watching a monitor sitting amid incredible paperwork clutter on a desk top
(recorded) Why didn't you bring any weapons
Something more advanced
Don't you have ray guns
Traxler, standing in the back, grins and nudges Silberman, who nods appreciatively
'   - He glares at Silberman
, as Silberman's voice is heard
(recorded) Show me a piece of future technology

Something about the field generated by a living organism
Nothing dead will go

Okay
But this

The real Silberman put the tape on ""
(excited) This is great stuff
could make a career out of this guy
You see how clever this part is
how it doesn't require a shred of proof
Most paranoid delusions are intricate
but this is brilliant
He starts the tape again
(recorded) Why were the other two women killed
(recorded) Most official records were lost in the war
The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother
Her name
Where she lived, just the city
No scanner pictures
The Terminator was just being systematic

(recorded, con- tinuing) You've heard enough
Decide
Are you going to release me

(recorded/voice rising) Then why am  talking to you
Get out

as we hear Reese begin to shout
(recorded) can help you
Who is in authority here
,  , as he looks straight at the camera
(recorded) You still don't get it
He'll find her
That's what he does
All he does

(recorded, con- tinuing) You can't stop him
He'll wade through you

The screen goes black
Vukovich has cut off the tape
(glancing around) Sorry
-  staring at the empty screen
(turning) So Reese is crazy
In technical terminology, he's a loon
But
Vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's padding
Sarah, this is body armor
Out  guys wear it
It'll stop a 12 gauge round
This other individual must've had one under his coat
Sarah want to believe him
God help her if he's wrong
But what about him punching through the windshield
(shrugs) Probably on , broke every bone in his hand and won't feel it for hours
There was this guy once that
Vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside Sarah on the bench
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep
It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands
can't sleep
Go ahead
You're safe
There're thirty cops in this building
Okay
She lays her head on a wadded up blanket as everyone leaves the office

The electric bolt on the security door opens and Silberman steps out
As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in the front door
He glances at the pale apparition in cap and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on
Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances up when he speaks
'm a friend of Sarah Connor
was told she is here
Can see her, please
You can't see here
She's making a statement
Where is she
(laconically) Look
It's gonna be a while
You wanna wait
There's a bench
Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric door, the rooms beyond

He turns and walks out through the front doors

Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments
He brandishes the -180 like a pistol in one hand, the 38 in the other
The shotgun dangles at his side on a shoulder sling

He hands her a blanket, some road flares, and a first aid kit
Then he slams the trunk
Reaching through the side window, he turns the wheel and pushes the car off the shoulder, over the embankment
, past Sarah and Reese, as the car trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis- appear among the trees
Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of

Let's get off the road

Reese, followed by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside
The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind
They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete, facing each other
They look beaten, grimy, exhausted
She huddles under the blanket, waif-like
You cold
Freezing
Come here
She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each other with the blanket covering both of them
Reese
you got a first name
Kyle
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time
White light
Pain
Like being ripped inside out
slowly
Like being born, maybe
Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket
You're wet
Oh my god
In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening with blood
caught one, back there
(incredulous) Caught one
You mean you got shot
Reese shrugs
It's not bad
Sarah sits up and turns toward him
We gotta get you to a doctor
It's okay
Forget it
Forget it
Are you crazy
Let me see it
Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder
(continuing) Jeez
You idiot
Take this off
She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens the first aid kit as he removes his jacket
(looking at the wound) See
Missed everything
Passed through the meat
Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound
This is gonna make me puke
Talk about something
What
Just talk
Tell me about my son
Is he tall
She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it
About my height
He has your-- (winces) damn
he has your eyes
Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back to work
What's he like
(thoughtful) You trust him
He's got that strength
You'd die in a second for John
Well, at least  know what to name him
don't suppose you'd know who the father is
So  don't tell him to get lost when  meet him
John never said much about him
He dies
Even before the war
(interrupting) Stop
don't want to know
Hold still
So
it was John that ordered you here
volunteered
You volunteered
It was an honor
chance to meet the legend
Sarah Connor
Who taught her son to fight
organize, prepare
From when he was a kid
When you were in hiding, before the war
She stops taping
She seems lost, her bravado dissipated
You talk about things  haven't done yet in the past tense
It's making me crazy
can't think
(pause) Are you sure you've got the right person
Reese appraises her coldly
'm sure
Come on, me
The mother of the future
Am  tough
Organized
can't even balance my checkbook
cry when  see a cat that's been run over
and  don't even like cats
She pulls the bandage tight with a knot
Ow
No, it's okay
It's better tight
And anyway, what do  know about guerrilla warfare
You'll learn
(angry) Look, Reese,  didn't ask for this honor and  don't want it
Any of it
John gave me a message for you
Made me memorize it
'Sarah"
this is the message
'Sarah, thank you
For your courage through the dark years
can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set
there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be
You must survive, or will never exist
'  That's all
Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real to her
Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage
(continuing) Good field-dressing
(brightening) You like it
It's my first
He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth- conserving embrace
Sarah gazes out the entrance, into the night
Sleep
It'll be light soon
(closing her eyes) Okay
Talk some more
About what
(murmuring) About where you're from
Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance
Alright
(pause) You stay down by day, but at night you can move around
The -'s use infra-red so you still have to watch out
But they're not too bright

He crouches down to her eye-level
She smiles
Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this
Huh
Reese whirls reflexively at a  behind him
The mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands

no, don't ask any questions
Just do it
gotta get going
gotta go
Bye, bye
Sarah has been idly leafing through the
On a whim she looks up something
She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing
Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out of the book
: 192
/  -                 192 Sarah is sitting at a table under a tree, lettering something with a lipstick on a cardboard box-flap
- , as the last letters are finished
It reads: as she retracts the lipstick and leans across to hand it to a girl at the next table
Thanks a lot
(
) What's that
Sarah looks up, startled to see him standing beside her
That's where we're going
Why
Sarah point to the directory page lying on the table
- Sarah's finger points to a listing which reads: 18144 El Camino Real, 'Vale She looks smug
Look
found it
Isn't that it
Cyber Dynamics Corporation
What about it
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing
Molecular-memory
Whatever
they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande
Skynet
for the government
Right
(uneasy) That's the way it was told to me
Sarah's fear has been replaced by excitement
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard
Eighty-six it
We'll blow up the place
burn it down
Something
(very cold) Tactically dangerous
We lay low
Reese
Think it through
We can prevent the war
Nobody else is gonna do it
If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again
We have to so it ourselves
That's not my mission
(upset, mocking his manner) Listen
Understand
'm not a military objective, Reese
'm a person
You don't own me
Reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet
Let's go
Time to move out
Fuck you
Let go of me
She jerks her arm free
He reaches for her again but she outdistances him, running
(warning tone) Sarah
She dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her sign
Reese follows her into the woods
: 193
/ -                               193 Only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over completely
as she runs down the path
Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in the long spring grass
She struggles violently to get away
Let
go
bastard
She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face
Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive crouch
Sarah freezes when she sees the
357 in his hand
(continuing, scared, but angry) Oh, that's real smart
Go on, shoot me
That's brilliant
Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun
Sarah too is shaking with emotion
Tears roll down her cheeks and her voice cracks
(continuing) Jesus Christ, Reese
Can't you see 'm scared
He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides
He turns away
(continuing) can't spend my life waiting for that thing to catch up with me
always looking over my shoulder, wondering if left some tiny clue behind
Reese doesn't respond
The gun slips from his fingers
His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees
The moment stretches
There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping
Reese
She crawls over to him
- in profile, with Sarah in
His eyes are closed
tear meanders down his cheek
(continuing, quietly) Kyle
(a whisper) 'm wrong here
wasn't meant to see this
He gestures at their surroundings
(continuing) It's
like some dream
This
this
He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree
(continuing) and you
all so
beauti- ful
It hurts, Sarah
More than death
He looks are her beseechingly
(continuing) Don't you understand
it's all gone
Sarah puts her arm around him
She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand
We can change it, Kyle
We have to try
She takes his shoulder in her hands
(continuing) There's no fate but what we make for ourselves
Right
Come on
Let's go, kiddo
Whaddya say
He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a second, then get up

Yes

The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight outside
Sarah is asleep on the bed
Reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid
The image of discipline
The
357 is held loosely in one hand on his lap
There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder
Sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness
He looks at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside
He'll find us, won't he
Probably
Sarah, if  get zeroed
Don't say that
If  do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace
Different country, different name, everything
In case they send another one
It'll never be over, will it
Look at me, 'm shaking
Some legend, huh
You must be pretty disappointed
No
'm not
Several beats before Sarah speaks again
Her eyes seem luminous in the dark
(softly) Kyle, the women in your time
what were they like
Good fighters
That's not what  meant
Was there someone special
Someone
girl
You know
(mechanically) No
(pause) Never
He looks away, outside the window (softly) 'm sorry
Sarah studies him for a moment
She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips
So much pain
Pain can be controlled
You disconnect it
And so you feel nothing
It's better that way
(with great sympathy) Oh, Kyle
Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness
John Connor gave me a picture of you once
never knew why
It was very old
Torn
Faded
You were young, like you are now
You weren't smiling
just a little sad
always wondered what you were thinking at that second
He closes his eyes, reaches toward her
His fingertips trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks
(continuing) memorized every line, every curve
He opens his eyes, looking right at hers
(continuing) Sarah,  came across time for you
love you

Sarah is quietly overwhelmed
Reese looks away

She continues, tenderly
He begins to respond
The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling embrace, clinging to her like life itself
Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed
She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with her lips
He unbuttons her blouse very slowly
Sarah guides his powerful hands over her

Sarah's hand moves
After a moment Reese looks down, puzzled
What are you doing
(continuing doggedly) You'll beg for mercy in a second
Reese seems unperturbed
Finally he begins to squirm
don't think  like this
You're not supposed to
Now Reese is becoming desperate
grimace spreads across his face
It becomes a grin
Then he's laughing, trying to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing together
Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might have been, in another life
moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking outside
Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes alert
Feral as ever

Then rolls off the catwalk

The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the snapshot develop

What did he say

Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the desert
Heat lightning pulses in their depths
