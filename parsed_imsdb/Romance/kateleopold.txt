"  " Screenplay by James Mangold and Steven Rogers Based on a story by Steven Rogers : - 1895 - : Ornate antique   strikes 2:15
The credits begin to roll
Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in preparation for a formal reception
Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier
Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery
Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases
- Kitchen clock strikes 2:15
Poultry plucked
Feathers everywhere
Steaming copper pots boiling over
Platters prepared with decorative garnish
Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced
glob of frosting enters a pair of puckered lips
The perpetrator, a fey, pompous,  , seriously considers the texture and flavor of the icing, then gives the   a withering, sour look
The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch
2:15
- Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15
The valet throws open velvet drapes, sunlight  the room revealing a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed
The valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt
The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry
Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, selects three suits and holds them up for inspection
From beneath the puffiest of pillows,   reluctantly opens weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit
- The riding outfit is adorned by , Duke of Albany, a dashing, virile man in his 30's
with great abandon, he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges
He sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path
In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the estate
Rugs are beaten out of open windows
- Large hallway clock -- 6:15
pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway
Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess
Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations
bird sits listless in a gilded cage
Hot water is poured into a bath
Carriages begin to arrive
Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play
Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire
- Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror
He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period
He flexes slightly
The valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid-section from behind
Leopold eyes his reflection seductively
He becomes bored
He turns to his right
The valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth
He turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat
The valet pats his mouth dry
He affects a pampered , crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air
Leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror
Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror
Fine linen undervest slides over his head
Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist
The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar
cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand
perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck
An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso
His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted
His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb
His cheeks are pinched
red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel
Leopold stares into the mirror
The effect is
He raises one eyebrow
Then, in a voice you could pour over a waffle: You dance like a herd of cattle, Miss Fairchild
You are a rare woman who lights up the room
simply by leaving it
He bows
As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's  , a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold in the looking glass
Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one-sided flash of wit
despise affairs of this sort, Uncle Otto
No one really listens to anyone else
If you attempt it, you will see why
You judge everything too severely wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward
You do not wonder at all
You merely ask in order to state your own opinion
We are all concerned about you
Ahh, here it comes
Your life does not seem to have any direction
At the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well
At 35 he is too old
Now is your time to take action
Tell me, what is it you want to  with your life
(wearily) do not know
(just as weary) Your ignorance cramps my conversation
(he slaps Leopold's face twice rather quickly) Wake up
This is your one and only life
Every man has the chance to make a difference
something
Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself
am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy
assure you there is no need for concern
am as effectual and attentive
as my position allows
Life is not position, Leopold
It is action
(he straightens Leopold's tie) will see you downstairs promptly
In the appropriate frame of mind
He leaves
Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers
The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy
Leopold shoots him a look
The valet fills the glass higher
Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway
He hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause
Finally
(grandly) Go spread joy
Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room
- Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian society gather inside
Leopold holds a prearranged dance card
He looks at the names and finds his first partner is Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting God
- profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically into frame with  , an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking
Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut
They dance out of frame
- Leopold dances into frame with , a  girl of 19
He glances at her and smiles
She titters, turning away shyly
They whirl around the dance floor
His smile grows into a broad grin
Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams up at him
happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky teeth
Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on
- Leopold lumbers into frame with  , a woman of immense girth
With great dignity and extreme difficulty he maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except her enormous bosom
You dance like an angel, Miss Fairchild
You light up the room thank you
Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily
Leopold glances at his card, sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders
He spots a    hidden amongst the guests
She scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around
Hiding his dance card, he saunters over
Good evening
do not believe have had the pleasure
The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes he is addressing her
She puts her pad away
Julia Carlson
Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently
'm sorry
Will you excuse me
(slightly tipsy) You are not from the area, are you
(smiles and shakes her head "No") Are you
This is my estate
Really
(looking around the room) Well it's not home but it's much
Leopold regards her curiously
The orchestra starts up
There is a hubbub amongst the guests
Shocking
The -----
The
Oh, that's from Paris, isn't it
It is a scandal nonetheless
Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room
Miss Carlson, do me the honor
'm afraid 'm not much of a dancer
(smiling seductively) Truly  would be in your debt
Any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself
No, no
Really,
Leopold stiffly holds out his arm
beat
Carlson, stuck, takes it   and is escorted to the dance floor
They dance
but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "--- --
" Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten
Carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly
suppose we really ought to sing along
(embarrassed) Oh, golly
They half sing, half speak the -----, their emphasis on "
" Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed
The room
Finally: (breathless) Thank you for the dance
It was lovely
hope it wasn't too awful for you
Not at all
It was most enlightening
There is a slight pause
The Grandfather  strikes midnight
really must be going
won't hear of it
(moving away from him) No, 'm quite late as it is
shall see you to the door
(stopping him resolutely) You're very sweet
had a wonderful time
(she watches him, memorizing his face
Then firmly) Goodbye
Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter
He watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door
He surveys the room
After a moment he follows her
- Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark
He hears an
He slows down, brushes back the thicket
The silhouette of a woman is revealed
She is once again writing in her notebook
Miss Carlson
Carlson spins around quickly, panicked
Leopold
Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, device
It's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow
Good God
What are you
You frightened me
Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it
What sort of mechanism is this
Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed
Answer me
It's perfectly all right
It's
Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside
Carlson
(carefully, deliberately) Listen to me
Please
Move very slowly
Step out of the machine
Step out and 'll explain whatever you want to know
What is this
Who are you
His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever
Oh, God
She  on his arm
Instinctively he pulls away, accidentally thrusting the lever into action
Carlson falls from the machine
(suddenly frantic) Get out of there
Get out now
The machine
Miss Carlson
No
The compartment door snaps shut
Shit
There is a
Blackness fills the screen
: - 1995 The compartment door slides  revealing
, 30's, an Asian doctor with a
Her face full of enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious Leopold
Shit
She turns to her co-workers, warning them
Shit
She looks back at Leopold
Shit
Her co-workers,
, austere, authoritative,
, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door
Good God
Everybody stay calm
Lock the front door
Dr
Drake and Kau make a move to inspect an unconscious Leopold
No, no, no
You mustn't touch him
The consequences could be catastrophic
He could be hurt, or even dead
All right
Touch him
They approach Leopold
Dr
Kau finds Carlson's note pad on the ground next to Leopold
She reads the last entry
But 'm stuck and it's only a dance and he  the seventh Duke of Albany
They all look at one another, then back at Leopold
Carlson
(racing from the room) Give me a minute
Shit
- '  - , a radiant workaholic, types frenetically into the computer while talking on the phone, trying hard not to sound upset
Who's upset
People fall in love, they have to climb back out
(she laughs but she is not smiling) So, what
We'll just be friends now, Right
She stops typing and listens for a while
She runs her hand through her hair
see
Well  appreciate your honesty
(using her middle finger she pushes up her glasses) No
'll just think of this as surviving another dating accident
Take care or good luck or whatever 'm supposed to
The line goes dead
say
Goodbye
Dr
Plodder bursts in
Kate sees his distress and instantly becomes very centered
She's back
(rising) That's impossible
She wasn't supposed to return until
Kate
It's Carlson
Something went wrong
He hands her Carlson's note pad
Slowly, she sits down
The 7th Duke
- (all business, reading from a printout) of Albany
He was the
the son of Emery and Eliza
He was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn of the century without a trace
It was a sensation
In the 30's they even made a movie about him
"The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald Coleman
(absently) love Ronald Coleman
Despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation, a body was never found
He was never heard from again
Until now
There is a stunned silence
They stare at Leopold in awe
We've altered the course of history
We never should have started this
Calm down
What are we going to do
We can't keep him here
Imagine if anyone found out
Think
Just, think
Rationally
Now, no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible
So
We fix this
We keep this to ourselves and we fix it
Fast
They all nod in agreement
Dr
Kau, research all our data
1st priority: Locate Carlson
Drake, determine the reciprocal correlation's connected to the 19th century
Work 24 hours a day if necessary
In the meantime
one of us will have to take charge of him
She forces back panic
Only the tremor in her voice gives her away
This is a major scientific opportunity
It doesn't get any better than this
Imagine
Researching the behavior, the physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago
Utilizing technology available to us today
He's a gold mine
He's a man, Kate
Not a guinea pig
And while he's here, he's ours
Any volunteers
No one moves
We'll draw names
Whoever is is picked will be responsible
Agreed
They nod reluctantly
Drake writes out names and throws them in a cup
The silence becomes deafening
Finally: 'll do it
All the scientists face her
You'll look after him
No,  meant 'll pick the name
She reaches in
They wait with mounting suspense
Finally The scientists follow her gaze
beat
Fine
Leopold stirs
He blinks at the group
Where
What has happened
The doctors, caught off guard,
They surround Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin
Finally: Your Grace
Um
Hello
Weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge research team
project funded by the government of the United States
(regarding their appearance with distaste) Oh
Americans
see
Yes, um
For the past six and a half years we've been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space
Yes, uh
Quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing Tachyons
particles traveling faster than the speed of light, which allowed us to
fold time so to speak
Yes
Bend it between the cracks of the dimensions
Yes
They all laugh nervously
Leopold does not
Now, while that wasn't the original purpose of our experiment, we opted to pursue it, well, privately, on our own
Borrowing funds already provided
We journeyed to your time because it was the quickest path to follow
We debated long and hard whether we should use this knowledge at all
Believe me, it was never our intent to disturb the past
Merely to discover if the expedition were possible
As your presence here confirms
we are very disturbed
Leopold nods at them as if they are insane
The problem facing us is not only to get you back, but , you see
We certainly don't want to miscalculate
Send you to a different era entirely
Leopold starts to speak
Rest assured, no harm will come to you
You'll be well looked after by Dr
Coles
Dr
Coles
do not follow
What do you mean, get me back home
Where am
Awkward pause
Leopold looks carefully around the room for the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting
The doctors are silent
Answer me
(slowly) Would you have me believe
am being detained, at present in the The time to come
(carefully) It is the year nineteen hundred and ninety-five
19
Leopold leaps up
The doctors follow him around the room
You're insane
All of you
This is impossible
Leopold, calm down
voyage through time
What do you take me for
Did you bring me here by force
We're scientist, not seditionists
(truly panicked) Let me out of here
won't stand for this another moment
He's out the door
- Leopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit hallway, the doctors close behind
Leopold, wait
You don't know what you're doing
Just listen to what we have to say
It is too late
Leopold throws open the door and runs upstairs
- Blinding sunlight
Skyscrapers
Automobiles
Traffic lights
Road construction
Modern day pedestrians
Helicopters
Car alarms
Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all in
19
The doctors reach him
He collapses to the ground
: - Kate and Dr
Kau talk quietly
Leopold, tightly holding onto his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter disbelief
Squab
Squab
remember reading they ate a lot of squab
Squab
Do you have a squab
(quietly
On the verge of panic) don't know
Pull yourself together
(turning to Leopold) Are you all right back there
Leopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds, magnified
Perspiration runs down the side of his face
Kate watches him in her rear view mirror
You're going to be fine you know
There's nothing to worry about have everything under control
Dr
Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence
(quietly to Dr
Kau) We'll never get away with this
- Leopold awakens alone in his room
He sits up with a jolt
His stomach sinks as he realizes
He slowly rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe
He makes his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob
There is a  on the door
Leopold  back and runs to the bed: The picture of dignity
How are you feeling
(no response) thought you might like some tea
insist on being returned home immediately
understand
We're doing our best
wish to speak with your employer, Dr
Coles
You're speaking to him
You are not suggesting that you are Dr
Coles
She smiles
Miss
uh
Dr
Coles
If you like, you could call me Miss Dr
Coles or if that's too much, how about just plain Kate
(coldly) of science
Hard to believe
But a woman's brain cannot obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind
(jotting this down) Interesting
Nevertheless, we've come a long way baby
(confused) Are you attempting to be humorous
'm attempting to be informative it's just coming out humorous
Leopold regards her dubiously
(clinically) Look, modern social science clearly states that a woman's place in society marks the level of that civilization
science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a
a
waitress
Cream and sugar
Young lady,
Surely it is not expected that  remain here with you indefinitely
Unchaperoned
(pen poised) Does that make you nervous
Certainly not
(writing) Then what are you getting so red about
It's a very large apartment
with locks on all the doors
The idea
My dear Miss Coles
Dr
Coles
Honey
(she puts the pad down) Let's get one thing straight right now
My name is Kate or Katherine or if you insist Dr
Coles
(she rises) Take a good long look, Leopold
am a 20th century American woman with a Doctorate and a commission and independence
am not your "young lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your "honey
" Is that clear
Leopold watches her with great interest
Finally: Honey
For the tea
'll get it for you
Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room
- Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard searching for the honey
Finally, she spots the honeybear and squeezes honey     into the tea
She tries posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the toaster
- Kate returns "confidently" with the tea and a plastic smile
Thank you
Has it been decided what it is  am to do while  am being held here
Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, a little light housework
Leopold doesn't react
(clearing her throat) took the liberty of preparing a simple schedule to efficiently utilize your time while incorporating you into my routine
(she hands him a schedule) As you can see, my day begins with meditation and yoga from 6:30 to 7:00
She moves in close to him, making Leopold uncomfortable
will arise at 6:45, shower and change and at 7:15, we breakfast together
7:45 we begin the days work
At 10:45 Dr
Kau arrives to observe you in your natural routine as  research the data that will enable you to return home
At 1:15 we lunch together
2:15 you answer a daily questionnaire,  type up my notes
At precisely 6:15 you will enjoy 15 minutes of  , then, at 6:30,  listen to Tom Brokaw while making dinner as  write down any questions that come up during your day
At 7:00, we dine together
If you need me at any time you may ring this bell
She rings a tiny dinner bell
He is about to speak
Now, Mondays and Wednesdays  have computer science class, Tuesdays have therapy
have a date, 'm usually home by 9:15
During these periods you may read any of the books 've picked out for you in your room
organize my next days work at 10:30, 11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 'm in bed
(she takes a breath, smiles at him) Next day we begin again
Simple
(after a beat, with great dignity) At what time shall   and
Kate is forced into a stunned silence
' Kate
'm home
Oh
Yes
Our chaperone is here
Your father
Sort of
My brother
Visiting
For the past two years
Charlie can never know about this project
We'll tell him you are a
overly distinguished colleague staying here as our guest
From Canada
Which would explain your lack of familiarity with our customs and so forth (aghast) Make yourself comfortable
'll check in on you later
think this is going very well, don't you
Leopold looks at her blankly
Okay
If you need anything, just ring
Kate tinkles the bell, fumbles for the knob and heads out
still on Leopold
(
) (shouting) Charlie
Leopold reacts
(
) (screaming just as loud) What
(still shouting) Come here  wanna talk to you
Leopold listens at the door
He slowly opens it, takes two steps out, peers around the corner, then quickly steps back in
He takes a    and slowly deflates
'  - Charlie sits on the couch smoking a cigarette surrounded by his paintings
He is a likable twentysomething with a big mouth
What did  do
(removing his coffee from the table, setting it on a coaster) And what did  say about you smoking in the house
You were against it
Correct
You're back early
(She takes away his cigarette) Hey
Are you all right
You look funny
Funny ha ha or funny odd
Both
That all depends
How was your trip
Why
If it was good 'll tell you the truth
If it was rotten 'll have to butter you up first
Butter me up
Have you been working out
No, 'm really starting to see results
Are you comfortable there on the couch
Very
Good
Cause you'll be sleeping there the next few nights
Kate
You have to be out of here by 8 and you can't be back before 6
We have an important man working with us with very unusual needs
The company is insisting he stay here
What about a hotel
This man requires around the clock attention
meant for me
Thank you, Charlie
(she kisses his forehead) owe you one
You owe me nine
What am  supposed to do all day
(as if having an epiphany) You could get a job
Kate, the entire point of being an artist is that  don't have to work
Who is this guy
Well,  can't tell you much because
'm not allowed to discuss what goes on at the office
Well 'm not
Anyway, it might be interesting to have someone else to talk to
It gets so quiet around here sometimes  feel like 've gone deaf
Does he have a label
Leopold
Is he anything like his name
He's exactly like his name
Then you owe me ten
- Leopold  around the entrance to the living room
Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright fashionable furniture
Leopold recoils
His eyes come to rest on the television set
The   buttons loom large
He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button Instantly,  and   loudly berate each other before an excited crowd
Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of him as if shooing away a bee
He quickly, yet cautiously, slams the power
Horrible
He quickly scurries out the hallway
He stops abruptly
He remains very still
Composing himself, he turns and deliberately faces the room
After a moment, he purposefully steps back inside
He makes a large  around the television set, is confronted by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an  around that
He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it
As he does, track lighting  the room
He looks at the lights then back at the switch
He flicks the lights  and , trying to figure out the precise moment in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself
Kate and Charlie enter
They watch Leopold flicking the lights, laughing like a madman
Charlie gives Kate a look
(explaining) He's from Canada
- Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie banished to either side
Leopold chews his dinner incessantly
(finally) What is this
It's called Hamburger Helper
It is beyond help
Please serve the next course
He pushes his plate away
'm afraid there is no next course
If you make a list of the foods you like, 'll pick them up at the store for you
Is all food here this
textured
Mine's good
Please understand,  am used to a different sort of preparation
Where come from a proper meal is the result of reflection and study recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation
Charlie gives Kate a look
Several courses are served
Menus are often prepared days in advance, timed to perfection
It is said, without the culinary art, the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable
In Canada
(after a beat
Firmly) In Canada
We have a saying here
"Shake and shake the catsup bottle, none will come and then a lot'll
" He pours catsup on his dinner
How interesting
Since you're such an expert on fine cuisine, why don't you make dinner tomorrow night
It should be obvious to you that am  a domestic
You may take my plate
have my own, thank you
Charlie
Who died and made me Cinderella
Young man, there is a distinct impertinence to your voice
It's part of my charm
Suppress it
(changing the subject) Leopold
Since you're our guest here, there are several cultural events you might enjoy seeing
Charlie has season tickets to the ball game
Perhaps you'd like to take that in
What is it
What is it
Or the Opera or the Ballet
What is it
Charlie, there's no rule that says everyone has to be interested in baseball
No, but  believe there is a rule that says everyone has to have of it
Dr
Coles, your brother Charles attitude and demeanor are unacceptable
If  am to stay on here you must have a serious talk with him regarding respect and civility
, could you help me with the dessert in the kitchen
In the kitchen
the kitchen
Excuse us
Kate and Charlie leave
The camera remains on Leopold, sitting alone, calmly sipping his wine
: don't believe this guy
Try to be nice to him
'm always
Please Charlie, as a favor to me
He gives me the creeps
Leopold reacts
He listens self-consciously
He's different that's all
What was that crack about domestics
Charlie, this is important to me
You're not going out with him, are you
Eeuuu
may be desperate but 'm not a lost cause
Kate, this is me
've seen the guys you bring home
've done countless favors for you
Now 'm asking for just one little thing
(overlapping) Oh, all right
All right
All right
They emerge from the kitchen, beaming
(after a beat) We forgot the dessert
You know,
don't know if mentioned it
but that is one fine looking suit

Louis Armstrong begins to sing, "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off
" Dressed in yoga clothes Kate sits on her bed in the lotus position
She bangs the gong and closes her eyes
bell rings
Kate flinches but does not open her eyes
(too sweetly) What is it, Leopold
The bell rings louder, interrupting Kate's routine
(eyes closed, screaming like a fishwife) ,
Leopold's bell rings with determination
Kate is off the bed and out of the room
- Kate enters and stops short
Leopold sits at the table ringing a
The dishwasher is open and  , the blender has spread breakfast shake , water is on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every cupboard door is
Garbage disposal runs
(calmly amidst the chaos) cannot seem to find the tea
: Leopold's hand rings a bell with irritation
'  - Leopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open closet
Leopold selects clothes from Charlie's wardrobe
No
No
No
Good God, no
Perhaps
He tosses them aside carelessly as Charlie seethes
: Leopold rings his bell
- Kate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom
Kate checks her schedule and bangs on the door
Leopold, your time is up
What's he got, a girl in there
- Leopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a "Whitecap" marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water
He picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder
It
: Leopold rings his bell
Nothing happens
He discovers the clapper has been stolen
'  - Kate types, talks and researches simultaneously
She looks up and stops suddenly
Leopold appears wearing  oddly assorted layers of Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap, bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick
He poses foppishly
should like to read about modern currency during my bath tonight
See that the tub and basin are scrubbed up
Remnants remain of this afternoons shave
Kate nods at him stupefied
Due to the many layers of clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing skis
- Leopold rings a
No one responds
'  -  () He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book
Each are wearing a walkman
He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously until they look up
- Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian customs
They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other
beat
Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles papers
They look up again
Then down
Then get back to work
'  - Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman
She glances up, laughs out loud
She looks at the dark empty room
No one is there to share it with
Closing her computer, she holds her pillow close to her
She slowly moves to the window and looks out
'  - text book with Leopold's picture inside
Leopold reads the brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment
He moves to the window and looks out
- Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows
The camera slowly pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city
'  - Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room
In our last session you intimated there was a symmetrical system regulating the social order of conformity spanning your era
found this particularly intriguing If can just find it in my notes
fire engine races by
Leopold dashes to the window then turns back, excited
The fire brigade
Kate stares at him blankly
She munches   and drinks water

She returns to her notes
This is insufferable
refuse to be spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled about any longer
have yet to venture outside this cell
Before go mad a more suitable arrangement must be found
Found it

No  meant  found my notes
Dr
Coles
Changes are in order
can hear you
(under control now) Miss Coles, as we are to remain here together, there are certain conditions insist are met and maintained no longer wish to be peeped at, mocked
never
(calmly) Or interrupted
Jot this down
Breakfast at 12
Luncheon at 4
Diner at 8
horse should be made available from 1 to 3
horse
In New York City
Yes
Also,  feel very strongly about your style of dress
do not care for it
(Kate looks up) cannot believe it is the prevailing taste for women to appear masculine and unkempt
If this is the fashion, have it altered
Kate rises
That is all for the present
He grandly hands her a napkin
, my dear
(infuriated) Thank you
Brushing herself off, she heads to the door
Dr
Coles
have been acquainted with many women in my time, yet  am compelled to say that the modern woman is by far the least attractive have ever encountered
(rising to the occasion) And  have a news flash of my own
Leopold waits
You sir, are no Ronald Coleman
She storms out
- Dr
Drake enters Dr
Kau's office with two pints of Haagen Dazs
Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Swirl or Peach
Peach
They dig in
Any luck
Yea
Lots of luck
All bad
No information exists detailing what happened to Carlson
've been working for weeks and 'm not any closer than when  began
How are you doing
My cholesterol level is up 70 points
Kate enters, exhausted, deposits an armful of papers on Dr
Drake's desk
Kate has pencils tucked behind her ear, through her hair, and in her mouth
Thank you, Kate
How're you managing with Leopold
Fine
Fine
Why
What did you hear
Nothing
was just asking
Oh
Well, it's fine
He's a delight
Everything's under control
Keep up the good work
(after she's gone) She seemed a little scattered
Do you think everything's all right
Katherine Coles is the most capable person we have on this project
If anyone can handle the delicacy of this situation, Kate can
So there's nothing to worry about
Absolutely not
'  - (Charlie shrugs) Charlie we've got to find him
(working on a portrait of Kate at her computer) Are you crazy
This is the first time all week my eyes aren't darting to the top of my sockets every five minutes
When did he leave
don't know
An hour ago
He said he wanted to take a walk
And you let him
He's not allowed to go outside
Is he being punished
We've got to find him
You stay here in case he finds his way back
And while you wait you'd better pray he's all right
If anything happens to him, anything at all, we've worked for will have been destroyed
She heads out the door
Charlie follows
- Kate, calm down
And ' be responsible
Understand
(she grabs her coat and purse) What's the big deal
Who is this guy
Kate takes a  pause
Leopold
is not really from Canada
'   - Peaceful
The sun sets
Pigeons rest on window sills
Suddenly: (
) The pigeons take flight
- Leopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost
Looking both ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street brakes,  horns,  shouts with Leopold, horrified, caught in the middle
He makes it across shaking and dazed
motorist pulls along side of him
You stupid fucking son of a bitch
Next time 'll hit ya
Fucking moron
Leopold , appalled
Hansom carriage slowly treads into Central Park
Leopold watches until it disappears
'
- Kate drives slowly, searching for Leopold
Cars honk with mounting anger
What're ya waiting for lady
An invitation
'm sorry
'm sorry
She continues searching, trying hard to remain calm
- Huge buildings
Neon lights flashing
Garbage in bundles
Calvin Klein Ads
In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies
He enters a deli
- Leopold, appalled by the prices searches for money
He has none
(to the counter man) $7
95 for a sandwich
Is that correct
You gotta problem with that
It seems rather pricey to me
So don't buy one
shan't
So shan't
He moves on
Yes,
would be happy to sample one however 'm afraid  haven't the finance with me just now
If  could establish a credit with you,  will have someone come round with the funds tomorrow
You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today, is that it
(a little confused) believe so
Yes
Get the fuck outta here
beg your pardon
Get out
Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off
May  remind you, merchant, that am the customer in this establishment and as such require your attention and the utmost respect
do not accept this modern convention of desecrating one's patrons with such contemptuous disregard
You tell him
Need  add that without our patronage you would not own that unwashed counter behind which you spew your filthy mouth
Where do you get off
You don't even have any money
Don't be irrelevant
'm browsing
Not in my store you're not
He comes out from behind the counter
He's big
(very superior) Do you intend to physically escort me out
- Leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street
Did you see what he did
Did you see that
No one responds
Leopold is left sprawled on the street
Thunder is heard
- Gargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery, Alphabet City
- 4
Pouring rain
Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten and drenched
car drives by, screeches to a stop, and hastily backs up along side Leopold
Leopold
Leopold, get in
Leopold stares at the car
Kate runs out, opens the door and helps him in
She dashes back into the drivers seat
- 4
(nearly in tears, trying to dry him off) Leopold
Oh, Leopold thank God you're all right
didn't think 'd ever find you
You had us all so worried
Oh, Leopold
She hits him hard
Don't you ever go out again without my permission, do you hear me
was frantic
You could have been killed a hundred times over
never would have known
She rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted
She pulls herself together and looks at him
Leopold, are you all right
(looking deep into her eyes for the first time) wish to go home
Okay
'll get you home in a jiffy
(badly shaken) No
wish to go home
Kate gently observes Leopold who stares rigidly straight ahead
- (on the phone) don't know
It's just Leopold
Like Cher
Or Goofy
Kate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted
Never mind they just walked in
Jesus
You look horrible
Charlie, don't start
haven't been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year
If you make a wisecrack 'm going to burst into flame
It wasn't a wisecrack
You do look horrible
'm too tired for this now
'll just save it up and kill you tomorrow
Help Leopold out of his things and lets get him to bed
've something to say
To the both of you
Nothing is what it seems
After witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent  am outside of my acquaintance
don't know how to proceed
frankly
am in need of assistance
'm sorry
'm not very good at this
In the event you have missed it,  am apologizing
There is a long pause
About time
(he shakes Leopold's hand reluctantly) Welcome back
(he leaves) Don't mind him
His heart would be in the right place if he had a heart
Surliness runs in my family
understand
It practically races through mine
(shocked) Leopold, you made a joke
mean one that's not at my expense
That's good
They look at each other just a second too long
We'd better get to bed
That is
Yes
start work
(she looks at her watch) in three and a half hours
Oh, dear
They self-consciously head to their respective rooms
It's fine
'm used to it
You mustn't get too used to it
You'll find life passes you by awfully quickly
Kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and is moved
She catches herself quickly however
Thank you for
(waving it away) Oh
They stand at their bedroom doors
Well, goodnight then
Leopold
don't have a clear handle on this
Perhaps  was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time
don't know when you'll be able return home
Tomorrow 'll start preparing you for the outside world
And
We'll find your way back
promise
Leopold smiles, still shaken
beat
They slowly close the doors to their respective rooms
- Leopold, dressed for an outing knocks on Kate's bedroom door
(
) Yes
Leopold enters
Kate stands in a slip calmly looking at Leopold
Leopold immediately turns, facing the door
Oh
beg your pardon
, , , was merely
didn't
Is there something you want, Leopold
merely wanted to see
that is, inquire, on your availability, for an outing
My assimilation and so forth
Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of us
'll be out in a minute
Yes, of course
Splendid
He reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob
He finally finds it and goes out
Kate smiles
: - the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue
5TH  - Kate and Leopold exit The Gap
Leopold awkwardly wears hip Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head
Are you certain this is correct
Kate places the cap backwards on his head
She nods approvingly
Certainly 'm certain
Leopold watches himself in store windows
He ' comprehend it
Kate leads him into Barney's
' - Leopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit
He looks
fact that is not lost on Kate
Now really
Isn't this better
Kate nods back begrudgingly, her breath taken away
- Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes
- Kate selects a shopping cart, begins to push it
Allow me
Kate walks ahead
Leopold, maneuvering a cart with a broken wheel, hasn't the knack and bangs into everyone and everything in the aisle
Sorry
Oops
Careful there
So sorry
: : Leopold scrutinizing vegetables in cans, cereals for kids, bottled water, instant soup, feminine hygiene supplies
: The check out line
As their groceries are being rung up, Leopold spots The Sun, a newspaper with the headline: Woman Sees Satan in her Microwave Oven
Leopold eagerly shows Kate
Have you seen today's paper
Put it back
But
Back
Leopold reads the paper totally enthralled
- Kate and Leopold walk down the street, a bag in each arm
Leopold eyes Kate suspiciously
Dr
Coles, why is it you are not married
Women are longer defined by the men they're married to, Leopold
have a career
haven't found a man who fits in with that yet
Yet people still marry
(defensively) 've heard of cases
They continue to walk, Leopold noticeably studies Kate
Finally: suspect there is something wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with me
Perhaps it is the way you present yourself
don't know what you're talking about
There is some sort of problem when a woman reaches thirty and insists on remaining single
You think 'm
What
Do  look  to you
It was an arbitrary number
You chose it specifically opposed to a lower number
didn't mean it
Thirty
apologize
How old are you
(sharply) 'm thirty
But you're the first person whoever told me  looked it
'm sorry
Leopold spots a formal dress in a store window
He takes a good long look at Kate, smiles, then quickly walks inside
Kate continues down the block
And it's not that  insist on remaining single
Believe me
Everyone dreams of finding somebody to share their life with
To give someone all the love they've been hoarding since they were a kid
'm no different
But one has to be sensible
have a career and a life that's filled with
She looks around
Leopold is gone
Not again
She starts off down the street, stops, and enters ', an upscale boutique
' - Kate races in
Leopold talks with a saleslady
What do  have to do
Put a leash around your neck
(to the saleslady) She is the woman to whom  was referring
You see the problem
(giving Kate the once over) Yep
(staring down at her clothes then back at the two of them) What
What
' - From behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others with irritation
This is ridiculous
don't have time to
(she shrieks) Do you know what this dress costs
Let's get this over with
'm coming out
Nobody laugh
Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff that she is
Satisfied
Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure
What
She turns and looks at herself in the mirror
Leopold stands behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs
You have a lovely face
Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely
She stares at herself for a long while
(quietly) We'll take the dress
They become aware of their close proximity
They nervously part
- Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa
She turns on the  and hands him the remote control
What is this
The drug of the 20th century
She aims the remote at the , changing channels
He's spellbound
- Dinner is served
Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits on the sofa watching the
Leopold, your dinner's getting cold
'm coming
He does not move a muscle
- Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and watching
On the screen, a Looney Tune
Leopold enjoys this especially
Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it
(making notes) It's a guy thing
- Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control
Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold
She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to capture a better look at his face
After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand and sits down at her computer
She opens her notes and types
Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop
She looks up at Leopold lost in thought
She smiles
Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to the floor
In a  frame, Kate and  drunkenly mug for the camera
Kate pales noticeably
She looks from the picture to Leopold
Slowly, she begins pecking away at the keys
She does not look up again
- Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr
Drakes area
Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr
Drake searches for solutions
Now within that astronomical structure, Dr
Drake here is searching for a pathway between your time and the present
He'll find it too if his arteries don't harden first
Astounding
Once that is discovered, the search begins for the exact time and date travel will be possible
They move to Dr
Kau's area
(to Dr
Kau) How are you proceeding
Dr
Kau merely grunts
Leopold looks at Kate
Don't take it personally
Once Dr
Kau starts working, you just have to wait until her batteries run down
We're all pretty much like that
They head into Kate's office
'  - Kate gathers her belongings, Leopold snoops at her notes
The complexity of this equation is astonishing
Can you really comprehend all that
(simply
Almost apologetically) 'm a genius
You're quite exceptional Dr
Coles
(a beat) That is to say, you all are
Thank you
And may  say that sometimes, in  light, you're not so bad yourself
They stand together, Leopold grinning sheepishly
Oh my God
Is that the time
'm late
Therapy
Every Tuesday night
May  accompany you
You mayn't
am not certain  understand therapy
No one does
That's why therapists can charge so much
As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high heeled red shoe in Kate's bag
What exactly transpires during therapy
Leopold
gentleman does not ask those questions
Come on, we'll get you home
am perfectly able to travel homeward myself
Kate looks at him skeptically
Really
have finance and our address
shall take a cabbie
Kate hesitates
You are late
insist
am  a child
Dr
Coles
All right
Don't bite my head off
She shakes her head and walks out the door
- Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station
few feet behind, Leopold cautiously follows
- Kate waits in line at the turnstile
Leopold, a ways back, grimaces noticeably at the smell
Kate heads through
Leopold follows banging painfully into the bar
hurriedly bumps into him from behind
He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge
He turns around to step out of line but it is already too long
He stands to  with the nun
can't seem to
(impatiently) Oh, for heaven's sake
The nun deposits her token and  them both through as the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold
He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in the nick of time
The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly against the glass
- Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray Dance Studio
Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a distance
- Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on the right, women on the left
Kate, in dance clothes, out of breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side
was worried
thought you weren't going to make it
(smiling happily) Miss my lesson
This is the only thing  have to look forward to all week
Is that a new dress Mrs
Pincus
Mrs
Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her purchase
Across the room,
Pincus beams in anticipation
An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters
She claps her hands together loudly
All right, kids
Pair up
The men slick back their hair
The women straighten their gowns
Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying the floor
The men take their places on the dance floor
They flick their hand twice, inviting their women to dance
Cooly, elegantly, the women approach their partners
After a while Kate looks up, relieved
She stands alone
Ballroom music plays
The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns
Kate dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated look spread across her face
The instructor approaches with a look of resignation
Don't think so much, Katie
the music
(sweating) am
Dancing should not be work
It should be a vacation the body takes from the mind
Let the music wash over you
(frustrated) It is
Repeat after me: 've got the muusic in me
've got the muusic in me
& (overlapping) 've got the muusic in me
Keep telling yourself that
Kate does
Her instructor shakes her head and moves away
Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved
'
-- Over the music, beyond the swirling couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, muttering to herself, dancing alone
- Dr
Kau  a large book on Dr
Plodder's desk startling him
've located her
You didn't
Is she all right
No
She's really not
Photograph of a  1896
The conditions are
Positioned among the workers, Julia Carlson, thin, ragged, worn out, stares helplessly into the camera
It was taken a year after she arrived
Look at her face
We have to get her back
Christine, this morning  spoke with the head of funding
They're talking about canceling the project
What
They can't do that
There's still time
Nothing has happened yet that can't be undone
We'll get her back
We'll put this behind us and we'll get her back
The doctors stare at the photograph
Powerless
: '  - Charlie and Leopold work at their easels
Leopold sighs Is there something on your mind
There is a pause
This is rather difficult for me
Uh huh
have been in the salon contemplating the reception  have received by the various tradesmen  have visited
've determined  am lacking the dexterity of modern intercourse
Of what
Social skills
Oh
realize our association has been rather distant and  bear you no ill will
You can imagine my relief
The fact is
need help
Why not ask Kate
would appreciate the masculine point of view
Why not ask Kate
That was a joke
Leopold looks worried
Charlie puts down his brush
Well
Let's see
guess we could start by removing that great big stick from up your
Let's start with your walk
My walk
You don't walk right
(gently) You strut
(very defensive) Strut strut strut
You walk into the bathroom it's like 'm watching a parade
Walk across the room
will not
know you won't
You'll
You asked for my help
Trust me on this
As Leopold struts across the room Charlie shakes his head and spontaneously begins to hum Sousa's Stars and Stripes March
Leopold becomes more and more agitated
As the song crescendos: That's enough
Really
You walk
Charlie hops up, casually walks around the room and begins to hum a more relaxed version of Stars and Stripes
(between choruses) See
Easy
Relaxed
You try
Leopold begins humming the more casual version of the song and mimics Charlie
That's better
Now, try to enjoy your walk
It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining, the peasants are singing
- : Charlie and Leopold joyously singing The Stars and Stripes
As the song builds: Charlie enters leading Leopold throughout the room
Leopold matches Charlie  step by step so tightly they appear to be one person marching happily about
: - Chinatown, Little Italy, chess in Washington Square Park
- Leopold and Charlie explore the city
Leopold works diligently on his walk
beautiful woman walks by in a revealing outfit
Charlie catches Leopold watching her and smiles broadly
Interesting
Leopold, caught leering, turns away sheepishly and smiles
Charlie pats Leopold on the back
Stops
Pats his back again
What the hell is that
What
Leopold, are you wearing a corset
Naturally
Cracking up, Charlie good-naturedly puts an arm around Leopold's shoulder
Leopold attempts the same pulls away
- With a headset on, Charlie listens to music
Leopold watches
What'd ya say was the name of this number
Tchaikovsky
Waltz of the Flowers
(deadpan) Pretty
Charlie stops the music and places a headset over Leopold's ears
Leopold watches calmly
Charlie selects a song
Instantly, Leopold's shoulders rise up to his ears
His mouth opens wide
Megadeath
High Speed Dirt
After a bit, Charlie turns the music off
Leopold's shoulders go down but his mouth stays wide open
Astonished
- Charlie and Leopold walk through the park
rubber softball hits Leopold squarely on the head
What in the world
couple race over
The man is
The woman is
Their child, , 7, follows wide eyed and apprehensive
Sorry
We're so sorry
Are you hurt
She's another Babe Ruth
We had no idea
Are you okay
Leopold regards them curiously
What do you have to say for yourself, Elizabeth
'm sorry
Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene
He doesn't speak
After a long moment: Is this your child
Yes
Charlie braces for the worst
The little girl stares at Leopold
see
'mon honey, lets go
want my ball
Just a moment
(bending down to Elizabeth, firmly) Pick a hand
She picks his right hand
Nothing
She picks his left
Nothing
Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from his ear
She takes the ball and smiles at him
My mother's name was Elizabeth
(then to her parents) She's a beautiful child
You're very lucky
What do you say, Elizabeth
Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face
Thank you
Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost in thought
Charlie watches him in surprise
They walk on
- Leopold talks animatedly
On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies
understand pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies
But  wish someone would explain Eskimo pies
He eats a large spoonful of pudding
Kate and Charlie exchange a worried look
You smoke Camel's, you wear Old Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew
It's revolting
(to Kate) The pudding tonight is excellent
Another thing 've noticed, everyone is in a great rush today
Instant Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, Minute Maid
You'll find there's much to be said for moderation and languor
He eats another spoonful
Mmmm
Is it tapioca
It's margarine
(taking the spoon out of his mouth) It's marvelous
Well, 'm off
Me too
Work to do
Where are you going
'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine
It's this coffee house we go to
Say hello to Dennis for me
Who is that
Dennis is this really good looking friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's alive because  doesn't know how to flirt
As a rule  don't like to associate with really good looking people
It makes me feel really
don't know
Smart
But Dennis is a nice guy
And he always picks up the check
Sounds enjoyable
shall join you
What
That's a wonderful idea
Leopold mentioned how he wanted to meet
People of quality was it
Ahhhhh
If you'd rather  didn't go
Nonsense
Charlie, you don't want to hurt Leopold's feelings
He's going to think you don't want him to go
Oh it's not that
It's just that it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all
'm not sure you'd have such a good time
little ribald humor
'm not as big a stick in the mud as you might think
'd enjoy a gay night out, kicking up my heels
There is an awkward pause
Leopold is so enthusiastic and sincere that despite a feeling of disaster Charlie relents
Finish off your Parquet and we'll go
Charlie gives Kate a look of death as we: : - Charlie and Leopold approach Caffeine, a trendy coffee house
Charlie looks in the window
There they all are
Now one more thing
Throw the words "like" and "you know" into a sentence whenever possible
It's how people talk today
Proper speech does not cease to exist simply because it is ignored
Please
Charles, you needn't fret
have the walk down pat
will not give myself away
Like
(looking in the window) Oh shit
(correcting himself) Shoot
What is it
Patrice
See that girl
The blonde one
She's so inconceivably hot
- Patrice, a tall blonde sits at a large round table, talking
She is very beautiful
- She's very pretty
She's mine
Congratulations
Ok not exactly mine
But  saw her first
understand
Okay
guess we should go in don't suppose we could tell everyone you don't speak English
Of course not
Let's go inside
Leopold walks his casual walk inside, followed by a very reluctant Charlie
- Charlie's friends are sitting at a table talking
They are a relaxed and friendly group
Charlie and Leopold approach
(ad lib greetings) Charlie
Where've you been
etc
Hi
Uh everyone, this is my friend, Leo
Hey
Hey
Waz up
Waz up
How are ya
How are ya
(after a beat) Leo's staying with us for a while
Charlie pulls out a chair for Leopold but Leopold sits next to Patrice instead
Patrice takes out her cigarettes
May
Help yourself
Leopold takes a cigarette, lights one for Patrice, then his own
Thank you, my dear
(at a loss) Um
(all look at Charlie) have nothing to say
You did not tell the truth about Patrice, Charles
What did  tell you,
He informed me you were inconceivably , but  think you're lovely
Exceptionally lovely
Thank you, Leo
(to the waitress) Check please
- The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City
Despite the fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the same bench
Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at Leopold
The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word
Just drop it Leopold
But Charles, it is so ridiculous am not interested in her
Hah
In any case the problem is not with me but with you
(quietly) You have no idea what it takes to go about courting a woman
From what 've witnessed tonight, it is symptomatic of your entire generation
(almost speechless) You are some piece of work, Leopold
Now  do not wish to get personal
Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old woman
She rolls her eyes
But you have been of great assistance to me and  feel this is one area where  can be of some real help
'm fascinated
Go on
Now, why was  successful with this young lady and why did you so miserably fail
What makes you think she likes you
Well she gave me the number of her telephone and  assumed it meant
Go on
As  see it, the girl hasn't an inkling of your intentions
And it's no wonder
You, Charles, are a Merry Andrew
what
Merry Andrew
am not
Everything plays like a farce to you
The more wit, the less courage
believe the modern woman desires passion, protection, sensitivity
No woman wants to be romanced by a buffoon
(the old woman shakes her head) Banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort of playfulness
You think  should pounce
'm saying you must treat her with respect
Any oaf can attempt a crude pass
woman of Kate's stature would never respond to an artificial tactic
Kate
What
You said Kate
did not
Yes you did
Didn't he say Kate
The old woman nods
We are discussing your problem
Not anymore
You like my sister
Charles
She has trouble with men, you know
Perhaps she has not met the right one
She has met the right one of times
But she pulls back
She cuts herself off
You turn around and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx
One never can tell
Does Kate know how you feel
No
Have you made your intentions known to her
No
Who's the Merry Andrew now
think you're all talk and no action
What are you waiting for
do not know if there is a future in it
Well Leopold, no one ever does
: '  - Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes
She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his closet
notebook falls from his pants pocket
She puts it on the bureau
beat
She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of the bed and starts to read
(reading out loud) Royal family -- Uncouth
Making Out -- slow soulful kissing
Woman as equals
She flips a page
Who drove the Chevy to the levy and why was it dry
Kate smiles
She flips the page
Eyes shine when she talks about
science
Raises her voice when she knows she's wrong
, , Lose my train of thought when see her smile
Most beautiful when she's angry
Honorable heart
Peasant feet
The front door is heard slamming
Kate, alarmed, stuffs the notebook back in Leopold's pocket
She races to the door; glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries from the room
- The corridor is darkly lit
Kate leaves the bathroom as Leopold enters
They collide and separate but remain close together
Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly
Ooops
Bread and butter
What's that
Bread and butter
It's an old saying
Well not to you  guess
You say it when you pass someone in a cramped space
As close as bread and butter
see
So
Did you have a good time last night
It was very interesting
Did you find that person of quality
Leopold looks at her a moment
Yes
did
Well
fine
(there is a pause) guess it's time to turn in
Yes
Goodnight
She reaches her door
Leopold stops her
Kate
She turns
Leopold grasps for the words but the habit of inaction returns
Goodnight
(he slowly closes the door) '   - Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting
He looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over
Charlie knocks
She opens the door
Hi
brought you some flowers
He hands her the flower filled painting
Charlie
Miss Wochuchowski
was wondering if you would do me the great honor of accompanying me to the cinema tonight
And allowing me the privilege of escorting you to dinner afterwards
Patrice shyly studies the painting
It's beautiful
Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly
He really does not want to say this next part
Leopold, however, is adamant
(deadpan) Gracing me with your conversation and company would mean the world to me
There is a long pause
Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief
Um
7:00
7:00 is fine
'll call for you then
They smile at each other for a long moment
(silently mouthing) Goodbye
Goodbye
(she closes the door) It worked
Of course it did
Leopold,
'm
have no idea what to do next
Charles
Leave everything to me
Not so fast, buddy
You're next
- Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time and space
Leopold enters
He is suddenly embarrassed and doesn't know how to proceed
Good morning
Good morning
You're up early
She moves to her computer on the other side of the room
Leopold follows
Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out her chair
She falls to the ground
He rushes to her side immediately
'm terribly sorry
Happens all the time
She opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her computer
There is a pause
Dr
Coles
ah, Kate
was wondering
She stops working and looks at Leopold
What it is you're working on
Oh
It's my computer
She resumes her work
see
Actually  meant the work itself
'm researching the correlations between your time and the present
Leopold stares blankly
'm  to get you home, Leopold
Oh
Charlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on
have never seen a woman work as diligently and extensively before
It's made me the man  am today
It's quite a beautiful day, have you noticed
Perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine Spring afternoon
Oh, 'd love to but  can't
've got too much work to do
Ask Charlie though
He'll go with you
'm afraid it really wouldn't be the same
It is  company  am seeking
Surprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold
(gently) Oh, Leopold
'm so sorry
can't
see
Some other time then
Yes
Thank you
Leopold sits at the far end of the room
Kate takes a moment then resumes typing
She  and sits back in her chair
After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with her foot and starts banging on the top of it
Oh for crying out loud
Would you look at this
Leopold
The computer's on the blink again
(she bangs harder) Cheap piece of equipment
can't
Maybe if you
, no, it does this all the time
Just have to wait it out
see
Darn
Perhaps it is a sign
Oh, you think
(she smiles at Leopold) - Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path
Kate follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown
must have gotten a funny horse
Leopold turns and rides around Kate
Allow me
- Bethesda fountain
Boats on Central Park Lake
Couples in Sheeps Meadow
Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse through the greenery of Central Park
-   - revival house
On the Marquee: "The Tenuous Duke" starring Ronald Coleman
- Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds,  & 's, and large drinks
The lights go down and the movie begins
The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once
He involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's shoulder, watching attentively
After a bit: Is that supposed to be my hair
Do you see how they think my hair looks
Kate looks over at Leopold and nods
Through his eyes, she too experiences movies for the first time
She moves close to him
- Grammercy Park, The Guggenheim Museum, Central Park Plaza, The Metropolitan Museum
- Kate and Leopold bound up the steps, entering the museum
- Modern art exhibit
Leopold stares blankly at an empty white canvas
He turns to Kate questioningly
That's simplicity in it's purest form
It speaks volumes in it's nothingness
Whiteness representing emptiness
Hopelessness
It's bleak
Bleak
Leopold eyes the painting skeptically
They move to the next object d'art
toilet
Aaand this represents
They burst into giddy laughter
Absolutely nothing
They round the corner, moving to the next room
Leopold's smile fades
:  painting of privileged Victorian society
Shaken, he gazes at a painting in a dream-like state
(very quietly) 'd almost forgotten how beautiful it was
Truly
Beautiful
Kate smiles sadly at Leopold
They slowly walk out
- We hear keys in the lock and laughter outside as Kate and Leopold enter
(laughing) & 's, ,
, ,
They collapse on the couch
Ah, , ,
don't know
Lang
don't know how you keep up with it
'm exhausted
So am
'll tell you what
Why don't prepare dinner tomorrow night never have before
mean even before hit town
"Hit town" How's that can't imagine what it'll taste like, but  don't think it will be any worse than your cooking
Leopold,  have a date tomorrow night
see
blind date
Oh, 'm so sorry
No, that just means  haven't met him before
It was set up through friends
Ah
hazard of single life
'm turning in
Kate gets up
Leopold automatically stands
Another time then
'm sorry
It's quite all right
As she gets to the door, she stops
Leopold
had a wonderful time today
can't remember the last time took the day off and just played
'd forgotten how beautiful this city can be
want to thank you for that
The pleasure was mine
Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out
- Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining room table
Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs into the bathroom in a
It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold
Are you sure you can teach me everything there is to know
(from the bathroom) Just don't swipe the silverware and give yourself away
Nobody's talking to you
It is very simple
will be your date
Just behave as you normally would and 'll correct you along the way
Now, escort me in
Charlie and Leopold move across the room
After a beat, Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first
Leopold gives his approval
Kate rushes out of the bathroom in a tight  dress
Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table
Charlie sits down, pleased
Leopold remains standing, incensed
Now what
Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head
Hard
Pull the chair for a lady
Clod
(
) No name calling
(to Kate) Well, really
Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair
As Leopold sits, Charlie pushes the chair in to hard
You're not shoveling coal into a furnace, Charles
Glide the chair in gently
Gently
Try it again
Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table
He remains standing, not sure what to do next
Well, sit down
Now don't burst a vein or anything, but there are quite a few knives and forks here
How do  know what each one's for
Merely start from the outside and work your way in
What kind of beer should  order
Beer
How do  look
Leopold and Charlie stand
Kate poses in the gown picked out by Leopold
Leopold smiles brightly
You look exquisite, Katherine
(almost sadly) Thank you, Leopold
She looks at Leopold not knowing what to say
Finally This is a tie 'm wearing
You look very nice, Charlie
Yes
know
The doorbell rings
That must be him
Your bland date
Blind date
Remember to breathe, Kate
And don't use to many big words
You'll scare the poor slob away
(moving to the door) This is always the scary part
(she sings) "Open the door to my, Mystery Date
" She opens the door and looks straight up
Leopold and Charlie peer in closer to get a better look
In the doorway stands , great looking, very tall, a winner
Hi
Kate
Larry
Kate turns back to the others with a frozen smile
Well, 'm off
(giving Larry the once over) Kate, may  have a word with you
Now
Yes
(as they cross the room) ' like the look of him
What are you talking about
Cad
can spot one a mile away
(he helps her with her coat) shall escort you out myself will act as your chaperone
That isn't necessary
'll be fine
It is no trouble
Goodnight, Leopold
But
Goodnight
She is gone
Leopold stares after her, dejected
- Kate and Larry are led to their table
Larry sits down
Kate remains standing
(friendly) Sit down
(sighs) Thank you
(she sits) So
How am  doing
beg your pardon
How am  doing
First date
You pleased
You disappointed
Undecided
see
He snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling Kate
She laughs nervously
So
What did Jeannie say about me
About you
Ah, she said you were tall
6'3
And nice looking
Thank you
Thank her
And that you persevere ardently on Wall Street
Well,  work there
(after a beat) That must be very interesting
(laughing) You've obviously never worked on Wall Street
(laughing along for the hell of it) No
Their laughter subsides
After a beat: What else did Jeannie say about me
- The Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie and Patrice to their seats
Charlie motions Patrice to go first just as Leopold has instructed
The Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair
Charlie gives him a look to back off
Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the table and takes his seat
Have  told you how much  liked your painting
(beaming) Twice
If you get tired of hearing about it, let me know
have to admit was sort of surprised when you called
didn't think you liked me, Charlie
When  first saw you,  thought
(he makes his jaw drop down to the floor) What do you think now
Charlie smiles and places her hand over his heart
Then he makes his jaw drop again
Patrice laughs happily
- Kate and Larry are eating their dinner
Aaand that's about all Jeannie said
What did Jeannie say about me
(smiling) She said you were enormously sexy, had a great body, but you don't put out
Quite a compelling portrait
(turning on the charm) Would you say it's an accurate portrait
(leaning into Larry) masterpiece
- Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room table
He moves to the window and looks out
After a while he pours a glass of wine
- As they eat their dinner Larry drones on
So this guy wants to invest $50,000 in a stock that's no good
Here's what  do
Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else
She looks down at the fork in her hand
She switches to the proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette
She notices her napkin lying flat on the table
She reaches for it
- Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap
He begins to eat his dinner
Slowly
Elegantly
Alone
- Kate places the napkin on her lap
She stares at it a long while
Finally she looks up at Larry
'm telling you the guy was a
total
(jarred awake) Who
Jeff Murray
The guy 've been talking about
Hello
(realizing her feelings for Leopold, smiling radiantly at Larry) Goodbye
Then as she leaves, a parting shot
Don't get up
- Sound of keys in the lock, then Kate bursts through the door
Leopold
The living room is dark and empty
She goes through the living room, past the hallway, into the bedroom
Leopold
His bedroom is empty
He is not there
Oh, Leopold
She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short
Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of Kate shines in the moonlight
She wears an antique dress
She is lovely
Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is touched
She turns and collides head on with Leopold
Oh
Bread and butter
He is wearing gloves and an apron
He rubs his bruised head, inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face
You're back early
Did you enjoy your date
(happily) No
She moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face
Here, you've got some
He wipes his face making it much worse
Is it gone
(laughing) No
She uses the apron to wipe away the soap
They gaze at each other and become serious
(softly) funny thing happened to me on my bland date this evening, Leopold really can't explain it
This puffed- up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn kept popping into my mind all night long at the most inopportune times
couldn't get rid of him
How inconsiderate
Yeah, it was
The harder  tried, the more persistent he became
He's conceited and inflated and unseasoned and it doesn't seem to matter
He's 134 years old but  can't get him out of my head
Is he there right now
Right here
Larger than life
'll protect you
They kiss
long romantic passionate kiss
Dr
Coles, would you grant me license to dine with you tomorrow evening at eight o'clock
Permission granted
Until tomorrow, then
They separate
beat
Leopold gestures for Kate to go first
They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms
- The table clock chimes eight times
Leopold enters from the kitchen dressed perfectly in the most    style
He carries a casserole dish
second later Kate enters from the hallway
She is wearing an  ,
She looks lovely
(a little startled) You look beautiful
do
What have you got there
Leopold opens the casserole dish
Hamburger Helper
know you like it
Kate smiles
She looks behind him into the kitchen Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair
This time she's prepared
He slides her chair to the table
, The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow throughout the apartment
Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" plays
Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine
Tell me more
Um, where was
So after my father died  had to go to work
Have you had many jobs
Many
got fired from all of them
'm the most unskilled person  know
But they were just survival jobs while  was still in school
always knew  wanted to go into science like my father
And  did
Do you miss him
think about him every day
He was courtly, just like you
think you are a remarkable woman Katherine Coles
You just don't get out much
You'd be surprised how remarkable 'm not
No, it is you who would be surprised
They kiss
Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes
They kiss again
Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door
They look at each other, deciding
Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door
Kate
Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips
Gently she leads him inside
They slowly embrace as the door closes
- Sunlight floods the room
Clothes are scattered about
Two figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed
One of the figures rolls around
The covers are pulled back revealing: Good morning
Morning
They kiss
: - Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee
The table is set for a huge breakfast
Kate also in a robe enters from the hallway
There is a moment of awkwardness as they see each other for the first time
Morning
Good morning
They kiss shyly
Kate notices the feast
Look what you've done
It's nothing
Nothing
My own mother never made me a breakfast like this
will have to have a talk with her
Leopold
Kate
About last night
Please sit down
He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her
Kate,  had never before been a considerate man
had, with astonishing complacency, squandered my life, waiting for some incentive to force me into action
You have made me see how rare our time here really is
am most beholden to you Kate
And always will be
sense the word "" entering into this any minute now
Leopold takes her hands in his
She looks at him defensively, bracing for worst
Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming my wife
Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream Shall  take that as a "yes"
Leopold
Did you just ask me to marry you
love you, Kate
That's entirely beside the point
You're moving way too fast here
Shouldn't we date first
mean it's obvious the first one went well
Where  come from that's pretty much the way it works
Leopold, even though last night we
loved each other, that doesn't mean this morning we're engaged
It just doesn't work that way now
(taking a ring off his fingers and placing it on hers) have loved you since  first set eyes on you
cannot imagine my life without you beside me
want to marry you, Kate and make an honest woman of you
Oh Leopold, sit down
They switch places
Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside him
Relationships these days are much more complicated than that
Women today have certain freedoms that men have been taking advantage of for centuries
You must have been aware of that
If you think about it clearly, it should be obvious to you that marriage between us is out of the question
Do you not love me Kate
(almost inaudible) Don't ever think that
Then consider my proposal
'll think it over but  can tell you now the answer is
He kisses her
It's impressive
(out of breath) Possibly
(a knowing smile) need you beside me
will not give up easily
(smiling) Do what you have to do
Charlie enters
Kate and Leopold become extremely selfconscious
Morning
(too casual and too chipper) Morning
Charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite right
He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the table
Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast
(to Kate) Coffee
Kate nods
As Leopold pours, they look at each other shyly
(after a pause) would like some coffee
Of course
Say when
She pours Charlie's coffee until it overflows
(deadpan) When
Sorry
As Kate wipes up the table, Charlie notices her ring
He eyes Leopold suspiciously
Leopold concentrates on his plate
Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance
She smiles at him, looking both innocent and guilty at the same time
After a beat: Uh huh
All smile privately and sip their coffee without another word
: - Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors in earnest
She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes in front of her
The coffee cup falls from her hand and breaks
(calling from her office) Kate, are you all right
Fine
'm fine
She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her mess
She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes
She has that will send Leopold back
She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window around the lab
Everyone is hard at work
Helplessly, she stares back at the paper on her desk
She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of Carlson
She stares at it for a long time
She opens her mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo
Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper
She returns the picture to the drawer
After a long moment, she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles away
'  - Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering
Kate clutches her pillow close to her
She looks over at Leopold concentrating on the  with furrowed brow
She smiles sadly
She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed
She snuggles up to Leopold
They watch
Together
- Central Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock Museum
- Leopold and Kate eat lunch
Leopold scans a newspaper
On the  over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun control
Public office is apparently still the last refuge for the incompetent
Show me a man who does not want his gun registered and 'll show you a man who should not own a gun
What is a pee-pee girl
What are you reading
The Village Voice
After much consideration,  have decided it is time  join the work force
As a pee-pee girl
Perhaps not that, but  am determined to acquire honest employment
Leopold,  don't know if that's such a good idea
Kate, my life back home was beneficial to no one
want my new life to have value
won't make the same mistakes twice
You have to be patient
could conceivably wait my whole life away
You're awfully cute when you get causey
will not waste any more time must make a difference
- Customers fill the aisles
In the center of it all, Leopold is hard at work
He holds a bottle of perfume
Try our fragrance
Would you like to try our new fragrance today
What is it
It is called,
He squirts some at her
Oh
don't think so
Have you got beg your pardon
Elizabeth Taylor's Passion
Next aisle over
She leaves
Leopold looks after her
(after a beat) Give your mother-in-law what she really deserves this season
Give her some
'   - The doctors enter Kate's office and closes the door
Hi
(the doctors remain silent) What's the matter
There is a long pause
Slowly Kate realizes the doctors are on to her
She puts down her pen
So you know
We had to go through your computer to access information
Your calculations have been verified and the final course has been set
Leopold goes back a week from Friday 1:17 a
m
How long were you going to keep it a secret, Kate
Were you even going to tell us at all
'm not sure
Not sure
What can you be thinking
You can't alter the course of history and assume everything will be okay
It won't be
He has his own destiny to fulfill in his own time
(quietly) You don't understand
(gently) He's going back, Kate
It's over
Kate nods
The doctors slowly leave the room and close the door
Just the sound of the clock ticking
Kate sits at her desk very still
No
No, no, no
'  - Charlie knocks and enters
There you are
've only been hollering for the last
He sees her face
Kate's eyes are red and swollen
She lays out Leopold's belongings
Kate
What is it
What happened
(very detached) It's time
Leopold's going back
Kate
Yup
'll get his things together
Tell him tonight
He goes to her
Are you all right
(pulling away) 'm fine
You don't look so fine
Well  am
It was wonderful having him here, Charlie
He was of invaluable assistance to the project
(she shrugs) 'll miss him
You'll miss him
will
Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy
Kate remains silent
Kate, don't do this
Please
It's not right
What am  supposed to , Charlie
can't go back
He can't stay can't let him go
'm not equipped to deal with this, Charlie
don't know how
Listen to me, Kate
Don't
Don't be the ice princess
(beginning to tear up) 'm not
You are
You can't live your whole life under a microscope
You've got to tell him how you feel
(breaking down in his arms) It's too much, Charlie
It's just too much
You owe it to him
didn't know  could feel like this
really didn't know
- So  looked him right in the eye and said, 'Ego is nature's compensation for mediocrity
'  turned and walked
He never said a word
He probably didn't understand it
Kate
(cold) What
Are you all right
You're awfully quiet
'm fine
How was your day
(taking a long pause) It's time
Leopold looks at her
We're sending you back
(slowly pushing his plate away) When
week from Friday, early morning
No
It was a mistake, Leopold
It's out of our hands
We can't  people from history like stolen jewels
We haven't the right
'm sorry
We'll miss you
Is that all
What do you want me to do, fall apart
You'd still be leaving
It wouldn't solve anything
Who is this woman sitting across from me
What do you want me to say, Leopold
Tell me that you love me as  love you
Let me hear you say it
Kate remains silent
Leopold abruptly throws money on the table
will not do this
'm sorry
We starts out
Leopold
- Leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm
His emotions get the best of him
Finally, exhausted, he winds up walking along Central Park South
Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out
He approaches slowly
He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's head
He looks at the horse for a long time
Then he looks at the skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do
He lays his face against the horse's head, torn
: - Kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty Sara Lee boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her way through the cookie dough
Leopold enters through the front door,
Good God
Look at you
You look awful
You should see what 'm looking at
went back to the restaurant
They told me you went out looking for me right after  left
That was pound cakes ago
Where were you
had a lot to think over
Such as
Just where  stand around here
There is a long pause
(quietly) We should have come up with something together
might have been spared ten or seventy pounds
Is that an apology
'm sorry for what  said
Leopold goes to her
He gently prys cookie dough from her hands
'm not going anywhere
Yes you are
'm not going
'm staying here with you
But
You can't
We have no right to
It is my destiny
It is my decision
Have you thought about what you'd be sacrificing
Your influence
Your authority
They kiss
Your family, your whole way of life, everything
They kiss
You're not just feeling sorry for me because  ate the contents of the refrigerator, are you
They kiss
love you, Kate
The single most miraculous event in my life was not how  arrived here, but that when did,  found you
(overwhelmed) Here comes the mushy part
After much consideration 've come to the conclusion  no longer desire a large estate with a full staff and ornate grounds
That's good, because if you're staying 'll probably get fired again
What do you desire
beautiful wife, a small home in the middle of nowhere, lots of children, and fine schools with meetings every other Sunday
love you too
do, Leopold love you, too
They kiss
- Leopold and Kate sit calm and resolute
The doctors are in an uproar
This is outrageous
won't allow it
The decision is not yours to make
Do you realize what you're saying
You're tampering with fate, preordinance, and God himself
We do that every day, doctor
It is called
Dr
Carlson is still over there
You can't simply abandon her
We have to get her back
Do you think 'm not aware of that
Do you think a minute goes by that don't feel responsible for her
But Only one person can return
The capsule accommodates only one person
Leopold has to find her
Perhaps she does not wish to return
Perhaps she's found greater happiness in her new life
It happened to me
Maybe this is her destiny
Maybe she's of more important use back there
Julia Carlson died in the Center Factory fire of 1897, two years after she arrived
She was 37 years old
There is a stunned silence
Dear lord
She was a friend, Kate
She was never expected to sacrifice her life for this experiment
won't be a party to it
know what 'm asking
There's no way we can force you to go
Just think it over
- 2:30
clock is ticking loudly
Kate and Leopold lie back to back
You're going back aren't you
keep seeing that poor woman's face
She was terrified
You said you wouldn't leave me
've never been lucky
Not one time
Six months ago  wouldn't have given it another thought
wouldn't have lost a moment's sleep
You've changed me, Kate
There is no turning back
wouldn't  you to change
That's what's tearing me up inside
Either way  lose
You've changed me too
can't go back to my old life anymore
can't live like that again
God my heart is pounding like a drum
've never been so scared in my life
Take me with you, Leopold
God
Take me with you
You don't realize what you're saying
You don't understand the kind of life you'd lead
What you'd be giving up
'd be with you
can't ask that of you
Just ask me
Just ask
Come back with me
She slowly turns
She embraces him
Yes
- Dressed to the nines, Leopold leads a blindfolded Kate through the street
She is clumsier than usual
Where are you taking me
This is something 've wanted to do for a long time
She takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign: Leopold
This will be very therapeutic
He takes her arm and escorts her in
- Leopold leads Kate to the dance floor
He opens his arms and Kate steps in the way she was taught in class
Leopold pulls her close
This time there is no pretending
Partnered together, they shine
They move beautifully, effortlessly
It's almost more than they can bear
As the music plays, they stop
Leopold holds Kate tightly
They look at each other for the longest time
: - Large screen computers are working overtime
Kate, Leopold, and Charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule
It is nearly time
The time tables have been set
Just strap yourself in and you'll be fine
You have only a twenty four hour leeway before the machine is set to return to us
You must find Carlson within that time frame and get her on board or there will be little chance of her finding a way back
understand
It's been a real pleasure
You have a much nicer smile than Ronald Coleman
The privilege was mine
Goodbye Leopold, and thank you
(she gives him a kiss) Oh, my
Don't worry
We'll send Kate to you
as soon as possible
'll see to it myself
See that you do
You have my word on it
The doctors leave
Four minutes and counting
Well
'll make this quick
Goodbye
He sticks out his hand
Goodbye
(impulsively Leopold embraces Charlie) shall miss you Charles, more than you know
'll miss you too, Leopold
You're the only one who knows how to program the
Take care of my sister
will
You better
Take care of yourself too while you're at it
So long
don't have any words for this
will see you soon
know
You'll be with me all the time
know
brought you something
She takes out a ring and slips it on his finger
So you wouldn't forget me
Kate
So you wouldn't think this was all a dream
They kiss
Don't forget about me
love you, Kate
Wait for me
For as long as it takes
will come back to you
will
'll be waiting
They kiss again for the last time
It's time Leopold
Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands
Very slowly they part
Leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself in
He places one hand on the red lever and the other against the glass pane on the door
Kate comes over and places her hand over his
Wordlessly, they say goodbye
After a moment, Dr
Kau gently moves Kate away
Dr
Plodder silently raises his arm, signaling Leopold
9 8 7 6 5 4
Leopold shifts in his seat, his eyes never leaving Kate's, his hand still against the glass
Kate smiles tenderly at Leopold
3 2 1
Dr
Plodder drops his arm signaling Leopold
Leopold pulls the lever, still gazing at Kate
There is a blinding of light, then darkness
- Kate raises her head
She sits at her desk surrounded by the doctors
cannot in good conscience let you go
It's out of the question
can't be a part of it either Kate
'm sorry
It's too big a risk
Kate rises and moves to the window
She is a full We cannot guarantee your child's safety
It's that simple
He's waiting for me
can feel it
Oh, Leopold
She gazes out the window, searching the horizon
: - Down from the horizon, a farm house
, 5 years old, rocks on his front porch swing
Using his bare hands as puppets he carries on a conversation
pulls up in her car
Hi
Does Katherine Coles live here
Yeah
(yelling inside) You're Leo aren't you
You don't remember me but  knew you when you were yea big
(she holds her hands an inch apart) Yeah
'm Julia
'm an old friend of your mothers
(proudly) We had spaghetti at our house 4 times this week
Kate comes out on the porch
She looks lovely
Leo you don't have to holler like that
'm not deaf
Kate
Carlson
The two women scream, run to each other and embrace
Carlson,  don't believe it
It's been
don't know how many years
What are you doing here
came to see you, sweetie
You remember my son, Leo
We've just been getting acquainted
Well, come inside
Come inside
'  - Kate heads straight for the kitchen
Carlson scans the living room before joining her
Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style
(covering her agitation) Would you like some tea
wish you had called before you come over
It would have given me a chance to straighten up the house
myself
my life
Tell me what you've been up to
Catch me up on everyone
heard you received some big endowment or something
was going to write, then call, but
She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently she has to put it down
It's all right, Kate
understand
There is a
Carlson gets the tea ready
Finally: You'd leave in 9 days
That's not a lot of time to get your affairs in order
And  warn you, it's nearly impossible for an intelligent woman back there
Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo
He's a fine boy Kate
Leopold would be proud
We're aware of your situation but we felt when the time came, you deserved the option
Kate nods, trembling slightly
- Kate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off
Who was that lady
Just an old friend
What she want
(she looks at Leo) Nothing important
You brush your teeth
Leo shows off his teeth
Then give your old mom a hug and go to bed
(Leo gives her a hug and a kiss) Good night, cookie
Good night
Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the house turning off the lights
It is very guiet
All we hear are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking
She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room
She sits down by the window at her desk
She sits a long time lost in thought
She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls out an old photo album
She opens it and begins to look through
: Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life
photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he departed this world
He stands stiffly beside his family for a formal portrait
Very discreetly, he points to a ring
It is the same ring Kate gave him
newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to establish a scientific center researching studies in time and space
magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, marching to give women the vote
photograph of a large formal wedding
Leopold, around , stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing to his ring
magazine article shows Leopold in his  establishing a scholarship program for studies in physics
He is surrounded by academia and subtly points to his ring
photograph of Leopold around  shaking hands with Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras
professional photograph of Leopold at  , sitting regally in a chair
Beside him, an  chair
He rests one hand on the back of the chair
The other he holds against his chest, showing off the ring
An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in bombings
tear falls on the page
Kate cries silently, looking out the window
The camera follows her gaze past her property
: - , 24 and his  take to the floor for the first time as husband and wife and are greeted with applause
Kate, older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder
Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor
He's so , Charlie
He's old enough
Look at that idiotic expression on his face
He's happy
Of course he's happy
All weddings are happy
It's the living together afterwards that causes all the trouble
Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet hall
She stands at the back of the large room, searching
Couples fill the dance floor
Across the expansive room, over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the guests
Leo cuts in
As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, Kate spots Carlson
She pales
They
Kate peers over Leo's shoulder
Her eyes lock with Julia's
Julia nods with purpose
Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not wanting to let go
She buries her head in his chest
Oh, you're so young
love you, Leo
Always remember that
From behind, her shoulders shake as she cries
Mom, we're only moving to Denver
know, cookie
know
- From behind a glass partition, Carlson works at her console
monitor counts away the seconds
59, 58, 57
In the darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps herself in and smiles tearfully
Their voices echo in the lab
Well
know
Me too
They embrace each other for the last time
What will  do without you, Charlie
(softly) Live happily ever after
(pushing the intercom button) Kate, it's time
(emotionally) Here
It's a letter for my father
Tell him about me and
um, tell him  love him
want him to know me
Leo
Mom,  want you to go
But
He puts his finger to her lips
He looks to his wife then back at Kate
He nods his head
Go
They force themselves to smile, trying to get through the moment
Ready
Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back
Inside the craft, the only light comes from the glowing red lever
Carlson raises her arm, signaling Kate
Then to her staff: 9, 8, 7
Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye
She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, staring straight ahead
Charlie puts his arm around Leo
3, 2, 1
There is a
Kate is gone
The others stand there motionless, stunned
The screen is
- 1924 - of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate
Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance
- Huge double doors open to reveal --
The creme de la creme have gathered and dance
Kate overwhelmed, rushes down an elaborate staircase
Half way down she looses a shoe
She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance floor
In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young woman
Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance
(brushing his shirt front) just love a starched white shirt
It's so elegant
Thank you
Skeeky
Yes
You dance like an angel Miss Beall
You light up the room around you
thank you
(with a big smile) Thank
The music changes:
Leopold heaves a sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the staircase
The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every turn as Kate searches each male face
In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up the stairs
As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up the muddy slipper, offering it to her
She turns in a huff, flouncing down the stairs
Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks for Leopold
Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs
He slows down, hesitates and
Very slowly he turns around
He becomes very still
well up in his eyes
The ballroom clock strikes
Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then In her heart
Slowly she turns
Leopold stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at her
He extends his arm, showing her
He offers her his hand
The crowd, the room,    ,
Their eyes lock
As she descends the staircase, Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her shoulders
The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone
They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment of youth, when they fell in love
Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot
He rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate
His hands are caked with mud
She smiles helplessly
Not caring, he wraps his arms tightly around her
begins to play, a slow waltz
He nods to her
She takes a deep breath
Her head bobs in rhythm
She begins to count silently
Leopold smiles, counting along
An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest
Who is that dancing with Leopold
've never seen her before
Kate and Leopold dance past
They are older
As they gaze into each other's eyes, they twirl
At the center of the floor they stop dancing
The rest of the world dances around them
Over this background The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly point to their rings
Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for studies in physics
The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera
The professional photograph becomes a double portrait
It shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching chairs
They hold hands and smile serenely
Staring directly into the camera, they show off their rings
the scrapbook closes
Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost in the crowd
The clock
Slowly we
