We hear the calm voice of Jerry Maguire, talking just to us
' Airight so this is the world and there are five billion people on it
When  was a kid there were three
It's hard to keep up
The great continent through mist and swirling skies
(Satellites and other pieces of skycasting equipment float by
) ' That's better
That's america
See, America still sets the tone for the world
puberty-ravaged kid dribbles a basketball, stares straight at us
' In Indiana -- Clark Hodd

Puberty hasn't been easy
Discreetly, his hand slips into his pants and scratches

You'll see her in the next Olympics
She launches her dive into mid-air, into nothingness

' Art Stallings, Indio, California
Check out what pure joy looks like
He swats a pitch -- not out of the park, it's much sweeter than that
He drills it over the first baseman's head, just out of reach of his glove
Art runs to first, laughing
Pats the first baseman's butt
Gotcha
-- line of  scouts watch a dazzling pass from a future star
' In Odessa, Texas, the great Frank Cushman
Cush is 20
Quarterback, role model, my client
He'll probably go number one in the draft this year
Cush turns into a closer shot
He's a living magazine cover
eyeing a long but level putt
' There's genius everywhere, but until they turn pro, it's like popcorn in the pan
Some pop
The kid misses the shot, whips his club at his coach
' (continuing) some don't
Hold on the kid, he's all youthful adrenalin, breathing hard
Portrait of an intense young competitor

/    -- wall of new  merchandise
Television monitors blink with the latest endorsement films
Into frame moves , 35
He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes and Sports Team Owners
We hear Herb Alpert's epic instrumental, "The Lonely Bull
" ' Now 'm the guy you don't usually see
'm the one behind the scenes
'm the sports agent
'   -- Jerry sits in a red leather chair, across from an agitated General Manager
He cooly works out figures on a yellow legal tablet
Easy now, we can spread these numbers over five years
' You know those photos where the new player holds up the team jersey and poses with the owner
Flash of photo Anonymous Athlete holds up jersey, standing next to Team Owner
Zoom in on someone's shirt-sleeve on left of frame
' (continuing) That's me on the left
' Inside that building, that's where work
Sports Management International
-- The  agents are a fierce, happy bunch
They sit in a carefully appointed conference room
Sports photos and posters are framed on the walls
The signs of global marketing are omnipresent
Each agent has a silver tray containing soft drinks and a glass pitcher of water
Through the glass window, we see a large office divided up into many cubicles
4
' Thirty-three out of shape agents guiding the careers of 2,120 of the most finely-tuned athletes alive
Near the end of the table sits Jerry Maguire
The word "millions" appears often and easily in his conversation
Shot moves in
' (continuing) in this economy, sometimes emotions run a little high
--  -- An unmarked car pulls into the underground parking facility of the Houston Police Department
cluster of chattering media members move in on the car
("Baja
"  "Baja, over here
")  Back doors open, and out steps Jerry Maguire with huge offensive lineman,  "" , 22
He is angry, and he is handcuffed
Was the girl 16 or seventeen
Were you aiming at anyone when you fired the shot in the 7/l1
Jerry whips in between Baja and the taunting media, blocking him off and forcing him through the glass doors into the police department
Professional smile in place, Maguire attempts spin
Listen, there's no proof of anything except that this guy is a sensational athlete
In the background, we hear baja bellowing insults at the press
-- Jerry now sits next to a towering white 27 year-old basketball player with a bad haircut
He is
They are signing a contract in the airport lounge
little approaches the player with a basketball trading card
Are you Calvin Nack
Could you sign my card
5
Nack bends down with a kindly-looking face
'm sorry little fella
can't sign that particular brand of card
can only sign Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards
The Little Boy looks confused
As Calvin Nack turns to grab an orange juice from a barmaid, Jerry smoothly dishes off a business card to the little boy
' Lately, it's gotten worse
-- Hockey Player  , 33, is a big man in a small bed
He is in traction, with concussion
stands nearby, shoots Jerry a look of concern
Family is nearby
Do you know your name
uh
wait
Wait, here it comes
have it
My name is Steve Remo
play for the Blackhawks
(now on a roll) You are my son
This pretty lady is my wife
And you are
Jerry nods encouragingly, presents his best "familiar" face
(continuing) My agent
Yes
And  gotta play this weekend, Doc
If  play in 65% of the games,  make my bonus
-- Remo's 14 year-old  () confronts Jerry outside the hospital room
He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football player himself
His voice is in the process of changing
6
This is his fourth concussion
Shouldn't somebody get him to stop
As he talks, Jerry's cellular phone rings in his bag
(glib, easy) Come on -- it'd take a tank to stop your dad
It would take all five Super Trooper  Warriors, right
The kid stares at Maguire
It feels as if the kid is peering into his soul
and all he sees is trash
Fuck you
The kid turns and exits in disgust
He leaves Jerry standing in the hallway
Devastated
Music
-- Jerry Maguire upset in a rental shuttle
Passing through frame
Music
Phone still ringing
-- Jerry sleeps
' Two nights later in Miami at our corporate conference, a breakthrough
Breakdown
Breakthrough
Jerry's eyes open
Breathing strangely
Trembling, he holds onto the nightstand for grounding
He gets up, takes a few gulps of air, walks to mini-bar
Gathers some tiny ice cubes in his hand, smears them across his face
This feeling is new to him
' (continuing) It was the oddest, most unexpected thing
began writing what they call a Mission Statement for my company
You know -- a Mission Statement -- a suggestion for the future
7
-- Jerry types, a pot of coffee and tray of room service nearby
we watch his face, alive now
There is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the words he's typing
His fingers fly
Even his eyes grow moist
' What started out as one page became twenty-five
Suddenly  was my father's son
was remembering the simple pleasures of this job, how  ended up here out of law school, the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field
was remembering even the words of the late Dicky Fox, the original sports agent, who said: The key to this job is personal relationships
As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now
' And suddenly it was all pretty clear
The answer was fewer clients
Caring for them, caring for ourselves, and the games too
Starting our lives, really
:  We must embrace what is still virginal about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we must simply be the best versions of ourselves
that goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear
He pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence
' (continuing) Hey, 'll be the first to admit it
What  was writing was somewhat "touchy feely
" He deletes it
And then -- zip -- he restores it and continues on, boldly
8
' (continuing) didn't care
had lost the ability to bullshit
It was the me 'd always wanted to be
'  -- Jerry in -shirt stands proudly watching copies pumped out
Wired college students, band guys, other Copy People of the Night nearby
' printed it up in the middle of the night, before  could re-think it
Industrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first printed copy of the Mission Statement
He nods approvingly, taps his heart in tribute
He slides a copy across the counter, for Jerry's approval
(The Future of Our Business) ' That's how you become great, man
You hang your ba11s out there
Jerry nods
It's 3 , and this guy sounds and looks like a prophet
In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3  does
(self-effacing) Thanks
being stuffed into mail-slots
-- Jerry splashes water onto his face
The sun is coming up
He looks younger, lighter
( ) Suddenly, dramatic movie score
It's Dana Andrews, showing Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura
("Someone was murdered in this room last night
any idea who it was
")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he packs
slight concern on his face
He moves to the phone, and dials with urgency
9
Hi, it's jerry maguire
Uh, listen did those manuscripts get
Oh they did
No no no no no, that's fine
-- Jerry in suit, alone with his luggage
Dry throat
clammy, holds onto the handrail to steady himself
-- The lobby is filled with  agents
The blue Mission Statement is in evidence everywhere
Jerry inconspicuously turns the corner, yearns to blend in
It's impossible, the recognition ripples through the lobby
Underling agent , 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders
("Finally, someone said it
") Suddenly another agent begins to clap, then reluctantly, another
Soon, the ovation rocks the lobby
(In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26 year-old female employee of  applauding with Mission Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side
)  Jerry motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen forever
It is a watershed moment in his life
' was 35
had started my life
Swing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping enthusiastically near the elevator
One offers gum to the other
# 1 () How long you give him
# 2 () Mmmm
week
folding up into a plane, as music and credits end
/  -- We move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but adrenalized Jerry Maguire
He sits in first-class, working on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby
The   next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy phone conversation with her boyfriend
10
Monkeyface
monkeyface, listen
'm not going to say it here
no
Jerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps
Battery's low
(continuing) oh listen,  got you the perfect white shirt, at this out of the way place
no
quit trying to make me say it
Jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep
Trying not to listen
(continuing) how about if  do it and don't say it
mmmm
see you soon
She laughs seductively and hangs up
She is still buzzed from the conversation
Jerry turns to her, surprising her
have to ask
(protective) What -- Where'd you find the perfect white shirt
She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers enjoying the good life -- as we   three rows, past the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach
We meet  , 26
harried passenger on this bus in the sky
Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother- functional
She is never as composed or in control as she wants to be
Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her
It is , her five-year old son
Dorothy is covered in toys and books
Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement
The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant
The overworked  arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell
11
Look, my son is allergic to the material in these blankets - That's all we have
The Attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and is about to exit as Ray makes a gagging noise
He's about to get sick
Both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to his mouth just in time
Their faces are now inches apart
(continuing) 'm sorry  was rude just then -- It's okay
We're in it together now
The Attendant now exits helpfully with the bag
' Don't take anything  say seriously
love to flirt
Dorothy, irritated, leans out into the aisle to look for the heads that belong to these voices
You're with the sports people on the plane, right
Jerry Maguire
Bobbi Fallon
'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs
Well
Good luck with that -- He nods, as he reaches up to shut off the light
Politely stifles another yawn
He shuts his eyes, settles into sleep
Bobbi leans into his darkness
Can  just get a quick "man's" opinion from you on something
: 12
-- Bobbi is intense now, unburdening, as tired Jerry listens like a priest
And  can't say his name without laughing  want to eat him up want to say goodbye to every bad thought  ever had about relationships
mean,  crave this guy
and yet
why
why did  have that affair this weekend
Does that mean 'm not in love with my boyfriend
think you'll know when you see him at the gate
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right
Because finally see the white picket fence looming and  love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it
you're right, 'll know when  see him
Why is it so easy to talk with you
Tell me about your fiancee
Maguire fights another yawn
uh
don't think we're quite at your pitch yet
Tell me, and then you can sleep
She's an  publicist
amazing sense of style
former athlete
volleyball
world class
really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why  should take a nap now
Her sleeping son now silent, she can't help but listen
' Tell me how you proposed collect romantic proposal stories
13
No no
(impatient) Oh, tell the story
Oh, tell the story
-- --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui
Gorgeous
year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl
Now 've always hit a wall at 18 months
Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months
It's like --ka- boom
The curse of 18 months
That's when you need to cement, and define define define
Exactly
And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor
knew  wanted to propose, so took her there
To the pools
To the pools
Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and 'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and  have the ring in my pocket, and 'm a little nervous, 'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz
" Oh no -- 14
Well, it bothered me somewhat
And  got quiet
And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know
And  decide 'm not going to propose
The mood is not right
Why be impulsive
Now at this point know she knows that  was going to propose and didn't
And she knows know
So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak
And we're both good at that
We fly to Honolulu in silence
We check into the Pro Bowl hotel -- How sad -- But wait
She is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story
The plane is now quieter
She listens to the easy sound of Jerry discussing his charmed life
(waking up) Mama -- Shhh
Mommy's eavesdropping
He sneezes, three big ones in a row
She hands him more kleenex, riveted on the story
And listens
' Now little do  know that my assistant
has assumed that 've now proposed
So she has gotten the lounge band to actually play "Here Comes The Bride" when we walk back in
Dorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively
She tries to share the laugh with her son, who stares at her
15
-- Which they do
And we're standing there
All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an  crew
So  turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me
" And  took out the ring, and  don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies
We're getting married in February
Jerry
You two will be together forever
She takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant Flight Attendant shuts the curtain to first class
Dorothy blows her nose, moved against her will
What's wrong, mom
First class is what's wrong
It used to be a better meal
Now it's a better life
She pulls out the Mission Statement,  aware that she's been listening to its author
She opens it and begins to read
-- Jerry Maguire exits the plane a few steps behind Bobbi Fallon
(quietly, like a coach) You'll know when you see him
You'll know when you see him
Bobbi scans the crowd
She spots Monkeyface, large and burly in tiger-print sweats
He looks like Mickey Dolenz
He holds flowers
16
Oh my God, you're right
know
(Jerry smiles) He's not The One
He's not the One
Jerry's face falls
Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace, faking it
Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed couple
Melancholy now, he continues forward through the crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for loved ones
Music
-- Dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage conveyor belt
She clutches a cup of coffee
In the background, other  agents' grab their bags and exit
Ray
Ray
Maguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the dark depths behind the flaps
Can  help
Oh
Hi
work in your office
was on the junket to the conference
'm -- know who y6u are
You're Dorothy Boyd
You're in
wait
you're in Accounts
You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body
(surprised) Hmm
Pretty good
Now what did you lose
My son
my mind
Over her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner, riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the Delaware
17
Well, while  go look for him, why don't you hang onto this curious gentleman behind you -- Dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches him off the belt
She bends down into his face
She speaks softly but intensely, with no frills
Remember "imagination
"
remember what that means
Well, this is one of my bosses so you will now  me screaming at you right now
Do  do that again
Ever ever
She rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young woman of 26
It's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a day
(continuing) Well, thanks
Well, take care
And have fun at your bachelor party
Jerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough
Dorothy freezes
(continuing) Oh no
No no
knew
(slow sigh) Nnnnn
just killed the surprise
No, 'm just
anxiously looking past it
already had my bachelor party
It was called "my twenties
" See you later
Jerry takes off
18
loved your memo, by the way
He stops
Turns
She flashes the well-thumbed copy in her purse
Jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered
Thanks
actually, it was just a "Mission Statement
" Ray has taken Jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him
think in this age, optimism like that
it's a revolutionary act
(eager for feedback) You think so
Oh tsht
Yes
appreciate that, because some of that stuff
you know, it was two in the morning and
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" -- Jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his words
(continuing) -- "and we should all force open the tightly-clenched fist of commerce, and give a little back for the greater good
"
mean, was inspired, and 'm an accountant
Ray, don't spill my coffee
Jerry looks more nervous, as Ray has now taken his mother's hand
He is now swinging on both of them
One-two-three
swing
19
Hey
To respect yourself enough to say it out loud, to put yourself out there, so openly
(shakes her head) don't know, it got me
Now Jerry looks concerned, as Ray continues swinging happily
One-two-three, swing
Thanks
May  offer you both a ride
Oh no
'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, 've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up
Thanks, though
Bye
(amused) Dorothy
Ray
pleasure
One-two
Jerry lets Ray down easy
The kid is a little disappointed
But Maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag
He then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling Ray's hand up again and completing the swing
three, swing
Ray is now happy, in love even, as Jerry exits
Dorothy laughs, as her sister arrives
is 36
No make-up, no bullshit
Laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches on dorothy's shirt as they hug
Come on, 'm double-parked
Dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down, gathering Ray's toys
She wipes at Ray's hair
20
("Don't put food in your hair
")   She is surprised that she's a little jazzed from her encounter with Jerry Maguire
She can't help but look back at Jerry, who catches her looking
He salutes her, with mock circumstance
She returns it with a guilty smile
He disappears, and she finds herself oddly short of breath
(to herself) Hmmph
Whoever snagged him must be some classy babe -- '  -- , 29, makes love to Jerry Maguire at fever pitch
They are standing on the bed, which is in the corner
Don't ever stop fucking me
Sooner
or later
'll have to stop
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better
Never
Nearby, a large and sleepy German Shepard yawns
(continuing) Never
The dog snaps awake, a little shook
Avery suddenly yanks away
Breathing hard, she just looks at Jerry
Sex is a very serious business with Avery
(continuing) Open your eyes
(he does) If you ever want me to be with another woman for you,  would do it
'm not interested in it
There was a time, yes, it felt normal for me, but it was a phase, a college thing, like torn Levi's or law school for you
people change, but if you ever feel like being adventurous in that way, would do it for you
You want anything from the kitchen 'm going to get some fruit -- 21
She skips off like a colt
Jerry digests what he's just been told
(to the next room) You know
don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything
(
) (laughing) Jerry, this is what intimacy is
Jerry rubs his face, as he does often when processing complex information
(0
5
) Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey
(0
5
) know about the bachelor party
Avery returns
Her robo body, half-lit now in the hallway, is a glorious life-long project
Who told you
One of the accountants
She makes a pissed-off sound
She then walks over, taking his shoulders and bending them forward
She is an expert at body manipulation, loosening him as she talks
Jerry
Your buddy Dooler worked his ass off to make you a tribute film
All those guys from the office are coming
Everybody loves you
Just calm down, relax, act surprised, and have an amazing time
And you'll never guess who narrates your bachelor movie
-- Jerry enters the hotel suite and over-acts surprise
He falls down, clutching his heart, feigning an attack
He looks around for a bigger reaction than he actually gets
--   -
It is hosted by
22
have often wondered where my career would have been had Jerry Maguire been my agent
The answer -- Yugoslavia
Tepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his friend
Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik on steroids
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry
There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party
Oh come on -- This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man
They should be screaming
(eying crowd) You're imagining it
They are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar
Sugar is a Maguire wannabee
Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder
We still having lunch tomorrow, Jerry
Looks like Carl Denton tested positive for marijuana
That moves Cush solidly up to numero uno in the draft
Oh, that'll really help this party
Let's all talk business
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar
(smoothly) The best commercial director in the business
hail you
Sorry  yelled
You have exquisite taste
23
Everybody's having a great time
You're both nuts -- the movie's great
Sugar moves on, cheerfully
like that guy
(The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation, is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends
is cut into this, nodding, as if he were actually interviewing
The effect is funny, but the confessions are brutally honest
There is The One He Was Too Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being alone
") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute exterior, more cute exterior
") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend, The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does  Great Jerry Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his- way-to-the-airport)
All seem to agree on some basic points (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following information to underscore it
)  Jerry always has a girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up with the last one
The relationship always competes with his job, and the job always wins
The final confrontation happens somewhere around the 18-month mark
Sequence ends with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to burn all these old phone numbers
) (wounded good sport) this is
uh
too funny
They ain't laughing, man
Something's wrong
Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer
He knows the response is little more than polite
None of the other agents can keep eye contact with him
Dooler is right
On the screen, the finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut to music
-- Elevator doors open
Maguire is now paranoid
He walks through the buzzing  headquarters, heading for his corner office
He is like an  man searching treetops and corners for the Gunman
Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy Knoll
24
He passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated Basketball Player
Moving forward
There is trouble in the air, but only he seems to sense it
He turns corner and is met by assistant , who hands him a long list of calls
The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward his back office
(as in 'get ready') Marcee's here
She's already in your office
Thanks, Wendy
'  -- Jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny waters of Newport Beach and a large mall parking lot
Already standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively , 25
African-American, gorgeous, a heat-seeking smartbomb
She is also five months pregnant
Marcee
How's my favorite player's wife
Jerry, Rod is very very upset
Tyson, no
Across the room, 4 year-old menace  ceases trying to pry a plexiglass case off the wall
Tyson, hello
Tyson just stares at Jerry
Jerry has little luck with kids
He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge
He grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another habit -- and sits down at his desk
He slips into crisis mode like an old shirt
(continuing) How can  make your life better
know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition
(more) 25
(cont'd) He is the biggest, fastest, raddest wide-receiver in the league
Now  don't know what you do for your four-percent --The door opens, Bob Sugar pokes his head in
Cronin's okay for lunch
Marcee -- this is one of our agents
This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock
Pleasure
You've called our house, right
Sorry to interrupt you guys
Sugar exits
Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact level of intensity
Now  don't know what you do for your five-percent, but this man, my husband has a whole plan, an image
we majored in marketing, Jerry, and when you put him in a Waterbed Warehouse commercial, excuse me, you are making him common
He is pure gold and you're giving him "Waterbed Warehouse" when he deserves the big four -- shoe, car, clothing- line, soft-drink
The four jewels of the celebrity endorsement dollar
Jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the best in him
The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it
(continuing) You gonna get that -- Not a chance
She smiles
26
(continuing) Marcee, things are changing around here
You and Rod will have my total personal attention
(upping the ante) Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it
(it's infectious) Damn right
He climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the poster with his hanging device
True to Marcee's complaint, the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall
Look at that handsome man, trying to build a life up there by the air-conditioner
We're coming to get ya, darlin
We are so close to having it all
-- It is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of second-tier players
Commanding wide-receiver  , 27, stands shirtless, hands on hips, looking vaguelyl uncomfortable
Emplazoned above his head:
Elsewhere in the room, we hear the inevitable crash ("Tyson
")
'  -- Crowded outdoor restaurant in the business district
Jerry sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes
Gimme a second here
Tidwell
Arizona contract
new glass cabinet
You okay
(looking up) 'm fine
What's up
came here to let you go
27
Pardon me
Came here to fire you, Jerry
For a long moment there is only silence
They study each other
These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the other's next three or four moves
(continuing) It's real, Jerry
You
you should say something
Suddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed
Aw shit
the crowded restaurant
so there's no scene
know
It sucks
suck
In a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's "Birthday Song" to someone else
Jerry is dying
You
(razor sharp) You did this to yourself
You said "fewer clients
"  You put it all on paper
Scully was very upset
Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him
You did this to yourself -- Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can speak, Sugar continues
(continuing) -- although  do gotta hand it to you
For about five minutes you had everyone applauding smaller revenues
Quietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier
You
ungrateful
unctuous
28
(unctuous) dick
Dick
Maguire reaches for water
The sound of the ice cubes jangling is suddenly very loud to him
He is drowning
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face
What  went through knowing  was going to do this to my mentor
Can you get past yourself for a second
You'll lose
(musically) You wanted smaller
'm over it
Now  want all my clients and yours too
Jerry -- -- and 'll get 'em
(patronizing) You'll always be my hero, Jerry
Always always always
We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore
We're no longer babysitters -- Jerry fights the desire to use his fists
Hangs onto the table
He's starting to freak out now
Trying to calm down
Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's mind
Rising percussive music
-- Jerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the lunchtime businessmen traffic
Back to the office
29
' -- Sugar dines alone now
Casually whips out a portable phone
-- Jerry in the elevator, eyes wide, mind racing
Dorothy Boyd sees him, raises a hand to say hello
Decides this is not a good time
-- Close on Maguire as he moves through the office, heading to the back office
Music '  -- Maguire rolls the fax machine over to his desk
He takes a breath, and begins to go to work
From within his bottom drawer, he withdraws a Powerbook
Then from another drawer, a phone book
And then from his inner jacket pocket, a third smaller phone book
They are lined in front of him now, as he dials
/ -- Frank "Cush" Cushman picks up the phone
Today, the young football God wears a yellow scarf on his head
He's still playing  Jam on his Gameboy' as he talks
' -- Sugar at the table
Chameleon-like, he adopts the personality of whomever he talks to
Cush
Hey Dudeboy
It's Bob Sugar
Listen, 'm callin' ya first 'cause you're the most important guy in sports
'  -- Maguire on the telephone, fighting hard, as he feeds a fax into the machine at the same time
Carla, right now you're paying 25% of your endorsments to , would cut my commission by 7%
As he talks, he takes a stack of his Mission Statements, once proudly set on his desk, and sentences them to the bottom drawer
30
-- Sugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable
You read that memo  snuck to you, the guy's tired of the job
Tired of making you money
'  -- Maguire feeds a fax, types another fax on his Powerbook, all while he talks quickly on the phone
And when  got you that big contract in Chicago, and the fan poll in the Sun-Times was 93% against you, who went and found you that sympathetic journalist who turned it all around, it was me
'  -- Several other agents working the cause behind Sugar, who breezes through the calls
He's costing you money, Debra
he's oldschool
'  -- Jerry on the toilet
Not a minute to spare
represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be
You stay with me, 'd fight for alone
You'd be my only client on that team
'  -- 've got the clients
've got the juice
-- Dorothy walks the center hallway with some contracts
To the right and left of her are the phones are ringing
31
Something is amiss
She stops at the desk of fellow Accounts Exec , 32
What's going on
(no big deal) They fired Jerry Maguire
Did it at Cronin's
Dorothy groans softly, as she lowers herself into her seat
She is strangely affected by the news
She scoots back on her roller chair, and looks down the hallway to Maguire's office door
'  -- The pace has accelerated
-- personal attention -- '  -- Sugar talks faster
-- more money, more endorsements -- '  -- Jerry talks faster than sugar
-- a family of athletes -- '  -- Sugar talks faster than Jerry
-- the millenium, eight-hundred channels more endorsements
Think of me, think of dollars
'  -- Jerry shows signs of tiring
Kathy
Hi, it's Jerry Maguire
-- 32
, 22 year-old figure skater, sits on a couch
Nearby are cardboard stand-ups, souvenirs of past endorsements
Also, the famous gold-medal shot from the Olympics
Kathy's adoring Mom and Dad sit next to her, listening in on the extension
The Mission Statement is folded open on Dad's lap
Kathy chokes on every other word, such is her anguish
already heard from Bob Sugar
Jerry  want to cry for what they did to you at
You helped me win that gold at the Olympics, we have history, and
oh Jerry
if we weren't in the middle of the Accura deal, you know 'd go with you
(starts to break down) Oh Jerry, oh God
There is a click on the line
She is pained and outraged
(continuing) Call Waiting
who could be calling me now
She clicks the phone once
Her voice is suddenly cheery
(continuing) Hiyee
' Still me, Kathy
She instantly starts "crying" again
Ohhhhhhhh
'  -- Sugar crosses off another name on his list
It's not show "friends"
It's show business
'  -- Jerry on the phone
It's getting harder to crank it up
33
Rod
How ya doing
Jerry Maguire
/ -- , 27, begins this conversation in the kitchen
He is a powerful physical presence, and he holds a hot new cellular phone
He fixes young son Tyson a bowl of cereal as he talks
In the background, monitoring the crisis is Marcee Tidwell
"How am  doing
"  'll tell you
'm sweatin, dude
That's how 'm "doin
" 'm sweatin my contract
'm sweatin' Bob Sugar calling and telling me 'm blowing the big endorsements if  stay with you
'm sweatin'
You hear what 'm saying
hear what you're saying
No
hear that you hear what 'm saying
But do you hear what 'm saying
'  -- Sugar works off a wristwatch
He spends no longer than three minutes on each call
'll bet he hasn't even called you yet, right Jennifer
Wait,  need to cough
He covers the phone, as another agent hands him a cellular with another call on it
(continuing) Hi, Ben, it's Sugar, hold on a second, have you heard from Maguire
You haven't
Well, that tells you a lot
Hold on, gotta cough
Back to the other call
34
(continuing) So Jennifer
' Jerry is still on the same Tidwell call
Looking at his watch
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know
Take notes if you want to
(dying) Okay
-- Tidwell walks down the hallway, past clippings and citations from his career
Marcee follows, always listening
Good, 'cause see,  am a valuable commodity
go across the middle
see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me,  tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball
" That's New York Steak, baby
Rare
And yet, nobody's giving me
Nobody's giving me
Nobody
went to Arizona State, 'm from Arizona,  break Arizona records, 'm a Sun Devil, man
Now you want Arizona dollars
Exactly
And 'm sitting here with an ant problem, look
And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water
Say hello to Jerry Maguire -- We meet the messy-haired and slightly overweight brother of Tidwell,  , 24
Tee Pee, who lives free of charge in Rod's house, is a nakedly jealous and more political version of his brother
He says into the phone: Hello Jerry Maguire
35
Tidwell takes the phone back, and continues through the house, with Tee Pee now following the procession of family monitoring the important call
--  the house is fallin' apart, we don't even know where we're gonna live in a year, and 'm supposed to be a "superstar," man
Are you catching my flow, here
Jerry looks at his watch
Doomed
need a decision from you, Rod
'  -- Sugar has three phones going
Killer, Steve, good decision
(next call) So it's yes, right
Excellente
(next call) Tell me it's yes
yes
Tidwell enters bedroom
Marcee, Tyson and Tee Pee in tow
--  now to recap,  want to stay in Arizona,  want my new contract,  like you, you're nice to my wife,  will stay with you, that's what 'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me
You listening
(dying) Mmm
Hmm
It's a very personal, very important thing
It's a family motto
So  want to share it with you
You ready
Yes
Here it is
"Show me the money
" (pause) Show
Me
The
Money
36
got it
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it
Say it with me
The lights have gone down in the city, and he hasn't had a chance to turn his own light on
He sits in the oncoming darkness, watching the blinking white lights on the phone bank on the desk
Show
Me
The
Money
Congratulations
You're still my agent
Tidwell hangs up
Feeling good about the decision, he enters his closet and adds today's shoes to an enormous shoe collection
Nearby, Tee Pee shakes his head
An African-American man running with a little ball, working for white owners and white agents
It's the iconography of rascism
(off Tidwell's dismissive look) but  woulda stayed at the bigger company
'  -- Sugar crosses the last call off his sheet, and throws himself on the sofa
He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof
The younger turks watch their new leader
Victory is his
'  -- Jerry stands at the door, holding some belongings
He looks back and symbolically flips the light switch off
Unfortunately he hasn't realized the lights are already off
So, in his final gesture, surprising himself, he has weirdly turned the lights on
-- Bam
Jerry's door opens
He exits his office with box
He is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged
Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving
37
Well, don't worry
'm not going to do what you think 'm going to do, which is
(continuing) Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills a small Dixie cup
Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his face
(continuing) But let me just say, as  ease out of the office  helped build -- sorry, but it's a fact -- -- from her cubicle
-- that there is such a thing as manners
way of treating people
He notices the fish tank nearby
He attemps to be profound
(continuing) These fish have manners
They have manners
And now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger
Another cup of water as he finds power
(continuing) In fact
They're coming with me
'm starting a new company, and the fish will come with me and
you can call me sentimental
He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish that failed to escape his cup
It's a fire-tailed Peruvian beauty
He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside
(continuing; to fish) it's okay
it's okay
Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck
38
(continuing) But if anybody else wants to come with me, this moment will be the ground floor of something real and fun and inspiring and true in this godforsaken business and we will do it together
Who's coming with me besides
"Flipper" here
But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new arrangement
Panicked, he whips around the small baggie
(continuing) Anybody going with me
Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look on with equal parts pity and embarrassment
Jerry downs another small cup of water
His lid is blowing off with each second
(continuing) Wendy
Shall we
Assistant Wendy looks at Maguire
Painfully polite: 'm three months away from the pay increase, Jerry
have to, uh
you know, stay
Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of her desk
She can't look at him
Jerry stands alone, the blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in frame
There is only silence now, the loudest kind
Okay, anybody else
She looks around
Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing they were applauding three days ago
She has an odd reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul
Before she knows it, she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee onto herself in the process
'll go with you
(quietly, on her coffee mess) Wonderful
39
She dabs at her pants
Next to her, Cleo looks on sadly
halfway across the office
Dorothy Boyd
Thank you
She gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done
(continuing) We will see you all again
Sleep tight
He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway corridor, past the framed posters and awards
- rising over the huge office
For the first time, we see the full expanse of the huge  headquarters
And down in the corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes
(to Dorothy) Let's see how they do without us
beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal commercial roar
couple of fleas have been swatted off the carcass of an immense beast
-- The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors
Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with adrenalin
And then the first pangs of dread
There is silence
The elevator stops
young, amorous Couple enters
Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five flights down
In a moment, we realize they are deaf
They sign to each other, murmuring noises of love
And then the Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy
The Couple are truly in their own world
They kiss before exiting on their floor
And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them
Wonder what he said
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired
He said "you complete me
" 40
They continue on in silence
-- Jerry and Dorothy pass through another office's party
Loud music
It's a pre-Easter party thrown for the building employees and their children
Jerry and Dorothy squeeze through with boxes and fish
-- Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars
Music in distance
So  know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right
Sure
Yes
Medical,  don't know
He spaces out for a moment
Awkwardly, she touches him briefly
And  guess we didn't talk about money
So, 'll just dive in -- Give me your number
'll call tomorrow
'm just a little
'm a little insane right now
(off her look) But it's going to be great
No no,  know -- They arrive at her red Camry
She writes her number on the back of a business card
But  mean really
wonderfully
(out of steam) great
(unsure) Absolutely
She climbs into her car, rolls down the window
And when you think about what you've done later, don't panic
41
Me
No
My sister -- it's a good bet
She starts the engine
(continuing) That took guts
Same to you
She salutes him as she drives off
His own move, played back to him
Camera moves away from Jerry, as he stands alone in the parking lot
Salutes her in return
Herb Alpert
"The Lonely Bull
" Stripped of power, his once mighty theme now seems puny
'  -- Lights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street in Manhattan Beach
Windows open
The sound of women's voices
-- living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced Women
This is their talk group
We meet , 30, who speaks shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks
She holds a too-full glass of red wine
(Much of the talk in this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses) love men
respect men
But that doesn't change the fact that most of them belong in cages
The other nine women nod with deep understanding
-- Dorothy does the dishes
Across the room, Laurel has her nightly cigarette, blowing smoke out the window
She is a no- frills woman
She has some time ago shut off those aspects of her life spent pursuing the opposite sex
They are in mid- argument
What about medical
Of course, medical
42
(unconvinced) You are a single mother
You have given up the right to be frivolous
(irritated) If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too
(more irritated) You know how much those Well Child exams cost -- (overlapping) Of course  know -- / hundred and fifty dollars
And that's just when he's well -- They talk over each other arguing for a moment and then: Wait
Where is he
He's in the living room asleep
Dorothy dries her hands, flicking in a hurry
Wonderful
Next time you lecture me, don't leave my little boy in a room with your Divorced Women's Group
She exits in a hurry, as Laurel throws her cigarette into the garbage disposal
She has a hard time saying this, so she says it so nobody can hear: Sorry
-- Ray dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of Women's Woes
Dorothy strokes his head, as she plucks him up
In frame another woman, , 50, speaks passionately to the group
43
Okay 've finally, finally, gotten my anger straight here
'm going to visualize Carl being here and finally tell him -- Shhhh
Dorothy exits, protectively stroking her son's head
(continuing) Come on, buddy, we're going to bed
-- She stops for a moment, little boy in her hands
The enormity of the day arrives with a thud
(to herself) What did  do
'  -- Jerry is quickly packing for a road trip
Avery looks on
They are both in a manic state
The power move is to go unannounced
(sotto) Black suit, right
(sotto) And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket
(full volume) Tell me again, how was it left with Cush
(perfect imitation) "Dad says we gwan sleep on it
Ugh
(turns, with clothes) Seventy-two clients
stayed
(sotto) Jacket on, tie in pocket
44
(sotta) Good
(full volume) They're all heatseekers
All of them, everybody
You keep one superstar and they'll all follow
There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you
think  was trying to sleep with you at the time
Well, it worked, and  will not let you fail
You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire
That's right
King of the Housecalls
Master of the Living Room
Okay, this is working
You are not a loser
Jerry stops, turns
The way she says "loser" is the most elegant of disses
She wraps her lips around it like a cheap hot dog
Who said anything about "loser
" Where do you get this word "loser
" 'm sorry
was on a roll meant something else
When do you want to leave
Jerry zips his brown travel bag shut
He is packed and ready
Now
Let's go
'll drive you
45
(stops, an odd thought) What if  don't get him
Avery takes his bag, heads for the door
Function function function
Forward motion is everything
Cush saves all
Jerry takes a breath, exits
Music
folding up
Music continues
-- -- Jerry drives the bumpiest Texas backroad ever
Music continues
-- Jerry exits car
Adjusts the jacket
Takes the tie off too, returns to the car and tosses it inside
He walks to the front door with purpose
Suddenly an intercom crackles, jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice: ' No sports agents allowed
Ha ha
Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from the upper-corner of this rustic home
The door buzzes
/ -- Jerry  follows the voice down a hallway  loaded with Cush memorabilia
Righteous indignation building
' 'm in the back den, Jerry
He moves into the den, finding  , 40, who stands at the living room bar
Two framed game jerseys on the wall
large draped American flag above the bar
He is a
Crew cowboy
You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry
Beer and tomato juice -- 46
No thanks
Maguire takes a breath, and sharply begins his pitch
(continuing) Matt,  came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to
But to me -- (overlapping) We decided to stay with you
On pure instinct, he hugs Matt Cushman
The move surprises them both
And somewhere out of nowhere, come a few surprising tears of relief
He has been spared
Oh, thank you
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him
You know, 'm not a hugger and yet
can't let go
Matt laughs, as Cush lopes in from the kitchen
Little brother , 14, enters with him
Hey, Jerry, what's been going on
--   -- Cush, Matt and Jerry brainstorm around the ceremonial "wagon- wheel table" where decisions are made in this house
Jerry is giddy, charged up, a part of the human race again
want him to go number one in the draft, and  want him to play
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him
(big grin) Hell, 'll either surf or ski don't care
47
Denver is where he should be
'll give it everything
You know  don't do "contracts
" But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak
Jerry toasts Matt with a bloody beer
good day
--/ -- Jerry drives back on the same bumpy road
On the radio, it's the Rolling Stones
He wants to sing along
He thinks he knows the words, but
(sings) Feelin
He realizes he doesn't know the words at all
He switches channels
Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics
No one will ever know what the words are
He switches again and finds "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire
Excellent
He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately
Switches again
All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows
Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee
" He drives through the countryside, singing the call and response of the song, like a happy idiot
/
-- Jerry turns into shot
He's on the pay-phone
He's jacked
Dorothy
Jerry Maguire
Is Avery there
Where can  reach her
/'  -- Dorothy is at her home work desk
Curious and nervous about the new arrangement
Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta, didn't leave me her hotel number
48
Through the back kitchen door comes   , 29, red hair cropped above the ear
Baggy overalls
Slipping through life with little turbulence
He's with Ray, who holds pieces of wood and a hammer
The new playhouse rocks, Dotty
(jumping) Yeah
Honey -- later, okay
(Ray jumps on her) Whoop
Wait
Hello
(back to phone) Sorry, that's my son and the nanny
had the calls transferred to my home so  could go over your stuff
Chad now notices the slight excited tone in her demeanor
He sits down nearby and listens to her talk to Maguire
No, that's fine
What calls came in today
Wait
That's yesterday, from the other office
Today is
She flips the call record from yesterday --150 calls -- to today, which is blank
(continuing) light
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery -- Wait a minute, it has to be one of the  hotels we do business with -- let me look -- but in the meantime, about this job -- 49
She reaches over Ray to get to her laptop and buzzes through a list of phone numbers
Jerry can't help but share the qood news: (importantly) Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back
We are so very very back
re-signed Cush
We're set
We are
It's all going to work
just got goosebumps
She examines her own skin with surprise
(manic, quiet) It's all going to work
We're going to save the world
Well, 'm happy for you
Happy for us
Oddly, the phrase affects her physically
Happy for us
okay
Here's the number
404-453-2222
Thanks
Call me later, hon
She hangs up, and looks over to Laurel and Chad
Both of them stare at her
(continuing) Wait
Did  just say "hon" to him
(laughing) Yeah, Dotty
You did
50
Twenty six years old
'm already saying "hon"
Hug your mother quickly -- Chad looks at her, something is different about Dorothy
Laurel walks away, sharing a look with Chad
-- Jerry is now teeming with energy, professional and sexual
Avery,  signed Cush
Again
-- Avery in mid-conference with four other  men in background
--
It is the victory call of the competitive girl, and she falls back into a chair, kicking her expensive shoes onto the bed
In the b
g
we see the hungry look of her male co-workers
Part of them lusts after her
The larger part knows she would demolish them, and pick her teeth with their bones
know
Sorry  threw a scare into our lives there -- Don't worry about it --  never told you what  thought of that memo either -- Well, no you didn't -- You lost your head, it happens
(quickly) 'm so fuckin jazzed
Listen
'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft
It's a plan --  -- 51
'll set it up with your girl
Woo
This is when it's good, Jerry
Enjoy it
Live it
Love it
And when  see you, 'm going to give you the best blow job of your life
He hangs up, staring at the phone
In the room with Avery, the co-workers look at each other
She is far, far out of their league
'  --   -- Dorothy Boyd speeds Jerry to the airport, the electricity fills the car
On the radio, a sports station debates the future of Cushman
as Jerry whips through a stack of sports pages
Avery'll meet you at the  gate at 4:15
Don't be late
Tidwell will already be there
(nods to Ray) Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars
No
They do, my brother
(giggling) 'm not your brother
Dorothy continues, business on her mind
put Tidwell on the same floor at the Marriott Marquis think it's great you're taking him to the draft
He doesn't smoke, right
have no idea
52
have no idea
(continuing to Ray) So Ray, if there's an accident or something, it goes pwoooooooof -- (simulates air-bag) -- and you go booooong
And you're safe
Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon
Ray is delighted by Jerry
Dorothy notes that he's great with her son
She pats Jerry on the shoulder
Her hand lingers perhaps a millisecond too long
She pulls away quickly, always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around this guy
Okay, have we gone over everything
Back on Tuesday, right
Yep
Have a good time at school, Ray
Wish me luck
Luck
Jerry nods and exits
They watch as Jerry inches into the crowded airport
Into frame, obscuring their view of Jerry, enters another Couple, who embrace each other and their small girl
It's a genuinely sweet goodbye, and we linger on Dorothy and Ray who both watch with private fantasies of the goodbye they didn't get
Mother and son look at each other, communicating volumes
They pull back into traffic
-- Jerry struggles through the Dallas airport, is the last, of his party to arrive at the  gate in Dallas
Avery, tall and cool in plaid skirt and shades, is in combat mode
Nearby, Cush is surrounded by fans and fawning Airline Employees
("Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush
"  "You gonna be rich, dude
") Tidwell looks jealous and ingnored as he leans against the airline counter, unnoticed
lone kid approaches Tidwell
Are you Hootie
(irritated) No man, 'm not Hootie
Kid leaves disappointed
Tidwell sinks lower
Doesn't anyone know his stardom, his essence, his power
53
All those disabled, and Frank Cushman can board now
-- Jerry sits next to Cushman, who is reading Bukowski's Notes of a Dirty Old Man
Across the aisle is Tidwell, who sits next to Avery
They are a small family, and Jerry feels at home with his operation
Cush looks up suddenly
(a big thought) Jerry
Why does God sometimes reward the evil and punish the good
Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of Cush
Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs
Let me think about that
Want something to drink
(thoughtful pause) see what you're saying
Wait
What do you mean
The two men have now totally confused each other
Tidwell leans across the aisle to Cush, attempting comraderie
Hey man,  wish  had a quarterback like you in Arizona
You're the shit
Cush looks up
Compliments blow off him like a summer breeze
Thank ya
Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't offer one
He returns to the book
Tidwell feels slighted
(loud mumble) Well you ain't that mothafuckin good
Say what
54
said -- last  heard, Jesus Christ was still in heaven
And you ain't even played in the
Cush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell rises
Nearby passengers begin to panic
This can't be happening to me
Jerry
Do something -- Jerry throws himself in front of Cushman
Knock it off
What are you, five years old
Am  taking the kids to Chuck
Cheese here
Grow up, both of you
We are a family
And we go to the draft in an Beat
Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too much
Hey, man,  dig Check
Cheese
Me too, dude
Especially that big old singin' Elvis Monkey
That's just insanity, man
Heard that
Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five
Briefly, the two clients bond
Past Tidwell, Avery smiles engagingly at Jerry
He handled the situation well
She crosses her legs, stockings swishing
The workplace excites her
-- The headquarters for the  draft is buzzing with activity
Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company
Media lights flick on, bathing Cush
Reporters chatter
("Is it San Diego or Denver, Cush
"Cush
")  Fans at the outskirts are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching, Cush
") Avery smoothly pulls  into the front position
Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles
("'ll either surf or ski
")  Jerry admires his fiancee
There is nothing more attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job
55
Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at the outskirts
He turns and exits unnoticed
--  -- Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through magazines
The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute
Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother
Both wear self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young athlete's face on it
Something about them, their pure enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way
He almost cries, for himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters
Tidwell is embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state
At last  find you
(sharply) Why the fuck am  here
feel like 'm five years late for the Prom
In a look, Jerry sizes up the situation
With a hand on Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's ego
Come on
Come with me
We're going to take a walk through this lobby
want every media guy, every player rep, everybody to see you for what you are
The best- kept secret in the
The biggest wide-receiver in the game
Let 'em see ya, Rod
And Whatever you do, don't sit down
Let 'em see how big you are
You ready
Let's do it
He is privately thrilled, but offers only: (begrudgingly) 'right
Let's walk
We hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's "Magic Bus" from Live at Leeds
56
-- Maguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past the reporters, the competing agents, the team representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a Nike crew filming an  spot in the lobby
Portable phones everywhere, in every hand
There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as if life had become a t
v
show, and everything within it concerned making other t
v
shows
Jerry works hard, introduces Tidwell around
And Tidwell is natural, polite and charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd
He does not sit down
Music continues
-- Tough red-headed beat reporter   watches Maguire and Tidwell from the opposite corner
Dennis, try not to laugh
Jerry Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the draft
) -- Arizona General Manager  , 48, is on the phone here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals
All around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming draft selections
Good,  hope he unloads him so can buy a decent quarterback
Who's he talking to
Right now, Dallas
Ha ha
They don't look interested do they
Actually
Wilburn looks concerned
-- Jerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level above the bright-white lobby
Maguire looks down at the scene
He breathes in the commotion
In another twelve hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman
57
came all the way here for that
To walk the lobby
Yeah
And it might have even worked too
Let's do it again
Jerry doesn't respond
Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a glimpse of a familiar-looking agent
It's Sugar
Jerry is consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell continues talking
(continuing) You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there
Did  ever tell you my Nike story
gotta get back to Cushman
Okay,  understand
'll boil it down for ya
Fuck Nike
All they do is ignore me
Jerry turns to Tidwell, finally focusing totally on him
You know what was great about you down there
For about five minutes, you unloaded that rather expansive, let me just say "large" chip that resides right there on your shoulder, and you know what
You were brilliant
Take care
Jerry starts to exit
You're loving me now, aren't ya
(mock serious) 'm not about love -- 'm about "showing you the money
" Tidwell nods deeply, respectfully
58
Good
was just testing ya
(beat) But just you saying that
Makes me love ya
Get some sleep
See you tomorrow
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake
'm a very good singer, man -- Call me tomorrow
might call you later
Tidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk small pack of diehard Jets fans pass, looking for autographs
'  -- We glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square
It's filled with  swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags, sweatpants, and more
Half-finished room service food abounds
Matt, Keith and Cush's stylish college girlfriend - mill about the room, basking in the glow of the man of the moment
Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap, wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a jacket
He signs for more room service and continues strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's "Something In The Way
"  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin
(to hotel waiter) Hey, what size are you
Eleven
(grandly) Why don't you grab a couple pairs of them new Nikes by the door -- Waiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door
Dude, you're like a God
59
(immediately) God, you're like a dude
It's a great line, and the room breaks up
This is charisma, the future of the
Waiter exits, as Cush continues strumming
And now Jerry speaks, importantly
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings
Okay
San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario
It's big
"Something in the way
Yeah
" Well, he's gotta go number one
"Ooooooo
" He still goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade up with New England -- they want him bad
Cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith
What happened to Denver
Denver got very silent about a day ago
San Diego's got a fever for Cush
This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft
People get crazy
And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty
Signing bonus of eight
(beat) Million
Anne-Louise whistles loudly
She is instantly embarrassed, and puts a hand up
Sorry
In the next room, the phone is ringing
60
don't know, Jerry
Should  unplug the phone
Reporters, Jerry
They been callin' all night
Just be friendly and say "no comment
" Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art  have not mastered
Jerry holds up a finger -- watch me
Jerry picks up the ringing phone
He offers a near-perfect imitation
"This is Cush
" Suddenly, everyone is, laughing
The room lightens
'   -- Bob Sugar talks on his hotel phone
It's Sugar
He must be there, right
Just sniff or something if he's there
(Jerry sniffs, panicked) Alright, buddydude
Just remember
You're swimming with the big boys now
You let your dad do all the talking
'm the one who got you the deal you needed
This is business not friendship
Be strong
You're global now
Sugar hangs up
"No comment
Jerry hangs up
The room is still laughing
His head is spinning
Hey, it's Cush on the big t
v
again
61
Hell, 'm already sick of me got "Cushlash
" More laughs
Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly
He speaks casually, directly
Look, before  go back to Denver
think we should put something down on paper
Something that says, "hey, 'm with Jerry Maguire
" He pulls out a yellow legal tablet
He scribbles a few lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous
Not right now, Jerry
Do  know everything there is to know here
(silent beat) You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you
More silence
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you
(quickly) Said who
Sugar
Hey, 'm learning as  go
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back
'm sorry,  -- brought Denver to twenty million
Denver deals with me all the time
You listened to Sugar
You let that snake in the door
Jerry touches the coffee table
Calms himself
62
(continuing) It's okay
You want Denver
'll fix this up
You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right
Another rough silence is broken by little brother Keith
(blurts) Mr
Maguire, someday 'm gonna be a famous athlete and 'm gonna sign with you'
Shut up
(beat) 'm sorry
sorry
(sympathy for Jerry) ' cool
Shot moves in on Jerry
Now
Wait
You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you
Tell me you didn't sign
(beat) Because 'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing -- We signed an hour ago
You were in the lobby with the black fella
Jerry moans
Silently, he rises and begins to gather his things
Cush hangs on to his guitar
'm sorry, Jerry
They say it's show "business," Jerry, not show friends
Jerry takes a breath before he exits
He surveys the room, settling on Cush
Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in all it's neon logo glory
63
Well
Okay
Of course
You're twenty years old, and 'm just another guy in a suit
It's all business
It didn't work out
You didn't buy my product, which is, unfortunately, mm
Let me see, there's a speech that 'm supposed to make -- right
-- "'ll be out there cheering for you
" "The door is always open
"  See
'm a class act
(breath, directly) But maybe this would have all worked, us being real human beings, coming through for each other, really, and now 'll never know
You'll never know
Weren't you curious
(they aren't) No
Okay, well, 'll be fine
And you'll be fine
And Keith bope you do call me
Flushed and embarrassed, he exits
We hang a beat on the silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on guitar
-- Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot
The Marriott lobby is packed
He is looking for Avery
Beat reporter Patricia Logan reappears
She relishes asking brutal questions, innocently
Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's had three concussions
'm sorry
excuse me
-- Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery
Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere
reps and media workers move tables and work out camera and seating arrangements
Elevated in a open  booth six feet off the ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's draft
Fans heckle him by singing the  theme
He rolls with it, expertly
Jerry spots Avery across the empty ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty tables
64
-- Jerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room
just heard
What do  do
How do  spin this
Oh honey
It's spun
She keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets
What did  do to you
She is furious with his question
Doesn't he know
It's all about you, isn't it
Soothe me, save me, love me -- Could you just stop moving
have to finish my job -- Everything's on the fucking run
Everything -- She stops
Walks to him, framed by a bank of t
v
monitors
Jerry
You and  are salespeople
We sell -- Look,  don't want a -- It's not "love me
"  It's not "trust my handshake
"  It's make the sale
Get it signed
There shouldn't be "confusion" about that
Go ahead
Jump right on into my nightmare
The water's warm
65
So honesty is outlawed here, can't be honest
She turns and exits again
He follows
Tell you what -- 'd prefer loyalty
What was our deal when we first got together
Brutal truth, remember
think you added the "brutal
" She stops, slaps down another media packet
Blows a troublesome piece of hair out of her face
Jerry, there is a "sensitivity" thing that some people have don't have it
don't cry at movies
don't gush over babies
don't start celebrating Christmas five months early, and don't tell a man who just screwed up both of our lives -- 'oh, poor baby
'  That's me
For better or worse
But  do love you
Jerry looks at his fiancee
Standing here, watching Avery coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks different to him
Avery -- She knows what's coming
She moves fast to avoid him
Don't say it
We're both ragged out right now
-- stop -- She exits back into the main ballroom
For a moment, she stops
They face off
This is it
They are quickly interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced  , 45
66
Hey
Curtis Weintraub from the Sports Popper
Haven't seen you two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest
Hello
Neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other
Curtis gets a whiff of what he walked into
(continuing; exiting quickly) Goodbye
'm warning you
Don't say it
You won't have another chance
Listen to me
No
It's over -- She continues moving into the next room
Didn't hear it
There is something missing here
You've never been alone and you can't be alone -- Listen to me, it's over
She can barely believe it
She blinks
No one has ever dumped me
'm not trying to make history
67
did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours
can make this work
(it slips out) No
She takes a breath
It sinks in
From somewhere, the small voice of her vulnerability
Oh Jerry
(steps closer) You know  didn't ever want to hurt you
She gets an odd look, shaking her head
Starts to step away, then thinks better of it
She  him in the face with the back of her hand
Jerry stands like a woozy boxer
She hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest
He sinks to the floor, sagging
backwards
She straddles him, addresses him fully, right in his bruised face
won't let you hurt me, Jerry
'm too strong for you
Loser
-- Jerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell
Both wear sunglasses
You love me now, don't you
Very much
-- is leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy athlete
-- Tidwell watches next to Jerry, as they wait for the flight
Jerry nurses a stiff drink
Everybody on this show cries now
68
Rod -- (off t
v
) You feel bad you tested positive
Quit doing blow
You feel bad about your baby girl
Why did you leave the mother
What are you doing with me, Rod
Huh
Don't you even see -- 'm finished
'm fucked
Twenty-four hours ago,  was hot
Now
'm a cautionary tale
Tidwell looks at Jerry, impassive
(continuing) See this jacket 'm wearing
You like it
don't really need it, because 'm
lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft
They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school
Why
Let's recap
Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom
Well, boo-fucking-hoo
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic -- (shaking head) No
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime
69
You are not allowed to act this way
Why not
-- They sit together
Jerry holds another drink
Man,  got a shelf life of ten years, tops
My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time
'm out of this sport in five years
What's my family gonna live on
What you get me
So don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya
" (ruefully, to attendant) Another drink please
Anybody else would have left you by now, but 'm sticking with you
said  would
And if  got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money
(the hell that never ends) Oh my God
He looks straight ahead, at the airphone in front of him
-- Dorothy finds Laurel on their small porch
There is only room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat
Laurel sits in it
He's coming over
At eleven at night
70
He just lost his best client
He called from the plane
invited the guy over
Dotty -- this is not "guy
"
This is a "syndrome
"  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, 'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome
And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you
Honey, he's engaged
And for the first time in my professional life, 'm a part of something believe in
Dorothy exits
Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room
Okay, but he better not be good looking
'  -- Dorothy puts Ray to bed
'Night buddy
This is my favorite part of your head
She kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the mirror
She checks her look, in spite of herself
Visible on the wall above Ray's bed, is her ex-husband's photo
Music
-- Jerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks later, post-flight, rolling with anything
Okay, turn here
Sharp right turn
8831 3/4 Waterloo
The cab turns onto a very small street
Cars parked on both sides
Down the street, another pair of headlights
71
Jerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it
Same with the oncoming car
(continuing) Yes, good, floor it, kill us
'   -- Door opens to reveal Jerry Maguire with brown bag, shoulder hang-up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses
'm Jerry Maguire
(super pleasant) You seem just the way  pictured you
'm her disapproving sister Laurel
Honesty
Thank you
Jerry enters, as Dorothy rounds the corner
Hey you
Hi
The lights are low and his glasses are very dark
(continuing) Thanks for inviting me over
Where's the little guy
He's asleep
Watch out for that lamp
'm glad you're home
That "alone" thing is
not my specialty
He ducks the lamp, barely
Laurel exits through his shot, miming "drinking" behind his back
Jerry takes off his glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye
72
Oh my God
Yeah
That too
broke up with Avery
Dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't quite understand
Too bad
Better now than later
We'll still be friends
'm dying here
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it
And just think if  got her the ring she really wanted
Dorothy laughs
He looks at her strangely
Suddenly she feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags
Sorry
Uh, let me see, have a seat
'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too
Do you have something to drink
Sure -- She moves to the kitchen door
She is about to exit, when Jerry begins to unburden
My brother works for the White House
He pretends he's an intellectual
He pretends he's from the east coast
She turns, not quite sure what his point is
She waits politely for Jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen
(continuing) was supposed to be the successful one
(more) 73
(cont'd) But  don't want to talk about it
And yet
My family
grew up with repression as a
a religion --you don't bitch
No moaning
Head down
Do it, whatever "it" may be
My dad
he worked for the United Way for 38 years
You know what he said when he retired
He said, " wish 'd had a more comfortable chair
" 38 years he sat in it
Do you know what 'm saying, Dorothy
Repression as a religion
'm almost as old as his chair
He rubs his face
She looks at him, and the situation slightly overwhems her
Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the taking
Beer okay
Yeah, thanks
Laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window
Dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers
heard
No kidding
looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest
(off Dorothy's look) Wait
Use the frosted glasses
(surprised) Thank you
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too,  warmed it up -- 74
That's the girl  love
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing
You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house
As opposed to twenty angry women
Dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken collide in the small kitchen
Dorothy deftly catches the food in her t-shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate
But her shirt is now stained
She starts to quietly implode, and Laurel takes command
They know each other well
Come on, let's get you another top -- They exit to nearby laundry room
/    -- Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living room where Jerry sits alone
We see Ray wander into the room and stare at Jerry
-- Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks up to see Ray
Hi
Hi Ray
-- All 'm saying
You don't have the luxury of falling for some drowning man
Be practical
Now
Which top
She holds up two tops
One is sexier with a dipped down front
The other is striped, cute, functional
75
Okay, you want to talk about practical
Let's talk about my wonderful life
Do you know what most other women my age are doing right now
They are partying in clubs, trying to act stupid, trying to get a man, trying to keep a man
not me
'm trying to  a man
She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on
(continuing) 've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life
have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours  might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath
Look at me, Laurel, look at me
'm the oldest 26 year old in the world
How do  look
Good
Thanks
-- Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a piece of rope
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and  love the zoo
Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo
Wait
want to tell you more about my dad
Let's go the zoo
Okay
've been hogging it
You're right
(more) 76
(cont'd) All my life 've been trying to talk, really talk, and no one wants to listen
You know that feeling
Ray nods vigorously
Let's go right now
Let's go to the zoo
Aw, the fucking thing
mean, the zoo is closed
You said "fuck"
Yeah  know
did
Ray loves this guy
He pats Jerry's knee
won't tell
We'll go to the zoo sometime
Okay
think  might have some time on my hands
Ray looks at Jerry's hands
don't see any
(points respectfully) Funny
Funny
(imitates him) (hears mom approaching) better go to bed
Ray hugs Jerry and exits
Jerry sits contemplating the kid for a moment
The door swings open and a harried Dorothy appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy attitude, and a tray
77
Drinks
Food
Plus,  called you a cab
(slightly confused) Good idea
Thank you
And we should keep our voices down a little
have a little boy asleep
(continuing) Right
Of course
Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm
It's not a twist-off
She hands him an opener
He opens it, inelegantly
So
Our company
She watches the drunken man, who drinks
Then coughs a little
Then stands
Okay
Lil' speech before  go
He gets up, woozy, but loose
Powerfully: (continuing) Do
Not
Worry
About
Your
Job
(beat) Our company is in good shape
You and your son
we
are just fine
You still have a job want you to feel confident
In
Me
And  have a problem with people who talk about themselves in the third person, but let me tell you something about Jerry Maguire
His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace poker
He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent
(continuing) Come after me and you will lose am a survivor
Do not underestimate Jerry Maguire
've got wits
(more) 78
(cont'd) 've got the instincts of a panther
(joust) 've got Dorothy Boyd on my side
Don't worry about me
can get jobs -- We will be fine
-- especially one like this
And  am
He becomes very aware of himself
Acting out in a virtual stranger's small-but-comfortable living room
(continuing) am drunk
He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed
Shaking his head
Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair
She breaks the personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet tip of the aloe vera plant
Truth
Sure
Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very visible at the kitchen door
Decides to ignore them
She gets closer
Sure,  care about the job
Of course
But mostly
(very honest) want to be inspired
There is something inspiring about the way she says the word "inspiring
" Me too
What you wrote inspired me
79
He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer woman's affection
Their heads inch closer together
(continuing) 'm working with you because of that memo
Mission
statement
They kiss
It turns rather passionate
She places a cool hand on his cheek
He places a hand on her breast
The taxi beeps outside
She pulls away
Both regard the hand on her breast
Well
Sorry about this hand
(he rises unsteadily) You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment
Don't worry about it, boss
Oh shit
You said "boss
" Yeah,  did
Now  feel like Clarence Thomas
No
No don't feel like Clarence Thomas
No,  do
feel like Clarence Thomas
(the worst day ever) 'm like
harrassing you
right now
may not sue
He laughs a little
Music
Unsure what more to say, Jerry rubs his face
And then: 80
Well, good evening
Good evening
He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits
Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the front porch, he recovers with style
We'll be okay
And 'm going to take my
one client and we're gonna go all the way
He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a little
He is a mess, and he knows it
(continuing; loving the dark humor) Hey
'm back
She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen
She regards the poker still in her hand
Laurel watches her conflicted, slightly lovesick sister
-- Jerry in the back of the cab
He turns for a moment, looking back at the warm house he's just left
Something is scratching at his soul, trying to get in
Music continues
He was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from his view
-- Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass
He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield
He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly pass, and slams into a padding post
Dennis Wilburn, the we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a look
Maguire forges ahead anyway
We gotta talk about his contract, Dennis
Your timing is impeccable, Maguire
Gee,  can't imagine how you ever lost Cush
81
Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly
-- Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room
Off-stage we hear a shower
In the b
g
, one of those locker-room psych-up signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind
started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotation
Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years
" Uh, not today, but -- John Taylor
Stokes
Andre Rison
all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars
They're making the money, and  got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table
understand your anxiety
Maybe you don't
Because it's not just the money  deserve
It's not just the "coin
"  It's the
He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk
(continuing) --  the kwan
That's your word
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community
and the dollars too
The package
The kwan
(impressed) But how did you get "kwan
" 82
(irritated) got there from "coin," dude
Coin, coin
kwaaaan
Great word
Towel
No,  air-dry
Rod,  say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and -- portable phone beeps
Is that your porty or mine
You
Tidwell rummages in his bag
Finds one of two porties and answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it
Hi baby
Yeah, 'm just breakin' in the new agent
He says 'm not marquee
know
know
Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of Marcee going off
(continuing) My wife is upset with you
-- The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the mirror
Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on, gesturing passionately
Tidwell, still naked, may or may not be listening
Here's what 'm saying
This is a renegotiation
We want more from them, so let's show them more from us
Let's show them your pure joy of the game, let's bury the Attitude a little, let's show them -- 83
(irritated) You're telling me to dance
No, 'm saying to be -- He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance
(little voice) "Love me love me love me
put me on t
v
" (pissed) That's the iconography of rascism, man
Rod, 'm not a rascist
'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game
Way back when you were a kid
It wasn't just about the money, was it
Tidwell gives him a look
Money was always a factor
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance
Fine
He begins gathering his things
'm an athlete, not an entertainer
These are the 's of
Get it
don't dance
Jerry rubs face
(continuing) What's wrong
Forget it
Forget it
No tell me
84
'm out here for you
You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you
It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that  will never fully tell you about
Okay
Help me help you help me help you
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude
And  dig that about you
Jerry has had enough for one day
(loopy, punch-drunk, arms flailing) Hey
'm happy to entertain you
'll see you in
Tidwell watches his agent lurch off, muttering and swaying
See, man, that's the difference
between us
You think we're fighting,  think we're finally talking
-- Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with thought
'   -- Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary
Dorothy greets him
They are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous encounter is still in the air
She hands him a list of his calls
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy
(jolted into happiness) Happy
He said "happy
" Actually he said "glad
" 85
Good
Good
Glad is good
Plus, you could use that commission
She hands him a financial report she's done
He takes a quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done
sunk most of what  had into this condo, which devalued, and -- You don't have to explain
Look, the other night,  want to apologize
(can't read her) Yeah, what happened there
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere
'm relieved you said that
mean, the other night was felt like you understood something could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk -- (beat) -- but we have a company here to think about
won't ever take advantage of you in that way again
(evenly) Oh good
You walked out on a job for me, and  won't ruin that
Exactly because  know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts
(more) 86
(cont'd) Think about everything that's gone wrong, how to fix them, and just be
alone, alone, alone
Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction
You want to go out to dinner
'   -- Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced Women's group in the living room
Jan speaks through her whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine
broke up with the Cowboy
And now he's stalking me
What's the current definition of stalking
# 1 Coming over uninvited
(thoughtful) So Romeo under the trellis
was a stalker
Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket
-- Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has arrived at the back-kitchen door
She watches unseen as Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly by a flying hug from Ray
He gives the kid an athletic bag, which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic wear, etc
("Brought you some swag
")  Ray continues hugging Jerry
-- Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid
Dorothy enters
Expertly breezy
Hey, looks like you've got a fan
87
(outdressed) Wow
That's more than a dress
That's an Audrey Hepburn movie
Yeah -- guess  got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster
(then) You meet Chad the nanny
Yeah,  did -- am  dressed okay
guess  didn't realize we were
He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date
"  The cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire
It's a new sensation for this bachelor
Don't let him stay up too late
(grandly) Hey, man, tonight 'm going to teach Ray about jazz
Good, that'll put him to sleep early
No offense
She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse
You know, you people have a jazz problem in this house
Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos
wanna go too
Laurel gives Ray a look
Ray backs down, as Jerry hears snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living room
We'll see you soon, honey
Bye
Bye you guys
88
Ray extends his arms, he wants a hug
Jerry bends down awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's cheek
All are surprised, especially Jerry
Dorothy is struck and moved
Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit with wonder
Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees one
-- Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting
She is equal parts jealous and protective
She spots keys on counter
She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on the lawn
"All Shook Down
"  Replacements
'  -- Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see are parked on the street and the front lawn
The sound of the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind them
Hey
As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can have privacy with her sister
(continuing) Forgot your keys -- (privately) That's the first time  ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just
thrilling
(eyes tear up) mean, he must have been needing that
Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to glue her emotional sister back together
She holds her arm
No no
Don't cry at the beginning of the date
(laughing, wiping tear) Oh, knock it off
89
(can't help it) And don't be a shoulder for him to cry on either
We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit
Music continues
Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood, slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the street
'  -- Jerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican restaurant
In the background, Mariachis play
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery
You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault
" It's one of the great lies, right
Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it -- Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work
know, but -- Mariachis approach the table
song for the lovers
/ (too quickly) No
No thanks
We work together
Jerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away
They do so, reluctantly
See, you choose
If you fall for someone, if you make a commitment, you should make it work
It's only when "options" entered the picture that things got bad
'm speaking historically now
It's a modern day concept, nueroticism -- how do  feeeeeel
--  think the only good thing to (more) 90
(cont'd) come from this period in history is probably the movie "Annie Hall
" (evenly) Maybe you should call her
No no no
just underestimated her
(touches wound) her temper,  guess
Why are we even talking about this
approaches the table with an armful of roses
rose for the lady
You want a -- (   (scoffs) No
No way
Jerry gives her few bucks, she exits
(continuing) Yeah
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before -- (stops herself) Jerry
What
(simply) Let's not tell our sad stories
Jerry laughs to himself
He admires her directness
(continuing) 'll be right back
Quit thinking those murky thoughts, okay
We're young, we're semi-successful
Life is good
She exits and we hang on him for a moment
91
--  -- Dorothy on the phone outside the bathroom
No, now
come on
let Chad catch the bee in a glass
He won't hurt it
Aw, buddy, you got such a good heart
love you, 'll be home soon
Can't wait to see you
Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is happening at the table
Jerry, hand on face, is embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play a mournful "Tears in Heaven
"  She smiles at the image, in fact the poetry charms her
Dorothy moves forward, grinning, fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis in another direction
Come on, let's take a walk
'  -- Music feathers into sounds of night
bug buzzing from the nearby light, Jerry swats it away
Well -- this would be goodnight
Good night
They don't kiss
They take great care not to touch too much
'll see you tomorrow
They don't move
On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him close
Kisses him
It's a good one
Good night
But they don't move
He pulls her closer by her straps
They break
She holds them up, nervous now
His lips travel down
He kisses her upper chest
She sighs deeply, she's missed this feeling
Jerry rises to kiss her lips again, tying her straps back on
Her expression says there is a decision to make
She concentrates on the styrofoam container she's brought back from the restaurant
92
(continuing; breath) think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel
Same to you
No
have to go in
live here
Right
'll come in
Okay
Wait here a second
(beat, then) Do we really want to do this
(half-unsure) Oh hell yes
She exits, as shot lingers on Jerry
That odd moment when you've crossed the line
He takes a breath
-- Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t
v
The house is now quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in evidence
He's asleep, right
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy
Still going
Chad raises his eyebrows
(continuing) Shhh
-- Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits
Chad now fully plays the part of friend with seniority
Looks the taller Jerry up and down
Treat her right, man
She's
93
(self-conscious) Yeah
well
She's great
And  know this is a little awkward, but  want you to use this
Chad ruumages in bag for a moment
Jerry is somewhat horrified at what Chad might be giving him
Out comes a cassette tape
(continuing; intense) This
is Miles Davis and John Coltrane
Stockholm
1963
two masters of freedom, playing in a time before their art was corrupted by a zillion cocktail lounge performers who destroyed the legacy of the only American artform --
Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open
Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside
-- Fierce, driving jazz
Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed
Getting hotter
The music gets wilder
Finally it is impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the bed laughing
She is left frozen, her arms open but he is gone
What is this
They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays
He looks at her
She turns away, then back again, he's still looking at her
It's a powerful moment for her
Laughter continues, the music is ridiculous
(Their sex is a big difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery
) --  -- Laurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night joint and carefully blows the smoke out the window
Laughter from the next room
She pops open the styrofoam appetizers her sister brought back from dinner
: 94
'  -- Radio clicks on
It's still dark
Only the glow of the digital lamp
Jerry alone in bed
He gets up, coughs, pulls on some pants
Manuevers through a strange bedroom, steps on toys
-- Dorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first possible drops of coffee
'm getting him up, don't worry
' Ray will never see his mother's raging physical needs
She starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second
First you gotta tell me something
No-- -- Jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices
-- Because 'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head
Please, if  start talking -- Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung
listening
Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of honesty an agent rarely hears
so what am , for taking the opportunity, Laurel
(more) 95
(cont'd) Maybe  am taking advantage
Am a bad person
All  know is that found someone who was charming and popular and not-so-nice to me -- and he died
Okay
So why should  let this guy go, when everything in my body says This One is The One
Easy, hon,  was just looking for fun details -- Oh, well, why didn't you say so
And oh,  don't know if you're interested in this detail, but was just about to tell you that love him
love him, and  don't care what you think
love him for the guy he wants to be, and love him for the guy he almost is
love him
They look at each other
The cat is way, way out of the bag
rubbing his face
Hi Jerry
Dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing there, well within earshot
As Ray pounds down the hallway in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins to crumble
The lack of control in her life is overwhelming her
Oh God
Easy, easy -- Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel
(continuing) could pretend  didn't hear, but won't,  heard everything
(to Laurel) Thank you for your honesty, as always
96
(frozen polite) Coffee, Jerry
Oh, no thanks
We bottom-feeders prefer cereal first -- Let's have Apple Jacks
Apple Jacks it is
Dorothy, good morning, darling
He kisses her on the cheek, in full view of Ray
Dorothy, still embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal
Jerry sits down for breakfast
They are an odd, but fairly complete-looking family
(continuing) What's going on, Jerry
lot
We got a big fax today
we need this commission, buddy
The sisters look at each other
Ray looks around, he feels happy, but there is something else in the room
He shrugs and continues to feel happy
'   -- Jerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room
That was great of you this morning
The Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway
(friendly, dismissive) Look, let's just root for a big offer so we can move out of this room to a real office
She feels slightly slapped down, but covers
She opens a window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand
Connecting
97
waiting for the results
Everybody has a stake in this fax
Lives are very clearly hanging on this results
Marcee shuts her eyes
Read it to me, and don't say anything unless it's over nine
There is a stunning disappointment on the fax
Jerry's heart sinks
His face slackens
Aw shit -- Rod turns away
Dorothy shuts her eyes, as Marcee opens hers
One-point-seven for three years
That's below average
We owe more than that
It is so very painful for her, as Tidwell slinks off to sit in a seat too small for him
'll go back to them
(explodes) And say what
"Please remove your dick from my ass
" Both men look at her
The outburst has surprised even Marcee
(continuing) 'm sorry
'm a little pregnant right now
feel like crying
feel like breaking the room up
Okay, we don't take this emotionally
We roll with this problem
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional
" If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional about this man
98
Marcee -- What  you stand for
Dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back
How about a little piece of integrity in this world that is so filled with greed and a lack of honorability that  don't know what to tell my kid except take a look at a guy who isn't shouting "show me the money," he's quietly broke and working for you for free
(off Jerry's pained look) Well, 'm sorry, 'm not as good at the insults as she is
No, that was pretty good
(impressed) No shit
In fact, you should read something that meant the world to me
She opens a drawer, and withdraws the Mission Statement
She is headed across the room to give it to Marcee, when Jerry swiftly intercepts it
Another time, okay Dorothy
Fine,  just -- And  appreciate that impulse
Jerry throws the Mission Statement into a bottom drawer
Camera moves to Tidwell, and we see him for the first time without his protective shield of attitude
Scared
Tell me what to do, Jerry
You tell me to eat lima beans, 'll eat lima beans
(more) 99
(cont'd) If you say take the shitty deal, that's all we can get -- "All we can get
" Can   with my agent here
Marcee is passionate
Focused on Rod
You know what you're qonna do, Rodney
You're gonna reject this shitty contract
You're gonna play out your existihg shitty contract and go be a free agent next year and the hell with Arizona
This is us, and we determine our worth
You're a fine, proud, surviving, splendid black man
Beat
Truer words
The big man looks into his wife's eyes
Honey, you are just -- No one else in the world exists
They are focused totally on each other
Jerry and Dorothy in the background, just watching the intricate machinery of this marriage
(continuing) -- the shit
She caresses the back of his neck
He pulls her to him
He gives her a small kiss
Dorothy and Jerry look at the couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable
There is a palpable forcefield around the Tidwells
They are a couple in every passionate sense of the word
After a beat: If you get injured, you get nothing
Won't happen
'm strong in my mind
It's a risk
Jerry looks over to Dorothy, who grits her teeth at the implications of the decision
100
Bet on me, dude
Bet on me like bet on you
Tidwell puts his hand out
Maguire is conflicted, but he takes a breath and shakes
'   -- Tidwell and Marcee exit
Dorothy and Jerry on the lawn
'll get you some quick work -- Good deal, man
'm sorry what  said back there
Don't be silly
My husband believes in you
We're gonna make it
Bye bye Dorothy
Take care you guys
Tidwells exit
Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone
The Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air
(continuing) Look
was up for a job in San Diego before  left
It's with the Chargers
touching down
Don't even talk about that yet
'll find something fast for Tidwell
We'll stay afloat
/ / -- Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car commercial
It is a hot day
Three other bored, large Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend, director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode
Dooler is arguing with Tidwell
101
Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee
Nearby, a camel
Look, Rod, just get on the camel
Bill, Rod, wait -- Dude, know your art form
If you put the camera down here, looking up,  look more powerful
There's no need for a camel
you got
Rod, get on the camel
(shoots look to Jerry) The sponsor wants a camel -- Jerry, back me up
It's either the camel or me
Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and stormps
Several crew members scatter in various directions
(takes the bullet) Airight
Enough
'm pulling him out of this
This isn't what had in mind anyway
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him
-- Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set
In the background, another athlete rides the camel
There you go, dude
You're learning how to represent me
We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad -- Jerry rubs his face
102
Can  ask you a question totally unrelated to your career
Oh, we gonna be friends now
What do you know about dating a single mother
Tidwell warms to the personal question
Oh  know plenty
was raised by a single mother
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego
Tidwell is always happy to hold forth
First, single mothers don't "date
" They have been to the circus, you know what 'm saying
They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings
You love her
How do  know
You know when you know
It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides
You know
No,  don't know
Then you gotta have The Talk
But  sure don't like that she's leaving
Well, that ain't fair to her single mother, that's a sacred thing, man
103
The kid is amazing
(shaking head) No
real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom
didn't "shoplift the pooty
"  We were thrown together and --  mean it's two mutual people who -- (a look) Alright,  shoplifted the pooty
Shame on you
on you
-- Jerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo
Ray straining at Jerry's arm
Life-changing decisions in the air
They offered me everything  asked for, it's only 2 hours away think it's good for us
Jerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray
They approach the reptile house
Show me the animal, Jerry
Right up ahead, buddy -- They approach the Reptile House, where a small crowd is gathered
(continuing) --  give you my favorite animal in the zoo
Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of
'm scared
What is it
It's in a cage
Do not be scared of
few people peel away, revealing
104
(continuing) The Two-Headed Corn Snake
- friendly but confused looking reptile
The snake has two heads, both identical, both twisting and battling each other for direction
Aw-ed chatter around the animal ranges from "weird" and "wow" to "mira mira
Dos cabezas
"  Few can turn away
Whoa
(quietly) Two heads
My God
Jerry is happy to play tour-guide
Both heads have brains
Both heads eat, both heads battle for direction all day long
(meaningful) Man, can  relate
The odd animal moves forward, fighting itself constantly
Me too
Dorothy just looks at the two men in her life
She turns to Anonymous Man standing nearby, staring at the animal
Is this a guy thing
It is, and it isn't
- strangely endearing, jittering and moving around the cage
'   -- -Haul is parked in the driveway
Inside the cab, a very sad Ray
Jerry approaches carefully
Ray does not look at him
He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next to him
105
'   -- Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye
You're doing the right thing mean, come on
You need to start your life and he
he needs a warm body to cushion the fall
Check out exhibit  on the front lawn -- -- We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying goodbye too many times
He's anxious not to be left alone
Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a sad Ray trudges to the cab of the -Haul
Jerry now follows Ray to the car
'  -- Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car
'm not good at this
Ray begins to cry
Jerry is incapable of dealing with it
(continuing) 'll see you this weekend, okay
Promise
Ray wails
Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so he exits
He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand
(continuing) Sure you're okay to drive this
This rig
Phht
No problem
So 'll see you this weekend
She accepts it casually, with a shrug
Airight, so goodbye and -- (simple, with shrug) love you
Jerry blinks
106
(too quick, weirdly) love you too, you know
She reacts with an odd look
The words don't sound right, and he knows that she knows
(continuing) What -- Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes
whatever
(beat) Don't make a joke of your life
Go back and read what you wrote
You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it
He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words
She kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him alone in frame
He grows increasingly uncomfortable
He watches her leave
Wait a second
moving to her car
She hears him
It's not loud enough for her
She stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip
She turns and he is now close to her
(continuing) know a way to s
to save on Medical and rent and
look
He grips one hand with the other
Dorothy looks at his strange behavior
He looks over to the cab, where Ray is making a sad face at him through the window
(continuing) what if we stayed together
What if we uh
got married
107
She looks at him
It's an odd proposal
(continuing) If  said that, would you stay
No no
Don't do that
Don't say that if you don't
Will you marry me
She looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara
'  -- Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at the wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard
Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer
In the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner, are Chad and Dooler
who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic  and well-dressed
Where are all your friends
(looking around) In the band
'   -- We are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend reading wedding vows
Ray holds the ring, and waits for his cue to offer it
But he has forgotten the cue
And every time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring
Dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame
She calms him with a hand on the shoulder
And finally the cue comes and he offers the ring
' / -- The bride and groom catch each other, post-wedding, in the hallway of the small home where the event has taken place
Wow
We actually -- 108
Yeah, we did
Giddy, Dorothy heads into the living room where Friends and relatives watch the video of the wedding
And now the enormity is evident on Jerry's face
Warm laughter in the b
g
More laughter and family noise in the background now
He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself
Jerry takes a breath and moves into the kitchen
Finds a beer
He turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first time
She raises her beer
They toast, warily
If you fuck this up, 'll kill you
(as she exits) Glad we had this talk
Nearby, Tidwell watches all
He moves to Jerry
Confidentially: You never had The Talk, did you
No
Well, this was another way to go
Jerry smiles
Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took, and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together
Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the room: (continuing) This is my agent, man
And we're all gonna have a great season
He pounds Jerry on the back, hard, shaking him like a pinata
-- Tidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit
The season is on
-- Across the room, he sees  Dennis Wilburn standing with Avery
109
He turns away, passing a monitor where elsewhere in the country, Frank Cushman is having another sensational Sunday
/ -- This is the Tidwell family ritual of watching Rod's games on the big-screen home t
v
At the center is Marcee Tidwell
Everything flows from her
Next to her is Tyson, and then the cousins, the neighborhood friends
At this particular moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a beating, but is having a hell of a game
In front of the t
v
, Tyson does the "Daddy Dance," a dance of pure joy
(proudly, to family) That's my motherfucker
Marcee reaches out and collars her dancing son
Why don't you be the first man in your family not to say that word
And then we'll let you live
Tyson nods, wide-eyed
(continuing) Now go kiss your daddy, quick
(cooly) That's why they cheer, you know
The white man sending the black man into battle
Marcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit
-- Jerry stands waiting
Bob Sugar nearby, greeting quarterback Still no Tidwell
-- Finally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet bag
How's your head
Bubblicious
110
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on
Jerry alongside
The quarterback sucks, man
He's gonna get me killed
'm a little worried -- 'm worried too
'm worried that the only reason 'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago
(interrupting loudly) , With great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to other tired players
Peace, my drunken brother
Ahd don't discuss gambling with me
Insane fan moves to another player
Jerry proceeds carefully
We can still take the offer, Rod
(stops) No
Jerry regards his slightly befuddled friend
Well, just stay healthy
will show you the kwan
(irritated) Hey, that's my word, okay
Tidwell wearily heads for the bus
Jerry stands in the parking lot
'll see you in Arizona
111
'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers
Take care, okay
You're my entire client roster
Don't  know
Now go home to your wife
What's that supposed to mean
Why are you even here, man
You could have told me all this over the phone
don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer
You don't want to go home, do you
Why are you doing this to me, Rod
'm asking you a question -- No, you're -- 'm trying to talk to you
How's your marriage
Jerry looks at Rod for a moment
It is the simplest question, and one in which he has no quick answer
Not everyone has what you have
Then why'd you get married
'm asking you as a friend
(shaking his head) You're jabbing at me
112
'm sorry  asked
No, 'm going to answer you
You want an answer
'll give it to you
(beat) Loyalty
She was loyal
(unconvincing) Everything grew from there
That's an answer
Damn right
(jab) For loyalty, you buy a dog
For love, you get married
Look
'm happy to entertain you, as always, but  have a question for you
Are we really "friends
" Why not -- Well, friends can tell each other anything, right
If we have our "friends" hats on -- (wary) think so
(intense) Airight
Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet
You are a paycheck player
You play with your head
Not your heart
In your personal life
(points) Heart
But when you get on the field -- (more) 113
(cont'd) (finger rises to Tidwell's head) -- you're a businessman
It's wide-angle lenses and who fucked you over and who owes you for it
That's not what inspires people
'm sorry, but that's the truth, can you handle it
Just a "question," Rod
Between friends
don't want to be friends anymore
Fine
Beautiful
(angry) We still having dinner in
(anqry) Only 'cause my wife likes your wife
Jerry exits
Tidwell is pissed
And hurt
(continuing) "No heart
"  "No heart
" (yells after him) 'm all heart, motherfucker
He gets on the bus
-- The Tidwells and the Maguires
Tyson and Ray run around the table of this family-style restaurant
Marcee is very very pregnant
They crack crabs for each other, seasoning for each other, feeding each other like one many-armed and loving body
-- so  go to see a so-called "black" film the other day -- (then) -- honey, no more salt for you, don't want you dehydrated for Monday Night Football
Most important game of your career
(more) 114
(cont'd) (then) --  minutes of coming attractions
All black films, all violent, 'm talking about brothers shooting brothers, Wesley Snipes with guns the size of our house, killing, blood flowing, cars crashing
blood blood blood blood
Is this all they think we want to see
Come on
enjoyed Shindler's List
Give me a little credit,  mean hooo -- hate you going to movies alone withoutme -- Oh baby -- He cracks more crab, gives her the biggest piece
Sitting across the table, stunned, just watching this intricate and perfect marriage
She takes a breath and gets a weird look
What baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
-- Marcee gives birth, Rod assisting
Jerry and Dorothy watch from behind thick glass
She hangs her arm on his shoulder, looks at him
Jerry stares straight ahead
Mortified, with dry throat
'  -- Jerry and Dorothy exhausted, alone, getting ready for bed
Dorothy sits down near him on the bed
What were you thinking tonight
Watching them go through the complete human emotional experience
115
was thinking  hope he doesn't get injured
felt responsible
Sometimes  can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours
He makes a noise
As in -- it's no big mystery
(continuing) And  really don't know your noises yet
Well, when you wonder, ask me
(unsatisfied) Okay
will
Beat
He feels inadequate
Why do you love me
Why do you love me
It is, of course, the better question
And before he can answer, there is a pounding at the door
Jerry, can  come in and watch t
v
'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes, second --                     buddy -- The door flies open and Ray comes bounding in, onto the bed, stations himself in the center and begins wrestling Jerry for the remote control
Dorothy watches, disconnected steeliness comes over her that we have not yet seen
-- Dorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of the playroom
She watches the boys and girls playing together in a room full of bright colors and games
Music
Anxiety building
116
'  -- Jerry sits finishing a phone call to an advertising account exec
He has come here, to Ray's playhouse for privacy
Tonight
Yeah, the red-eye, 'll be in Arizona on Monday
Jerry adlibs some salesmanship on Tidwell's behalf
Dorothy approaches
She gives him a few phone messages, sits down
Beat of silence
He sees a look on her face that is unfamiliar
It's my fault
What -- It's not fair to you
This whole -- (instant crisis mode) Tell me -- let me help -- took advantage of you and worst of all, 'm not alone
did this with a kid
was just on some ride where  thought  was in 1ove enough for both of us
did this
And at least  can do something about it now
(damage control) Well -- 'm not the guy who's going to run
stick
don't need you to "stick
" You want
don't know -- (it slips out) my soul or something
117
Why fucking not
deserve it
(direct) Dorothy -- what if 'm just not built that way
think we made a mistake here
But now he can't stop
What if it's true
"Great at friendship bad at intimacy
" mean, come on
It's the theme of my bachelor film -- know
watched it
sort of know it by heart
(absorbs it) don't like to give up
Oh please
My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"
if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it
Why don't we call this next road trip what it is
nice long break
What about Ray
She notes the only real glimpse of ache, in that question
There's no question you'll be friends
Of course you'll be friends
So this break
is a break-up
Come on, Jerry
You know this isn't easy for me
(more) 118
(cont'd) mean, on the surface, you'd almost think everything was fine
See, 've got this great guy who loves my kid -- (resolute, no tears) -- and he sure does like me a lot
Jerry Maguire, a man who speaks for a living, has nothing to say
(continuing) can't live that way
It's not the way 'm "built
" He moves to embrace her
She pulls away first
'  -- Jerry kisses sleepy Ray goodbye
Don't wake up
And then faces the exotic fish who now resides on Ray's table
He once lived in a tank the size of a Cadillac
The fish now hangs in a too-small bowl, looking at him
(continuing; defensive) it was just a Mission Statement
-- Jerry Maguire stretches his arms out
security wand passes over him
Deadness in his eyes
The glaze of the road on him
Music
-- We are hovering in the sky, just above Sun Devil Stadium
The classic Monday Night Football shot from the blimp
-- Tidwell's family in the living room
buzz in the air
The pregame show is on, sound-muted
Old-school on the stereo
Everybody is happy
Marcee sits in the position of honor, her new baby  in her arms
She is a tired mother, and the family celebrates her
119
He'd better not mess up on Monday Night Football
Marcee shoots Tee Pee a look
(continuing) What did  say
He gets nervous for the t
v
games
it's not a secret
/- -- Nervous Tidwell chews a toothpick as he stands checking out the field
Nearby, some cheerleaders and a man in a Pickle suit
Nothing like Monday Night, huh
What is it, 2 billion viewers
(irritated) Shouldn't you be out there doing some pickle dance or something -- Pickle Man nods and goes out to dance for the crowd
Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude -- Tidwell turns
It's Bob Sugar approaching
Laser-like, ready to feed on his insecurity
Listen,  spoke to your quarterback
He's my client, you know
And  said, "take care to get those passes down, let Tidwell look good on t
v
" Tidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick
(continuing) You should let me do more for you
would have had you your deal by tonight
Al Michaels is a friend of mine
would have had him on the air, talking about you, tonight, when it counts
Get outta here
Go
120
Where's your agent tonight
Don't know
Rod
know this is "uncool" to do this now, but you belong with the big boys
You belong with the money
You belong with -- Here comes Jerry Maguire
Get the fuck away from my guy, Sugar
Tidwell can't help it
He beams as he sees his agent approach
Jerry
You made it -- (off Sugar) Go
Flee
Sugar retreats, offering one final look to Rod, think about what  said
Thanks for coming
(bittersweet) missed ya
What can  say
-- They watch the game
(
) It's a bruiser out there tonight
(
) Arizona refusing to go into the quiet night of this rough football season
Come on, 'm trying to be poetic here
Tidwell takes a rough hit, and they respond loudly
121
(
) Ooof
Another rough hit across the middle on Rod Tidwell
Nothing poetic about that
-- Maguire moves through the box
-- Tidwell takes a hit
Hangs onto the ball
-- The Tidwell clan are banging on t
v
trays and whooping loudly
But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the unsettled look on young Tyson's face
She pulls him over to her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee
He is the only thing in her world, as she says: What does daddy say
"It looks worse than it is
Marcee gives him a kiss, as Tidwell makes another grueling gain on the field
' They don't pay enough for a man to take that kind of ugly hit -- (to others) Boy, no s-h-i-t
Big laughs from the living room
Except Tee Pee
He's gonna have nothing left for next season
They're letting him kill himself
Can you be quiet
What'd  say
-- Maguire watches as Arizona's quarterback John Swenson drops back for a pass, and is sacked
122
Philadelphia fans cheer wildly
The game is turning uglier by the minute
Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet look at the next play
Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into the end-zone
Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two different sides
This hit is bad
Worse than bad
Tidwell flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud, ball still in his hands
His head hits the astroturf, hard
Tidwell is out cold
And the ripple effect of the injury shoots through the stadium
Jerry stares at the monitor, stunned by the sudden brutality
-- We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game
Tidwell lies still on turf
Overhead, the fight music continues for a few seconds before disappearing abruptly
Players and coaches begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell
-- - The hit in replay
It is brutal
And we can see a flash of his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then
like two bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side
One cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body literally flips
The second defender then hits him at the shoulders
Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling downwards
Still holding the ball
Still
-- Silence
Utter silence
' --   you sure hope his family wasn't watching that
And then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee begins to sob
Camera catches the face of Tyson, now panicked
Scared, he embraces his mother
Maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium
He turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a guard, heading into the bright t
v
light of the football field
123
-- Gathering around the television, the family waits through a commercial for more information on Rod's injury
He should have kept his head tucked down
(immediately) Shut up
'm not putting him down,  just have a commitment to the truth
Marcee lunges for him
Can't you be loyal to your brother who  you
(she is held back) Get out of my house
Across the room, the phone starts ringing
answers
It's Jerry Maguire
-- Jerry Maguire on the portable
He took a shot
He's unconscious
'm freakin out
Oh God 'm -- Keep the phone open
'll call back
Stay calm
He's got some good doctors out there
"Stay calm
"  'm freakin
Alright, 'm freaking too
But they need you to stay calm
'll call back
124
My whole life is this family, Jerry
It doesn't work without him
She takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen Tidwell
Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field
'
-- We're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful, sleeping face
They are all
, trying to pull him out
1)    full sports bar in arizona silently watches Monday Night Football
2)   Generic living room of sports fans, all watching Tidwell pinned to the screen
3)   Generic outdoor bar-b-que as white fans watch t
4)   Tidwell living room
All gathered around the television
5)   Maguire straining at the sideline
-- Dead to the world as sound disappears
There is now only silence
- - -- The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked
We don't hear them
We see them, their motions increasingly manic
Shoving fingers in front of him
Screaming
We read their lips
("Rod
" "Rod can you hear us
")  We see the anguish and escalating fear on their faces
The Trainer leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap right in front of Rod's still face
His hands head toward each other
closer
bringing with them the first inkling of sound
getting closer and then finally coming together, bringing with him the sounds of the stadium
who blinks back to life
Concerned men are yelling very loudly, right in his face
Tidwell becomes aware he is the absolute center of attention of the entire stadium
As crowd noise begins to rise
125
Let's get you off the field
Wait
Can you feel your legs
Yeah
Just let me enjoy this for a minute
who watches
Only marginally relieved
Is he okay
Crowd noise rises
Is he okay
Can he move
Is he okay
' Not a breath is taken
Is he okay
He rises
Stadium explodes
At first on wobbly feet, he raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the crowd
Crowd noise doubles
gasping for breath
Has never felt like this before in his life
It is the pure and absolute love of the spotlight
And his fans
And then
it's real and he feels it
Tidwell breaks out in a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step
He does a high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards
who watches, now in complete disbelief
Tidwell will not let go of the spotlight
' Going absolutely nuts
Marcee hysterical, laughing and crying
126
(to Tee Pee) You ain't talking now, are you
You're a silent motherfucker
Tyson watches in silent awe of his mother
-- Finishes his small but heartfelt dance
It is a personal catharsis he is sharing now with 2 billion people
(to himself) Nike
He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field
Jerry, casually thumps his heart twice
Jerry Maguire is overcome with emotion
He sits down on a camera case, head in his hands
Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero
always knew he was great
Maguire rubs his face
Overcome
Photographers and others rush past to be closer to Tidwell
-- Jerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and Sportswriters
Success has returned, in all of it's superficial grandeur
He is a star again, by association
We catch the look on Maguire's face
Try as he might, he can't manufacture the joy of the moment
There is a void
Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn nodding, holding a thumbs up
He tries to get to Maguire, but cannot
And then a commotion behind them all
It's Tidwell
Tidwell exits the locker room
Press and media surround him
Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him
He works his way to Maguire
They hug
Cameras flash
Tears roll down from beneath his purple shades
We did it
And now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable phone rings
Both men reach for their porties
It's Maguire's
With anticipation, he answers
127
Hello
(beat) It's Marcee
She says she couldn't get through on your phone
Tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with his wife
Jerry watches, as Tidwell leans on his shoulder
( ) Bob Sugar watches from the nearby wall where he stands with his client, quarterback John Swenson
Why don't we have that kind of relationship
-- Rod Tidwell sings karoake, on stage
He's struggling through U2's "One
"  In the audience are many Arizona players, as well as most of Tidwell's family
One love
you got to share it
-- Tee Pee is stuck at home, babysitting twenty kids
-- We move past many Big Men celebrating Tidwell, singing along, sharing their Monday Night victory, onto melancholy Jerry Maguire
He watches, cellular at his side, as a approaches
Jerry Maguire
'm Tommy Bendis
You don't know me, 'm a new agent, just getting started represent that place kicker over there
(indicates kicker) wondered if you would sign this for me
Because it inspired me
He withdraws a well-thumbed copy of Jerry's Mission Statement
The blue cover is ripped along one edge
It clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's career
128
He feels the cover, flips through it a little
Memories flood with the passing pages
Shot holds on Jerry's face, as Tidwell continues singing in the background
Suddenly, an odd feeling
shiver runs up and down his spine
His forehead tingles
He rubs his face
All he can do is think of Dorothy
Just make it out "To Tommy"
Tommy
love you
-- Jerry Maquire sprints through the empty airport, heading for the last flight out of town
Music
'   -- The Divorced Women's Group in session
Laurel stands near the doorway, blowing cigarette smoke into the night
Dorothy is now a part of this group
've listened to you all tell a thousand sob stories, and  have been very judgmental
Frankly, think you've all been waaaay too comfortable with your pain
Plus, Jan, you always spill your red wine on the couch
(off Jan's guilty look) 've not been fair to you
Women need to stick together, and not depend on the affections of a man to "fix" their lives
Maybe you're all correct
Men are the enemy
Murmurs of agreement
(continuing) But  still love the enemy
Murmurs of disappointment
129
'  -- Jerry exits cab, holding hang-up bag
Looks at the house
On the other side of that window is a world he hopes he's still a part of
-- Jerry enters
Dorothy is seated toward the back
Hello
'm looking for my wife
Dorothy looks up, robbed of words
Stunned, she does not move
(continuing) Alright
If this is where it has to happen, then this is where it has to happen
Dorothy says nothing
(continuing) 'm not letting you get rid of me
How about that
He shares a look with some of the other women
She's not going to say a word
Neither do they
(continuing) This used to be my specialty was good in a living room
Send me in there, 'll do it alone
And now  just
don't know
but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because couldn't share it with you couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you
missed my wife
We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh -- (directly) love you
You complete me
Aw, shut up
You had me at hello
130
He moves to her
They embrace
Ray watches in b
g
Jerry has given this room hope
It's on their faces
At last, even Laurel gets off on her sister's happiness, as she shares a look with Chad
(sloshing wine) think we'd better go
-- Roy Firestone leans forward
your father who left the family on Christmas eve, the mother who cleaned the steps of a prison to make your tuition
The older brother who lost a leg in that tragic bass fishing accident -- Tidwell is wearing glasses now, in a somewhat scholarly mode
No, Roy
'm not gonna cry
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show
He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals
Four years for ten-point-two million dollars
Playing in the state where you grew up
-- love everybody, man love my wife
My kids
Little Tyson
My new baby Kaydee
My brother Tee Pee
love my friends, my teammates, who am leaving out
(laughing) It's only a half-hour show, Rod
' watching off-camera
Marcee crying too
Shot takes us to Jerry, Dorothy and Ray
131
Wanna send some beautiful love out to my offensive line, just a beautiful bunch of dudes, wanna thank a beautiful individual -- God, and of course the entire Arizona organization, a little slow, but they do come around
'm leaving somebody out
Amused and finally glimpsing the end of a long journey, Jerry leans over to Marcee
Take care, Marcee
We'll see you at the restaurant
She nods, emotionally, biting her lip
Oh yes
Jerry Maguire
My agent
This is a fierce, loving individual,  love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan
Ten seconds, Rod
And  love my fans, of which he is one
Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too
That about says it
Jerry watches wonderously at the monitor before leaving credits are rolling on the show
(continuing) Wait
And thank you Melvin from the Casual Man, thank you for the suit
-- Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight
They walk to Jerry's car
From across the fence, a stray baseball from a pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of them
Ray picks it up
In an easy fluid motion, he whips it back over the fence to the game on the other side
few kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of a great little throw
132
Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown shocking natural ability
They are quiet for a moment, turning slowly to look at each other
And then, not ready to deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they say quickly to the boy: Come on, Ray
Ray, let's go
Happily Ray joins them as they walk to the car
family
Music
