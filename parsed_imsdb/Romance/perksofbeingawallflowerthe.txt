a Written by Stephen Chbosky Final Draft : 1
-                                              1 The titles begin over black
We hear the sound of an old typewriter
Someone reaching out to us
The bell dings, announcing the end of a line, and we see our title
Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city
Downtown Pittsburgh
Looking out of the back window like a child in the back of a station wagon
We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us wonder
We see the bridge
And the river below
And then we enter
The Tunnel
We keep moving backwards, watching the lights
Golden, alive, and hypnotic
The music carries us as we float out of the tunnel
Onto another bridge
And over the highway
We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a window, and into

'  -                                   2 It is a neat and tidy little room
Few posters or books
is 15
He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable to everyone but his classmates
He sits at his desk, writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box
(
) Dear Friend,  am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have
Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who am, and  don't want you to do that just need to know that people like you exist
Like if you met me, you wouldn't think  was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital
And  wouldn't make you nervous

'  -                              3 Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban split level house
2
(
) hope it's okay for me to think that
You see,  haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer
Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football game
Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine
Charlie waits for them to notice him
And waits
And waits

'  -                                       4 Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil
(
) But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever, and  really need to turn things around this year
(hopeful) So,  have a plan
5
-                        5 We see it in Charlie's mind
Slow motion and wondrous
The kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in the air like a New York confetti parade
(
) As  enter the school for the first time, will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year
Charlie walks down the hall
Triumphant
Confident
Happy
(
) (') Unfortunately,  counted, and that's
: 6
-                       6 Reality
The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from Charlie's
leads the ritual, making dozens of freshmen hop down the hall
Hop, freshman toads
Hop
Move it, boys
As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall
(
) 1,385 days from now
pass, wearing their letter jackets
3
Man, you got big
Worked out all summer
Rock hard, dude
At the front of the pack is   (17), the quarterback
He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly
The big man on campus
Nice guy, too
Would you guys get a room
They laugh
Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them
Trying to make himself as small as possible
(
) (trying to be optimistic) Just 1,385 days

-  -                   7 Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister is 17 and a beautiful type , straight  priss
(
) In the meantime, 'd hoped that my sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek would have let me eat lunch with their earth club
Seniors only
(barks to Derek) What are you doing with a plastic spork
Candace turns to her boyfriend, , 17
Derek is such a pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail
don't want to bring back silverware-- Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer
Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog
Charlie watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria

-                                            8 Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a great time with their friends
He sees a pretty girl with blonde hair having the best first day
This is , 14
4
(
) When my sister said no,  thought maybe my old friend Susan would want to have lunch with me
Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away
(
) (') In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around, but now she doesn't like to say hi to me anymore
Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays
(
) (') And then there's Brad Hays, who's the quarterback of our team
Before my brother went to play football for Penn State, he and Brad played together
So, thought maybe he'd say hi to me
But Brad's a senior, and 'm me, so
who am kidding
Brad catches Charlie staring at him
Awkward
9
-                                            9 Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil
(
) On the bright side, one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen
He even drew on Mr
Callahan's legendary goatee with a grease pencil
Meet  (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over high school
He is the class clown, performing a perfect imitation of the teacher, Mr
Callahan
Boys, the prick punch is not a toy learned that in 'Nam back in '68
"Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks
" The laughter suddenly dies as the real
(57) walks up behind the oblivious Patrick
(') But you know what happened
That prick punch killed my best friend in a Saigon whorehouse
5
Patrick suddenly feels Mr
Callahan behind him
Oops
heard you were going to be in my class
Are you proud being a senior taking freshman shop, Patty-Cakes
My name is Patrick
You call me Patrick or you call me nothing
Okay
Nothing
The class laughs
Except Charlie
He watches Patrick take the long walk back to his seat
(
) felt really bad for Patrick
He wasn't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything
He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better
Everyone open your safety guides
Nothing
why don't you read first
Patrick opens the book
Chapter 1
Surviving your fascist shop teacher, who needs to put kids down to feel big
(to the class) Oh, wow
This is useful guys
We should read on
Charlie smiles
He loves him already
10
-                                     10 The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill  Mockingbird
Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the plastic pouch, and writes
"
" (
) My last class of the day is advanced English, and 'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school
girl with braces smiles at him
6
(whispers) Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot
The kids around him laugh
Charlie's ears turn red
At the blackboard, the teacher writes his name
Mr
Anderson
But you can call him  (27)
Bill is an idealist
Shhh
'm Mr
Anderson
And thanks to Teach for America, 'm going to be your teacher for freshman English
This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird
Genius book
Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz
All hands go up
Except Charlie's
Bill paces the rows
(') 'm shocked
Alright
You can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book
Anyone
As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats
(') He's British
He also invented the serial
In fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails
Hence, the term cliffhanger
Anybody
Shakespeare
That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels
Anybody else
(off their silence) The author was
Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has already written
Charles Dickens
(') Charles Dickens
However, if you and had gone to a play in Shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies
Can you imagine that
We would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office
And that's where we get the term
anyone
7
(
) "Office Depot
" "Office Supplies
" Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that Bill is staring at him
Waiting for him to raise his hand
'll give you a free "" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right
Charlie looks down
He's not going to answer
(') Box office
The kids groan
They should have known
Charlie smiles to himself
He's going to like this class
11
-                                       11 The bell rings
The students chatter their way out of class
The last to leave is Charlie
You should learn to participate
Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board
(') Why didn't you raise your hand
(off Charlie's shrug) They call you teacher's pet
Freak
(off Charlie's nod) used to get spaz
mean, come on, spaz
Charlie smiles
Bill takes a moment
Then
(') So,  heard you had a tough time last year
But they say if you make one friend on your first day, you're doing okay
Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend  make today, that would be sort of depressing
Yeah
could see that
Don't worry, Mr
Anderson
'm okay

Bill nods and watches Charlie exit
He gets swallowed up by the hallway as the bell rings
12
-  -                      12 Charlie looks through the thick office glass
He sees Patrick use his charms on
, (58) the Principal
(to Mrs
Small) would happily not take shop
Out of nowhere, the   grabs Charlie's book
Hey, Freshman Toad
The bully rips the cover
He throws it on the ground as his friends laugh and disappear down the hall
Charlie walks up and picks up his book
(
) Well,  have 1,384 days to go
And just so  say it to someone, high school is even worse than middle school
13
'  -                                       13 Charlie walks up the path to his house
(
) If my parents ask me about it,  probably won't tell them the truth because  don't want them to worry that  might get bad again
14
'  -                                 14 Charlie tapes his book cover back together
He looks up as his dad comes home from a long day
Charlie's mom hugs him
(
) If my Aunt Helen were still here,  could talk to her
And  know she would understand how  am both happy and sad, and 'm still trying to figure out how that could be
just hope  make a friend soon
Love always, Charlie
15
'   -                        15 Charlie stands in the kitchen, pouring his milk
9
(
) Charlie, come on
His family is seated around the table
Candace's boyfriend, Derek, is their special guest
Mmmm
This chicken paprikash is delicious, Mrs
Kelmeckis
Charlie's father rolls his eyes, then reads his sports page
Thank you, Derek
It's Charlie's favorite
He was a little nervous about starting high school, so  made it
You feel a little silly being nervous now, huh, champ
Yes, sir
sure do
Charlie carries his milk back to the table
He quickly sits, hoping someone will change the subject
told you
Just give 'em a smile and be yourself
That's how you-- "--make friends in the real world
" You're cruisin' for a bruisin'
Freshman year is tough, but you really find yourself
(deep eye roll) Thanks, Derek
16
/   -                           16 Charlie's father and mother watch a local sports show
Charlie passes by them with ice cream on his way downstairs
think you could be a little nicer to Derek
10
'm sorry
The kid's a pussy
can't stand him
Charlie moves to the entry hall
He looks through the screen door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye
As Derek walks to his mom's Mercedes, Candace joins Charlie
(waving from car) hope you love the mix  made
The cover is hand-painted
When he gets into his car, she hands Charlie the mix tape
Charlie, do you want this
Are you sure
He gives me one every week
17
'   -                                       17 Charlie sits on his bed, reading To Kill a Mockingbird, the cover taped back together
We see Derek's mix
Autumn Leaves
rotate in his old tape recorder
(
) Hey, Babe
This next one might be a little sad, but it reminded me of your eyes
The first notes of The Smiths' "Asleep" begins
As Morrissey sings, Charlie keeps reading
And reading
: 18
'  -                                         18 The reading is done
Charlie proudly puts To Kill a Mockingbird on his newly dubbed "Shelf of Fame
" 19
-  -                    19 The songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to day life over the next few weeks
Charlie exits his English class
wait for him, led by
Did you already do the term paper on To 11
Silence
They grab and drag him into the boy's room
We hear the toilet flush for the swirly
20
'  -                                        20 Charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin
He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with  cola
21
'   -                               21 Charlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions on
He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him
22
-  -                      22 Charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria
Not giving up
Looking for somewhere to sit
: 23
-  -                      23 Charlie sits by himself in the corner
He looks around the cafeteria, wanting to break in
Not knowing how
After a moment, he returns to his book
The song ends
24
-   -               24 Friday Night Football in Western,
Charlie buys his Coke and nachos and wanders to the bleachers
He sits alone, trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students
When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears
Come on Devils
Woooooo
Charlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off pass him, taunting
Hey, Nothing
Hey, Nothing
Suck it, virginity pledges
Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly
After driving himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches
Hey
Patrick
12
Hey
You're in my shop class, right
How's your clock coming
My dad's building it
Yeah
Mine looks like a boat
(off Charlie's awkward silence) You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends
No
'll sit if that's okay
Patrick motions for Charlie to sit
Charlie sits
Elated
Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by the way
It's an endless nightmare
And these assholes actually think they're being original
Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field
Charlie dries his hands on his pants
So nervous
5 second silence that feels like a year
Think of something to say
Anything
So, uh
you like football
Love it
Then, maybe you know my broth-- Hey, Sam
Charlie looks up
Standing there is the prettiest girl he's ever seen
(17) would make every mother proud and every father nervous
She is alive, adventurous, and a world class flirt
Great attitude
Great taste
Great banter
Question
Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting
Yes, they call it the men's room
13
Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick
Charlie tries to remain casual
Hang in there, buddy
Well,  finally got hold of Bob
Party tonight
No
He's still trying to shag that waitress from the Olive Garden
He's never tossing that salad
Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field
The kids clap
Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick
(about Charlie) Patrick
who's this
This is
Uh
Charlie
Kelmeckis
Kelmeckis
No shit
Your sister dates Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she
Is that what they call him
Awww
Leave Pony Tail Derek alone
You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick
try, Sam
try
It's nice to meet you, Charlie
'm Sam
Sam extends her hand to Charlie
Every nail a different color
They shake
Then, Sam grabs a nacho
Zoinks
So, what's the plan, Sam
You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house
14
Can't
She got caught watering down her parent's brandy with iced tea
Let's just go to Kings
(turns to Charlie) Hey
we're going to Kings after the game if you want to come
Charlie nods just as Brad Hays tosses a touchdown pass
The fans go crazy
Especially Patrick
Charlie smiles
25
-                              25 The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter
The place is packed
Patrick and Sam drink coffee while Charlie eats his brownie
They're all excited
Do you have a favorite band
think The Smiths are my favorite
Are you kidding
love The Smiths
The best breakup band ever
What's your favorite song
Asleep
It's from Louder Than Bombs heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape
That works on so many levels
could make a copy for you
Thanks
What about Eide's
You love Eide's, right
(never heard of it) Yeah
They're great
Not a band, Charlie
It's an old record store downtown
15
used to be popular before Sam got me some good music
So, watch out, Charlie
She'll ruin your life forever
That's okay
Brad Hays, the quarterback, passes with his posse
Taunting
& Hey, Nothing
Hey, Nothing
Let it go
Jesus
It's an old joke
It's over
Sam laughs
She loves watching Patrick get riled up
So, Charlie
what are you going to do when you get out of here
My Aunt Helen said  should be a writer, but  don't know what 'd write about
You could write about us
Yeah
Call it Slut and The Falcon
Make us solve crimes
Sam laughs
Charlie smiles
You guys look happy together
How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend
(off their laughs) What
He's my step-brother
My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago
But Sam's not bitter
Make no mistake
Absolutely
'm not a bulimic
'm a bulim-ist
16
They laugh at their inside joke
Charlie has no idea what's so funny
'm sorry
don't know what that means
She just really believes in bulimia
(cracking up) love bulimia
26
'  -                                       26 Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck
The music blares
Thanks for paying, Charlie
(so eager) No problem
Thanks for the ride
Hey
maybe 'll see you around in school
(distracted - to Patrick) God, would you turn that down
You're going to make us deaf
Bye, Charlie
Bye, Charlie
Okay
Bye
Charlie waves as the truck leaves
The look on his face
The happiness from one night of company
27
'  -                                       27 Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news
He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty
He hears the  playing downstairs in the basement
28
-                                   28 As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting
(
) 'm sorry
can't do anything about it
Please talk to me
17
(
) Maybe your mom and  should have a "drive us to our hair appointment" contest
Then,  could spend a Saturday with you
Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find
There's nothing  can do-- Do you always want to be a mama's boy
am not a mama's boy-- Yes
You are
Every time  go to your house-- Shhh
Shut u-- -- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia with Candace
Go to Pitt, Derek
Mommy needs you to stay at home because she can't drive herself
" She's only 51
,
29
'  -  -                    29 Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight
Derek's neck is red
Dangerous angry
Candace keeps digging
And you just stand there like a little bitch dog
Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face
It's not a movie slap
It's a real slap
Dead sound
And after it, silence
Candace turns and sees Charlie
It sobers her up
Charlie moves at Derek
Candace stops him
(') Charlie, just go
can handle it
Just don't wake up mom and dad
She pushes him out of the room and closes the door
18
30
'  -                                        30 Charlie sits at his desk
So disturbed
He hears a car start outside
He moves to his window and looks down at Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes
Derek is crying
Candace comforts
After a beat
they kiss
Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face
(
) Hey, look who's here
: 31
-  ()                                  31 The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and entering the house
Aunt Helen carries a suitcase
The children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad
They just know they love her
Little Charlie stands at the top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday clothes
There are balloons
And streamers
Welcome home, Aunt Helen
Oh
Look at you all, dressed so nice
Aunt Helen smiles at Little Charlie on top of the stairs
: 32
-  ()                                    32 Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the house
She is startled when she sees Charlie
They whisper
What are you doing
Look,  egged him on
You saw it
He's never hit me before
promise he'll never hit me again
She's about to go back downstairs when
Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends
silence passes between them
Then
19
Charlie
this is Pony Tail Derek can handle him
Will you trust me
Please, don't tell mom and dad
With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs
Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled
33
-                                           33 The Homecoming Dance is in full swing
God bless everyone
Especially Charlie
He's alone at the wall, dressed in his Sunday suit
To us, adorable
To himself, in living hell
Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek
As happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the right thing by keeping quiet
The song ends to applause
After a beat, Charlie turns away
That's when he sees Sam and Patrick at the punch bowl
We hear the first notes of "Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners
Oh, my God
They're playing good music
Holy shit
They are
They're playing good music
(total mischief) Living room routine
Living room routine
Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is
It starts slow
"So over it" hand moves
little shoulder
And then, the best of swing
30 seconds of genius
Charlie takes a breath
Then, he tries desperately not to look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them
He bobs his head like a dork
And once he gets close, Patrick and Sam turn and find him
& Hey
Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a circle
Their own island
After a moment, Sam moves around Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance
20
34
'  -                                          34 The party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town
Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing
God, it's freezing
But you wore that toasty costume
It's not like you're trying too hard to be original
Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo
Are you sure it's okay that  come
Of course
Just remember, Charlie
Bob's not paranoid
"He's sensitive
" Sam knocks
The door opens, revealing  (20)
Bob was the cool high school kid, who never quite left
He's stoned so often that people can't tell the difference anymore
Sam
that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease
Will you marry me
Only if  have Patrick's blessing
Patrick
You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute
So, 'm going to have to say "no" on that one, but nice try
Charlie
Patrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam
Touche
35
'  -                                35 21
Charlie
this is a party
The music blasts
Charlie's eyes are our guide
As they walk through the crowd, you can smell it
Stale beer and cigarette smoke
High school parties
The room is packed with kids playing quarters
Others pouring vodka into a watermelon
(') This is what fun looks like
Patrick smiles when he spots two friends
(') You ready to meet some desperate women
and  (both 17) sit on the sofa together
Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely bossy
Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in college
Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary Elizabeth's "beta female
" (') Here, have a seat
Hey, ladies, meet Charlie
Charlie, meet ladies
They shake hands and say their hellos
(') This is Charlie's first party ever
So, expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you
Patrick, you're such a dick
Where the hell did you go
The dance was a little boring, don't you think
You're so selfish
We looked everywhere for you
You could have told someone
Cry me a river
How is it that you got meaner since 22
Just lucky  guess
think you're doing something wrong
Or something very right
Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam calls out from the other side of the room
(
) Hey
Look who's here
The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback, enter with Sam and Bob
Patrick approaches them
Charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls
He's shocked
Is that Brad Hays
Yeah
He comes here sometimes
But he's a popular kid
(offended) Then, what are we
Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't
The girls turn, ignoring him
Bob approaches with a tray
Charlie, you look like you could use a brownie
Thank you
was so hungry at the dance
was going to go to King's, but  didn't really have any time
Thanks
Bob smiles
Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance
Charlie bites into the brownie
The icing gushing between his teeth
The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale as he chews and chews and chews
36
'  -                                         36 After a beat, the music changes, and the image exhales back down to Charlie, who is now
baked out of his mind
The 23
whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks
Have you guys felt this carpet
This carpet feels so darn good
(laughing) Charlie, what do you think about high school
High school
Bullshit
The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center
And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out
And why do they give out letters for marching band
That's not a sport, and we all know it
This kid is crazy
Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut
And Mary Elizabeth,  think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs
(off their laughter) 'm really sorry
That sounded like a compliment in my head
Oh, my God
Well, it's kind of true
Shut up
Sam enters the room
Takes quick stock
Then
Bob, did you get him stoned
Come on, Sam
He likes it
Just look at him
How do you feel, Charlie
24
just really want a milkshake
The entire room explodes with laughter
Charlie loves that people find him so funny
37
'  -                                        37 Sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender
Charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake
Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself
You know what mean
Okay, Charlie
Let me make the milkshake
What a great word
Milkshake
It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy
'm guessing you've never been high before
Me
No
My best friend Michael
His dad was a big drinker
So, he hated all that stuff
Parties, too
Well, where is Michael tonight
Oh, he shot himself last May
Sam looks up
Shocked silent
Charlie is just stoned
(') kind of wish he'd left a note
You know what  mean
(off her sad nod) Where's the bathroom
It's up the stairs
25
Charlie wanders off
Sam watches him go
38
-                                              38 Charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in a large ornate mirror in the hallway
Charlie
Charlie
Weird
Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost
He finds the door to the master bedroom and opens it
He sees Patrick and Brad Hays
kissing
(') Woah
Charlie
(nervous) Who is that kid
Relax
Relax
He's a friend of mine
Stay here
Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie
didn't see anything
know you saw something, but it's okay
Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching
(') Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to know
wait, are you baked
"Like a cake
" That's what Bob said
And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us
And everyone laughed, but  don't know what's funny
Okay, Charlie, listen
need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad
This has to be our little secret
26
Our little secret
Agreed
Thank you
We'll talk later
look forward to that big talk
Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door
39
'  -                                          39 The party has thinned
Sam watches Charlie drink his milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth
Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice
It's even better than the first one
Patrick walks downstairs
Sam motions him over
(barely audible whisper) need to talk to you
Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself don't think he has any friends
Patrick turns to look at Charlie
He feels so bad for the kid
Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd
Everyone
Raise your glasses to Charlie
Charlie looks up
little paranoid
Everyone is staring
What did  do
You didn't do anything
We just want to toast our new friend
(off his look) You see things
And you understand
You're a wallflower
Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants
He looks around the room at the nods and friendly faces
(') What is it
What's wrong
27
Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet
So, everyone
& To Charlie
They all drink
Sam approaches him
knowing smile
Welcome to the island of misfit toys
Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud

'  -                                         40 The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel
Patrick drives
Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel Song
" The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our prototype for tone
My God
What is this song
Right
have no idea
(to Charlie) Have you heard it before
Never
(light bulb) Wait
Let's go through the tunnel
Sam, it's freezing
Patrick, it's the perfect song
No
Mama Patrick says no
Patrick, it's Sam
It's Sam talking to you, 'm begging you to drive me-- 28
(laughing) Alright
concede
Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed
She grips the flood lights to steady herself as she stands
What is she doing
Don't worry
She does it all the time
Turn it up
You got it, your highness
Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel, just as the truck flies into
We go behind the truck
Rising as Sam puts her arms in the air
The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from Sam's feet up her shivering legs
Past the band-aid on her right knee
To Sam's face as she looks down
Into the camera
Right at us
For we are now
Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit
So happy to have friends
Happy to be alive
Charlie gets this look on his face
Patrick notices and smiles
(') What
feel infinite
The truck flies out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel onto the bridge
Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms
Free and young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life
: 41
'  -                                 41 We see Charlie proudly put a Smiths poster on his wall next to photos of his new friends
He dances to his desk, listening to Air Supply's "All Out of Love" on his Walkman
29
(
) Dear Friend, 'm sorry  haven't written for awhile, but 've been trying hard not to be a loser
As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs
'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts
Charlie sits at his desk, writing and lip-synching
(
) For example,  am trying to participate by listening to Sam's collection of big rock ballads and thinking about love
Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant
completely agree
42
'  -                                   42 As the students file out, Charlie hands his paper to Bill in exchange for a beat up copy of The Great Gatsby
(
) am also studying extra books outside of class
As it turns out, Mr
Anderson is a writer
He even had a play put up in New York once, which  think is very impressive
He and his wife might go back there after this year
know this is selfish, but  really hope he doesn't
Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill
43
-                                            43 Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on his tray
He looks at the gang at their table
He sits with them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine
(
) My favorite time, though, is lunch because get to see Sam and Patrick
We spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show
It's called Punk Rocky
Mary Elizabeth is really interesting because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a "long day
" 30
44
-                                          44 The xerox spits out copies of
Halloween Issue
Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog
(
) Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school
She also steals jeans from the mall
don't know why because her family is rich, but 'm trying not to be judgemental
Especially since  know how they were all there for Patrick last year
Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened
Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life
[Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's  of Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend
] 45
-                                     45 Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer
Moments later, Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field
When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around
46
-                                            46 Patrick whispers while the gang studies their  books
(
) Then, Monday in school, Brad would say, "Man,  was so wasted
don't remember a thing
" This went on for 7 months
47
-                    47 Charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes
He turns to see Brad with his father and mother
Proper family
Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back
(
) When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick
Then, he started to cry
31
(
) (') saying his dad would kill him
And saying he was going to hell
48
-                                               48 We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library
They reach the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they simply
(
) Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober
asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him
Brad sits down with his football pals
Patrick joins Charlie and Sam at their table
Charlie looks over at Sam, studying hard for her 's
(') think that  understand because really like Sam
asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties
guess she had a reputation
But  don't care
'd hate for her to judge me based on what  used to be like
49
'  -                                    49 We see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box
(
) So, 've been making her a mix tape so she will know how  feel
The two cassettes run
The song is just about to finish when
the side runs out of tape and snaps off
(') Ah, shit
50
-                  50 The marquee announces it's time for the
51
-                  51 Rocky Horror Picture Show
The  , dressed as Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy
32
Gimme an
Gimme an

Rocky
Rocky
Gimme a
Gimme a
Gimme       Rocky
a
What's that spell
The crowd cheers
Charlie claps from the front row
52
-                       52 The movie is in full swing
Charlie watches Sam as Janet in the Floor Show
Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly
Especially the body
She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in full drag is
Patrick
Whatever happened to Fae Wray
That delicate, satin draped frame
As it clung to her thigh, how  started to cry 'cause wanted to be dressed just the same
Patrick is a rock star
He approaches Charlie
Putting his ass in his face
Charlie is freaked out and laughing
Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling
(') Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
Erotic nightmares beyond any measure
And sensual daydreams to treasure forever
Can't you just see it
Woah oh oh
Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick, Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia),  (21), an art student with a model's body (as Rocky)
and of course
Sam
Charlie watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt)
53
'   -  -                      53 We hear the chorus of "Don't Dream It, Be It" as Charlie watches all of the exciting cast members at the after-show party
Charlie sees a photo of Sam's naked back on the wall of Craig's loft
Very arty
Very black & white
Charlie's lust (and guilt) are now at 11
Alice looks at the photo
It's gorgeous, Craig
What did you use
Craig is impressive to high school kids
He's a little pretentious
But his art school life
His red wine
His loft
Wow
Right now, he holds court in the wine line
33
Color film, but black and white paper for the printing
My professor gave me an "," but for the wrong reasons
Most of them are idiots
You'll see what  mean when you get to college
How were your 's by the way
(worried) 1150
think 'll get into
Yeah,  hope so
(cruel to Alice) 1490
Harvard
Face
54
'   -                       54 Charlie sees Sam alone on the loft steps
She looks a little down
He hands Sam a plastic cup and sits next to her
Hey
Are you okay
Yeah
Yeah
But  got my  results back
Oops
You can take them again
Yeah, it's just if 'm going to Penn State main campus,  have to do much better
wish  would have studied freshman year
was a bit of a mess
'll help you study for the next one
Will you
Yeah, of course
Thanks, Charlie
Charlie summons his courage
He hands her the mix tape
34
(') What's this
Just a mix tape
No big deal
My parents have a pretty good stereo
It's all about that night in the tunnel couldn't find that song we were listening to, but 'm still searching for it, so-- It's okay
These are great
You have really good taste, Charlie
Really
Yeah
Way better than me as a freshman
used to listen to the worst top 40
No
Yeah,  did
But then  heard this old song
Pearly Dew Drops Drop
And thought someday  would be at a party in college or something
And 'd look up and see this person across the room
And from that moment, 'd know everything was going to be okay
You know what  mean
(devastated in love) Yeah
55
'   -                               55 The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad
Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade
Like she is dancing with him
But she isn't
wider angle reveals that she is slow dancing with
Craig
Charlie is 15 year old
No filter
Just feeling
Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room
So, what do you think
don't know
35
hope it works out
Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend
No, shit
Who could forget Mr
Car Wash Loser
just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys
keep telling her
don't make yourself small
You can't save anybody
Craig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends
Sam goes into the kitchen
Craig approaches Charlie
Turns off his mix tape
Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid
How about something a little more upbeat
Craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down
(') Sam tells me you want to be a writer
Yeah
Don't you write poetry, Craig
No
Poetry writes me
You know
Charlie sighs
Craig's upbeat song begins to play
He dances over to Sam
Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam hug on Craig
56
-  -                      56 In a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers
Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall
57
-                                     57 The bell rings
Charlie sets down his On the Road paper
Wow
That was fast
You want another one
36
Charlie nods
Bill smiles and reaches into his desk
He hands Charlie a copy of  Separate Piece
Charlie takes the book and starts to walk out, but he turns back
Mr
Anderson
can  ask you something
Yeah
Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date
Are we talking about anyone specific
Charlie nods
Bill looks straight at him
Not preaching
Coming from a history of personal experience and pain
(') We accept the love we think we deserve
Can we make them know they deserve more
We can try
Charlie smiles
58
-                          58 Charlie waits nervously at a booth
He sees Sam enter
He fixes his hair, then pretends to read his
Hey, Charlie
Hey, Sam
didn't see you come in
You want to work on probabilities and statistics
Sam nods
They open their books, and a Christmas song begins
In a quick passage of time, we see them study next to Halloween decorations
Then, Thanksgiving
And finally, Christmas decorations
59
'  -                                    59 The song continues
Charlie's mom and sister hang the Christmas ornaments as Charlie helps his dad find that "one 37
Hey, dad
Can  have 30 dollars
(old joke) 20 dollars
What do you want 10 dollars for
Sam is doing secret santa
It's her favorite thing in the world
Please
Charlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a bill
It's a fifty
Dad winks, in a great mood
Have fun
Thanks

Sam
Patrick
Wrapped gifts are deposited
Mischief smiles
Lockers closed
Everyone loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks
61
'  -                                  61 Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the Rye
He smiles
Charlie
this was my favorite book growing up
This is my copy, but  want you to have it
Thanks
Have a great Christmas break
You too, Mr
Anderson
62
-                                            62 Mr
Callahan, the shop teacher, looks at a Sad Sack Girl's clock
He takes a moment, and then
Terrible stain
38
He moves to Charlie's dad's amazing clock
He hands Charlie an  on a piece of paper
(') That's pretty good, Charlie
Mr
Callahan moves to Patrick's
No stain
No finish
Lop-sided
The ugliest clock you've ever seen in your life
(') You've got to be kidding me
If you fail me, you get me next semester
Mr
Callahan writes a grade and slaps it down

Charlie and Sam cheer as Patrick screams at the top of his lungs
Woo
Minus
It's over
It's over
Ladies and gentlemen,  am below average
Below average
Patrick screams at the city in the distance
Below average

Hey, guys

Everyone cheers
Sam hugs Charlie

'  -   -                 65 Charlie carries Sam on his shoulders past the Christmas Tree
Sam wears a Santa Hat like a hot elf
No more applications
No more 's
Thank you, Charlie
They pass Mary Elizabeth as she opens her final present
39
Multiple pairs of blue jeans
Wow
This is a really tough one, but 'm going to have to guess
Alice
Alice smiles
Bob nudges her
Guilty as charged
Mary Elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag
(') Wait, guys
a receipt
She actually paid
Impossible
'm so touched
Alice laughs
Patrick pours everyone brandy
The kids look ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous
Where's Craig
He went home to Connecticut
He'll be back for New Year's Eve
'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight
Sam nods, then turns
Charlie is delighted
No Craig
The kids settle in the living room in front of the fire
Alright, big brother by 3 weeks
Who's your secret santa
'll tell you, Sam
This one's tough have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and a mix with the song "Asleep" on it
twice
Charlie starts snickering
He can't help himself
(') mean,  have no idea
This collection of presents is so gay that  think  must have given them to myself
But despite that distinct possibility, 'm going to have to go with
drum roll
Charlie
40
Charlie holds up his hands
Yay
They all cheer
Alright, Charlie
it's your turn
Charlie and Patrick switch places
Charlie stands
Okay
Uh,  have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt
was ordered to wear them all tonight
So, 'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth
Huh
Now, why do you say that
don't know
She bosses people around sometimes
The gang cracks up
Mary Elizabeth is pissed
What the hell is wrong with you
Sorry
Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually
me
You got me clothes
Why
Because all the great writers used to wear great suits
Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom
Delve into our facilities
Emerge a star
Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents
Can you hand these out while 'm gone
Wait a second
There's only secret santa presents
There are rules, Charlie
Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas
Hand them out, Sam
41
Sam gives out the presents
The group rips them open
Alice looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription
"Alice,  know you'll get into
" Alice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with
40 dollars
(reads card) "To print Punk Rocky in color next time
" Bob blows soap bubbles into the air
Stoned
Mesmerized
He knows me
He really knows me
Sam looks at her present
An old 45 record of The Beatles classic "Something" with a card
She reads the card
Holds it to her chest
Very moved
Come on out, Charlie
They all chime in
"Let's go, young man
" "Charlie
Charlie
" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his entrance play off their faces
The reverse angle reveals
Charlie dressed in his suit
Like the best of English mods in the 60's
For those of you who know the book, this is the cover
They all clap
It's magic
Yeah
What a display of man  have ever seen
Sam and Charlie look at each and smile
66
'  -                                        66 The door opens
Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room
Where are we going
It's a surprise
Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light
Sam's room is so cool
shrine to music
xerox that says "The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves
" Virgin Mary icons
Snow globes
Kitsch
42
Is this your room
It's so cool
Thanks
Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk
You got me a present
With all that help on my Penn State application
Of course  did
Open it
Charlie lifts up the box to reveal an
don't know what to say
You don't have to say anything
Sam goes over and types
"Write about us sometime
" He smiles and types back
" will
" They look at each other
We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs
(') 'm sorry we can't be here for your birthday
That's okay
'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad
'm in such a great mood,  don't think even he could ruin it
feel like 'm finally doing good
You are
Me
What about you
When  met you, you were this scared freshman
And look at you in that suit
You're like a sexy English school boy
saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out
(innocent laugh) No
43
Innocent
Worst kind of guys
Never see you coming
And parents love you
That's like
extra danger
Well, it hasn't worked so far
Come on
You've never had a girlfriend
Not even a 2nd grade valentine
He shakes his head
(') Have you ever kissed a girl
No
What about you
Have  ever kissed a girl
(laughs) No
Your first kiss
Sam gets this strange look in her eyes
little haunted
My first kiss
was 11
His name was Robert
He would come over to the house all the time
Was he your first boyfriend
He was my dad's boss
Charlie goes silent
(') You know Charlie,  used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit
And get wasted all the time
But now
feel like  have a chance
could even get into a real college
It's true
You can do it
44
My Aunt
she had that same thing done to her, too
And she turned her life around
She must have been great
She was my favorite person in the world
until now
Sam smiles
She's very moved
Charlie,  know that you know  like Craig
But  want to forget that for a minute
Okay
just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you
Okay
Charlie nods
And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him
It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him
Holding on for lonely life
When the song crescendos, and they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other
Finally
(') love you, Charlie
love you, too
67
'  -                            67 The porch lights are as golden as Charlie feels right now
We see the girls wave to each other and hug Sam
"Merry Christmas
" "Good luck at your dad's
" "See you at New Year's
" Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway
Have a good time at your mom's
Thanks
And Charlie
since you were born on Christmas Eve,  figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents
So, thought you should have my clock
From the heart
45
Thank you, Patrick
Sam gives Charlie one last hug
Patrick and Sam watch their friends leave
love you guys
68

Above the city on Christmas Eve
69
'  -                                          69 The front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad
Hey
Look who's here
He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's older brother,   (19)
Chris is handsome, charismatic, and an all around winner
Come here, little sister
Hey, Chris
Big hug
Chris smiles big and "son flirts" with his mom
Ma, you look so thin
10 pounds
Weight Watchers
Big kiss
When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles
Charlie
Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence
Then, hug
As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris gives him a quiet
(') Happy birthday

'   -                             70 46
Make a wish, honey
We move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out his 16 candles
: 71
'  -  ()                            71 The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags
The suburb is quiet
Not a creature is stirring

Charlie
He fills a brown paper bag with    sand and a candle
He lights the candle, making the bag glow   like a beautiful lantern
He looks down his street, where    families are out with their kids, doing the same luminaria   ritual

Christmas Eve
Many years ago
Aunt Helen and the kids finish their luminaria bags
Aunt Helen lights up the candles
They glow
Can you see it, Charlie
The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus
The image goes wide
All of these bags glowing
Beautiful
Aunt Helen rattles her keys
Whispers

He shakes it off

He turns the corner where he finds Chris sitting at the table
He's lit by a couple of candles and the blinking lights of the Christmas Tree
He's surrounded by leftovers
Charlie sits
Hey
Chris chews and swallows
Famished
They both whisper
Hey
God,  missed mom's cooking
You have no idea how good you have it
'm actually beginning to hate pizza
Charlie smiles
Grabs a Hershey Kiss cookie
How are you liking school
Not bad
'm no brainiac like you or Candace
But 'm doing okay
Okay
You're playing in a Bowl Game
Chris laughs
Charlie smiles

Chris changes his tone
Cautious
How are you feeling, Charlie
Good
You know what  mean
Is it bad tonight
No
No
'm not picturing things anymore
And when  do,  can just shut it off
(relieved) 48

And maybe if it does get bad again, you can just talk to them, yeah
Yeah
Especially Sam
'm going to ask her out at New Years

Chris smiles at his kid brother
We hear the church organ

Charlie's father, then mother, then sister, take the sacrament
Charlie is next

He places it in Charlie's hand
Charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth with his fingers

The church organ is now a rock organ
And it's now
New Year's Eve
Charlie closes his mouth
He looks down the hall of the smoky room where Craig has his arm around Sam
Charlie turns to Mary Elizabeth, who's also dosed
How long does this take to work

The sound is muted thick
Slight echoes
Charlie shovels the snow
Crunch
Fascinated by his breath making fog
Sam comes outside
She's worried about him
Shoveling snow, huh
have to get this driveway clean
Then, have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it
You said that an hour ago
Was that tonight
God
was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then 49
Okay, Charlie
Don't freak out
Just give me the shovel
Calm down
Look up
She points
Charlie looks up
Sees the stars
(') Isn't it quiet
Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you
All the time
So, you want to put on these glasses
They'll protect you
Sam puts her arm around his shoulder
Protecting him
Charlie looks through the glasses
The sky bends like a globe
When he breathes, the sky ripples

He sits down on the sofa
The world unbends as Charlie takes off the glasses
Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts of themselves behind
Charlie looks upstairs to find
Sam and Craig kissing
Craig leads her to the bedroom
Charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the New Years countdown
Patrick leads the charge

Charlie looks up as the , , and his  tower over him
He is terrified and does what any kid would do
He lies his ass off
Did your older friends pressure you
No one pressured me into anything would never do drugs, officer
Never
Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning
51
Well, um
was really tired, and uh
was feeling feverish
So,  went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air
And  started seeing things
So, passed out
He waits to see if this worked
And then, unexpectedly
(worried) You're seeing things again, Charlie
(oops) Not, uh
Not really

he's wearing his suit from Secret Santa
All the kids stare
Charlie realizes he made a terrible mistake
It was a Christmas present

The Great Gatsby
As the kids chatter, Bill gives Charlie his own book to start the year
The Stranger
Did you have fun on your break
More fun than you're going to have today, Sinatra
Bill pats his shoulder and moves on
The Smart Ass Freshman looks at Charlie and whispers
Nice look, jag off

Well what are we supposed to do
We're going on in 10 minutes
The phone rings
Mary Elizabeth picks up
Charlie turns to Brad, sitting next to him
Charlie is freaking out
But they said in health class-- They say that about  to scare you
Are you sure
Charlie, you're fine, man
Mary Elizabeth hangs up the phone, frustrated
Guys, we have an emergency
Craig flaked out on us again
need a Rocky
Brad
(scared) No way
There are people out here
The group is deflated
They all start thinking
After a beat, Mary Elizabeth looks at Charlie
Charlie
take off your clothes
93
-                       93 You know those dreams you have when you are standing in front of 200 people in your underwear
Well, this is no dream
We hear a heart beat as Charlie dances out of the Rocky gauze and finds himself standing in tight gold underwear, looking out at 200 people, cheering him on
His friends can't stop smiling
Especially Mary Elizabeth, who watches Charlie's little butt in the gold undies
She 53

Sam slinks over to Charlie dressed in her white bra and slip
(as Janet) So if anything grows while you pose
'll oil you up and drop you down
And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand
And  need action
Sam grabs Charlie's hands and rubs them all over her chest
(') Ah
Touch a touch a touch me
wanna be dirty
Thrill me
Chill me
Fulfill me
Creature of the night
The song continues
We see flashes of the night's performance as Charlie goes from train wreck to triumph
Charlie joins Sam in the kick line, and it feels like it's just the two of them
On the final beat, Sam gasps

The song ends
The cast bows
Sam and Patrick push Charlie in front for his own curtain call
Everyone cheers
It's the night he'll never forget

That bracing February cold
Charlie helps Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car
Maybe  could join the cast as an alternate or something
We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college could put in a good word for you
That'd be great
Thanks
They put the box in her trunk
Snap it closed
We can't help but notice the "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" bumper sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt

Charlie
have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance
The one where the girl asks the guy
Yeah
Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist
It's like, "Hey, thanks for the crumb
" And normally, 'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture
But, you know, it's my last year, and
would you maybe want to go with me
You want to go with me
'm sick of macho guys
And you looked really cute in your costume
So, what do you say
Charlie thinks and thinks and

He approaches
Are you having a good time
Not really
How about you
don't know
This is my first date, so don't know what to compare it to
Don't worry
You're doing fine
Charlie joins her at the wall
Mary Elizabeth gives them a quick, jealous look
'm sorry Craig didn't come
Yeah
He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance
Can't say blame him
don't know
If you like it, he should come
Thanks, Charlie
Have a beautiful first date
You deserve it
'll try not to make you too jealous

He said it to cheer her up
Sam forces a smile and leaves

She uncorks a bottle of wine
She hands him the bottle
Mmmm
Now, let it breathe
Mary Elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable
She turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control
Roar
This is sure a nice house
Thanks
Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl
Doo Wop make-out classic begins to play
She dances over to Charlie
(') Mmmm
Don't you just love old music
(off his nod) Good
Because  made you a mix of it
'd love to expose you to great things
Like Billie Holiday and foreign films
She pours the wine
Charlie looks at the bottle
This merlot is really fancy
Yeah
My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink
That's weird, isn't it
guess
Where are your parents
Their club is hosting a cotillion or something racist
They'll be gone all night
Mary Elizabeth drops her necklace with a thud
Charlie looks around
Heart beating
That's sure a nice fire
57
Yeah
After 'm done being a lobbyist, want to move to a house like this in Cape Cod
That sounds nice, doesn't it
Yeah
She reaches out and touches his chest
Your heart is beating really fast
Is it
Here, feel
She puts her hand on his
Moves it to his chest

Uh-huh
Do you like me
Uh-huh
You know what  mean
think so
Don't be nervous
She slowly moves his hand to her dress strap
It falls off her shoulder
She leans in for a red wine kiss
She guides his hand over her bra
He feels her breast
Wow

The song is over
The needle turns at the end of the record
Charlie
She gives him one last kiss
Content, she lays down on his lap
Peaceful
(') didn't know how it was going to go tonight, but it was really nice, huh
Yeah
can't believe it
You of all people
just can't believe you're my boyfriend
We land on Charlie's face
"What
"   And then, we hear the (') Oh, shit
My parents
The mad scramble for clothes begins

Charlie gets out
Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend
Not knowing how
Mary Elizabeth smiles
Smitten
See you Monday
With that, she backs out of the driveway
We see him from the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller
His stomach already filling with acid

) Dear Friend
'm sorry  haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster

Mary Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie
Smothering him
We're literally making out, and 'm in my bra
Hello
And the front door opens
It's my parents
'm scrambling to get my dress on
It was crazy
Right, babe
Charlie nods, tortured
(
) probably should have been honest about how  didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but  really didn't want to hurt her feelings
105

Charlie gets out of the school bus to immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him
She sees the cross of ashes on his forehead
She thinks his ashes are a smudge
She cleans it
(
) You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone
And since  heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy, tried hard to love her like  love Sam
Can you believe it's almost our two week anniversary
know

-                    106 double date
Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr
Caligari

) So,  took her on double dates
(proud) Your first foreign film

(
) And  tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty

' /  -                    107 Just like Sadie's except
the fire in the fireplace is out
We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater
(
) And  had to admit something really upsetting
But  am tired of touching her boobs
thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music once in awhile, we might have a chance
Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo
Sighs

Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray

) And maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr
Anderson gives me
Walden
read it in 7th grade
would have called it "On Boring Pond

Charlie grabs the cordless
He looks at Patrick's clock
3:13pm
His voice can no longer hide his quiet rage
(
) Or if she would stop calling me the minute  get home from school when  have absolutely nothing to talk about other than the bus ride home

) That dairy just sits with you
It walks with you

His mom is sympathetic

can do that
Charlie's father leans back from the sofa and his newspaper
For Christ's sake

Can  talk to you-- (
) Charlie
Please, don't interrupt
You know  hate that

Tick

In hindsight, probably could not have picked a worse way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth

Who are you talking to
dare you to kiss Alice

Samantha told me that you got into Harvard
Congratulations
Thank you

She kisses him
Charlie bites his cheeks
Sam looks a little depressed

You're just wait-listed
Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing some hot "fag on goth" action
Anticipation
Patrick is getting ready to plant the biggest kiss on Alice when she jumps him
Everyone groans
Ew
Laughter
Patrick looks for the next person
Charlie's heart pounds
Don't pick me
Please

My turn
Um
let's think
Charlie
truth or dare
Silence
Thinking
Finally
Truth
How is your first relationship going

It's so bad that  keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so  don't have to break up with her
Charlie
Truth or dare
Charlie blinks
It was all fantasy
Dare
dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips
Notice charitably said girl and not person because let's face it
'd smoke all you bitches
Alice hits him
Laughter
Charlie thinks
He looks at Mary Elizabeth, then turns to Sam
Before Sam can even react
Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips
When he opens his eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his mistake
Everyone stares
After a horrible silence
(') Now that's fucked up
Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and goes into the kitchen
Mary Elizabeth, 'm sorry
'm-- Alice follows Mary Elizabeth
Sam is close behind
(') Sam
Sam
'm sorry
didn't mean anything by it
'm sorry
Sam turns and looks at him
She doesn't even recognize him
What the hell is wrong with you
Charlie is devastated

Charlie feels awful
Panicky

Trust me
You don't want to go back there
But,
'm sorry
didn't mean to do anything
know you didn't, but look
hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam
Other guys
Things that have nothing to do with you
But
it's best if you stay away for awhile

Okay

It's going to be a long time

" Brad moves into the arms of  (18), cheerleader cute
As Brad kisses her, Charlie sees Patrick down the hall, watching them
Patrick closes his locker
Hurting
Are you okay
Not now, Charlie
'm sorry
Patrick storms off
126
-                                           126 Charlie sits at his table, alone
He watches Patrick leave the lunch line, passing a chorus of
68
Patrick says nothing
He's too sad to fight the mob today
He just moves to his table when the Nose Tackle sticks out his leg
Patrick falls on his tray
The kids laugh
Oops
Sorry, Nothing
Patrick smiles to himself, dusts off, and turns to Brad
You going to do something
What are you talking about
Your pet ape just tripped me
Are you going to say something
Why would
You know why
It's too far
Brad can feel people staring
This is pathetic, man
Your fixation on me
Brad's friends laugh
Patrick's eyes narrow
Do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises
Really
got jumped in a parking lot
Where
In Schenley Park
Do they know about Schenley Park
(to Brad's friends) Do you guys know about Schenley Park
Brad stands and gets right in Patrick's face
don't know what kind of sick shit you're trying to pull
(real warning) But you better walk away now
Nothing
69
Fine
Say hi to your dad for me
Patrick turns and leaves
And then, as an afterthought
Whatever
faggot
Brad's friends laugh
Patrick stops and turns
Last chance
What did you call me
called you a faggo-- Smack
Before Brad can even finish, Patrick throws a vicious right to the cheek
Brad tackles him
And the two start fighting
The cafeteria erupts in
Say that shit again
Say that shit again
Brad's football buddies rise and peel Patrick off Brad
Mary Elizabeth and Sam jump up from their corner table
It's Patrick
The cafeteria gets louder
The Nose Tackle holds Patrick up
More Noise
The Linebacker hits Patrick in the face
No
No
Sam rushes up and the Nose Tackle pushes her down
She lands on her tail bone
Thud
Patrick gets hit a couple of times in the face
The kids cheer the fight
It's getting louder and louder with more and more noise
And then
: Silence
Charlie comes out from a blink
He calmly looks around
For a moment, he doesn't understand where he is
He looks up
All the kids are staring at him
Mary Elizabeth
Alice
Brad
They are all quiet
Afraid of him
Charlie looks at his hand, clenched in a fist
It is already covered with
70
Charlie's confused until he sees the Linebacker holding his broken, bloody nose
He's looking at Charlie
Terrified
The image pans over
The Nose Tackle is on the ground
Charlie stands over them
He is disconnected
It's an out of body experience
He reaches out and helps Patrick to his feet
Then, he calmly turns and stares right through Brad
(icy calm) If you touch my friends again, 'll blind you
Brad is stunned
So is everyone
except Sam
127
'  -                                127 Charlie sits in the waiting room of the principal's office
He looks through the glass where Principal Small talks to Brad
After a beat, she pats Brad's shoulder and opens the door
Leaving Charlie and Brad alone in the waiting room
Just as Brad is about to leave
Charlie
Yeah
Thanks for stopping them
Sure, Brad
Brad doesn't look at him
He just moves on
128
-   -              128 Charlie exits the building
Kids stare at him
Then, look away
Charlie feels very lost until he sees
Sam
She smiles
It brings him back instantly
And then, gently
How you doing, Charlie
don't know
keep trying, but can't really remember what  did
Sam can see he's afraid of himself
She nods, sympathetic
71
Do you want me to tell you
(scared) Yeah
You saved my brother
That's what you did
So, you're not scared of me
No
And can we be friends again
Of course
The minute she hugs him, the numb goes away
She kisses the top of his head and puts her arm around his shoulder
They begin walking away
(') Come on
Let's go be psychos together
129
'  -  -                      129 Mary Elizabeth looks at us because she wants us to know
'm dating Peter now
She motions to
College
Glasses
Good looking-ish
(') He's in college with Craig
He's opinionated, and we have intellectual debates
You were very sweet, but our relationship was too one-sided
know this is hard for you
'm just glad you're happy
Okay
Mary Elizabeth joins Peter
Charlie looks at his friends
72
that says, "They forget
don't
" After a beat, Patrick comes downstairs
He looks sad with his bruises
Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon
We're going to miss the movie
Yeah, 'll go put some pep in her step
As Craig moves upstairs, Patrick approaches Charlie
Hey
you wanna get out of here
Sure, Patrick
130
-                                130 Patrick drives Sam's truck up the hill to the overlook
(
) 'll tell you something, Charlie
feel good
You know what  mean
Maybe tomorrow 'll take you to this karaoke place downtown
And this club off the strip
They don't card
And the Schenley Park scene
You gotta see the "fruit loop" at least one time
131
-                                131 Charlie and Patrick walk the lighted path, howling at the moon
Patrick holds a thermos, filled with who knows what
Oh, my God
My life is officially an after school special
Son of a bitch
(laughing) It kind of is
It so is
More laughter
They arrive at the lookout
They drink
So, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller
don't know
73
Really
thought your brother would have told you
It's a classic
Maybe
So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker
And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity
So, she did it really proper
She packed a picnic
Stole a bottle of wine
Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms
So, what do you think happened
don't know
They did it with one of the sandwich bags
They start laughing and screaming
Ew
That's disgusting
Yes
It is
Let's keep the train rolling
Suburban legends
Charlie
Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks
Uh
Well
there was this girl named Second Base Stace
She had boobs in the 4th grade-- Mosquito bites
Promising
Go
And she let some of the boys feel them
That's your suburban legend
Did you at least cop a feel
No
74
Of course not
You went home, listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self- esteem-- Fine
Okay
Your turn
Patrick walks over and sits down next to Charlie
Yeah, 've got one
Well, there was this one guy
Queer as a 3 dollar bill
Guy's father didn't know about his son
So, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town
Catches his son with another boy
So, he starts beating him
But not like the slap kind
Like the real kind
And the boyfriend says, "Stop
You're killing him
" And the son just yells "Get out
" And eventually the boyfriend just did
Patrick stops
Gripped by sad
He can't shake
(') Why can't you save anybody
don't know
Forget it
'm free now, right
could meet the love of my life any second now
Things will be different now, and that's good
just need to meet a good guy
Yeah
Patrick looks at him
Charlie has never seen him so vulnerable
After a beat
Patrick kisses Charlie on the mouth
Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen
His eyes open the whole time
moment, then Patrick looks at Charlie
He collapses into his chest
'm sorry
It's alright
75
Charlie holds his friend as Patrick begins to cry
And we leave them, the city lights small in the distance
132
-                                        132 We see the truck glide down the highway
(
) 've been spending a lot of time with Patrick
He begins every night really excited
133
-                                       133 Patrick and Charlie are parked at the entrance of Schenley Park
Patrick speaks, very animated, until
(
) He always says he feels free, and tonight is his destiny
But after awhile, he runs out of things to keep himself numb
the words leave him, and we can see how sad he really is
134
'  -                      134 Patrick hands Sam an envelope
Sam holds it
Pins and needles
(
) Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State
Sam opens the letter
She reads
Tears instantly well up in her eyes
She leaves the room and walks down the hall
Patrick picks up the letter
(reading) "We will require you to take our summer session at the main campus immediately following your high school graduation
" (off Charlie's look) She got in, Charlie
Charlie turns back to Sam
She holds him with sweet relief and redemption
135
-                                             135 Charlie laughs with his friends in the cafeteria
(
) After that all Patrick could talk about 76
(
) (') did get into  Film School
Patrick is going to the University of Washington because he wants to be near the music in Seattle
136
-                                          136 Charlie and a group of students stand, looking up at the wall, which is covered with
(
) But he wasn't going to leave without organizing the best senior prank ever
All The Shop Tools Painted Pink The shop teacher, Mr
Callahan stares at the wall, furious
As the students gawk, Charlie smiles to himself
137
-                                         137 Sam and the girls chat excitedly
Summer is almost here
(
) Sam is going to leave right after graduation
It all feels very exciting; just wish it were happening to me
138
'  -                                   138 Charlie sits on his bed, finishing the letter
Especially because ever since  blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse
And  can't turn it off this time
Charlie puts down the letter
139
'  -                                139 The kids pass their copies of The Great Gatsby up to the front, where Bill collects them for next year's freshmen
The class is buzzing loud
Guys, you want to pass your copies of Gatsby up to the front please
And know it's the last day, but if we could just keep it to a dull roar, 'd appreciate it
The class quiets down
77
(') Thank you for such a great year
had a blast
hope you did, too
And  hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations
Now, who here is going to be reading for pleasure this summer
Charlie looks to see if anyone is watching
then, decides to raise his hand anyway
Bill is proud
(') Very good, Charlie
Who else
Charlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all year
She sighs
Nothing left to say to him
140
'  -                                    140 The last kids exit the classroom
Charlie walks down the aisle and stands in front of Bill
Last day
Yeah
So, uh,  know it's none of my business, but have you decided
are you going to New York
Well, my wife and  like it here, and think  might be better at teaching than writing
Charlie is relieved
Bill is staying
(') So, uh Charlie
was thinking maybe could still give you books next year
Yeah
Yeah
think you could write one of them one day
(fragile belief) Really
do
78
Charlie is quiet
Then
You're the best teacher  ever had
Thank you
He gives Bill a shy sideways hug
The two men say nothing else
Charlie waves and leaves
Bill smiles to himself
141
-  -                  141 Times Square has nothing on these seniors
Charlie watches the gang on their last day of high school
When the clock hits 10 seconds to 3pm, all the students chant
& 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2
(
) Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here

They all cheer and hug each other
Patrick loses his mind with joy and charges down the hallway
: 142
-                          142 brilliant sunset
We see the gang
In silhouette
Running up the bleachers after the sun
(
) Dear Friend
wanted to tell you about us running
There was this beautiful sunset
And just a few hours before, everyone  love had their last day of high school ever
And  was happy because they were happy, even though counted, and  have 1,095 days to go
143
'  -  -                   143 Prom night
Charlie sees Candace posing for Dad's camera
For a moment, we think Candace went to prom with Derek
(
) kept thinking about what school was going to be like without them as they 79
As mom and dad move out of the way, we realize Candace is standing with her 3 best girlfriends
They look beautiful
(
) (') My sister finally decided to break up with Derek and go stag with her girlfriends instead
144
'  -                            144 Prom night continues
The antique limo is so garish, it's great
Charlie snaps pictures with Sam's mom and Patrick's dad
Mary Elizabeth is with her boyfriend, Peter
Alice stands with Patrick, dashing in his Mod Suit Tux
(
) And then there was Sam
The image moves to the front of the house, where Sam emerges
She wears a vintage flapper dress from the 20's
Radiant
(
) (') 've looked at her pictures since that night
like to see how happy she was before she knew
Sam joins Craig
They kiss for the cameras, then run with the rest of the gang to the limosine
(
) (') They were in a hotel suite after prom when the truth came out
The gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo
(
) (') Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam the whole time
When  heard that, kept thinking about the happy girl in these pictures
Because she doesn't have 1,095 days to go
145
-                                     145 Graduation Day
The place is packed with graduating seniors and families
Charlie's mom and dad fawn over Candace with the video camera
Charlie finally finds
Sam
(
) She made it
This is her time
And no one should be able to take that away
They approach each other and hug
80
(') Congratulations
Oh, Charlie's here
Guys, group photo
We should all take a group photo
Get against the railing and try to look suave
The kids line up for the picture they will always remember
(') Yeah, this is the one
That's going to be a great angle
Patrick bows to reveal the top of his cap reads, "Nothing Hates You
" The parents line up cameras
"Cheese
" Snap
: 146
' /  -                146 The grandfather clock reads 9:30pm
The room is festive under streamers wishing Sam luck at Penn State
The kids sign each other's yearbooks
Charlie sees Sam smile at old photos
He misses her already
(
) At her going away party,  wanted her to know about that night we went through the tunnel
And how for the first time, felt like  belonged somewhere
: 147
' /  -                147 10:28pm
Charlie doesn't know where the time keeps going
Sam opens goodbye presents from her friends
(
) And tomorrow, she's leaving
So, wanted to give her a part of me
Charlie watches Sam pick up his present
She carefully peels the tape to reveal that Charlie gave her all of his books
Are these all your books, Charlie
He nods
They lock eyes and do not speak
81
148
'  -                                       148 The pictures are down
The dressers empty
The suitcase is open on the bed
Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put them in her suitcase
He has promised himself he will not cry
Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of "Something
" Instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail
Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice
Thanks for staying up with me
Sure
My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner
You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night
It's a tradition
That sounds like fun
Yeah
Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore
Yes,  will
Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room
They stand next to each other
Close
(') had lunch with Craig today
Yeah
He said he was sorry, and that  was right to break up with him
But 'm driving away, and  just felt so small
Just asking myself why do  and everyone love pick people who treat us like we're nothing
We accept the love we think we deserve
He says it sober
Without judgement
Sam lets it sink in
Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing
Then, she turns to him
82
Then, why didn't you ever ask me out
Charlie didn't expect that
He is silent
Heart pounding
, uh,  just didn't think you wanted that
Well, what did you want
just want you to be happy
Don't you get it, Charlie
can't feel that
It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love
don't want to be somebody's crush
want people to like the real me
know who you are, Sam
Sam waits
And Charlie finally speaks from the heart
(') know 'm quiet, and  know  should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant
How much we are alike
And how we've been through the same things
And you're not small
You're beautiful
He can't contain himself anymore
He moves to her and kisses her
They stand
Move to the bed
Kissing
Charlie's heart pounds
They sit on the bed
Still kissing
We see her fingertips
Her hand on Charlie's knee
When she touches him, Charlie pulls away from her
Shocked
Like he's seen a ghost
It hits Charlie like freezing water
What's wrong, Charlie
Oh, ah
nothing
Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues 83
149
'  -                           149 It's like a dream for Charlie
He watches Sam hug Alice and Mary Elizabeth goodbye
But Charlie is somewhere else
'll call all the time
Promise
And we'll all see each other in New York
' Come on, Sam
Charlie can't take it
He moves to the side of the truck and puts in the last suitcase
He looks over at Sam
: 150
'  -                                       150 Charlie remembers kissing Sam the night before
Her hand touches Charlie's knee

'  -                           151 Charlie snaps himself out of it
He turns back as Mary Elizabeth and Alice part ways
Charlie locks eyes with Sam
They take a moment
And then they come together to hug
She kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry
After a moment, Sam climbs into the driver's seat of her truck with Patrick riding shotgun
Charlie looks dazed
: 152
'  -                                       152 Charlie remembers pulling away from Sam

What's wrong, Charlie

153
'  -                               153 Sam starts the truck
Charlie wants to scream for her to stop
But he's frozen
She drives away
He watches her go
The truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the stop sign
And disappears
Charlie stands there, alone
: 154
'  -                                           154 Charlie remembers the night with Sam
We see her put her hand on his knee
The image moves up the arm
To the shoulder
To the face
And we reveal, we are not in Sam's bedroom
And it is not Sam touching Charlie
But
Aunt Helen Don't wake your sister

'  -                               155 The memory only registers as a small blink of his eye

He's not
He's numb
156

His eyes far away
The images and memories are short, violent bursts
If you've never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels

One image
Two images

It's all my fault

Years of history staring at us
Ghosts on the wall

Hits another in the throat
And pushes another

Candace,  killed Aunt Helen, didn't
She died getting my birthday present, so guess  killed her, right

She knows this voice
Candace covers the phone
Call the police and send them to my house
And  can't stop her

Burton, enters
She finds him sitting in the corner
He has been crying
Charlie
'm Dr
Burton
Where am
Mayview hospital
This news hits Charlie hard
He begins to panic
You have to let me go
My dad can't afford it
Don't worry about that
89
No
saw them when  was little
And don't want to be a Mayview kid
Just tell me how to stop it
Stop what
Seeing it
All their lives
All the time
Just
how do you stop seeing it
Seeing what, Charlie
Charlie breaks
There is so much pain
And  don't know how to not notice it
What's hurting you
No
Not me
It's them
It's everyone
It never stops
Do you understand
Dr
Burton smiles, sympathetic
Charlie nods, relieved that someone finally understands
Until
What about your Aunt Helen
Like cold water
What was tears is now confusion and soon to be shame
Dr
Burton is gentle to him
What about her
Can you see her
Yes, she had a terrible life
But mean, what am
You said some things about her in your sleep
don't care
90
If you want to get better, you have to-- Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement
She was
insane
The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed
He stops talking
Dr
Burton does not press him
Not today
Charlie, are you going to let me help you here
Charlie cries and nods
Okay
Do you remember anything before you blacked out
, uh
remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home
We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off
175
-                                       175 The sun creeps through the windows
We can hear birds outside
The intercom is quiet
Charlie is alone
He looks at Sam's typewriter
"Dear Friend" is already typed
(
) was in the hospital for awhile
won't go into detail about all of it
But will say there were some very bad days
And some unexpected beautiful days
Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam
176
-                                        176 Dr
Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway
(
) The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me
In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop
Shocked
91
177
-                                        177 Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway
Honey
His mother comes to hold him
(') 'm so sorry
For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page, before he chokes it down
He walks over to his son and kisses his forehead
178
-                                    178 Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards
(
) The best days were those when  could have visitors
My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp
He's going to be first string this year
And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job
179
-                               179 Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand
His mother waits in the hallway with Dr
Burton
There he is
So, 'll see you Thursday at 6, right
Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother
(
) My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there
know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together
Dr
Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital
180
'   -                              180 The family sits at the dinner table
92
God bless this food that we are about to receive
We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
Amen
After they say "Amen," the room falls silent
The family is on pins and needles
No one touches their food
Until
How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad
God damn Penguins
think they're allergic to God damn defense
What do the players call a puck again
biscuit
Are you sure it's not a "God damn biscuit
" You're cruisin' for a bruisin'
As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper
Candace talks about the books she'll need for college
Everyone starts eating
And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home
181
'  -                                    181 Ding dong
The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling
Can Charlie come out and play
Charlie's mother smiles
Charlie smiles, too
Especially when he sees
Sam
Standing next to Patrick
Her hair a little different
Her eyes alive and happy
182
-                           182 The gang of three sit at their booth
Sam and Patrick have their coffee
Charlie has his brownie
Like always
That first night,  had grilled stickies
It was so good
You have to visit in the Fall
We'll have some
Okay
93
Definitely
Sorry, Sam
Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October
Charlie laughs
Sam smiles
After a beat
Well, can  tell you something
've been away for two months
It's another world
And it gets better
(off Charlie's smile) And my roommate Katie has the best taste in music
Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table
(') found the tunnel song
Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile
(') Let's drive
183
-                             183 The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck
Patrick drives
Charlie in the middle
Sam the passenger
(
) don't know if  will have the time to write any more letters because  might be too busy trying to participate
So, if this does end up being the last letter, just want you to know that  was in a bad place before  started high school
And you helped me
184
'  -                                         184 The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck
The music blaring
The wind making their hair dance
(
) Even if you didn't know what  was talking about
Or know someone who's gone through it
It made me not feel alone
With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window 94
185
376  -                                    185 Charlie gets into the back of the truck
He sits down, looking back at the highway
Watching everywhere he's been
(
) Because  know there are people who say all of these things don't happen
And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17
We see Charlie in profile
The night sky behind him until
186
-                                     186 they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast they're driving
The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed
perfect night
perfect drive
Flying
(
) know these will all be stories someday
And our pictures will become old photographs
And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad
But right now, these moments are not stories
Charlie turns to face forward
To the moment
To Sam, smiling at him from the front seat
(
) (') This is happening
am here
And  am looking at her
And she is so beautiful
Sam kisses Charlie
Then, she turns, and all three kids look ahead to everything in front of them
Charlie begins to stand in the back of the truck
Ready to leave the tunnel
(
) (') can see it
This one moment when you know you're not a sad story
You are alive
And as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder
And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world
Charlie stands in the back of the truck
The wind on his face
He is free
(
) (') And in this moment,  swear
95
We see the moment as Charlie sees it
The tunnel's exit getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city behind it
(
) (') we are infinite
The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel
Sam and Patrick scream with excitement
Charlie holds his arms in the air
The weight of the world gone
If only for a moment
This one moment
We see the city
million lights like white stars in a glass dome
We crane to the sky
We are in Heaven
