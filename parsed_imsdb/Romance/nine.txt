Written by Michael Tolkin & Anthony Minghella Final Script November 11, 2009 - The flicker of film
Footage from a press conference
You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it
film is a dream
You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans
Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes 've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again
That's why 'm secretive
(
) So what's your favorite pasta
Finally, a serious question
Laughter
word: 5,  - huge soundstage
The   lets a man into the stage, turns on a working light
: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965 Good luck, Maestro
Departing, he closes the soundstage door
As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard
, the most famous film director in the world
In front of him: , , -   under construction
complex maze of scaffolding, its unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins
Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands
p
2 Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses
He looks at the plans, looks up at the stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping over to the crane
Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in every sense a jumble of ideas
Guido looks at the set in despair
He sits in the bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands, overwhelmed
(
) Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini
How do you begin
How do you begin this thing

In the distance, a figure approaches out of the darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination
An escape from his tortured reality
The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess
She is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive
She is , his film star, his muse
When Claudia reaches Guido, she stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face, and kisses him
And with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of '
As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear
They emerge from everywhere
These are the women from Guido's life, past and present
Women from his films, women he has loved, the sources of his inspiration and creative genius
grand  unfolds
The most significant women in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own powerful entrance: , his wife , his mistress , his costume designer and accomplice ' , her spirit , a fashion journalist , a whore p
3 dark and glamourous dream
The women surround Guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace
5,  - The fantasy ends abruptly with    , as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting Guido who is slumped in the crane seat
Harsh daylight penetrates the gloom
Too bright
He blinks, discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures approach with purpose
One of the figures is a well- fed, amiable character,
He is Guido's longtime associate and Producer
younger, more ascetic figure accompanies him, sharp and birdlike
This is , an accountant
Dante speaks quickly and without obvious punctuation: (walking) Guido
You're here
Buongiorno, Dante
've been looking for you all over the place
The set's coming along
How are you
Bene, grazie, bene
Guido stands to greet him
They kiss on both cheeks
Bene
My God, you look terrible, better go to makeup, forget you've got a press conference
(discreetly, to Dante) He has no tie
Yes, makeup and wardrobe
He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight
Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look and a gesture asks Dante who is he
(overlapping Dante) Signor Contini, 'm Fausto
Good morning, Signor Contini
p
4 (interrupts) He's counting costs, you know
The Bank wants him here
(to Fausto) Don't speak to him,  speak to him
Okay,  have some questions for Signor Contini
We all have questions for Signor Contini
They head outside
- Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en route to the Production Offices
Behind them is a large poster of , starring in Guido's last movie, a failure,    (The Modern Woman)
As Guido passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore
Guido nods
Yes, but please, please,  think it's customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commences
Is he going to follow us
It's not my intention to be difficult
Maestro,  am a huge admirer of Maestro Contini's movies, your early films are
everybody loves them and
consider it a great honour for me to be here now
none the less,  need a script and a budget
Neither Dante nor Guido respond
Fausto flounders
They make their way to the Production Offices
Everywhere signs for the movie,
,  - long corridor, bustling with activity
The trio heads down it
If a pretty girl goes by, and there are several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without missing a beat of their solemn conversation
p
5 As they progress into and through the open plan office, many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to get Guido's attention, swelling the procession, interjecting with their urgent requests
There are set models everywhere, in the process of being constructed, or painted
, Guido's production designer, looks up from a model, hurries over
Nobody stops moving
As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to look
, Guido's young , has caught up with the procession
He has dozens of phone messages, sorting through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a partitioned office - Where do you want your messages
On my desk
There's no room on your desk
- into the main office - Under my desk
In the trash
Non lo so
(waving them at him) Some of these are urgent
(to Pierpaolo) Get me a cigarette
(confidentially) We will never be ready to shoot in ten days
Jaconelli - (at the same time) Not ready
(continues) Ascolta me
() p
6 (') (he kisses Jaconelli on the cheek) Careful what you say
He's a spy from the bank
Guido carries on moving through the office
He's not exactly from the bank, Guido
Now , Guido's Casting Director, moves towards Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head towards Guido's office
Dottore, Dottore
You have actors waiting for you in your office
Auditions all morning
You should see what 've found
found two sisters
Look, they're right
Guido turns through another partition, as they all besiege him with questions
Benito despairs
(') Dottore, this way
Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him
Dante blocks Benito
(') Maestro
Not now
He's got the Press Conference
,  - Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the barrage
They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always, for Guido
Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky, indomitable, sharp as a tack
She adores Guido without any sentiment
She's incapable of sentiment
Guido heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting some fabric
need a cigarette
Dante comes in, closing the door behind him
p
7 He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli
Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call
need a coffee and a cigarette
He lies down
(unimpressed) Answer a question, 'll give you a coffee
Answer another question, 'll give you a cigarette
And so on
Actually and an aspirin
Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some drawings
(in the background, on the phone) We're running late
(turns to Guido and lights a cigarette) Calm down
Directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it
You just have to say yes or no
What else do you do
Nothing
Maestro - Should this be Red
Yes
Green
No
More extras
Yes
More lipstick
No
Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no - that's directing
Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette
That's right: that's directing
And it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is
So please, Guido, yes or no, do you want any costumes in this film
Yes
p
8 You see - simple
(handing him an espresso fetched by her assistant, ) Might  know what period the movie's in
Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the table, he looks at the costumes
Yes, yes
(downs the espresso) Soon
Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away
You know  don't allow producers in here
Alright
Two minutes Guido
Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante
He leaves
Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket
Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him
Guido sits up
Lilli puts the tie round his neck
He's gone
Have you written a word of the script
No
Are you in a panic
Yes
She ties Guido's tie for him
Is Luisa going with you to the Press Conference
No
Nobody
Dante
And his spy
You need to shave
You look terrible
p
9 (looking around, desperate) Why is there no fire escape in here
What if somebody needed to escape can't face these reporters
have nothing to say
You'll be fine
You're a world class liar, darling, go out there and lie for Italy, lie for Italia
- Guido is driving his Roadster   through the streets of Rome
An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the radio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo
In front of him in the convoy is   Dante with Fausto
'  - As Guido drives, he turns to see his  in the passenger seat
He's not remotely surprised
She appears the way he remembers her
Mamma is extraordinary
What the hell's wrong with me can't sleep
can't think
can't write
can't breathe
My heart is racing
Am  dying, Mamma
owe you flowers,  know
'll come to the cemetery at the weekend
You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, could visit you every week
Don't look at me like that
(with kindly patience) Oh, Guido, Guido
He stops at a busy intersection
/
'  - This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas, skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young people
magnificent fall day, and the cafes are stuffed with the beautiful and chic
p
10 This is your Rome, Guido
The world sees Rome the way you invented it
Your films did that
(buoyed by her encouragement) miss you
miss you, too
Guido is in his own world
The policeman raps on the bonnet of the car
Guido startles and pulls off, alone in the car
Guido looks across as he drives
Mamma has gone
,   - The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto
As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting paparazzi snap his picture
Beautiful women look at him
Guido moves quickly by them
Dante and the team hurry after him
Fausto tackles Dante
And they hurry after Guido
- big suite
About fifty reporters, men and women, are in the room, and an array of microphones are on a coffee table next to a long couch
Excited chaos narrates in the background
And we're just waiting for the arrival of Contini
any moment now - Could this film put the Maestro back on top
few news cameras are filming
There's a buffet, and a bartender
And Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne
Dante and the team follow him in
(') And here he is
p
11 Silenzio, per favore
Thank you, thank you
Dante, Guido Contini's long time producer, is about to speak
want to say a few words from my heart
am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that  am producing Guido Contini's next film, Italia, which will star once again Contini's longtime inspiration, the international film star, Claudia Jenssen
stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen emerging from the Colosseum: Flashes
Excitement
(') we start shooting in ten days time in Cinecitta
That makes it one week from Monday
(to Guido, handing over) Thank you, Maestro, thank you very much
This is our ninth film together
Guido Contini
Thanks for coming, everybody
Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and kisses Dante on the cheek
He returns to the couch
All the reporters fire their questions at once
The questions come on top of each other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated energy
He takes his sunglasses off and signals to , a harsh-looking woman
Maestro Contini
Maestro Contini
Yes
Grazie
Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia
big title
Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt
p
12 Actually, it's my shortest title yet
But hardly a modest one
Films are not modest
They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people
So they should have grand titles
And might you tell the press what the film is about
Why
still don't know what my last film was about
(In a loud aside to Dinardo) That was the problem
Nobody else did
Of course  can tell you what my film is about
can tell you the story, can tell you who  am going to cast, the music  want to use,  can tell you everything
but
won't
'm afraid that if  say anything, the word might get out to the Press
General laughter in the room
He wins a round, but is clearly feeling the strain
Dante recognizes, steps in
Our next film will be exactly as it sounds
Italia
It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream
Is this true
It sounds fantastic
can't wait to see it
He's still winning
Ignoring the question, he points to , a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes from American Vogue
Flirtatious and charming, she wants him and he senses it
p
13 Signor Contini
Stephanie
Grazie
Could you tell the fashionable women of America who your favorite designer is this year
'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it
Signor Contini
You're a man of the world, yes
Educated in Britain, a home in Biarritz
With Italia is it fair to say that you've come home for good
(
) (tries to interrupt) What do you think of the New Wave in the French Cinema
For good
It's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife, do you plan on casting her in this new film
Guido is spinning plates
told Luisa that when we got married would never again make love to my leading lady
But she hasn't worked at all since working with you
Laughter
Everyone starts firing questions at Guido again
Another  asks a question
But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film
It's a serious question
What's the big deal
p
14 : "" We discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his unfinished set
retreat into surreality
He sits on the same couch from the hotel suite
He slouches, arms folded, legs crossed, with his hat pulled over his eyes
You want me to be serious
In a Press Conference
"" thought  was the clown in this circus
"" ' Signor Contini
Artists do their best work before they're famous
Now you're famous
Without wishing to be negative - but your last two films, they're not, they were

15 "" '  , ' 'm just asking if you're nervous
You seem nervous
This stops Guido
He doesn't answer
We see a bead of sweat running down the back of Guido's neck
Everyone waits
Excuse me
What 'm asking, Maestro, is have you run out of things to say

We see two Guidos

- Amidst the chaos, Guido notices a waiter with a tray of glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the wall
As the waiter passes, Guido slyly opens the door and sneaks out

18 - Guido speeds away from Rome in his Roadster
- Guido's car passes by the remnants of an ancient aqueduct, with women from his fantasy draped around him, spilling out of his car
sing a musical flourish of praise to Guido

The car races over a hill, blurring the countryside, and we see the blue Mediterranean sea, and the pretty spa town of

Guido's women are gone as the song ends

He doesn't want to be recognised
He approaches the Front Desk, where an immaculate Desk Clerk, the urbane and wise  , waits to greet him

Why not

Guilty pleasure
Those early films
Not the flops

Do you know one who's discreet
'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible
Consider it done
Please

20 (takes the key) And  need to place a call
To my wife
Guido writes the number on a piece of paper on the desk
You can take the call at the lobby phone over there

The phone rings
He picks up

Luisa knows every move of Guido's
She manages him very well, calm, dry and funny
Luisa, tesoro

Is everybody mad at me
Well, 'm mad at you
Where are you

Dramatic
Don't tease me

(all too familiar ) Yes, it's hardly worth it
But  do wish you were here
Get some rest, take the waters, sleep, then come back here and make a good movie

Get better

22 ,   - He hangs up, pensive
Goes straight back to De Rossi at the Front Desk, and scribbles down another number
Your doctor is on his way
(carefully) This number - if a woman answers you put it through to my room, otherwise
De Rossi understands
It's a wrong number
'  - - on Guido's eye, being held open by a Guido is on the bed, shirt open
The Doctor examines Guido's eye while a heavy-set  takes his blood pressure
The Doctor stands and turns to his case

Dottore
Si
He walks round to her
The Nurse whispers to the Doctor
They look at the blood pressure gauge
Guido is disturbed by their conspiracy
What is she whispering
Is it my blood pressure
Is it serious
Am dying

The doctor, interrupting him, takes a tongue depressor from his kit
The doctor, sits on the bed beside Guido, and takes his cigarette out of his mouth
He stubs it out
p
23 (') Stress
Exhaustion
The doctor is in the way of the phone
Guido desperately makes an attempt to reach it and can't
He's trapped by the doctor and by the nurse holding his arm

Guido opens wide, gagging, as the phone continues ringing
Guido looks at the ringing phone, but the nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood pressure for the second time
And the phone continues ringing

Carla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes the steam from an arriving train
,   - And out of the steam
comes walking toward Guido, swinging her hips, with a  behind her, pulling five bags on a wagon
Carla is dressed in her own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant
She wears it with pride
Guido
Ciao
(to himself, remembering how much work she is) Carla
(and now to her, covering his ambivalence) Carla
'm so happy to see you
Carlissima
She gives him a hug and a kiss, both too much for him in public
missed you so much
(they move off) Are you happy 'm here
Of course
But very happy
Or just a little happy
Very happy
She sees something in his face that worries her
What's wrong
You look very tired, very tired
p
27 (avoiding this, looks at her bags) Carla, all those bags for the weekend
Yes, the Bellavista is a very fashionable place
You know  stayed there with my parents, during the war, it was full of Germans
Carla
have to tell you
they found out who  am at the hotel-- No
yes, horrible, but obviously we don't want to be followed by the press, so  found the most charming pensione for you, and it's right here
It's charming
Here at the station
- small pensione across the street from the station
Carla sizes it up, and it's really not at all what she was hoping for, but she doesn't say anything
- Later, Carla, in silhouette, from behind
Wrapped in a sheet, she is looking out the window of the dingy room
The light from the pensione's neon sign spills in
They whisper
(
) Close the curtains, it's too light in here
Carla closes the curtains
They continue to whisper
(') Perfect
Now, go into the corridor--- What
p
28 Shhh
Yes, count to ten and come back in, and pretend you're in the wrong room, and 'm a complete stranger-- Carla sits on the bed facing Guido
love your games
She kisses him
'm here on business
Okay
Go, go
Wait
Your face
What about it
Get your makeup
Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and tilts the lamp shade up
He begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes
He is meticulous about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it exactly as he wants it
had a nightmare last night
We were in that little alley behind Piazza Navona, where  bought you that scarf, remember
The same one your wife bought you-- (probably doesn't) Don't move, Carla
When you wear it,  never know if it's hers or mine
(not really listening) Uh-huh
So we were there, on the ground, naked, kissing, and we didn't care, and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel
Poor Luigi
() p
29 (') He would never do that
He's so sweet
He speaks Latin
He knows all the Roman Emperors
(still intent on his makeup job) Good for him
Perhaps there's a job for him in the movie-- Why not
You could work well together
Beautiful
When you come in  want you to be my little savage
Yes
(gesturing towards the door) Go, go
Guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side table
You think  am one of your actresses
Hurry, please, Carla
Carla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her
Guido turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for the game
Carla looks at herself in the mirror
Oh, Madonna
'll pretend to be asleep
Carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's glasses and turns back to him
What if  really found the wrong room
Would you be jealous
p
30 Could you do such a thing
Carla teases him with a look that says, "Why not
" (coyly) Hm
Who knows
Carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind her
We  the  who runs the Pensione talking to her
While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer
Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling for Guido to keep quiet
What happened
(still giggling) It was the woman from the hotel
She wanted to give me towels
Come here
Okay
What
You are a stranger,  don't know you
Carla, just come here
(indicating her sheet) Be savage
Show me
She crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide
Excuse me
've got the wrong room
Yes, you have
And  don't have the faintest idea who you are
She throws herself on Guido, whose arms enfold her
p
31 - Carla is asleep, her bare back a thing of post-coital beauty
Guido sits on the edge of the bed, quietly getting dressed, filled with confusion and guilt
- Guido tip-toes out of Carla's room, shoes in his hand
He walks down the hallway, alone
(
) Page one, page one, page one
The figure emerges from the darkness like a goddess
She is Claudia, his muse
, '  - in his fantasy
Kissing him
Walking away
(
) She takes the man's face and kisses him
Guido is surrounded by discarded bits of paper, an outline of Italia
An empty sheet of paper sits in his typewriter on his desk
He is not working on the outline
He is sketching a voluptuous woman
(
) (') And with that gesture, he's suddenly inspired to write something
profound
he draws in the nipples on the woman's breasts
Guido becomes discouraged
He tosses off his glasses and runs his hands through his hair in frustration
(') Mother of God, give me a sign
He's happily distracted by the sound of vehicles arriving outside his window
He opens a slat in the shutters, looks down as a motor calvacade draws up
At its heart is an impressive luxury car
p
32 ,    - Hotel staff swarm around the vehicles which discharge a procession of religious, including an in scarlet robes and the '
Priests follow as the Cardinal heads inside the hotel
Guido is intrigued, hurries out of his hotel room
- As Guido hurries down the stairs, the Cardinal is being helped into the elevator
The '  is dealing with check-in formalities with De Rossi
Guido calls to him
Excuse me, father
' (turns) Buongiorno
His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -
' (recognising Guido) Signor Contini
(starstruck) am a big fan
would very much like to speak to the Cardinal
Do you think he might grant me - ' Is Claudia Jenssen with you
No
' Pity
His excellency is a big admirer of Signorina Jenssen
(explaining) 'm in need of some guidance, some pointers
' Do you think you could find a signed photograph of Signorina Jenssen
p
33 For His Excellency
' Si
'm sure that would be possible
' Truly
What a pleasure
Arrivederci, Maestro
He heads towards the elevator
Guido watches him go, then a voice calls out his name
Guido can't turn round
He knows that voice
Guidino
Guido hurries towards the elevator
The elevator doors close
Guido is trapped
'm not going to ask how you found me
Please - it's my job
producer needs to know where his director is at all times
even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying
Oh God
understand, Guido
Rome is absolutely unbearable
The pressure
It's no good
Really
You understand
He takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell
-  - Of course  understand
Absolutely
You're not going to drag me back
No
You're a genius and genius must be served

34 Thank you, my old friend
(Dante is guiding him) Where are we going
You can't be in Rome
Okay
(heading towards the ballroom) ,   - Rome will come to you
Dante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full ,  ,  , The models, costumes, headshots, everything all in place or being put into place
An absolute beehive of activity
Guido is staggered
(') It's a fantastic place for you to focus
Everyone is here to help the movie
Everyone is here because they love you, Guido
He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he sets to work with his team
Guido moves through the room avoiding specific questions from everyone
As he does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a magnificent girl on his arm
(explaining his designs) Yes, with the flower and the glass and the arches of the Roman Empire
Guido
you remember Donatella
Ciao
(he doesn't, she's new) Ciao
Donatella, you tested her
was very nervous
He probably doesn't remember
was quite nervous

You were, we all enjoyed you, so to speak
Maestro
Pierpaolo, Guido's assistant, holds a telephone
Guido wants to know who it is
(') Claudia's agent
Guido grimaces
Then takes the phone
He attacks the phone call with gusto
(listens to a stream of invective) Did she like the script
(gestures for Pierpaolo to light him a cigarette) No no no no - impossibile - are you telling me she didn't get the script
(shouting at Pierpaolo) Pierpaolo
He takes the cigarette with a smile, and then without missing a beat starts barking at Pierpaolo
(') Claudia didn't get the script
Send her another one
For Chrissake
Send her two
(playing along) Yes, 'm sorry
Right now
Cretino
(back to Lombardo, listens) Yes, yes, that's what  say, people just don't realise - she's an actress as well as a star -  know Dante's dying to talk to you
dolpo
Ciao
He hands the phone to Dante, who's delighted to see Guido back on good directing mode

36 As Dante takes over, Guido walks away, heads towards Lilli and her domain
'  ,  - Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap
Guido leaps over the balcony and lies down on a table
Performance mode off
Lilli nods to Roberta to leave
Roberta puts down her work and clears the room quietly, leaving them alone

'm happy
brought my swimsuit
Lilli is working at a mannequin, hand-sewing some sequins on a costume
red feathered boa is draped on the figure

What
No
Oh please God
No spoke with her yesterday
She didn't even mention it
Give me a cigarette
Lilli points to the one in Guido's hand
What's that
Guido sees the costume
What's that
It's for Claudia
For which scene
Well  don't know which scene until `ve seen the script, but she always likes something like this, or you do
Looks like the Folies Bergere
It's wrong
Italian women don't wear those things
p
37 Don't knock the Folies Bergere
Lilli tosses the boa over her shoulder as she continues pinning the costume
(') it brings back happy memories
That's where  learned my art
All those sequins, all those feathers
(Still working) And, you're wrong, you put Claudia in one of these for that nightclub scene in Natura Morta
Why did people love that film
Guido picks up a straw hat
Puts it on his head playfully
Oh Guido, don't
That's death
Every time we have to start again
'm trying to find it
You won't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass
Ashtray
She produces one
(') Thanks
You were saying - my head is jammed up my ass
Halfway
don't know
Why not dream up something entertaining, Guido
Something with music
with dancing
God knows, we could use a little joie de vivre around here
Guido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her and sees
p
38 : "" Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red feathered boa hangs from her shoulders
She places the same straw hat on her head
The soundstage has been transformed into an impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the 1930's, with Lilli as its French Star

The din of the theater audience fills the smoky atmosphere

Apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic barely covered in beads, sequins, and feathers

From every corner, more showgirls begin to enter

Last night  looked down at this table in the chairs you are sitting in now, and what did see

And next to him
Suddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience
(') Ahh, mon Dieu
Guido
Guido Contini
What are you doing here at the Folies Bergere
You naughty boy
You're only nine years old
But 'm glad you've come
Would you like to join me on stage
Yes
Come
Come, come, come
And she brings him onto the stage
The audience applauds
She addresses him as though he is Older Guido
(') Feeling better
There's no room for hopelessness in here, is there, Guido
(to the audience) We must explain something to our young Guido
What do we want
Laughter
What do we want
Love
What do we want
Dreams
Let us not forget, Guido, mon cher -- That's our privilege - to entertain
p

Young Guido finds himself swept into Lilli's intoxicating world

Lilli crosses the proscenium
Her boa grows and grows until it stretches the length of the stage

He and Lilli are lifted onto an art deco swing, flanked by two showgirls, that rises into the air
He is transported and inspired

But suddenly a   dips into the shot and it's Guido contemplating a model of the set
He places a figure on the top of the staircase
p
41 He moves round to the front of the model and places another figure on the top of the scaffold tower
He knocks it over
Unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa
The coffee table is covered in head-shots
He finds the one of Claudia
Guido looks at it
He lies back to write and finds himself in ' She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his hair
He starts to sign - "
" then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself
Claudia laughs
- Grottos and tunnels are thick with steam
Guido follows the Cardinal's Secretary
' The Cardinal is right this way
The Cardinal's Secretary leads Guido to a private area, where the Cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of hot water
' (') Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here
The Cardinal's Secretary makes a gesture to Guido to get into the tub with the Cardinal
Guido gets in the water
The Cardinal looks hard at Guido and then makes his first pronouncement
like Charlie Chaplin
Me too
genius
What can  do for you
Do you believe in God
The Cardinal's Secretary is shocked
' Signor Contini, please
No, no, it's an honest question
Yes, believe in God
p
42 So do
Are you a Catholic
Oh yes, very much so
Not as much as would like to be, not as much as you would like me to be, 'm sure, but certainly yes, 'm trying
Try harder
Yes, yes
will,  will
Your Eminence,  am not happy
'm searching for something
feel a sense of misery, of despair and -- (interrupting) saw your films
Not the flops, the others, the good ones
But you think people need to see so much sex
It's not necessary
We can all imagine
(laughing) Excuse me - my films are what imagine
Then your imagination has no moral training
(nonplussed) How do you train the imagination
The imagination is God's garden; don't let the Devil play in it
Teach our Italian women to be wives, not whores, don't make us look at filth and debauchery
Make us proud to be Italian
Guido's head disappears under the water
The sound of the Cardinal's voice trails away
p
43 : - :   Pesaro, Italy, 1926 Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes with five boys from the village
The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the war
They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand it to Young Guido, already the ring leader
They crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker
'  - Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back
(not loud enough) Saraghina
(louder) Saraghina
Now all the boys join in
Saraghina
Saraghina
(loudest) Saraghina
Sa-ra-ghina
shadow moves inside the bunker
Now even Young Guido takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps back
And then she comes out
is a gritty, earthy woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy
She has darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on Carla
She looks at the boys
She may be a crazy whore, but she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having her own fun with them
She takes a deliberate step
Young Guido stands his ground
She takes another step and holds out her hand
p
44 Young Guido opens his hand with the coins
She looks at the money
Is it enough
But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes the coins
She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker
She returns dragging an old broken chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready for the "show
" Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body
dark vamp begins
: "" Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage
Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same chair from the beach
She speaks, surrounded by other in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs
So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love
Saraghina will tell you
and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with
Because it is in your blood
- With a smile, she pulls her dress off her shoulders

The boys are transfixed
She gets up and heads towards the water
The boys follow, running
"" Saraghina and The Whores brandish tambourines
They begin a slow, rhythmic and sensual dance that builds into a wild and raucous tarantella
We furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and the memory of the boys romping on the beach with Saraghina, across the sand and through the water

The whores dance
The number ends

The boys run
Young Guido tries to run away from the priests
They catch him and carry him away from the beach
- Off-screen, a boys choir sings
The priests drag Young Guido through the school's chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate altar, into the Principal's office
'  - Guido's mother is there with the  (again, she appears the way he remembers her)
am ashamed of you, Guido
But Mamma, what did  do
Bring him here
That savage is the devil
God will punish you for your sins, now and forever
The Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the boy remorselessly
Mamma looks away
Young Guido cries out as they punish him
- and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla in the spasm of sex
He suddenly can't breathe
Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy
He rolls over, recovers slowly
As always, immediately wanting to leave after the sex
p
47 What
What
can't breathe,  can't breathe
Guido, don't die on me
Can you imagine
poor Luigi
It would kill him
(finding her ridiculous) If  die it would kill your husband
Guido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly
Carla kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back
No, that's not what  meant, Guidino
No
Where are you going
have to go to work
Carla,  can't breathe
Guido stands up and picks up his shirt
He puts it on whilst they argue
Let me come with you
It's impossible
Why
Because it's impossible
Please
But why is it impossible
Look at your producer
He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares
Guido
Everybody knows about me
Why
Why won't you let me near you
For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you
It's not fair to your husband
It's not fair to my wife
p
48 See, you're playing with me
You're twisting everything
Please let me come with you
No
Guido heads towards the door, still dressing
'll be here waiting for you with my legs open
Disgusted with himself, he leaves

view of the sea
pop band and a dance floor
slick Italian performs
People dance
The whole   is at a working dinner
Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas, struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia - Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man
(pours himself a glass of wine) Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it, like Figaro
(to Lilli) Like the circus
Claudia is going to be amazing
It sounds like a masterpiece
(hissing at Dante) Dante, you see, he hasn't written a word
(defending his director) The screenplay is first of all a map
That's a map
p
49 Let's try to dig for something else
Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert
Guido
She nudges him
He looks across the restaurant to see his wife at the entrance looking for him
Luisa
He jumps up from the table and hurries towards the dance floor, genuinely happy
: - as Guido is protective of Luisa
holding her back from the dinner table

The jungle drums said it was an emergency
The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit
Not entirely

Come
He pulls her into the middle of the dance floor
They start to dance

When you get home, the house will be full of flowers
Am  already going home

Happy Birthday, my darling

At last
Magnificent
You know Donatella

She leans across to kiss Lilli
He sits Luisa down, goes to grab a bottle of champagne

(confidentially) You're saving the movie
Give him a good idea, for God's sake
Luisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are kisses, etc
as Guido returns and pops open the bottle of champagne
Let's drink a toast to Luisa's birthday
(negating it) It was Monday
Happy Birthday

Happy Birthday
Just then, the Cardinal's Secretary appears
Heads towards the table

Please

Publicly, you know the Church condemns them - we have to - but we all love them

She was the best thing in the movie

54 Guido enters
He's fascinated by her
She's taken aback that he's in front of the camera and approaching her

It's oddly intimate
He stands back to reappraise her

Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened
You open your mouth and a lie comes out
What lie
Why am  surprised

She walks away up the steps
Guido can only guess at what's happened
He heads back to the terrace restaurant

Carla is seated at a table

Raging, he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door

Well, she could have warned you
The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me

Right away
Guido goes back to the suddenly vulnerable Carla
Carla, you have to wait outside
Will you wait with me

So why do  have to wait outside

You told me it was finished
It is
Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if  was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as  know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin
Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly
p
58 (') (smiles, insecure) What
What are you laughing about
Nothing
If you could see yourself
(raising herself up further) couldn't live with it - the absurdity of being you, the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat

It's finished

You drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear

Makeup tests start today
Remember

You can't
You must
Don't sit down

(still packing) You've had help
You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure
'm not cured
(decisive, no arguments) That's enough
The movie calls, your star has landed
Fausto - take his things please
Dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing Fausto
Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall
(') (impatient, at the door) Guido
Andiamo
- Guido's Roadster approaches the gates
There are gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the beginning of filming
They drive through, solemn faced, ignoring the press

) need more time
(
) Forget the script
Claudia's here now
She'll inspire you to do what you do best, write with your camera
p
71 - The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic, people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work, everybody and everything needing Guido's attention
Guido drives towards the stages
Guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesn't exist
Guido is trying not to panic
He feels as if he's just arrived in prison camp
He drives fast and straight to Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are immediately swamped
Pierpaolo has a hundred requests for Guido
Maestro, the screen tests are back from the lab
Will you watch them now
Tonight
We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions
Design meeting
Production meeting
Tonight
Tonight
Dante marches Guido towards the stage
Lilli joins them
Claudia says where are you
She's in fine form
Feisty
(knows what that means) Okay
She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one
said didn't quite have mine
Lilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a rack of costumes
p
72 ,  - couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some lights are being flown up into the grid, the  is preparing the Clapper Board
The Loader has created a slate: ,  ,
The gang enters
Guido says a brisk hello to the crew, then leaves the set quickly
Finds the studio telephone behind the flats
He dials
Guido waits
Luisa picks up the phone
Pronto
Luisa, it's me
Please don't hang up
(she doesn't respond) want you to be with me in the screening room tonight
want to talk to you about the casting, about the script
Everything
/  - ,  at home, listening, inscrutable
Otherwise  won't be able to start, won't know what 'm thinking
Luisa listens
Pierpaolo appears again, always the same, needs him to start
Maestro
Guido nods, waves him away
Are you there
Luisa
Go on
'm not asking you to let me come home,  just want you to come to the screen test tonight
Not for me, but for the movie
You always have, you always do
Luisa puts down the phone
p
73 Guido is in a mess
- Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her
As the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is , of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for Guido
She looks stunning and glamorous
The epitome of a Sixties movie star
Guido gets up and approaches Claudia
Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director
Silence please
Se gira
And we are rolling
Guido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test
Could you turn to the right please, Claudia
Yes,  can turn to my right
And can you turn to the left
Yes,  can turn to my left
Now just one slow turn for us
(she turns around) Okay, one slow turn
Bellissima
Brava
Cut
We've got it
Next costume please
Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately surround her, loosening her hair
Dante is thrilled
Fausto is also mesmerised
She's a star, that's the long and short of it
p
74 And she's warming up for a fight with her director
Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous
Has anybody got a script
Script missing, handsome reward
Lost, one script, title Italia
Can't make a film without it
Lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on Claudia, adjusts her hair
(') So interesting to do hair and makeup for a part when you don't know what the part is
Guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness
(') (shrugs off the coat) No
'm going back to my hotel now
(anxious) But please, just a couple more costumes, Claudia
(to Guido) 'm going back to my hotel now, my darling, and when  there is a script, 'll read it and then we'll take it from there
(calls over to Lilli) love the costumes, Lilli
They are beautiful
(back to the guys, sweetly) Ciao Bello
That's fair
Claudia
(to Dante) That's fair
Fair
'll be back
p
75 Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat from Lilli with him
Opportunity for escape
(calling to Guido) You've got dailies, Guido
'll be right back
(shouting) You've got meetings
- Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing open
The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car, flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a picture of the Star driving away with her Director
Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from Guido
They drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas and little cars
,   - Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse following
Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her in the car, she's such a class act
He's always inspired
He's driving fast but distracted by her
You look ravishing
You're not seeing me, you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup, 'm somewhere hidden underneath
Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the traffic
So do the posse, but as the road opens up, they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake a car, they speed after him
,  - Guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the Trastevere, just south of the Vatican
They watch the photographers hurtle past in search of them
They sit for a second
p
76 It's good to see you
'm assuming that's code for there's no script
Guido is exasperated
Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script
Claudia listens
She's always seduced by the way he speaks, his passion
They fall in love with each other in every movie, that's the way of it
Guido lights a cigarette
(') Talk to the people who love you in our films, they're not interested in my script
They're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon
the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera - how
- (enough examples, sighs) who even knows, but whatever else it is, it's not my script
Guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore
They get out of the car and begin to walk away
It's almost deserted here
So Lilli says 'm playing a million different parts - Not a million - you're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today, a country run by men - who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not
(teasing him) So 'm the women behind the great men
(trying hard to tell the truth) The great women
() p
77 (') In a way - yes - you have this man in the story and he's, he wants to take hold of everything, to devour everything, he can't let anything go, or, he doesn't want to, and he changes direction every day, because he's lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to death
(deflating) And these muses - they fall in love with the man
Exactly
They fall in love with him
(decisive) 'd rather be the man
What
'd rather be the man
She grabs his hat, puts it on her head
Saunters down the road
He follows

No, you misunderstand

When there's a camera between us
No
It's not a real person, Guido
(pointed) And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love
(
) (') , - Claudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient fountain in the centre of the square
The Piazza is empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances have been blocked off
Claudia steps up onto the fountain
p
79 There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and  could hear you walking about
Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain
(') and, all through the night, wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened
And why didn't you
don't know
don't know
"" , , , '
- Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves closer to Guido
The music continues
Maybe you should have knocked, maybe you should have knocked me right off the pedestal
can't do this anymore
She takes off her wig and diamond earrings
(') This is me
And you have a wife who loves you
She hands him the wig and the earrings
She kisses him
(') 'll miss you
Wrong girl
The music ends
Claudia turns and walks away
p
80 ,  - screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test
People start to comment, all enthusiastically
Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up
(to Lilli) Great work, Lilli
Wonderful costume
Thank you
and the hair, makeup, fantastic
Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not Luisa
She has a beautiful profile
Two great profiles
She's a goddess
And the back isn't too bad
She came directly from Venus
Beautiful
Fantastic
Guido
Really nice
Who's next
Actresses
Okay
Let's see the actresses
The reel finishes
The lights come up, to excited chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she shrugs sympathetically
The room goes dark, the next reel begins
Guido turns back to look at the screen
p
81 During the reel, Dante is very decisive
shouts out, as the women appear
They come on, one after the other, say their names
Guido gives them things to do
Pick up the phone and argue with your lover
No, make him laugh
Make him want you
Walk towards the camera as if you were frightened
As if you were angry
- very angry on the phone: If we like her, we have to call her agent right away
Everybody wants her right now
Well they can keep her
She's a very funny actress
She's peculiar
You don't like her Guido
Next actress:
Someone comes in the door
Guido turns and sees it's Luisa, sitting next to Lilli
She's come
He turns back to the screen
Another actress appears
It's Donatella
Very nervous
She says her name
Guido instructs her
She tries the phone, the walks
She's not a natural
Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation
She looks at Guido
little smile
He feels it like sunshine
He turns back to the screen
(') She's nice
She's very natural
Even better
She's a bit nervous here
What do you say, Guido
Donatella's nice
Another girl:
Very striking
Keeps looking out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions from Guido
Her hair is in a chignon
She begins her improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in front of the camera
Approaches her, and undoes the chignon, freeing her hair
She's beautiful and innocent
Guido says something to her, a whisper
But what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes, goes like a dagger to Luisa
p
82 (') Who's this
thought we were looking for a blonde
She's too tall
Very tall
She's very beautiful
It's not the point
Guido wants the blonde
She's not bad, but - Shh
She's beautiful
She's too beautiful
For my tastes
As the reel finishes
and the lights come up
(') don't know what Guido thinks think we are happy with Donatella
Donatella's better, isn't she
Sure
(delighted, jumps up) Great
Anyway, fantastic day, but we have to go home
We have a very, very busy day tomorrow
Thank you very much everybody
Thank you
Okay, well done
The screening room empties, a lot of mutual congratulations on good work, especially to Lilli, and a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for Luisa
Lilli kisses her, leaves
Just the two of them now, husband and wife, several rows apart in the empty screening room
It meant so much to us all
That you came
() p
83 (') (nothing from Luisa) What did you think
Did you like anybody or -
(nothing) Luisa

gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain, beckoning
The curtain opens, revealing the silhouette of a figure bathed in red light
Guido sits in an audience of raucous men who have filled all the seats around him
They start to whistle as if they were at some sleazy club
Guido squirms, trapped
The figure steps forward
It's Luisa, tricked out like a seedy nightclub stripper
,  - Thank you
(encouraged) What for
Thank you for reminding me 'm not special
You don't even see what you do, do you
Even the moments  think are ours, it's just you working to get what you want

He stands up, leans on the chair back
(') The screen test
You have to understand, it's nothing, this is what do,  direct
That's my job
Guido stands up straight
And this is our life
You think to create is to forgive yourself in public
Fine
But don't think  can forgive you in private, because can't ever
"" As the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes her body and her contempt for Guido
Guido watches, humiliated

Instrumental
Luisa charges into the audience: she is mauled and assaulted by the men

You take everything, and 'm empty
Luisa gets up from her chair, heads to the exit door
(') You know, 'm glad  came
can see now
it's hopeless
Luisa leaves
Guido is left alone
The room goes dark as the screen tests, on a loop, start up again
Guido walks into the flickering light of the projector

And you are so far from where you wanted to be
and you're lost and then you're lost

87 No one can help you find your way
(a beat) It's up to you, Guido
Up to you
Nobody else
In Guido's face, a soulful recognition that what she's said is true
,  5 - large piece of Guido's set comes crashing down
Dante and Guido walk through the empty soundstage, leaving behind the set which is being dismantled by a group of construction workers
(
) Old friends,  have to come clean with you
,  - Guido faces his production team
This is hard for him
There is no movie
can't pretend anymore
We have to stop
(nothing more to say) 'm sorry
There is silence in the room
,  5 - The metal soundstage door opens as Guido and Dante walk through and into the sunlight
Guido is defeated
He stops at his car and turns to Dante
Guido gets in his car
Guido drives away
Dante watches him go

88 ,  - It's the end of the season
Only a few customers left in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day, pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables
Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt
Haggard
He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro
newspaper sits open in front of him
Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in Rome
Guido gets up at this moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper, folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant
He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes - ,  - Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play, , starring
Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie
Guido watches from a distance
Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross and head down the street
- Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront
People pass by occasionally
They talk - 'm glad she's acting again
made her costumes for the play
She's funny
She seemed so happy
didn't want to interfere
Is she with anybody
Guido, she's my friend
'm not her mother
don't know
expect so
Nobody likes to be alone
Promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard
p
89 like to get about without everybody pointing at me
And where are you getting about
Nowhere
Here
walk
Just to be able to walk
Are you seeing anybody
No, no
Nobody
(teasing) Well, it sounds exciting
Walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard
might come up here and join you
Don't tease me, Lilli
My heart is - -  know
just miss her
should have tattooed on my forehead
Luisa certainly thinks so
(grasping at this) Does she
Did she really say that
Stop
'm not going to act as a postman between you both
Come back to Rome
Make a movie
Go to work
He sits
Lilli joins him
No
Never
've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up
p
90 You're such a dope, aren't you
Making movies wasn't your problem
You were your problem
Don't stop being a child
You'll never make another movie
Nobody wants that
especially Luisa
She indicates the people who pass
(') Guido - there probably isn't a single person passing by who hasn't been touched in some way by one of your movies
That's your gift
That's what you've been given
Use it
Just use it with some grace
For Chrissake
(doubtful) The only movie  could make now would be
don't know
would be about a man trying to win back his wife
Sounds perfect

glimpse of a female eye applying false eyelashes

Young Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear
We're ready to begin
surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores, models, schoolboys, priests, etc
show about to begin
The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and builds throughout
People run past with props, lights, etc
Showgirls are hurrying
beautiful confusion

He stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence
Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car
He is greeted by Pierpaolo
He seems to need and acknowledge his support
Pierpaolo is tender
can't remember how you do this
You'll remember
The camera moves through the backstage mayhem
Mamma is in her dressing room preparing
Saraghina is sharing a dressing room with a Priest
He is helping with her corset
Carla and Luigi
Carla fixes her husband's hair
Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk
Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe

In his hand, an actual script
The set surrounding them is modest; a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets
The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a woman
don't want to say too much
The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it
But this scene is about reconciliation
And within the scene  would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other
Young Guido rushes by the dressing rooms
Presto
Presto
Take your places
Andiamo
Andiamo
The dressing rooms begin to empty
p
92 5,  ,  - From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido watches Older Guido at work
(Continuing to speak to his actors) Maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again
We start from the beginning each time and  feel today as if 'm starting from the beginning
We'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay
On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and ushers in    '
They enter with a sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom behind Guido
They are all dressed in angelic white
But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task that lies ahead
He talks to his cameraman
Puts down his script
He takes off his jacket and hangs his glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set in front of him
Maestro, should  call final checks
Yes
Makeup, please
Final checks
reveals a tableau vivant looming behind Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every inspiration
They watch him as he begins to work part of him now and forever
Guido sits on the crane
The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure slip quietly onto the set
Tentatively, she steps through the shadows
It's Luisa
From a discreet distance, she watches her husband return to his gift
Pierpaolo calls for silence

Silencio per favore
Silence please

At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the crane with Guido as it begins to rise
Luisa watches
As the last note plays, the crane soars higher, carrying Guido up and up
