Richards Shooting Script () 3/9/99 : 1
-                                 1 tense surgery in progress
Meters flicker, instruments flash in the bright overhead light
In the midst of it all stands
, 35
The master of his domain
Ravell leans forward so a  can mop the sweat from his brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure
His co workers sigh collectively with relief
(to Asst
Surgeon) Close her up, will you
2
-                              2 Dr
Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted
Without his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring: , 25, Raven-haired and striking, and , 24, an exotic mix of African-American and Asian
, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up the corridor
On his heels is
, 33
Lonnie is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to David
In everything
The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks
There's been a train crash near Santa Barbara
They're flying an aortal trauma here now
How can  ask you this, David
David rubs his eyes
Thinks about it
can do it, Blake
His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie
Is he crazy, Jasmine
He's been on his feet for fourteen hours
Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie died
Losing himself in his work, poor thing

' (
) 'll give you something to lose yourself in

) Excuse me, miss

-                                  3 Quaint, Midwestern eatery
Knick-knacks and photos abound
The booths and counter are packed with
family dining section off in one corner
sitting at the counter in team jackets
The older of the two holds up his empty coffee cup
But his , standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move
She's completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on two battered, fuzzy  sets
, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white waitress uniform
attend to customers behind her
The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera
But the older one, still wants coffee
He gestures toward Betty
Miss
Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front of him
Without taking her eyes from the , she pours the java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop
(cont'd) Very impressive
That is very
(turning to others) Did anybody see that
The   around him don't even bother to look up
Of course, they've seen it before
Betty smiles
3
(cont'd) Thank you
Could  bother you for a little more
Before he can even finish, Betty is topping him off with milk
Skim, right
(tears open an Equal) And half a pack, if  remember correct
The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes out
He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail
She looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and gobbling down a huge bacon burger
(cont'd) You know, you're never too young to start on a lean meat substitute
() You wanna try some turkey bacon on that
You want a tip when 'm through
It's your body
Betty turns back to change pots
The older man watches her intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself
(to himself) That's right, so why don't you get up off it
Wesley
(to Betty) 've told him the same thing
Thanks for the suggestion
No problem
Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye always on the  as she approaches two local types
, 32, a short, tightly wound little man, sitting at his own booth
Ballard is spit and polish all the way:  creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes
Badge proudly displayed
He sits with 4
, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter
Betty drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the table for him
Another smile
Hi, Betty
You're looking good
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet
a big liar, but sweet
liked your editorial this morning
Oh, appreciate it
was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to
(interrupting) Yeah, it was great
Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at
like that Lonelyhearts column
(chuckles to himself) 'll take a refill there, Betty
His cup is full before he can even finish the sentence
Hey, Sheriff
How's everything
Oh, you know, the usual
keeping the world safe
meant your food
Oh, right
's fine
Thanks
thought you said the eggs weren't
It's fine
Mind your own meal
5
You should get the order you want
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette
(to Betty) It's no big deal, Betty
There's yolks in there, huh
It's no prob'
gotta keep you on track
Betty grabs Ballard's plate without another word, gives him a reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off
He smiles appreciatively after her, then turns on Roy
Why you always gotta embarrass me been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be
plenty Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow
Mind your own business
You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway
Still carrying Ballard's plate, she returns to the counter
Come on, guys,  told you it's egg whites only for the Sheriff
(quietly) put him in that 'zone' thing
#1 Well, it better be a pretty good size zone if he's in it
Betty and the cooks share a quick laugh
They move to change his order while Betty glances up at the

-                 4 Lonnie catches up to Blake in the corridor
Blake,  can handle that transplant
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure
Why don't you observe
'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake
No, you're not
You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell
've made my decision
Now, if you'll excuse me
Blake exits
The camera moves in to hold on a  of Lonnie's face as he simmers in anger
Music soars

-                                  5 Plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the One of them turns the  off by remote
Hey
We were watching that
#1 The other girls've got orders up
we're not one 'a them goddamn Nelson families, y'know
Betty snatches up several plates to help out
Ballard's food appears with   of porcelain
It's "Nielson"
#1 Yeah, well, we ain't one 'a them, neither
7
() Go on now
When you gonna get those things fixed, anyhow
#1 When you all quit watching 'em for a living
Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at tables where the people know her by name
She moves off toward    in a booth jangling their empty cups
Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills
When a hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with her foot and keeps right on pouring
Absently, Betty takes a look around the restaurant
The other waitresses are gone and no one is behind the grill
Alarmed, she pushes through the double doors into the kitchen

-  -                   6 , along with the  and   are standing in a row waiting for her
alright,  get it, no more
Sorry
No one moves, then  leads them in a huge
They produce a life-size cardboard cut-out of Dr
David Ravell, who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs
Betty backs up in disbelief
(cont'd) Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing
Where did you ever find this
On the goddamn internet, where else
You're joking
#1 nope, got him at "
Hunks with Sweet Little Asses
Com
" #2 Seventy-five dollars
#1 Seventy-eight fifty
(everyone looks at him) 8
Well,  paid for the damn thing,  oughta know
#2 'mon, Betty
Pose with him
Betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man flash photo is taken
cupcake with a single candle is placed in her hands
One candle
uh-oh, you're getting up there
Doesn't David like 'em young
'm over the hill, what can  say
Darlene gives Betty an envelope with cash showing
#1 little something for those nursing classes you've been wanting to take
but keep putting off thanks to a certain husband we won't mention
Oh, guys, you didn't have to do that
So how you gonna celebrate
Del takin' you into Wichita for a big fancy dinner
The others laugh; they know better
So does Betty
Yeah, Dairy Queen, maybe
Oh,  should probably call him
Thanks, you guys
#1 Alright, alright, come on
'm not running no bed & breakfast, we got customers
Let's go
Smiling, Betty grabs a wall phone as the others mingle about

As the , the   across pictures of  , 35, dressed as Napoleon, Caesar and Abe Lincoln, arms raised in a high-energy sales pitch

The   again
We see a framed certificate of achievement from General Motors, dated 1986
After the   an   clicks on
It's loud
(Del's voice) Hello there
You've reached Sizemore Motors, home of the best selection of used General Motors cars in the Big Springs - Fair Oaks area
We can't come to the phone right now 'cause we're out making a sale, so leave us a message; better yet, come on down and steal one 'a these beauties right out from under us
Coffee's always on
(
) Hi Del, it's me
guess you're busy
8
- / -               8 Del's very busy
He's on the rented sofa in the trailer's lounge, screwing his secretary,
But as he rocks the couch, he's listening to Betty's message
(
) know you want the Oldsmobile back tonight, so
was wondering if  could take one of the new Buicks
Del pulls out and lurches across the room
He reaches for the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet
He gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around the desktop until he finds the phone
(
) (') So, call me when you-- Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hang on a second there, baby
Why do you need one of the new Buicks
(
) Oh, you're there
You sound out of breath
ran back in to get the phone
10
The answering machine is on, so their  are
The phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get back to Joyce
He motions for her to join him but she remains where she is, fuming
(
) don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and-- What's so special about it
Joyce looks at Del, incredulous
Then pissed off
He signals to hold on
(
) Sue Ann's taking me out and  thought it might be fun to go in a nice car
Joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up her panties
Del shoots her a look that says ''m not finished yet
'  They pantomime frantically back and forth until Joyce throws him the finger and  out the door
(
) (') What was that
Nothing
it's, ahh, busy here
Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann
Take the blue Corsica
'll see you when  get home
He throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window to get Joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke
(') (through the pane) Shit
Joyce, open the damn gate, will you
As Del zips up his pants Joyce trudges across the lot to bring in the "Closed For Lunch" sign and open the gate
Del silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a moment
He takes in the banners, the signs, etc
(cont'd) that's what we need, some goddamn flags
11

/ -                               9 Betty enters the office
Joyce is on the phone
She looks up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the caller
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet
well, once he dumps her we will
(to Betty) He's out pricing banners
don't expect him back
"Banners
" You know, flags and shit
he said "for a livelier look" or something
Betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set Joyce gives her
(cont'd) ' too bad about the LeSabres
they're a really sweet ride
As Joyce prattles on, Betty notices the Buick LeSabre keys on a rack behind her
She sidles around Joyce, deftly removes a set from the hook and drops them in her purse
She smiles and starts to wave goodbye as Joyce puts her call on hold
(cont'd) Need something else
No,  was just
How you doing
Great
Good
Content
Oh
How come
dunno
Job satisfaction,  guess
() How's things at the Tip Top
They're fine
you miss it
You must be joking
12
Hmm
() So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright
'Kay, good
Bye, then
Uh-huh
(back to phone) Anyway, 'm thinking Easter, 'cause just fucking love pastels
She whispers, then laughs loudly as Betty leaves
10
-                               10 The cardboard doctor is standing next to Betty's Olds
She thinks about leaving him, but picks him up and tosses him into a blue Corsica
He lands with his face against the passenger window
She stands for a moment by the Corsica, dangling the LeSabre keys before her eyes
Suddenly, she jumps inside the Chevrolet and slams the door
11
/  -                  11 The blue Corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the street
The car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row of battered airstreams
Betty gets outs of the Chevy and looks back:  the handsome face of Doctor David Ravell is staring at her from the car
Oh, Christ, what am  gonna do with you
She goes back to pick him up, then starts off
12
-                             12 row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling driveway
Betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck
13
13
-                          13 She tosses the cardboard "David" over a concrete slab wall, climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres
Her key opens the last one - maroon
She puts the doctor on the passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car smell
Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the phone
She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails
We deserve this
14
-  -                             14 Betty has the car at 75 m

The  is blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along
She sees her speed and punches the accelerator

She turns the radio up louder
When she approaches a sign saying "You are leaving Kansas" Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious
She eases up on the gas
slows down
does a -turn and heads back toward Fair Oaks
She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at the billboard that quickly fades into the distance
15
'  -                        15 Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into a driveway
She parks in a detached garage and looks over at the cardboard David
There's no way he's going in the house
She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door
16
'  -                          16 She walks several houses down
On her way to the door we hear a  ,  and   from inside
answers Betty's knock
Her hair is matted with sweat as she struggles with , ages 4, 3 and 6 months
Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber ball
Hey, darling
oww
Sorry, got my own little Gulf War going on here
Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a shelf
It's all one move; they do this every day
14
Did you watch it yet
Sure did
'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort
Yep
Hey,  got a surprise for tonight
We're going to the Starlite in style
Oh, Betty-- 'll give you a hint
If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar
Honey, 'm really sorry,  was gonna call you about tonight
Larry's got a lodge meeting
There's no way  can get a sitter this fast
(disappointed) No
what about your sister
can't ask her again-- Nathan, stop it
Jesse, don't take that, hit back
-- feel terrible, hon
After a beat
It's all right
You sure
Maybe next week we could
Uh-huh
No, we'll do it later
' only a birthday, right
'll have another one next year
Betty forces a smile, kisses the baby and hands it back to Sue Ann, who hands her the videotape
Aahhh
() So what color is it
15
What
The LeSabre
Maroon
() stole it
What
He wasn't going to let us use it, so just took it
Oh,  wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive
Yeah, me too
Sorry, hon
Happy Birthday
gotta go make dinner
Betty throws her a look as Sue Ann closes the door
Betty turns around, frustrated
She starts yanking her apron off as she crosses the street
17
'  -                                 17 low-end ranch
worn-out sofa and loveseat form an '' that dominates the living room
Romance novels line a small bookcase
in cages chatter away in the kitchen
Del sits at the dining room table, agitated
He is presently attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread
All we hear is    and
Betty stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her uniform and quietly eating a salad
Sure you don't want any salad
No,  do not want any goddamn
what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks
16
told you
Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but
She's not comfortable in a Corsica
' got air and leather
took the blue Corsica, Del
Relax
All right, then
Actually, 'm glad you're going out
got something going on tonight
Some serious clients, with real potential
Del , smiles, then  at the birds nearby
like the water purifiers
What
Or the vitamins
Or the
Del almost comes out of his chair, pointing his finger at her
Hey, the  screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it
() Anyway, 'least  try shit, still got some dreams left
you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got
got you, Del
well, then you ain't got much
Oh,  know
() So, who're these clients
Couple 'a guys in from outta town
They want to see the new LeSabres
Betty hides her reaction
17
(cont'd) And  don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up
Just knock it off, 'kay
Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new
They're new to us
Truce for a moment
Del plucks a copy of Soap Opera Guide from Betty's purse while absently taking a bite from Betty's cupcake
He narrowly misses the candle
(cont'd) Jesus
you know these actors are mainly models, which are mainly fags
They've done studies
The rest're assholes
But you know what bugs me most about these soaps
She silently mimics him as he says
(cont'd) It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives
Yeah,  guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del
That is a skill
Del lurches to his feet and crosses to the bird cages as the canaries  and   at his approach
(cont'd) Daddy's here, babies
daddy's here
(to Betty) Be back later
clean up
He exits
She collects his dirty dishes, puts them in the sink and starts to wash them
Then she stops
What the hell am  doing
She drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of wine, lights the candle on her deflowered cupcake and opens the one card on the table
18
a traditional greeting from her grandparents
Red hearts and lace
color photo of them enclosed
Betty smiles at this
After moment, she quietly sings a quick refrain of "Happy Birthday" to herself

'  -  (  )          18 Standing wrapped only in a towel, Lonnie speaks into the phone
Tell me something good, Sugar
19
'  -  (  )           19 The beautiful nurse Chloe is curled up seductively on her sofa with her phone in one hand and a cigarette in the other
We're all set
told him my car's in the shop
He said he'd be happy to give me a ride home
(
) You're beautiful
Tell me something  don't know
Betty hits
Characters flit on and off the screen at top speed until David Ravell appears
20
-  (  )             20 Chloe's magnificent legs are folded into the seat of David's 560
She struggles with her seatbelt, so he helps her
She makes sure their hands touch
Thanks for pulling over, David
can't go that fast without taking a breather
Sorry
it's nice to see what this little beauty can do, though
guess, somehow, all that speed helps me forget the past
19
'm sure it does
(touching the seats) Mmm, leather
How far do they recline
David smiles, a little uncomfortable
(cont'd) Listen, David,  know 've said it before, but  want to tell you again how sorry  am about your wife
() It must make you scared to get close to someone again
She puts her hand over his on the gear shift
moment
Finally, he has to move her fingers to start the car
(cont'd) Let's not go
not yet
sits on an old couch in the den and watches, eyes glued to the screen
Suddenly, she hears the sound of sweep across the window
Damn
She hits  and crosses to look out
21
'  -                               21 Del gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car, followed by and  - the guys in the team jackets from the diner
Charlie is 63 years old
He wears a dress shirt, slacks and docksiders
The suburban father look
Wesley is 28
He's in jeans, -shirt and white Reeboks
Clean cut; the kid who used to mow your parents' lawn
Betty quickly snaps out the light and closes the door until it is open only a crack
22
'  -                               22 Del swaggers into the house
The two men follow politely
you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em
20
You're a hundred percent right
They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much
Del stops and looks around, deflated by the mess
The den is only a short flight of steps from the living room and the kitchen
Betty has a clean view of both from where she sits on the couch
23
'  -  -                         23 She hears Del come in, but doesn't take her eyes off the screen
(
) My apologies, gentlemen
asked my wife to straighten this shit up before she went out
23A
'  -   -                23A Del crosses to an old stereo and puts on an
He smiles as the music overtakes the room
Charlie and Wesley stand nearby, appreciating the quaintness of the surroundings
Now, what can  get you gentlemen to drink
Del crosses to the cupboard
Charlie and Wesley stand leisurely in the living room
Bourbon, little water, thank you
Beer, please
You got it
Wesley looks at a wedding portrait of Del and Betty
Hey
you got a fine one right here
Wesley
(to Del) Your wife's a very lovely woman
Have seen her before
21
If you ate at the Tip Top you did
Oh, yes, with the coffee
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup
Del reaches into the fridge and produces a Miller for Wesley, then mixes two drinks and walks into the dining room and Charlie and Wesley follow to the table and sit down
like this
like doing business in the home
It's cozy
(noticing the card and cupcake) Who's birthday
Ahh
my wife's
What'd you get her
Huh
Oh, umm, a car
() So, to a successful transaction
They raise their glasses and drink
Del tosses back his drink in one gulp
24
'  -   - (  )     24 Chloe is on top of David, kissing him on the mouth as he resists
He finally has to push her away forcibly, and we hear a
Chloe's blouse has been ripped
'm sorry, Chloe
She starts to cry
David reaches out to comfort her
(cont'd) It's not that  don't find you attractive
'm just not ready
David looks up to find her lips on his
In spite of himself, he gives in to the warmth of her kiss and responds hungrily
Betty is mesmerized
22
25
'  -   -                 25 The men have retired into the dining room, sitting or standing around a worn wooded table
Charlie and Wesley are just finishing their drinks
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it
need to know if you're for real
If we're for real
You don't exactly look like drug dealers
Isn't that the point
Yeah, well,   don't have time to screw around
got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up
We appreciate that
But you just poured me a drink, 'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes
Fine
You got five
It's a nice place you got here
Real comfortable
Sweet little town, Fair Oaks
You like it here
(laughs) Are you kidding me
What's to like
Seems like a nice place
It is, if you like idiots
What do you mean
It's a small town, man
never should have left Omaha
People here think 23
small
They act small
They're a bunch of dumb fucks
Really
You better believe it
Could you give us an example
Of what
'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck
don't follow
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del
(warily) No
didn't think so
So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing
Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it
Are we gonna do business here, or not
Relax, we brought the cash
'm just curious
Can't you give me an example
(annoyed) All right
lemme see
okay, new Burger King opens up
These assholes get excited and start lining up
Like it's some five star restaurant
The place is mobbed
Right
24
Hmmmm
"Five Stars," huh
() Is that stupid, Wesley
No, that's ignorant
They just don't know any better
That's what  thought
(to Del) You better give me another example
This is bullshit, can we get down to business here, please
Off a look from Charlie, Wesley produces a pistol and gently nudges the barrel into Del's ear
(') Jesus Christ
He's waiting
Okay, uh
the, umm, Injuns're stupid
"Injuns
" You did not just say "Injuns," Del
The Indians, Injuns, whatever
They're always drunk and doing stupid things
Like what
Driving their cars into trees
puking on the sidewalk
stupid shit
Let's see
around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if 'm not mistaken
don't know
25
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours
() So here's how this is gonna work
Would you take your socks off, please
My socks
You heard the man
Del slowly takes his shoes and socks off
He's sweating, trembling
'm gonna talk to you and when 'm finished, you can answer
But  don't like being interrupted
Now roll them into a ball
Del does it
Oh, Jesus, please
Please, God
and put them in your mouth
At a sharp look from Charlie, Del obediently stuffs the socks into his mouth and starts to cry
Wesley produces a roll of duct tape and fastens Del's hands to the back of his chair
26
'  -  -                         26 Betty is glued to the , oblivious to the men
Chloe and David are still talking in his car
She continues to cry

) You're wonderful, Chloe, you are
But just know there's something special out there for me
27
'  -   -                 27 Now 'm gonna tell you what stupid is
Stupid is taking something that doesn't belong to you
Right Wesley
26
That's right
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy
That is so right
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them
Right Wesley
Now, that's really stupid
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not
Don't we
Del nods; crying, sweating
(cont'd) Good
Now we're getting somewhere
You agree that you were stupid
Del nods again
Wesley collects Charlie's glass and mixes him another drink
He gets a beer for himself and stands behind Del
Charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it
(cont'd) You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans
Right here where your house is - you'd have been scalped
Hell of a way to die
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley
We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels
Del's eyes get huge
(') It's pretty simple, too
() 27
First you take a knife and just draw a mark right across the hairline
Wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the very top of Del's forehead
Trickles of blood wind their way down his brow
Del is  and  through his socks
(cont'd) Hold still, Del, we're just talking here
(pointing to a spot) Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut
It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off
mark, huh
Wesley takes a jab at Del's forehead with his knife, leaving a small cut
Del starts twitching, rocking back and forth as Wesley grabs a fistful of his hair
(cont'd) Shut the fuck up
bleed more than that when  shave
Del stops moving
He breathes furiously through his nostrils
Now
want to know the particulars of your stupid act:  how you got what doesn't belong to you, who helped you get it, and of course, where it is now
Charlie pulls the socks out of Del's mouth
Del splutters, gasping for air
It's in the Buick
swear to God it's all there
28
'  -   (  )        28 David enters
Blake nods to him grimly
You wanted to see me, Blake
wish  could say  had good news
(off David's look) David, 'll get right to the point
Chloe Jensen has filed charges of sexual 28
assault against you
() You can continue to practice at
County, but 'm afraid  have to revoke your privileges here at Loma Vista until this is resolved
on David's shocked expression (
) '
Betty's not sure what Del said, but the panic in his voice got through
She hits  and takes a look
29
'  -   -                 29 Del is facing her, tiny rivulets of blood running into his terrified eyes
Wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife
got it from a truck driver named Duane Cooley, out of Amarillo
He brings my cars down from Detroit
But  haven't touched it,  swear to you
Please
Please
Please
Annoyed, Charlie stuffs the socks back in Del's mouth
Betty stares
Her gaze shifts from Del to Wesley, drawn by Wesley's demonic expression
Consider yourself lucky
Luckier than those 'Injuns' you have such contempt for
Wesley stares at the top of Del's head
Betty stares at Wesley
Charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink
(cont'd) 'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal it's the American Indian
This country has a black mark on its soul for what was done to them
Wesley's nostrils flare
Betty leans forward
(cont'd) 'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed
It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley
29
And with a long , Wesley rips Del's scalp from his head
It makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing
For a long moment, there is only silence
An eerie silence
Suddenly, Del  into his socks and thrashes in his seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides
Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near
Blood flies and curios shatter as Del thunders through the room dying bull, only messier
It's quite a show
Wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand, as if wondering how it got there
Betty is transfixed, horrified
Charlie re-enters
The two men look at each other over Del's as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the breakfast counter
Del bashes blindly into it
(cont'd) (to Wesley) What the fuck is the matter with you
Wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on what he did
Charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully Del through the head
The big man stops suddenly, blinks once or twice, topples over
30
'  -  -                         30 Betty points her remote at the dining room and clicks it, as if trying to make the image disappear
Finally, she gives up, slowly turning away from the carnage and aims at the
" Reason to Love" pauses on the face of David Ravell and Betty sits in absolute silence
31
'  -   -                 31 Charlie quickly begins to hide their tracks, producing a plastic baggie and collecting the beer cans and his own glass
He also wipes down the fridge as Wesley watches
Are you out of your mind
You scalped him
30
You told me how to do it
That was to get him to talk
() Get rid of that thing, will you
Wesley crosses to the garbage can, steps on the lever
He looks at the scalp one more time before dropping it in
(') This is great - just great
Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is
He told us it's in the Buick
We don't know which Buick, do we
Well, why'd you shoot him
had to shoot him
It was the only decent thing to do
They exit the house
(
) (cont'd) This is very unprofessional, Wesley

She pushes 'play' again and David Ravell begins to speak
33
'  -  -                    33 Sue Ann comes out of her house, balancing a homemade cake in front of her
The candles give off an unearthly glow as she picks her way up the Sizemore's gravel drive
34
'  -  -                      34 Betty is catatonic, staring at the frozen image of David Ravell on her
Downstairs, Sue Ann comes in
31
(
) Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday, dear-- terrified  as the cake lands unceremoniously on the entryway
As she hits 'Play': you're wonderful, Chloe, you are
But  just know there's something special out there for me

'  -  -              35 Roy enters the foyer and looks around, carrying a pad and pen in hand
He hears  from the kitchen, sees going off
He sneaks down the hall when   stops him
Hang on there, Roy
Nobody comes in
Elden called me
He wants to, ahh, make a statement for the paper
The deputy nods him through and Roy moves off toward the sewing room where he has spotted Betty
36
'  -   -              36 Betty is packing an overnight bag on her bed when Roy enters and quietly closes the door behind him
She is working with a purpose, almost like a different person from the woman we first met
Still bright and cheerful, but with a willful glint in her eye
Determined
Hey, Betty
Are you okay
'm great, good, content
(stopping) What happened to your arm, Roy
Oh, nothing, it's fine
just need to keep it wrapped for a few
32
Make sure it's elevated
Uh-huh
You want me to make you a sling
It's no problem
Betty starts whipping a -shirt into place but stops abruptly
She turns curiously to Roy
(cont'd) What're you doing here, Roy
Well,  was worried about you and wanted to make sure you were alright
and  guess  was sort of hoping  could ask you about what happened
Oh, that
Sure,  saw the whole thing
It was disgusting
My God
did you get a look at who did it
Yes
You did
Was it anyone that you
It was Chloe
Sheriff Ballard enters the house, surveys the scene of the crime where one deputy wipes blood off his boot with a paper towel, and erupts when he sees Roy
Hey, you guys wanna try not stepping directly in the evidence, please
(to Roy) Ostrey, you and your goddamn police scanner
leave for ten minutes and
Betty, 'm sorry about this
He motions to a female officer
33
(cont'd) Why don't you take her down to the station
We'll be along in a bit
She leads Betty out the kitchen door
'Night, guys
37
'  -   -                 37 As Ballard leads Roy into the next room
Okay, let's go
got nothing for the record yet
Oww
My arm, careful
Ahh, what'd you do now
fall off your bike again
No, it's nothing,
my piranha just mauled me a little when  layed their food out
Good God
they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there
can't
they prefer a more formal presentation
don't usually go so close to the surface, but  was
you are so goddamn weird
() Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here
No, Elden,  need to
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene
And leave Betty alone, she's
34
She knows who killed Del
Elden, she said it was a woman
It wasn't a woman
Yes it was
Betty saw the whole thing
Your killer's name is Chloe
'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy
38
'  -   -                 38 Ballard drags Roy into the living room, where he sees Del
He has been turned upright and is being carefully examined
Jesus
You think a woman did that
Roy runs into the kitchen, covering his mouth
39
'  -  -                     39 Ballard and his cronies delight in watching Roy struggle with the dry heaves
Roy runs to the kitchen sink, almost loses it, then wipes his mouth with a paper towel
Kinda' looks like a burnt out roman candle, don't he
() Del must've sold a lemon to the wrong Indian, and got paid back the old fashioned way
Them Kickapoos get pretty mean when they drink
Roy sees Del's scalp in the garbage can as he goes to drop his crumpled towel inside
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee
They no longer live in tepees, Mr
College Graduate
35
Did you send anyone out there
You bet  did
got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now
Bad idea
You just go write your little story, Roy
'll handle the police work
You better handle what's in this garbage can first

Charlie and Wesley are at the last car
still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth
saw his soul Wesley
He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation
But your Geronimo act rattled me, and  abandoned my instincts
() Never abandon you instincts
didn't
You gave me a look
What 'look'
That one look you got
thought you were done, so  took him out
wasn't done,  was just sick of hearing him whine
And you didn't take him out, you scalped him
Christ,  almost puked, did  tell you that
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story
36
What the hell does that mean
If 'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat
Wesley is stung
Charlie slams the last trunk in disgust
The rest remain where they are; open
(cont'd) It's not here
Let's go
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this
Why not, it'll confuse 'em
gotta do something, now that you fucked it up
wanted to make a statement
Let me tell you something
In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring
The guys who get the calls are good - not flashy, just good
They get in, they get out
Nobody knows a goddamn thing
Understand
Boom, boom, boom
Three in the head and you know they're dead
that's a good motto
Fine, 'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it
It's the only statement you need to make

Ballard and Roy watch through a window
And did your husband know these people
Sort of
but he ignored them
And how did that make you feel, Betty
37
felt all cold inside
And angry
Ballard looks both ways to make sure he won't be overheard
questioned Joyce about all this
Yeah
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del
On a regular basis, if you get my drift
and half the other guys in this town
Including you,  believe
Junior year
Anyway, so what
So
Suppose Betty found out about them
You said a woman couldn't have done it
woman can write a check
So you're saying Betty Sizemore - our Betty Sizemore--who you were in swing choir with--has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched
You're amazing
' just a theory
just 'cause 'm thinking it don't mean  like it
The doctor comes out of the holding room
(cont'd) How is she
38
She's in a kind of shock
see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms
Could  have that in American
It's a type of altered state
it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning
So she did witness it
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden
That's it
'
He spins Roy around and marches him toward the door, one arm bent behind his back
Oww, the arm, the arm
You just don't know when to quit, Roy
You were jealous of me when  got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now
One question, Doctor, please
(outside the door) You can't do this
'm the press,  have rights
That's right, you have the right to remain silent
Ballard pushes Roy out the door
As he returns, Roy reappears behind him, leaning in to listen
Ballard doesn't see him
(cont'd) Sorry you had to see that
You were saying
was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being
also think you ought to have her 39
stay with someone tonight
() Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are
No
Friends from the diner maybe
Well, you should find out
She keeps talking about them
Ballard nods, sure he's got a clue here
He looks in at Betty again, just as she begins repacking her travel bag
He frowns at this, his suspicions fueled all the more

Sue Ann tucks her in and turns out the light
Let me know if you need anything, okay
Are you and Larry happy
Oh,  dunno
enough,  s'pose
Then you should treasure that
you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit
All you been through

All the time
Well, you are
After a beat
40
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it
Yeah, hon
Real bad
You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine
Sue Ann, 'm sorry about all this, but just know there's something special out there for me
Sue Ann looks down at her friend, troubled
She strokes Betty's hair gently and kisses her
After she leaves, Betty lies awake, staring at the ceiling

The Mickey Mouse clock on the wall reads 3:30
Beneath it, Betty is sitting up in bed, wide awake

'  -   -               44 Betty comes down the stairs without a sound
She finds a pen and paper near the phone and writes a note
:            Dear Del: This is the hardest thing 've ever done and  can't even face you
But  need to be honest
We haven't been happy for a long time
You always say people need their space, and now you'll have some

They're extra
Mmmm
Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane

All he talks about is those Japanese gals

When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together

On the dashboard is a Rebel flag pin, a bumper sticker that says "The South Will Rise Again" and a dozen country music tapes
Duane gets in the sleeper cab, where stacks of porno tapes and magazines reach the ceiling
Wesley takes the driver's seat, Charlie, the passenger seat
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane
Georgia
In case  didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen
We can live with that

Duane passes two videos to Wesley
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone

(laughs) They're Korean, so they're pretty hot
You know, it's interesting
The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory
Huh

Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis - they're all losers in my book
Charlie smiles

The fuck you talking about
Even Robert
Lee was a loser

telltale piece of Confederate red fabric hangs out of his mouth
There is a purplish bruise on his forehead
He's quiet, but glowering at his captors
So, at a rest stop outside Logansport you noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars, and you decided to see what it was
Then you figured you'd take this valuable commodity and go into business yourself, even though it didn't belong to you
But you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it, so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose Del
Sound right so far
Duane nods
(cont'd) Del's dead, by the way
sent him to the Great Beyond
Actually,  scalped him, and then you killed him
Duane narrows his eyes in disbelief
Exactly
() Now, the one thing  don't get is that we checked all the Buicks on that lot
Four '97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em
Duane smiles mockingly
(') Ohhh
There weren't four, were there
Charlie reaches up above the visor and pulls down a rumpled manifest
He leafs through it
(cont'd) There were five, damn it
should have known
Goddamn
() So, what happened to the fifth car

Duane shrugs his shoulders
(') You know you're going to die, don't you, Duane
(Duane nods) And you really don't know where that other LeSabre is, do you
Duane shakes his head

He doesn't know
Should  kill him now
Wait
Any last words, General Lee
Duane nods emphatically
Wesley pulls the Confederate flags out of his mouth
Suck my dick, you Yankee piece of shit
He spits in Wesley's face
Charlie has to restrain Wesley
God,  admire that
Ya see that, Wesley
That's why they get all the glory
Charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the parking lot
The Town Car is parked near the adjacent motel, just a few spaces away from Betty's LeSabre
With a furious calm Wesley wipes his face, then takes out a can of lighter fluid, sets it on the dash and looks at Duane

Her show
" Reason to Love

He can't help himself

She's a slut, but just don't think she's that mean

His Federal Marshall's badge rests on the counter
Shehands him two photos of Betty taken at her birthday celebration
In one she's holding the cardboard David Ravell
The other, a closeup shot
and how long did she work here
Oh, five years, give or take
Hmm
you two in high school together
Aren't you a sweetheart
no, not quite
Anyway, she's been with us awhile
But she wanted more out of life, right
No
she just wanted something outta life
Anything
And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing
That's her husband, Del
'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way feel about all of this

(holding up photos) May
If it helps bring her back, be my guest

Thank you for your cooperation

did she ever talk about getting rich
who doesn't

and what kind of car does she drive
Well, she wanted a LeSabre, but Del made her use that blue Corsica
() So, is this what you boys'd call 'pumping me for information
' Joyce  as Wesley stops moving
Did you say LeSabre
Look, she didn't kill Del over no car if that's what you're thinking
But she could have taken one, right
With her knees, Joyce prods him into humping her again
Maybe, but  don't think she had the nerve
know her
And 'm a pretty good judge of character
Joyce reaches for a cigarette on the nightstand and takes a deep drag
Wesley closes his eyes and turns away, offended

Yes

Please
It's very important to me

(Betty nods) When  went to Europe my friends told me was crazy
57
Europe
The Europe
(laughs) This is my first time out of Kansas
should call you Dorothy
() When  left here  went straight to Italy
Everybody told me not to go
But wanted to go to Rome ever since  saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit,  went
Did you love it
Sure  loved it
It was great
Ellen rinses a few glasses as she talks to Betty
(') Let me tell you something
got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought  was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and  got some kind of weird gum disease from the water
Plus, it ended my marriage-- That's horrible
No, he was a toad
Even more of a toad than Merle
just wear the ring to keep the flies away
Rome was the best thing  ever did, because
And swear to you, it changed me
've been to Rome, Italy
sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me
Betty leans across the bar conspiratorially
She looks at Merle to make sure he won't hear her
left my husband two days ago
Really
58
'm getting back with my ex-fianc
He proposed to me right around here, so guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop
Wait,  thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas
Oh

'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good
Nice move

He's a surgeon
Ellen looks at Betty
Yeah,  know, we just watched him together, remember
Up there on the

You're serious

Ellen whistles, wipes the bar down to buy a few seconds
Merle looks over at Betty, then catches Ellen's eye
59
(') Piss off, Merle
(to Betty) So how you gonna find him, Betty
'll go to the Hospital
What if you can't find him
What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be
Like Rome
Worse
You made out alright
Yeah, but at least  knew Rome was gonna be there when  arrived
Ellen walks to the end of the bar and starts rinsing glasses
After a beat, Betty gets up and moves down close to her
Ellen, this is the biggest thing 've ever done, but 've gotta do it
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you
To tell you the truth,  can't believe 've made it this far
It may not be Europe, but  just know there's something special out there for me
Ellen looks into Betty's eyes - sees the innocence, the hope and enthusiasm - and has to look away
Betty takes it as her cue to leave

Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up
She's an amateur, just like Del was

(into phone) Yes

Sorry, you've got the wrong number
He hangs up

Ice water in her veins

Probably a Swede or a Finn
'Finn
'  What is a Finn
You should read more
Listen to me think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her
She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole
Then she sees her opportunity, and

These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty
Hah
We've been tracking her for, what, three days and  already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg
Charlie pulls out the close-up photo and studies it

He then returns to his computer, struggling to find the right words and to type them with only one hand
He types a little, stares at the screen, then deletes an entire sentence one character at a time, hammering on the 'Delete' key
He glances up at the television as the words 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' are repeated

We think we know where Betty is
Ah, shit
Do  have to hear this now
What's with the tupperware, Elden, did Meredith run outta baggies
No reason to get a plate dirty
see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on
Worry about your own goddamn lunch

Betty is a big, big fan of the soap opera, " Reason to Love

She tosses a copy of "Soap Opera Digest" on the desk
Ballard ignores it and keeps eating
Why do  need to see this
Did he ask you to
Listen
saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on They're television characters
Betty's in love with Dr
David Ravell, from the show
What if she's out in Los Angeles looking for him
The actor, mean
That's the dumbest thing 've ever heard
Yeah
Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona
She said she was in Arizona, did she
& Yes
You people are even more stupid than thought
The woman's on the run and she's gonna just phone in her location

Photos of Betty at various ages lie scattered in front of them
Charlie holds up a picture of a young Betty in ballerina costume posing at the barre
He studies it intently
This is Betty at twelve
Very graceful
Perfect form
Betty was a lovely child
And she always had such spirit
But, after her mother died
Would you say she was ambitious
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy
Never really had a childhood
caring for her father, going to school
Charlie admires a photo of Betty, around 18 years old
He continues to rummage through a box of collectibles, pocketing a small child's diary when it is convenient
Wise beyond her years, 'm sure, and such poise, too
(quietly) Very, very impressive
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband
65
don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone  can tell you she put up with things in that marriage wouldn't have
And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him
And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry
What do you mean
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me
(taking her hand) Mrs
Blaine
can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone
That's not our Betty
(defensive) why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody
Because it ain't natural, young man
What are you talking about
Killing's totally natural
It's dying that isn't natural
(covering) My partner's still young, Mr
Blaine, and he loves his job
(laughs) He'd like to kill all the criminals himself

Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff
You must know him
He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate
He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but-- (Off Chief Nurse's look) It's not true
He was set up
Well,  certainly would have heard about that
Of course, he's only here two days a week
He's also on staff over at Loma Vista

It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background

You've just described all of Southern California

As well furnished as a legal assistant's salary will allow
The living room is dominated by a large glass tank filled with tropical fish
Betty checks out the space
It's lovely
really like your aquarium
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat
Hmmm
Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men
Oh,  dunno
but just once  wish 'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits
Betty smiles, a little embarrassed
(cont'd) come on, 'll show you your room

Wesley sits in the passenger seat with the door open
The  is on
Charlie is on his cell phone nearby
(into phone) No, we don't know where she is understand
No, we'll find her
() understand
He hangs up and looks out at the horizon, where huge black storm clouds are gathering
Then he walks slowly to the hood of the car, staring at the ground in front of his feet
What'd they say
Can we go back to Detroit
Charlie rests his hands gently on the hood, as if considering buying the car
Wesley's   from the radio
77
They said find it
Find her, find it
Finish the job you were paid to do
Half
What
They paid us half
They still owe us half
(disappointed) There it is again
That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place
That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain
() They don't owe us shit, Wesley , '
Charlie  on the hood of the car, scaring Wesley
(cont'd) That woman could be in any one of four states
Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley
We're not in Rhode Island
know that
Wesley switches it off
Charlie turns his back to the car and addresses the angry clouds on the horizon
(cont'd) Do  deserve this
In the twilight of my career, do  deserve this
don't think so
've always tried to do what's right
never took out anybody who didn't have it coming
'm a professional
() ' 78
Worse
you're in Texas
Well,  should be in  now
If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and 'd be on my way to the Keys
On my boat, Re-ti red
The first raindrops begin to fall
(cont'd) 'm very tired, Wesley
've worked hard, and the work should be over, but '
This job is just beginning
(he turns around) Wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell Charlie, whose eyes are blazing
Charlie silently walks around to the driver's side and gets in
He and Wesley stare at each other over a photo of Betty, which is between them on the dash
Charlie starts the engine and snatches up the picture
(cont'd) What're you thinking, girl
What's going on in that pretty little mind of yours
Huh
You can tell me
He paws at the picture, imploringly
He mutters to himself
Wesley shakes his head and stares out
96
-  -                           96 Betty sits in an office along with a  who taps away at a computer keyboard while she studies a printed list of names
can't find Loma Vista Hospital
never heard of Loma Vista Hospital
don't believe this
You're the second person here who's told me that
That's like Ford saying they never heard of
Try another county

He exits
97
-                                    97 Rosa is on the phone at her desk in a law office
(
) Hey, Rosa
it's Betty
How do you get to this town called 'Tustin
' It's in Orange County
Tustin
Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five
(
) The Five
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that
(
) Okay
oh, umm, would you mind if borrowed some clothes
Huh
Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want
() We're still on for tonight, right
98
-                              98 Betty stands in a sexy pink dress, trying to decide if she should put on a hospital gown and waits, tensing each time she hears a voice from the hallway
Finally, the man's hand and the bottom of a white sleeve appear
The door swings open and a silver-haired, bespectacled  in his mid-60's enters
The nametag on his white coat reads " ,
" 99

Betty winds her way through a  , passing out small white cards
Rosa spots her and goes over to meet her
80
You made it
Hey, that looks great on you
' classy
() So, how'd it go today
You find him
Ummm
no, no
Different 'Ravell
' Rosa starts to lead her to the bar
(cont'd) You know, the more  think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place
What are you talking about
This bar is packed with professional people
() Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone
Luckily, 'm currently off men, so 've got the luxury of not giving a shit
know what you mean,  recently had some trouble with a man, a different man
and David's still getting over Leslie
(off Rosa's look) His wife
He has a wife
Had
She died in a car accident last year
She was decapitated
God, that's awful
It may not have been an accident
They never did find her head
Her 'head'
You're making this up
No, no
Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who believe was mixed up with the Mafia
81
Jesus,  thought my love life was crazy
Rosa and Betty are sitting in a booth, talking over drinks
The place is a little quieter now
(cont'd) so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there
They've got all the phone books, plus medical directories
() We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay
'm making this my personal mission
David isn't hiding from me,  left him standing at the altar six years ago and now 'm
Fuck the details, they're always to blame
Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers
see it at my company all day long
So 'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever
() One of us should
Rosa,  can't believe you're doing all this for me
thank you
Rosa glances over to see Betty pass a business card to who checks on them
When he is safely gone, Rosa touches Betty on the sleeve
Hey, how 'bout a card for me
What is that
(takes one, reads) "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell
"  This is my phone number
How many of these have you given out
How many men have  talked to
82
Jesus
They're all gonna be calling me
You said in
, anything goes
was talking about what you could wear

-                        100 The Town Car's parked on a barren stretch of desert highway, white smoke billowing from the hood
Half a mile ahead Charlie and Wesley are walking in the sweltering heat
They're in their shirtsleeves, drenched in sweat as the sun beats down on them
See, in a LeSabre Betty's probably getting twenty-two, maybe twenty-five miles to the gallon, where we're topping out at fifteen
() She's probably all cool and fresh, and comfortable in that nice air-conditioned car right now
Wesley wipes the sweat from his eyes and trudges on in silence
Charlie takes out a photo of Betty and speaks to it
(cont'd) You don't look comfortable here
That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you
Nah
You're like me
What the hell's the matter with you
Wesley grabs the photo, tears it in half and tosses it
Then he starts walking
Charlie is stunned for a moment, but recovers quickly
He finds the pieces and stuffs them in his pocket, then catches up to Wesley
That was a really shitty thing to do
'm sick of looking at her mother-fucking face
beat
they walk for a moment
83
Don't talk like that
She's my last one, Wesley, my final target
(to photo) Don't you realize your special, that you represent something
This is too much
Wesley explodes
What
What does she represent
What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you
'd just love to know
dunno
something
() Why is she doing this to me
Why
don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it
101-102                                                   101-102 102A
-                   102A The Lincoln Town Car is raised up high on the hydraulic jack
Wesley is at a pay phone out front
Can you describe her to me
Okay
Yeah, that sounds like her
Thanks
He hangs up and goes into the garage, where he addresses the Town Car above him
(cont'd) They found her in Vegas
No answer
(cont'd) Perfect match on the description
Lying across the front seat taping the reassembled photo of Betty to the dash
Charlie's beginning to come apart
His hair is uncombed and his clothes are wrinkled
His eyes have a thousand-yard stare
84
(
) (') Sounds like she's with the buyer Del lined up
Charlie pulls himself up on the door and looks down
How'd they describe her
You know, blonde, thin, whatever
Not so fast
Slower
'blonde, thin', yes
Did they say she had style kind of grace or anything
Wesley rolls his eyes, then goes straight to the levers controlling the hydraulic jack
(to mechanic) How do  get this fucking thing down
wouldn't if  were you
He got pretty upset when  tried it

(The entire scene is in Spanish
) What do you think my father would do if told him  didn't want to be a lawyer anymore
Probably the same thing my mom would do if  got engaged
have a heart attack
So how's it going with your new roomie
What's her name
Betty
It's
except 'm worn out
We spent all weekend looking for her 85
doctor-boy
How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County
She's gonna have to 'cause 'm out of ideas
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice
What's his name again
David Ravell
God, that sounds so familiar
Ravell, Ravell
where's he out of
'm not sure now
She said he used to be over at Loma Vista
never heard of it
Loma Vista
(laughs) You mean like the guy on " Reason to Love
" 104
'  -                           104 Rosa enters, tosses her purse on the table and goes straight to the

The characters appear

The same clerk as before busies himself at another counter
Rosa appears at the glass partition and raps urgently on it
Guess who  saw today
Who
86
Doctor David Ravell
What
Where was he
(off Betty's puzzled look) Cut the shit, will you
Rosa  the videotape down on the counter
(') Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems
Which one is it
have no idea what you're talking about
'
Shhh
heard you the first time
(suddenly calm) spent my weekend looking for someone who does - not - exist
should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but  was with you
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so
Is this about gas money
'
() You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character
Not the actor - whose name is George, by the way
His character
Rosa stands over Betty, fuming
Are you having a nervous breakdown
Rosa  and smacks her hand on the glass as Betty watches
in a nearby lounge look up
Rosa stares at them until they look away
87
(cont'd) Why'd you help me in the first place
helped you because 'm an idiot
Ask my mother,  love it when people take advantage of me Betty tries to return to her work but Rosa confronts her loudly
The nearby  and  pretend to be busy
You need help, Betty
Even if this is your idea of a joke, you need (walking away - to herself) Necesitas un mdico
Pront simo
fuming in her humiliation
After a moment, Rosa reappears at the window
(cont'd) 'm not going back on our arrangement
My word is good, and my family owes you
But think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can
Fine

-  -                  106A Roy and Joyce approach the door to the trailer/office
She takes out her key, then stops
It's been padlocked and barred with yellow police tape, as is the whole lot
Roy pulls hard on the lock, then starts looking around
You're wastin' your time, Roy
Look Joyce,  need your key to the files, not advice, okay
This is a complex case
88
Roy works on opening a side window
Nothin' complex about it
Del's dead, Betty's gone
She's probably dead, too
You'd like that wouldn't you
You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together
No
before that
Ahh,  hate this town
Places like this just make you small
() should have never come back here after college
Blah - blah - blah
Hurry up, will ya, got a date tonight
Roy forces the glass open and starts to squirm through the window as Joyce watches
(cont'd) don't know what you think you'll find, anyway
(
) Names, a phone number, something
() Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it
If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass,  wouldn't have to be breaking in here
The color drains from Joyce's face
What did you say
(
) The driver was killed
think there's a connection-- (starting to cry) No, about
Are you talking about Duane Cooley
89
(
) Yeah
Why, you know him
(crying) Know him
We were gonna get married
He was gonna leave his wife for me
Fuck
Joyce begins to sob at the side of the trailer as Roy shimmies through the window frame
Suddenly, Ballard is there, weapon cocked and placed roughly into Roy's privates
Joyce backs away
know you don't use them, but if you wanna keep 'em you'll back out of there slowly
106B
-  -                         106B Roy is in the rear of the car, handcuffed to the screen dividing the front seat from the back
Ballard is driving
Come on, Elden, think about it
The driver, all them trunks standing open like that
something's going on here
know that
Well, do something, then, damnit
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle
You don't think see what's going on
Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce
' not no conspiracy, not some episode off the -Files
's just a crime of passion, plain and simple
Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here
moment of silence as they drive
Oww
Did you have to make these things so tight
90
No,  didn't have to
He grins at Roy in the rearview mirror

-                              107 Mercedes Lopez arrives at the office and stops at Rosa's desk
(The entire scene is in Spanish) Hey
Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy
Oh, yeah
Man, 'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air
Mercedes hands her two tickets to a benefit
Here's your needle
He's supposed to make an appearance here tonight
108
'  -                            108 Betty's lying on her bed reading "Modern Nurse"
The
Times Classifieds are open on the bed
Rosa looks in
Don't worry, 'm looking
just taking a tiny break
This is crazy
come home, you go to your room
You go in the kitchen,  go to my room
It's stupid
Betty nods in agreement
(cont'd) So what do you say
Can we be friends
okay
Rosa smiles and starts looking at the tickets in her hand
(cont'd) What are those for
91
Oh, it's a charity dinner
The money goes to a good cause, but  don't have anybody to go with
Umm
Rosa exits for a moment, then reappears in the doorway
you hungry at all
109
-  -          109 The car is covered in dust and mud from the road
It's worse inside: food wrappers, empty bottles, pieces of clothing, filthy windows
They've been living in it
Wesley's driving now
Charlie's almost unrecognizable: a six day beard, uncombed greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, rumpled clothes and an exhausted, faraway look
The photo of Betty faces him, taped to the glove box
He is reading from the diary, which he clutches like the Bible
They roar along a desert highway, passing a sign that says "Grand Canyon, This Exit
74 Miles
"  Charlie looks up, marking his place
We should go
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground
We can make Vegas in four hours
This one's got to be her
It's a very moving experience, trust me
No
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World
No
be dark before we get there
You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night
What difference does it make
She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas
We 92
went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty
So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas
You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties
Vegas is too crass for Betty
said, 'No
'  -
Charlie turns to a passage and reads aloud
"When  grow up 'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian
always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral
" (to Wesley) Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you
Do you hear yourself right now
Like a fucking madman
Wesley drives on stoically
The Exit comes and goes
Every American should see the Grand Canyon
Are you an American
Yes,  am and we're not going
Act professional
Charlie stares at him, hate rising from just below the surface
He draws a nickel-plated pistol and points it at Wesley's head
Wesley looks at it and keeps on driving
Charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it
He lowers the pistol
If you don't take the next turn for the canyon, 'm blowing my goddamn brains all over this car
He puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it
Wesley looks over, not so sure this time
of the black Town Car as the turn signal comes on, and it eases onto a lonely dirt road
Their headlights pick out a sign that says: "Grand Canyon Fire Trail
Forestry Personnel Only
" 93
110
-                           110 Rosa and Betty approach the hotel entrance
Ahead of them a black Lincoln Town Car pulls up
Headlights glint on the chrome, hitting Betty in the eye
She freezes, and Rosa bumps into her
Sorry
Betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should mean
Then a  in a tuxedo gets out
Betty moves on
111
-  -                   111 sign on an easel reads "Save the Children
"  Betty and Rosa present their tickets at the door to a ballroom
Several times there is a stir near the entrance and a scattering of flashbulbs
Rosa scans the crowd
Looking for someone
You never know who you'll see
Rosa keeps looking
Finally,  McCORD - the actor who plays   - enters
He comes in with  , late 40's, and
Several women approach George, some starry-eyed, for quick, polite greetings
He's doing his job of being a soap star
Rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on Betty's shoulders and points her at George
(cont'd) Look who's here
Betty's jaw drops
She freezes
(cont'd) What are you waiting for
Talk to him
You came fifteen hundred miles for this
Rosa prods her, then Betty makes her way unsteadily toward George
When she's a few feet away he looks up
He can't help but notice her - she's beautiful
She's also looking right into his eyes
The conversation stops as he does a double take in Betty's direction
94
Do  know you from
His friends watch as George studies her face
of course you do
(hurt) You don't remember me
take it  should
'm sorry
We were engaged
Oh good, another one
George's friends look at each other
few heads turn
beg your pardon
But 'm the one who's sorry
Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life
(to his friends) We were thirteen days away from getting married and
just got scared
It's a mistake 've had to live with for six years
But it's behind me now
(to George) And  hope you can put it behind you
've missed you
David
George sighs with relief
His friends smile
The tension evaporates
They can handle a fanatical fan
That's very kind of you
The day  left you  just drove and drove
drove all day and all that night, and  didn't go anywhere
just kept driving
stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and  sat-- in the very first pew, where we would have sat on our wedding day
95
Betty looks at her
So does George
(cont'd) can't believe  remembered that, although  suppose  should
wrote it
(to Betty) But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim
'm flattered think
Or frightened
What's your name
Betty Sizemore
What do you mean you wrote it
'm Lyla Branch
'm the Producer
They shake hands
Rosa watches expectantly
(cont'd) Alright,  admit it, you had me there
You're better than most of them, anyway
do you have a headshot
No, wait
what happened next, Betty
Are you sure you want to encourage this
() No, you're right, let's have some fun
So, what did happened next, "Betty"
Well, David moved out here and started his residency
Then he met Leslie-- No, no, no
We know all that
What happened with you
married a car salesman
The friends laugh
Rosa watches, confused
So is Betty
#1 You were dumped for a car salesman, George
Why are you calling him George
96
#2 Yeah - David - tell us about this car salesman
George likes the challenge
This party isn't so boring after all
Oh, you mean Fred
No, Del
Right, Del
Del was one hot salesman
Of cars
He could talk anyone into anything
You knew Del
Honey,  didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and  go way back
We went to school together
In fact, he saved my life
Two more minutes in that icy water and  would have drowned
But Del jumped in and grabbed me
We fell out of touch eventually, but  still owe him one
He never told me anything about
that's unbelievable
Funny, that's just what  was thinking
can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him
His friends snicker
Rosa stares
Betty is oblivious to everything but George
'm so sorry
Life makes us do awful things sometimes
She's ready to cry
Which only inspires him all the more
tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it
But
Del
97
There was no plan
was just young and stupid and scared
You never gave us a chance
know that
can't tell you how many times 've said that to myself in those exact words
Betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now
George doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but his friends interrupt
Hey, don't
come on,  was just
you're not really crying, are you was just playing along
#1 Now, look what you've done, George
Why do they keep calling you George
don't know
Why do you keep calling me George
Listen - David - It's getting late
George hesitates; Lyla sees it
(to Betty) Right, uhh
feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party
() But
'd be honored if you'd come
Yeah, bring your friend along
'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do
Rosa watches, stunned, as Betty waves to her as she leaves arm-in-arm with the man of her dreams
98
112
-                               112 The Town Car is parked near one of the viewing stops at the rim
Charlie stands in the darkness, but Wesley stays in the car
You don't know what you're missing, asshole
Charlie walks toward the canyon rim
Suddenly, Betty appears in the headlights standing at the rail - her back to Charlie - with a bouquet of flowers
Just as he closes his eyes to rest, the
Yeah
(
) Mr
Campbell
Huh
(
) Is this Neighborly Life Insurance
(recovering) Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell
(
) It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend
heard from her
walking toward the rail
As he nears her, they kiss
Suddenly,   from the car horn
The image of Betty shudders, then blurs, then fades away entirely
Charlie rubs at his eyes tiredly, then slowly trudges back toward the car
Charlie returns and gets into the car
Silence
Wesley stares at him
you have a good time
You make a little wish
99
Silence from Charlie
(cont'd) Well, guess what
found Betty
where she's been, anyway
Where
Where is she
'm not telling
What
'm not telling 'til you straighten up
You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty
mean it
slow transformation comes over Charlie
Wesley, 'm fine
just tell me where she is
113
-                             113 George, Betty, Lyla and the two friends are waiting outside the hotel for their cars
#2 bought a car from Del, too
He sold me a lemon
Really
put a hundred and thirty thousand miles on mine
Huh
had no idea our little lot was so popular
#1 never bought a car from Del
But loved him
In my own way
guess we all did
(to Betty) You know, didn't marry Leslie because  loved her
married her to forget you
100
Oh, David
'm sorry  caused you that much pain
black jeep 4x4 pulls up and  , the actor who plays , gets out
(cont'd) Oh my God
What's Lonnie doing here
You're late, Eric
know
Why are you guys leaving
We did our twenty minutes
Before Eric can take another step Betty  him across the face
go off as  capture the moment
You bastard
How can you even show your face around here
Do you think we're not onto you
Who the hell is this
Sorry
She thinks you're someone else
George hustles Betty to his car as photographers continue to shoot
know exactly who you are
114
-                           114 The Lincoln Town Car rumbles into the dusty parking lot and parks
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to
Maybe she had to use the bathroom
She pees, doesn't she
Wesley tears the photo of Betty from the glove box
101
Be careful with that
Charlie takes it back and gingerly secures the tape
115
-                           115 Merle is at the bar, drunk, the only customer on a slow night
Ellen drops two coasters in front of Charlie and Wesley as they sit down
What can  get you
We're Federal Marshals, ma'am
Ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled clothes
We're looking for this young lady
He slides the photo of Betty across the bar
Ellen's gaze drops to the picture for a second, and Charlie sees what he was looking for - a flicker of recognition
He allows himself a satisfied grin
Wesley shows Ellen his badge as Merle checks out the photo
haven't seen her
Sure you have
That's
Shut up, Merle
Charlie continues to grin at Ellen
Ma'am, if you've seen this woman-- Betty
That's her name - Betty
Charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket
never saw that woman before, and neither has Merle
He drinks too much
And don't try to tell me you're cops 102
was married to a cop for nine years, and you're not cops
Now get out of here
Wesley steps behind Merle, takes a handful of his hair and his head into the popcorn machine on the bar
Merle staggers away, stunned
Wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop from a nearby hook
Ellen reaches for something under the bar, but Charlie's faster
He pins her arm with one hand
You haven't been very forthcoming with us
They watch Wesley follow Merle at a slow walk around the pool table,  him over the head about every five steps with the popcorn scoop
Merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down
They begin a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the of the scoop against Merle's head
What's your name, dear
Ellen
That's a nice name
After one more  shot Merle staggers, then falls
Wesley walks over to Charlie and Ellen, drawing his knife
That's a really nice name

'   -  -  -      116 George and Betty are alone
Lyla's very nice
Yes, she is
She told me  was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town
And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me
103
She's a good person to know
() So where did you study again
Carleton School of Nursing
Two semesters, but Del made me give it up
Alright, okay
think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago
You told me that two hours ago
He pulls up in front of Rosa's apartment and parks
(cont'd) haven't been this happy since  was twelve years old
What happened when you were twelve
For Mother's Day,  used all my allowance that 'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City
We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city
It was the last outing we took together
She died the following year
Wow
You just gave me goosebumps, you know that
You make it all sound so real
Great improv
just want everything to be perfect between us
know
Listen, we need to take a time out here
Can we talk seriously for a minute
Of course
104
At last
know how much you want this
You're gifted and extremely determined, but
it's not up to me
know
It's up to us
Betty leans over and kisses George - so deeply that he's too surprised to react
She pulls away abruptly and gets out
(cont'd) love you, David
And  want to see you tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day
Still surprised, and now a little intrigued, he watches her go inside
117
'  -                             117 Betty comes in and pours a drink from the fridge
Rosa appears in a nightshirt behind her, framed in the doorway
Were you with him this whole time
Oh, God
You scared me
Yes
You still in love
Betty nods
Does he know you think he's real
He is real
Uh-huh
So, what'd you talk about
Oh, my gosh, everything
My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know
No, 'm not sure  could begin to imagine
So, where'd you go
105
To a party in the Hollywood Hills
Was it a huge place
With a view of the whole world
Yes
'd never been in a place like that before
have, lots of times
My mother used to clean them
used to piss in their pools
Rosa gets up and starts for her bedroom
She stops
(cont'd) This isn't fair, you know
Do you always get what you want
No, almost never
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist
You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him
() Betty, you are one-of-a-kind
Rosa goes into her bedroom and closes the door
Betty smiles and nods, sipping at her drink as she retires to her room

It's Ballard
Elden, let me out of here
Now
This is ridiculous,  need medical attention
That's a nice name for what you need
106
Come on,  have to get this dressing off
it itches
And what about my fish
Who is taking care of them
Ballard doesn't say anything
He's very grim, subdued
Roy has never seen him like this
Just shut up a second and listen
That, uh
that bar in Arizona
Where you said Betty was
What about it
Any idea where it is
Little place called "Williams," why
just got something off the wire
The woman who owns it was murdered last night

got inside my character last night like  haven't done in six years on "Reason"
It was a totally rejuvenating experience
know, George,  was there
'm not denying that she's good
She's even taken a job as a nurse
() David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla
107
We know that
Can  have an evil twin
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie
The blind one last year, remember
Oh, of course
Who can forget the Emmy
() Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens
don't know, George
'll tell the cast ahead of time
What do you say
'll think about it
It'll be like live television
Let's live on the edge a little
You and  can break the mold here
said 'll think about it
Fine, but promise me one thing
If we use her,  want to direct those episodes
She's my discovery
Actually, she was my discovery

So you believed the bartender
Why
Well
think  saw her soul
That's good
You're learning
But let me tell you why  know she was lying
() First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star
It's beneath her
dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling
should have known it all along
'm kicking myself as  shave here
So, first thing we
Wait, wait, wait a minute
that doesn't make sense
What doesn't
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman
109
never said that  believed
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to
so that means you trusted her that much
so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky
Huh
'Cause  just don't buy it
Call it instinct
Call it 35 years of professional know-how
call it 'nutty' as my shit after  eat Almond Roca
You need to remember who you're talking to
need to get my goddamn head examined
() You can't rule something out on a whim
Or because she's cute
've been following your whims all across the
of
and now 'm tired
Me
Wesley
"It's beneath her
"  She's a mother fucking housewife
nothing's beneath her
Wesley stands up for emphasis, pointing a finger in Charlie's personal space
Charlie reacts at this, throwing his razor into the sink and turning on Wesley
Boy, you need to get outta my face
now
You got a feeling, then you do what you gotta do, but don't you ever try to tell me my job
Not ever
It's a standoff
Wesley blinks first
He stalks off and out of sight
In a moment, he returns
Fine
Just fine
'll go check some shit on my own then
And don't call me 'boy
' 110
He turns and slams into the door frame
He glares at Charlie, then exits
When the front door   allows himself to go back to his shaving

-                             123 Map in hand, Wesley stand near   and discreetly asks questions
what kinda car's Jasmine drive
Ahh, Mercedes,  think
Black
Yeah
The sport utility
Uh-huh
Damn, that's sweet
() She really that good-looking in person
Better
Oh fuck
Wesley looks around covertly, then produces a fifty
(cont'd) Hey, can you sneak me on the lot
Sure
Wesley smiles and wanders off, headed toward a series of studio buildings in the distance
The guard watches him go
(cont'd) it's Sunday,  can sneak anybody on the lot

You're sure
Yeah, Detroit by way of Kansas

No, please
Go ahead, it's your funeral
Rosa
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you
What if he's lying about who he is
You should have a little faith in people
Does he ever talk about medicine
His patients, the hospital
All the time
It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that

Not as much as 've heard about you
She's a very nice girl and you better not hurt her
What
Betty appears
Rosa, so you've met David
Sure did
And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George
Oh, he does that
(hugging him) It's this silly game he plays
Half the people who know him call him George

'  -                           126 don't think your friend likes me
She's a little jealous,  think
And confused when it comes to men

Well, first  thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then  thought of somewhere a little more romantic
Like my place

Betty and George sit on the sofa with the lights low and playing
God,  haven't felt like this since  was with Stella Adler in New York
You're so
real
113
He leans forward slowly to kiss her, but Betty pulls back
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me
Didn't
No,  would have remembered that name
The only Stella  ever knew was a parrot
() Was this before Leslie
Before us
George takes her face in his hands and looks at her
've never met anyone like you, Betty
know, that's why we were meant to be together
No,  mean your dedication scares me
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something
Yeah,  felt that way, too, when  first started, but now
the hours, the repetition
it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore
Maybe  should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier,  don't know
() just hope it's not too late for me
God
Listen to me, "Me, me, me
" It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself
Stop, right
That's it, no more about me tonight,  promise
Let's talk about you
what do you think about me
'm kidding
Seriously, Betty, 'm doing all the talking here
but  love listening to you, so that's okay
114
Thanks
But 'd like to hear what you're feeling
Well,  just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around promise
You know,  almost believe that
you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life
(laughs) said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember
remember
You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it
Yes
maybe it was
She kisses him deeply, then allows herself to fall back on the sofa, pulling George down on top of her and kissing him passionately

He's the show's Main Prick
And that is definitely Betty
Now, that ain't no coincidence

Charlie studies the photo, troubled by something
Who's this

doctor on the show
why
Charlie thinks about it, then reaches into his pocket and takes out the photo of Betty with the cardboard David
As he compares the photos, Wesley peeks over his shoulder
(cont'd) What in the
(simmering) What the hell is this
You've been holding out on me
All this fucking time
It just didn't fit her profile
Fuck the profile
That's the same guy
She can't be here because of a
a soap opera
Not a soap opera
That'd make her
crazy
No shit, Shaft
And you ain't far behind

Man, you have got to get some therapy

' 116
yeah,  got it

You made your point

Just a little further
come on
George stops and puts both hands over Betty's eyes
He looks about expectantly and then uncovers them with a flourish
(cont'd) Surprise
Betty stares, slowly trying to take in her new surroundings
It looks like Loma Vista, but something is different
Odd
Cameras, lights, etc
- all the apparatus of a  show - are in plain sight
And very disorienting
Oh my gosh
didn't know  was going to meet your friends today

He leads her to a taped mark on the floor as appear, including  and
That's cute
listen, you got the part, and 'm directing
You've only got four lines today, so  thought 'd just spring it on you
No blocking or anything, just stand near the nurse's station
we're gonna do a quick walk-through
Alright
He kisses her cheek and walks off toward the waiting Lyla before she can respond
(
) Quiet on the set
Traffic was terrible
No, that's fine, we've only got seventy pages to shoot
take your time
hands Betty a set of sides and an on-set tries to fit her
Excuse me
What are you doing
We'll get you into hair and make-up after this, just put this on
The other actors take their positions
Lyla watches from behind the cameras as David readies himself
Chloe enters the set with Kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume
(to Betty) Hi
hear you're great
Good luck
What are you doing here
David
Your lines'll are in the script, but you can ad lib
Ad lib
118
In fact,  want you to ad lib, that's the magic 'm after
wanna give a whole new feel to the show
She's sliding toward a complete meltdown
Slate it
George steps back behind the cameras
Betty's still frozen to her spot, overwhelmed
Just do what you've been doing
Watch the scene and on your cue take off from there

Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop when they get to Betty's cue
Their faces loom around her menacingly
Staring
The lights are impossibly bright
People begin to shuffle and stare at one another
Lyla clears her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling
Betty
Are you all right
(to Chloe) think you stepped on my first line
was talking to her
(to Betty) Do you need anything
She's freezing up
George approaches her
Betty,  thought this would be the best way
You know, throw you into it
What the hell's going on
If you need a minute, that's okay
But thought you'd want to-- 119
David,  don't
Can we talk privately for a second
Stop calling me David
We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here
As he pulls away Betty grabs his arm
Why are you doing this to me
Why am  doing this to you
Isn't this what you wanted
Lyla approaches
Is there a problem, George
No
No problem, there is no
(to Betty, sotto) What is the problem
Just do that
thing
you do
Come on
You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it
George steps back behind the cameras as if nothing's wrong
Betty still hasn't moved
She's shaking with fear
The cast and crew members find it hard to look at her
All right, everybody
That's ten minutes
No
Let me try this
(storming off) This is bullshit
Forget it, George
It was a gamble, it didn't work
Nice try
Let me try this, goddamnit

George throws down his script and rushes up to Betty, who reaches out to him
He brushes her hands away
Well,  don't know what you had in mind, but  hope you're happy
put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot
What do you mean
What did  do to you
Who put you up to this
Did my ex-wife ask you to
David, please-- ,     ' , ' Betty begins to cry
Leave her alone, George
You're a fucking grip, go grip something
(to Betty) And you're not an actress, you're nothing but a soap opera groupie, aren't you
Well, why don't you get a fucking life, and stop ruining mine
Betty stands dead still as George continues to berate her
slowly starts to drop out, then comes back abruptly with a
Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she stares at him
'm sorry
Oh my gosh, are you George McCord
What
What did you call me

George
McCord
You're my favorite actor on
She called you 'George,' George
did  win some contest
But 'm David

You heard her

'm not crazy, she is
Why are you screaming at me

why am  here

You're doing this now
After all the
are you sick
Are you going to kill me now
No,
'll leave
Forgive me if caused you all any trouble

How do you do, Mr
McCord
We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,
a Ms
Betty
Deranged
That would be the right word

She's staying with a Rosa something
Hernandez, Herrera
know it's an '' sound
in Silverlake
Thanks so much
You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot
More than you know
Is there anything else
No, that should be more than-- Good
George turns to leave
Actually, there is one more thing
George stops
Wesley is suddenly shy, hesitant
(cont'd) It's just
well
watch the show too, and you being Dr
Ravell and all, thought you could maybe get Jasmine to come out here
You thought wrong
George pulls away
Wesley grabs his sleeve
It's just for an autograph
It's not for me
It never is

George wrenches free of Wesley's grip and takes off
Wesley is furious
He catches George in two strides, spins him around and  him across the face
George's glasses go skittering across the floor
stare
You need to learn some manners, friend
reach out to your goddamn fan base a little more
Charlie pulls Wesley away
George is frozen to the spot, humiliated, a pink handprint emerging on his cheek

It sucked dick

She moves without direction, in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her, causing her to turn
She is staring at a black Lincoln sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome
She shudders involuntarily at it
Suddenly, she hears a familiar voice
(
) What the hell are you doing here
It's Del
He's in a pastel version of his usual shirt, slacks, and tie
(cont'd) Well, are you gonna answer me
What'd you come here for
came for love
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you
'Cause you know what that is
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives
That's right
So, if you know it, why are you in trouble
124
don't know
You sure don't
Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway
You should remember where you came from
And who you really are
Del looks up at the sun for a moment, shading his eye from it
(cont'd) gotta run
Got some serious clients to meet, with real potential
() Goddamn, it's hot
He wipes the sweat from his brow
Betty looks at his handkerchief and sees that it's soaked in blood
Then back at his face, now obscured by blood pouring down from his head
She stares, horrified, and in that moment Del becomes

Are you crazy

Where are you going
have to leave now
She tries to put Betty's suitcase away
What
No, 'm not gonna let you just run out of here
You need to talk about what's going on
You think 'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it
My husband was, ahh
Your husband
Yes,  had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen
was right there
Rosa stops
Jesus
What are you saying

That you had something to do with it
don't know

Whoa
What the fuck're you doing here
He breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter, then quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire
He removes the tire, then raises the panel on the floor of the trunk as Charlie joins him

It hasn't been touched
The bottom of the trunk is lined with brown paper-wrapped bricks of cocaine
Charlie stares at it, shaking his head
(cont'd) You were right
Del wasn't lying
Well, you were right about what that bartender said

Wesley looks at him
He appreciates the compliment
But you were right first
You gotta follow your instincts
Charlie takes a long look at Wesley and smiles proudly
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid
Leave
Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money
We could do that
could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out
but that's not what we're gonna do, is it
No
if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror
This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one
My instinct says  gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing 've tried to teach you here-- It's to follow my instincts
And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge
No,  said to follow 'my' instincts
Now, we go up there and conclude our business
Case closed
Charlie walks off
Wesley closes the trunk up and prepares to follow him
oh, that's fucking democratic
138
'  /  -          138 At the sound of the  Rosa goes to the door
She looks through the peephole and sees Charlie holding up a badge
128
'm Detective Jefferson-- Oh
Did Betty call you
Charlie nods
Rosa opens the door, and he enters with Wesley
She's got problems, but she's no killer
hope you guys can straighten this out
Charlie and Wesley exchange a puzzled look
We'll do what we can
Where is she
Bet-ty
(to the men) Please, go easy on her
She's had a really rough day
Betty appears
She recognizes the men instantly and freezes
Charlie's eyes wander over her
slowly
Wesley notices
(cont'd) These guys are here to help you, Betty
don't think so
() Rosa,  didn't kill Del
they did
Wesley produces a pistol, sitting Rosa forcibly on the sofa and tapes her mouth and hands
Charlie walks over to Betty
We meet again
He moves closer to her
almost whispers
Wesley steps in and quickly tapes her hands
Charlie stops him
(cont'd) Not her mouth
(to Betty) 've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me
've seen it painted on the horizon
(to Charlie) What's wrong with you
129
at the door ruins Charlie's moment
That's our pizza
Wesley hustles Rosa out of the room
Get rid of them
You understand
Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole
She stares with disbelief at
He  again
She opens the door a crack
Betty
Boy, am  glad to see you
Roy
What are you doing here
You're in serious danger
Ahh, look, right now's not very
woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail
He still thinks you had Del scalped
never said that
Open the door, Betty
shoves Roy aside; Charlie's getting edgy
Sheriff,  don't
'mon, Betty, open up
got some questions for you about
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty
think there might be
It's not really a good time, guys
Don't give me that
've come two thousand miles for this
130
Charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the door and finally snaps
Two thousand miles
That's nothing
He flings the door open, sticks a pistol in Ballard's face and yanks them both inside
(cont'd) Hah
You probably flew
've crossed the river Styx looking for her, pal travelled the fucking country to be here
Charlie slams the door and frisks them, taking a gun and handcuffs from Ballard
Wesley returns with Rosa
(cont'd) (to Betty) Who are these idiots
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter
And this is Sheriff Ballard
We all went to Fair Oaks High together
Oh, this is wonderful
Wesley takes over
He sits Rosa down on the sofa, then pushes Betty down next to her and beckons to Roy
Come here
He breaks Roy's nose with his pistol
Roy crumples to the floor, holding his face
Betty starts to scream, but Charlie puts his hand over her mouth
Wesley tapes Roy's hands together, then beckons to Ballard
(cont'd) Your turn
Ballard drops to his knees in a prayer-like position near the aquarium
got two kids and a dog
Wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor, then with a foot on his neck, he loops Ballard's arms around one leg of the steel aquarium stand and handcuffs him
131
Charlie does nothing but stare at Betty, his eyes locked with hers
Wesley sees it
Act professional, remember
Charlie pulls her to her feet
(cont'd) What are you doing
Charlie leads Betty out of the room
(cont'd) No way
This is not professional
139
-                                 139 Silence
Then Charlie takes out a knife and cuts the tape from Betty's wrists, touching her hair
Gently
He leaves her standing in the corner while he sits on the edge of the bed
s'pose you did that so  could take my sweater off or something
No, just stand there
lemme look at you a minute
She does
Charlie stares intently at her
(cont'd) Do you know who  am
know what you are
Do you know why 'm here
've got a pretty good idea
You're here to kill me, so kill me
You want me to be afraid, but 'm not
don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband
Charlie studies her, then sets his gun down on the bed
You really
didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you
132
have no idea what he was mixed up in
it was always something
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify
(off her blank look) Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty
Drugs
God, no
'm totally against drugs
Damn, life is strange
had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch-- Not that  didn't admire you for it
Charlie slowly folds his knife and pockets it
well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here
to see you
140
'  -   -          140 Wesley stands over Ballard, about to tape his mouth
Rosa and Roy are sitting in chairs opposite them, their mouths and wrists already taped
You killed that bartender in Arizona and the trucker in Texas, didn't you
How did you find Betty
just put it all together
knew David, Lonnie and Chloe were from that show
Roy starts freaking out, trying to talk through the tape
(cont'd) Betty thinks they're real people
It sounded crazy, but it was worth a shot
Roy is apoplectic
133
What do you want
Wesley tears his tape off
That's a lie
figured it out
've been trying to tell this dumbass-- Fuck you, Roy Ostrey
--small-time, pissant, Barney Fife-- Shut the fuck up, both of you, before  kill you
'm the one who watched the show was
Did Chloe crack
Totally
She came apart like a house of cards
They dropped the charges
Goddamn
how 'bout Jasmine
She's a lesbian
Wesley immediately pulls his gun and points it at Roy's head
You lie, motherfucker
swear to God
Rosa  her feet, drawing Wesley's attention
She tries to talk through the duct tape; gestures for him to come to her
What
You scream, you die
He yanks the tape off
Rosa winces
have a tape of today's show
134
141
'  -  -              141 Betty is sitting on the bed
Charlie leans against the wall, facing her
He has trouble starting this
never meet people like you
'm a garbageman of the human conditon
deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives
But you
you're different
am
Sure
You could probably have any thing you wanted
somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it
Betty looks curiously over at Charlie
(cont'd) 'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good
take care of myself, and  got some money socked away
You'd never have to work agin, that's for sure
'd treat you like a queen
Umm,  don't think that
Wait
Let me get this out
(clears his throat) like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children
read passionately, and  like to discuss things
'm basically conservative, but flexible
've been involved in the death of thirty-two people, but  can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty-two pieces of shit, excuse my language
"Thirty-two
" Well, thirty-three, but 'm not counting Del, on account of you
so, what do you think
135
() You probably feel 'm flattering myself to see us together
don't feel that, no
just
'm not really who you think  am
No one is, honey
Here, listen to this
"If who  am and who  hope to be should meet one day,  know they will be friends
"  Now that's beautiful
Betty is stunned
wrote that when  was twelve
where'd you get that
(he pulls out the diary) know
borrowed it from your grandparents because
it doesn't matter
Don't worry, they're fine
(he gives the diary back) Look,  used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea
() 've chased you across the country, Betty, and  come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think
thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something
Yes, but 'd sort of like to put that behind me now
142
'  -   -          142 Wesley is engrossed in watching " Reason to Love
"  Behind him, Ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until he's completely upside down
He rubs one foot against the other until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot
Rosa and Roy watch
He finally lifts the boot off
It falls soundlessly onto his chest
small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle
He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank
136
Roy and Rosa   at the same time to cover the noise
Wesley glares at them
Ballard gets the pistol free
But it falls into the fishtank
The air goes out of Roy's sails
Ballard has fucked up again
On screen, Chloe and Jasmine kiss and embrace
Wesley reacts as if he was slapped
goddamn
Wesley immediately runs the sequence back to view it again
Ballard  the wall of the fishtank with his cowboy boot
Roy and Rosa cover the sound again with
Wesley pauses the
and looks around
(cont'd) What's your problem
Ballard  at the tank again
But he can't break the glass
Roy can't take it any more
He launches himself at the tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of himself
torrent of water, fish, plants and gravel pours down upon him
(cont'd) You stupid piece of fuck
He leaps at Roy and starts kicking him savagely
Rosa throws herself onto Wesley's back, knocking him to the floor
Ballard paws through the muck, scattering fish and gravel everywhere
He spots a glint of metal in the sand
Wesley struggles out from under Rosa
Just as he gets free, Ballard , hitting him  into his chest
Wesley stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him
Then at Ballard, as if trying to link the two
He slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream
(cont'd) ---------
Charlie opens the bedroom door
Wesley
Charlie sees Wesley turn to him as Ballard  again
Wesley's face explodes
The flying lead drives Charlie back to the bedroom
Crawling through the muck, Roy notices a fish flopping helplessly on the carpet inches from his face
137
Those're Japanese koi
Yes
How'd you know that
You gotta get 'em in water right away
We're in a shootout, Roy
Shut up about the damn fish
shut up
(to Rosa) They're beautiful, but get them some water
He gently hands her the fish, then picks up Wesley's nearby gun
Rosa nods; she's amazed that he knew what it was
She looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away toward the kitchen
143-144         (  141, 142)                          143-144 145
'  -  -              145 Charlie  back from the doorway
Oh, Christ, they shot my boy
Enraged, he empties his pistol at the living room
Ballard and Roy return fire, and Charlie ducks back in
(cont'd) (reloading) How the hell did this happen
'm in a goddamn shoot-out
Wesley
What the fuck happened out there
He opens the door, and a bullet slams into the doorjamb near his head
He ducks back in
Charlie sags against the wall, looking toward Betty
(cont'd) That's my son
My son is dead
'm sorry
138
You're sorry
'   ' ' , Charlie fights back his grief
(cont'd) What do you want from me
Charlie can't handle the moment
He breaks for the door, and  away
This time he's nicked in the shoulder
He stumbles back, losing his balance
His gun falls and slides right into Betty's hand
Equally surprised they stare at one another
Charlie slumps over in his defeat as Betty holds a shaky pistol on him
Oh shit
146
'  -   -          146 Rosa crawls to a flower vase and dumps a second koi into the water inside
Roy and Ballard crouch behind the open archway, using the hanging beads as protection
(checks his gun) We need ammo
Go check his jacket, 'll cover you
'm not going out there
Let's wait for the real police
You gotta go, we're pinned down
So why can't we just sneak outside
Huh
Lady, you don't just run away from crime
besides, Betty's in there
139
(checking) You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead
say we wait
No, no, no
you don't know shit about procedure
You don't send your best
've got the working gun, Elden, me
You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there
Ballard stares at him in disbelief, then back at the closed bedroom door
Ballard starts off on his belly
Goddammit

Betty moves close to Charlie to look at his shoulder
He watches her intently
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance
better go check on them
Wait, Betty
you still haven't answered me
This is really awkward
The  are coming closer
He waves her off
Ahh, it's too late, anyway
It's too late
() Listen,  could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me
If you'd gimme my gun back
140
'd rather not
Betty,  don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison
No way
've got some professional pride
And  don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out
what're you saying
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword
Charlie fumbles in his pocket, then pulls out the photo of Betty with the cardboard David Ravell
(cont'd) Did
did you really come here because you love this guy
Yes
Not the actor, though, the doctor
think
Charlie's sinks slowly to the floor
So all this
really was because of that soap opera
My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor fake doctor
wouldn't have put it quite that way, but
Wesley didn't even want to come up here
He warned me, but  insisted
() have to ask you, Betty
are you crazy
don't think  am
Charlie remains sitting pensively for a long beat
want you to listen to me, Betty
People don't lie when they're about to die
141
() You don't need that doctor
You don't need that actor
You don't need any man
It's not the forties, honey
You don't need anybody
You've got yourself
and that's more than most people can say
Charlie reaches out slowly and takes the gun from Betty
She doesn't fight him
He kisses her hand and steps into the bathroom and closes the door
