- William Wordsworth the theory of black holes was developed before there was any indication from observations that they actually existed
do not know of any other example in science where such a great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis of thought
It shows the remarkable power and depth of Einstein's theory
There is still much we don't know, such as what happens to objects and information that fall into a black hole
Do the reemerge elsewhere in the Universe, or in another universe
And can we warp space and time so much that one can travel back in time
Maybe someone will come back from the future and tell us

Frank drops to his knees, ducking under the cables, shuffles to center of the vault
Places his hands at opposite ends of the halaghan tool, hoping for the cables to pass directly over his head

Frank jackknifes out of the water, ramming the halaghan into the ceiling

She made up her mind
Nothin'  do is gonna change it
Nothing you're willing to do
Spotting John and Satch, a  approaches them
They keep on walking
What's the story
Survey crew found a body
Actually a skeleton
Over here
The uniform leads John and Satch around some overgrown weeds to  a patch of freshly unearthed dirt
out of which sticks a   and
In the
, a   unit can be seen arriving by van
Be real careful when pulling it out
And get the dirt around it
As Satch turns to talk to a second  and a couple of , John notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far away
As he starts to him, to Satch: think 'll visit the neighbor

As the scene unfolds, we can the half torn down diner/crime scene through a window
Satch oversees the operation
, 70, hands John a cup of coffee
Thanks
John looks out the window
Used to get breakfast there all the time back from the boat
Them Greeks were good people
Once that McDonalds opened up on Dyckman, they lost all their business
John glances around the room - notes family
There's a picture of Shepard in younger days on a commercial fishing boat
Next to it a faded black and white picture of Mrs
Shepard, 35
few pictures of the Shepards and their And at the end, a color photograph of the same son, about 20, in  , graduating from the Police Academy -   '64
Your son on the job

Carl died in the line of duty
October '69
'm sorry
Shepard points to a frame above the fireplace: Distinguished Service Medal,  , awarded posthumously
My boy lived and bled blue
Silence
Mr
and Mrs
Shepard stand very still
John discreetly glances at his watch
- in the distance
personnel have made some progress in unearthing the skeletal remains
couple of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones
John stands looking down at the skeleton

And then he turns to Satch and they start for the car
Behind them, the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground

) Sounds good

Julia hands John a Coke
Close on her face - she feels her son's pain
'm sure everything'll work out

Fine
You know Dr

So how'd you like
Oh,  loved it

You work too hard, John
Look who's talking
They share a laugh
And then slowly the laughter dies
John's expression changes as he quietly lights a cigarette
Julia knows what he's thinking
29-years tomorrow
long beat
wish  could remember him better
Truth is, most of the stuff  know is from the stories you used to tell
But they're not mine
They're not my memories
They're yours
Julia glances at an old photo of Frank, then back to John
You would have liked him, John
And he would have liked you
The microwave timer sounds off
-  -   - 1969 Frank's dog, Elvis
Poking his nose in a carton of Chinese take-out on the floor
An arm drops into frame - scruffs the puppy's back

) Wasn't too tough, buddy
Game happened almost thirty years ago
What are you talking about

Frank puts his finger on the squawk bar, about to say something, but just at that moment his son Johnny appears in the doorway in his pajamas
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball

The camera stays on John
He puts down his drink

) Sorry 'bout that
What'd you just say

) Oh, that was my kid
John looks up at the photo on the wall: , ( 1969)
beat, then: You call your son Little Chief
(
) Uh huh
What'd you say your name was
Frank
Frank Sullivan
Is this some kind of joke
Gordo is that you
Are you fucking with me
(
) Look pal, 'm just askin' how you
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series

Gordo, if this is you, so help me

John's  - top of radio - in  , on a piece of masking tape, is written: "WB2YXB" What'd you say your station

The call letters hang in the air

My name is John Francis Sullivan,  live at 1060 41st, where 've lived my whole life
And saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father

) What
29-years ago
: Frank dropping his cigarette in the ashtray
It rolls out and lies smoldering on the desk
He doesn't even notice
29 years
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan
And every night when  went to bed he sang to me
(softly, almost singing) Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd
Beat
(
) What the hell
'm dreaming this
Shit, this is a dream
(
) 'm not dreaming
John reaches out to touch the radio
But he stops, his hand hovering just above it
So you're Frank Sullivan, huh
It's 1969 and you're sitting at your desk in the study, just chewin' the rag
He smells smoke, sees the cigarette burning a hole in the desk
Spooked, Smokey the Bear just started a fire
Christ
Frank beats out the flame with the newspaper
(
) What's going on
(lying) Nothing
just spilled something
: '
John pushes the Bushmills to the side, staring at the scar
It hits him - hard
Oh my god
(
) What
You just burned the desk
(
) What's happening
John rubs his fingers over the old burn scar
You burnt the desk
can see it
Eerie quiet, the only sound is the rain outside John's window
That's impossible
(
) What if it's not
reaching out, touching the radio
(') Dad
(
) Johnny
Shockwave
long moment of absorption
Frank and John
(') How could this be happening
don't know
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time
Sun spot
Yeah, that's how Hams work
Wait a sec
there was something on the news
Something about this space anomaly
think they said it was connected to some storm in '69
Frank glances at    -
He says nothing for a long beat, struggling to understand
You sound
ground up
'm thirty-five years old
Thirty-five
That would make it
1998
Frank pulls back from the radio
1998
This is wrong
Who are you
Why are you doing this
'm not doing anything
(beat) Look,  don't know what's going on
But swear on my life, "m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now
in 1998
John's voice has a conviction that Frank cannot deny
It's really you, isn't it
Yeah
think so
Silence
Both men trying to wrap their minds around the reality of the situation
Slowly accepting
Thirty-five

You married
Got kids

No, not yet
Too busy playin' ball, huh
Nah,  gave it up
Johnny gave up baseball

John takes a sip, the answer caught in his throat

so much
Quiet beat

No wait, don't go
It's okay

But you're not

More static
The signal breaks up, then returns weaker
What are you talking about
lost you
What
never knew you, Dad
Why
Fire
On the job
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening
(beat) Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn
Said it wasn't your fault
You went with the training, with your instincts

That can't be

It did, Pop
It did
When
October 12, 1969
Heavy static now
They can barely hear each other
But that's tomorrow

Both men frantic
Their words overlapping

John scoots over to it, straightening it
But he slips, sliding down the roof, coming to rest against the chimney
light pops on from an upstairs window across the street
Gordo appears in the window
Does a double take when he sees John, sitting on the roof, soaked, drunk
(sliding open window) Sull
What the hell
talked to him Gordo
talked to my Dad
Gordo's heart starts to break
His best friend has slipped over the edge

Go in where

We are in the bottom of the 9th with the Baltimore Orioles' Brooks Robinson coming to the plate
Oh, man
Robinson is gonna nail it and we're gonna be dead
, moving the groaning firemen reluctantly to action, and freezing Frank in surging anxiety
Gibson is up and passing Frank

And for the first time in his life, Frank Sullivan is
Frank stares up at the sky, transfixed

And in the distance, as if from inside the burning building, a   is first heard, and growing louder
Hear that

Suddenly, out of the building runs a screaming and babbling incoherently
Help
Help
Oh, god
Help
She's up there
She's trapped

Immediately galvanized, Frank moves to the girl
Hey, hey
It's gonna be okay

Butch behind them
Flames haven't reached this area yet, but the  of the fire above them is deafening, and smoke billows down before them
They sprint towards it and start up
, and suddenly they are face to face with a    blocking access to the 4th floor
Frank and Gibson stop and stare into the inferno
It looks open on the other side
Don't know what's behind it
One way to find out
And he barrels through the line of fire onto the 4th floor
Gibson starts to do the same when the 5th floor gives way above Frank, sending burning timber and debris cascading around him and cutting off Gibson's route
Now Frank's only way to go is up the stairs toward the 5th floor
He turns to Gibson
Coming up behind him is Butch
Across a gulf of flames Frank yells and waves at them to get the hell out
And then suddenly, part of the 3rd floor around Gibson and Butch starts to go

Frank turns and bolts for the 5th floor as a huge flaming down onto the stairway behind him, forcing Gibson and Butch to scramble like hell back down the stairs

Another rough night, huh
That it
Yeah
That's it
John moves for the door
But Satch grabs him, slams him against the wall
Startled, John freezes
Do not disrespect me
Disrespect yourself all you want

John shrugs, sagging against the wall

The answer is no
He looks terrible, as haunted as any man could possibly be
He doesn't mean to, but he snaps -- What are you doing here
Samantha jumps, frightened
Ellen said you were working

Murdered
Why
There was this case
serial
He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69
The papers called them the Nightingale Murders
They never caught him
But the killings just stopped
What kinda twisted animal
Dad, we did something
Something to make it worse
Whatta you mean
He didn't just kill three women anymore
He killed ten
What are you talking about
Something we did changed the case
changed history
(beat) Mom wasn't dead
But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened
And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing
it was like a spree
seven more women
gotta take her away, John
'm gonna take your mother away
He can't hurt her if  take her away

(beat) What about the other women
'll warn them
That'll never work
They'll just think you're crazy
What can we do
You don't even know who this guy is
No
Nobody got
(realizing) Wait a minute
might not know who he is, but  know where he's gonna be got the case file
We know what he's gonna do before he does it
So what should  do
Call the police
You think they'll believe me
They will if they catch him in the act
You can make that happen, Dad
You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment
don't know, John
'm a fire fighter
This is
this is different
do know
'm a cop
This is what do
John takes a long sip from the Bushmills
(') You ever talk to a victim's family
The one's left behind
They don't act like what you'd think
There's panic and fear
But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem
And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay
(a breath) But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it
Just a glimmer
But somewhere they know
They know their world is never gonna be the same
What if the radio stops working
Christ, what if  can't reach you again
Then you get Mom the hell out
But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die
We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives

Why not just get the cops to watch the bar
They'll question her
Whatever they tell her could change what happens

Frank readies to follow her when he suddenly trips over a crate of vegetables and goes down on one knee
Karen looks in the direction of the accident, and for a split second, her eyes lock with Frank's
Embarrassed, Frank looks away as he rights himself
Frank edges out of the grocery store as Karen steps into the street and dodges traffic towards a corner / at the end of the block, past a heavily overgrown
Frank follows Karen across the street and finds himself, just as Karen enters the bar, at a point near the murder site described by John
He pauses to stare at it

Frank checks out everyone in the bar, not knowing quite what he's looking for
Karen slips into the booth with her friends

Frank orders a beer, but his eyes are fixed on the booth
Karen and a friend take note of Frank staring at them

This case just got hot
We pull on this string
But for some strange reason John has stopped listening to Satch
Something else has got his full attention
It is the Nightingale file that lays open on his desk
It is changing
Karen Reynolds' forensic photo disappears
In fact everything about her, all evidence of her murder - police reports, photos, witness reports - is

The bartender leans into the  at the bar and announces
Last call
Frank flashes his wedding ring at the sexy woman
Smiles at her and shrugs "'m sorry
" 23RD  -   -  - 1998 The clock reads 1:30AM
John sits at the end of the table, opposite Daryl
His quiet masks the dark menace he is barely in control of
Daryl stares at him like a deer caught in the headlights
Satch sets a Coke before Daryl and starts to leave the room

(to Daryl) You need to use the head
You can, y'know
If you want to
Daryl shakes his head "no

The place winds down
An old movie on the 's
Elvis'   plays softly
Frank watches as Sissy picks up her last tip and heads to the back to change into her street clothes
See you, Fireman
Don't talk so much next time
Frank smiles, checks the time
2:00AM
He looks around
Nobody suspicious about
He starts up for the bathroom
-  - 1998 Satch enters with a fresh cup of coffee, settles back to watch
- With great ceremony John removes his watch, his gun, and lastly, his badge, and sets them off to one side
You know, Daryl, sometimes, despite all the training we cops go through
Despite all that we are taught about right and wrong
Despite all that we would like to honor in ourselves, we can come to a place where we don't give a fuck
Know what  mean
And John starts up from his seat and walks toward Daryl
(') You are going to tell me what  need to know, Daryl
, in the door strides
John
John freezes
Looks towards Satch
(') Got a minute
Yeah
Sure
Satch opens the door and steps out
John collects his watch, badge and gun and follows
- He ain't our guy, John
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer
Not everyone fits the profile
Long beat
If he was gonna give something up he would'a done it already
John pauses for several seconds, then nods slowly
- '  -  - 1969 filters in
Frank zips up, heads to the sink
Bends over to wash his hands, and suddenly
His face is smashed on the edge of the sink
He twists to the floor, fighting to maintain consciousness
black Frye boot explodes into Frank's gut
He rolls over, looks up at the    from the bar
Frank seems to recognize him
We know him too -
But we don't know his name yet
So we'll call him
You following me
Killer's eyes, evil fuckin' black dots
He lifts Frank to his knees
Then rips a fist into Frank's face
(') asked you a question, asshole
Frank is clearly incapacitated
Killer lifts him to his feet so they are eye-to-eye
(barely able to speak) Mary Finelli
look of absolute shock wipes across the Killer's face
Who the fuck are you
Caught off guard, Frank is able to slam his knee into Killer's balls
Killer goes down like a stone, but Frank is too battered to take advantage
He collapses on top of Killer, who pushes him off, scrambles up, and delivers a massive kick to his head
Frank is out cold
Quickly, Killer rolls Frank over and rifles his pockets finding his
He grabs something from it, then tosses it aside
He then takes something out of his pocket, a thin leather garrote
He coils it around his hands and snaps it taut
He bends down to start the job when suddenly, the bathroom door opens and
very stoned  stumble in
#1 Whoa, dude
Is he okay
Yeah
He just needs a little time kissing the porcelain
And Killer muscles Frank into a toilet stall and puts his head in the bowl
He closes the door, quickly leaving
In the stall, Frank spills onto the floor, his legs sticking out into the bathroom
His face flush to the tile, his eyes trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall

He reaches out and grabs his wallet off the floor
His money still there
Credit cards, too
But something's missing

Scared
Desperate

peers out from behind a security chain
Frank stops banging
(') It's okay, Ma'am

Old Lady skeptically looking him up & down - noticing Frank's bruised face
She quickly closes the door
Frank reaches inside his jacket pocket, pulls out a small bent metal wire, homemade
He goes to work on Sissy's lock
, ,  - got it
He opens the door, steps inside
'  - It's dark
And then a sound
scratching and popping, the sound of a   makes when it reaches the end of the vinyl and is scratching against the label
The wind catching a curtain allows the shaft of a street light to beam brightly into the room, and in one swift moment, Frank is staring at a : Sissy Clark's murdered body
Her dress hiked above her waist
Her panties ripped off
Paper stuffed into her mouth
Her hands bound with glass tape
Frank is transfixed and sickened by Sissy's twisted face, her eyes frozen open in horrible death
'   - Frank staggers out of the building towards his Harley
He bends over and blows his dinner, then mounts the bike and kicks the motor over
As he roars off down the street, in the building window
looking down at him
The  reads: 16th - -  -  - 1969 & 1998 He killed her John
He killed her and didn't do a thing to stop it
It's not your fault, Dad
Yes it is
we did this
We changed everything
(pausing) 've been having bad dreams, Johnny
Dreams where  die
in the fire
(soft) was supposed to die in that warehouse
No
Frank
Trembling, overcome by an awful combination of fear, guilt and shame
This is wrong
it's like we cheated
know
(beat) But Dad, you can't go back
You didn't die in that fire
And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that
So all we can do is deal with this
and try to make it right
don't think  can
'm not a cop can't
can't stop this guy
But we can, we can do it together
Spirit and guts, remember
Johnny,  know, but
Frank starts to light up a Lucky
But he stops, stubbing the cigarette out
need you to believe in me
To believe that we can do this
John, he's got my driver's license
What
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live
He took your wallet
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license
He touched your wallet
Where's your wallet
In my pocket
We got him
Dad you got him
What
His prints
You've got his prints
'll run them through criminal index
You gotta get me that wallet
How the hell am  gonna do that
(thinks) Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners
What
Please, Dad, just do it
Okay, okay
Frank does as John asks
Taking out his wallet
(') got it
Right, now  need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep
Huh
Then you gotta hide it somewhere
Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it
for 29 years
(looking around the room) Put it under the loose floorboard by the window
(getting it now) gotcha,  gotcha Chief
It's gonna work, Dad
We're gonna stop him
Hang on
Frank fishes around the desk drawer for some electrical tape
quickly ripping off strips of tape
covering the wallet
Then he goes to the window
Crouches on the floor, digging his nails around edges of the loose floorboard
getting up
(
) (') (over the ) Okay
John scrambles to window
Crouches down on floor, reaching to find: '
John goes back to the radio
We're in business
Just sit tight
and don't worry

Sprints for the door

strange look of recognition
(') The old neighbor's son
the cop
But he's dead
What are you talkin' about
know this prick
He worked outta Brooklyn North
(realizing) He never died
- John exits his car to find Fred Shepard watering his plants
Just came by to wrap up over there
Thought 'd say "hello
" Glad you did
Come on in
Buy you a cup of coffee
- They enter the living room
No Mrs
Shepard
John's eyes fix on the police academy graduation  of
His gaze then shifts to photos of Mrs
Shepard
(beat) Wife around
(a startled half-laugh) No
No
Well, sort of
In my heart
Been dead 29 years
Oh
Sorry
How so
Well, she, Eve was murdered, Detective
An ugly one to tell you the truth
John's breath catches
His look shifts back to the photo of Carl Shepard
Mr
Shepard reaches to open an album
There are several photographs of the young Mrs
Shepard
couple where she is dressed in a '
John is stunned
One can only imagine what is now racing through his mind
(') The mother of a cop, and they never found the bastard who did it
Blown away, John looks out the window to where Mary Finelli's skeleton was found
Happens that way sometimes
(beat) Son still on the job
Nah
Doin'
work now
Got caught up in them Knapp Hearings
Set up by some dirty cops who needed a fall guy
Hurt him bad
Would've broken his mother's heart
John can only stay inside himself and wonder at the madness of the world
- John walks past the lunchtime crowd, makes his way to the Grabs a stool two
seats away from
Carl Shepard
John orders a soda, glances over at Shepard
Their eyes meet
John holds his gaze
slight nod
You used to be on the job
Yeah, long time ago
know you

What house you work
John gets up, slides next to Shepard
The 2-3

Nah, just working the job

Missing teenager
Disappeared thirty years ago
Found her bones last week
Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street
Mary Finelli
John waits again for Shepard's reaction
Huh
(sipping drink) Talk about dumb luck
Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later
And then the chances of hitting a dental
forget about it
Bets part is she's the first victim
She knew the doer
'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking
Shepard says nothing, but his eyes are burning into John
(') The past is a funny thing
We've all got skeletons in the closet
You just never know when they're gonna pop up and bite you in the ass, Carl
John slips something on the bar, next to Shepard
It is a crime scene photo of Shepard's murdered mother
He reels back, totally losing his veil of composure
He is freaked
Who are you
'm the train wreck you didn't see coming
And 'm gonna steal your life away
You went down 30 years ago
You just don't know it yet
And with that, John gets up, leaving Shepard stunned

Game 5
First inning
Julia is busy bringing in groceries from her car
You're telling me this maniac is a cop
What the hell am  supposed to do with that one
Call the
Use a pay phone
Don't give 'em your name, Dad
Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others
That he's the Nightingale
In the
of Frank's house a
Julia can be seen going to answer it
It is Satch
There are ad lib greetings that we don't clearly hear
(') Tell them where Finelli's body is buried
They'll be able to connect him to her
Same high school
Same class
'm betting they search his place they find some souvenirs
Satch steps into the study
1969
Okay, 'm on it
(sees Satch) Hey
Hello, Frank
Frank's hand lifts off the squawk bar
He notes Satch's tone and demeanor
What are you doing here, Satch
You off today
(
) (over the ) Dad, you there
Frank, we need to talk
(into radio) John, hold on a second
(to Satch) 'm in the middle of something important here
You mind if
Frank suddenly spots something through the front window
Satch's partner,  , and   out at the curb
Half a penny drops
All his senses go on alert
And instinct kicks
he hits the squawk bar
(') Satch, you gotta just give me
Satch is here John
You hear me
Satch is here
'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside
Frank releases the squawk bar
Johnny and Gordo remain fixed on the game, oblivious to anything else
In the kitchen, we can see Julia moving around putting away the groceries
(
) (over the ) Dad, what the hell is going on
(into mic) Just a minute, John
okay
Don't go away
Julia now becomes aware of the tension in the voices in the other room
She looks outside and sees Phil and the uniforms
She looks at Frank and Satch with confusion
Frank hits the squawk bar again
He wants John to hear this
(') What is going on here, Satch
What are those guys doing out there
think you know, Frank
No,  don't
Let's go outside and talk
We need to do that
About what
Let's go
Do us both a favor
long beat
Frank sees Julia staring at them
She is now a bundle of growing anxiety
Frank stands up
Okay
(to Julia) It's okay, Bud
'll be right back
(into radio) Stay there, John
And then he and Satch walk out the front door
-   - and towards a spot halfway between the house and the cops
From inside the house, Johnny and Gordo have begun to take in the activity
Where were you last night, Frank
The rest of the penny drops
Frank stalls, trying to think What do you mean
Do you know where  found this
And he hands  his missing '
Frank looks like a truck hit him
(') 415 Greenwich St
#302
Under the body of a murdered woman
No
This isn't what you think
wanna be wrong here
But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it
Okay, okay
need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio
You can talk to Julia
Forget the radio
Frank nods
Takes stock of the cops by the cars and heads back into the house
- Julia, who has been watching through a front room window with Johnny, moves to meet Frank
Behind Frank, Satch signals Phil and the uniforms that all is okay, giving Frank a couple of steps on him
Frank steps into the house and wraps his arms around Julia, turning so he can see both Satch outside and where he wants to go inside
Trust me, Bud
Do that for me
-  - Frank moves Julia toward teh desk, lulling Satch a moment, then quickly steps to the  radio and hits the squawk bar
John, you there
(
) (over the ) Yeah, Dad
What the hell is going on
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder
John
Julia stares dumbfounded at Frank
(
) Frank
Satch strides by Julia and reaches to take Frank's elbow
Frank wheels at the sound of his name and the touch, and he lurches back from Satch
you gotta help me, Chief
-- and the movement yanks the mic cord to the radio tight, dragging it to the edge of the desk
Johnny tears into the room and clutches onto his mother
"Daddy, Daddy
" That's not the deal, Frank
Don't do this to your family
And Frank throws his hands up in front of his chest in an " give up" gesture
(
) Dad
Dad
What's going on
Satch
And the  radio  to the floor in 1969
: 1998
The
a large dent appearing in its casing before John's eyes
dials cracking
Dread creeps into John's face as we   : ' We see what John sees in 1998
But we also go inside his mind and glimpse flashes of new childhood memories
Memories of seeing his father arrested for murder
Images that match '  from moments ago in 1969
17TH  -   -  - 1969 Frank sits at a metal table bolted to the floor, Satch sits across
Phil stands
Two cups of coffee on the table
The room is very bare
Cinder block walls
Padded locks and bars over the windows
small metal cabinet against the far wall
Satch and Phil smoke
Frank does not
Carl Shepard
Detective out of the 15th precinct
Satch stares at Frank with utter incredulity
Phil lights a smoke, tossing the pack and the matchbook on the table
(') swear, Satch
Uh, huh
(beat) Uh, huh
And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when came in
As nuts as that sounds, yes
Uh, huh
Satch, would you listen to me here
Just you and me
Can  talk to you here, alone
Satch looks over at Phil
Give me a little time with this guy
Phil nods his understanding, steps out of the room
(') Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl
He's not gonna stop, Satch
He's gonna keep on
Are you listening to me
You're in a world of shit
An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment
We got your prints all over the place
Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank
(beat) You gotta give me something here
Something  can believe
It's quiet for a moment
And then a sound filters in under the door
The sound of cops cheering
It's the World Series
Frank sits up - takes a beat
What if  could prove it to you, Satch
How's that
What if  told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0
And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot
It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball
Frank, please
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park
Frank, this is insane
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run
Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th
The Mets are gonna win 5-3
(beat) Go watch the game, Satch
Go watch the game
Go watch the fucking game
Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer
It matches the Nightingale's profile
You understand what that means
We hear the bolt slide, the knob turns and the door opens
His wife is here
She wants to talk to you
Satch nods okay to Phil
He closes the door
Whatta you want me to tell her
Frank struggles for an answer
but comes up speechless
Satch looks like his heart is breaking
Unable to comprehend how Frank could have slipped this far
long beat, then
She's in harm's way
He's gonna be coming for her
Satch snorts, incredulous
Frank reaches over the table and takes his hand, deadly serious
(') Promise me, as a friend
October 22, don't let her out of your sight
Satch nods okay
They have an understanding
17TH  - '  - Satch walks down the stairs
Julia alone on the bench
She sees Satch approaching, stands up, looking at him for an answer, for an explanation
for hope
(after a beat) Let's walk, get a cup of coffee
Julia nods okay
They exit the precinct house and into
17TH  - the street
Around the corner we catch sight of someone familiar - someone Julia and Satch don't recognize: Shepard
17TH  - '  - Shepard approaches the desk, flashes his shield at Sergeant
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders
Yeah
'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North
You mind  take a shot at him
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar
They around
Just missed Deleon
Hayes is up in the squad
Where's the collar, in the cells
No,  think he's up in interrogation
'll go find Hayes
Shepard turns, gliding through the lobby like a shark
- Satch and Julia sit at a booth in the back
Satch stirs his coffee, trying to start a very hard conversation
As he struggles to begin, the camera notices something in the
At the counter: a few stray people gathered around watching the   on an old
17TH  -  - Shepard passes the
It is packed with detectives, gathered around a
watching the game
Phil Hayes is among them
And as Shepard passes, Phil half catches a glimpse of him as he glides down the hall and enters
17TH  -   - Frank looks up to see Shepard, who quickly closes the door behind him
and unholsters his gun
An eerie moment
On your feet
Frank waits a beat
Then very slowly, he stands
(') Now turn around, face the wall
Frank steps back, slowly turning
Shepard holsters the gun
Kicks Frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the Peppermint Lounge Bathroom
He coils it around his hands
(') How did you know
Frank is trembling
(facing the wall) You twisted animal
Evidence says you're the animal
(snapping garrote tight) That's why you hung yourself
But Frank turns
You try putting that thing around my neck and 'll rip your throat out
You want me dead, use the gun
Shepard smiles, unfazed
Let me draw you a picture
You live at 1060 41st Ave
You have a wife who works at New York Hospital
And a six-year old at
130
Shepard gives Frank a look that would make a Marine Drill Sergeant shit his pants
Shepard knows Frank's weakness, the one thing that would make him submit to death
Closing his eyes, Frank turns to face the wall
But the door handle rattles, someone is outside coming in
Shepard quickly yanks Frank away from the wall, shoving him in a chair at the interrogation table
The door opens
What the hell is going on here
You got to help me
He's trying to kill me
Shepard just laughs
Phil scans the room - everything looks normal, a cop questioning a perp
Mind if we take it outside
Phil shrugs okay
(') (to Frank) 'll be right back
Shepard and Phil step out - bolting the door behind them
17TH  -  - Shepard and Phil stand outside the door
didn't mean t step on your toes
They sent me up from downstairs,  thought you'd be in there with him
What are you looking at him for
17TH  -   - Frank's expression begins to harden
His eyes search teh room
his
He looks like John - controlled rage piercing through that Sullivan thousand yard stare
He stands, turning around, looking for something, anything that he can use to get the hell out of there
His mind's racing, fire fighter training kicking in
And then he looks up - just below the ceiling, above the door - a 2'X2'
Follow Frank's eyes to something else
An Frank goes to the window
Runs his fingers along the air conditioner's thick electrical cord - thinking
He unplugs it
And then he  cord out of the unit, exposing wire
17TH  -  - loud cheer rises out of the coffee room - the game is heating up
Shepard and Phil are still standing outside the interrogation room
Shepard flashes a smile, having said something that makes Phil laugh
Yeah, half the uniforms are either at the game or on the street
It's gonna be a riot if they pull it off
(glancing down the hall - in direction of sound of ) What's the score
- Julia's crying
Satch has no words to comfort her, now way of explaining any of this
He reaches out across the table
taking her hand
And as they sit quietly
tracks towards the counter
And we hear something that Satch does not
The sound of a voice
(
) Cleon Jones thinks he's hit
think the ball hit him in the foot
17TH  -   - Frank uses the heel of his shoe to rip the plug off the other end of the electrical cord
Both ends now have exposed wires
17TH  -   - Close on a
Pull back to reveal Shepard lighting Phil's cigarette, then one for himself
They are inside the squad's coffee room now
All eyes on the : Hadges is coming outta the dug out
He's calling for the ball
Can we get a shot of the ball
Shepard inhales deeply, sneaking a glance down hall at the closed interrogation room door
- Satch looks past Julia, distracted, curious
Can you excuse me for a second
Julia seems bewildered as Satch gets up out of the booth, making his way through the restaurant and towards the
17TH  -   - Frank, in full throttle, drags a chair against the wall
Climbs on the chair, uses a dime to unscrew the He then unscrews the master fuse and '
After re-tightening the fuse, and careful not to touch the other end of the cord, he jumps off the chair
Frank freezes
Someone's walking down the hall
17TH  -   - Wall to wall cops
Mesmerized by the game, especially Phil
There's a scuff mark on the ball
The umpire has reversed his decision
He's sending Jones to first base
The cops erupt
Cheering
(yelling over the noise) You mind  go back at teh fire boy for a while
won't lay a hand on him, just want to see what he's got
Go ahead, knock yourself out
Shepard gives Phil one last smile, then slips out - casually heading down the hall
towards the interrogation room
17TH  -   - Frank, sweating bullets now, takes the two coffee cups off the table and pours their contents
The coffee forms a   which Frank is careful not to let slip over the door saddle
He puts the cups down
Then opens the cabinet, rifling through, finding a can of  spray
Sounds of cops cheering filter in under the door
-  - Satch is riveted to the  as Clendenon steps up to the plate
Strike on
Satch jumps - Julia has come up behind him, touching him on the shoulder
She looks mad: how the hell can he be watching the ball game at a time like this
What's going on, Satch
Beat
(dumbfounded) don't know
17TH  -   - All eyes on the
Another strike to Clendenon
0-2 count
17TH  -   - The door knob turns
The door half-opens
Shepard sticks his head in, scanning the room
He relaxes a bit when he sees Frank sitting quietly at the table
Shepard opens the door a little further, takes a half step into the room
and into the puddle of coffee
Frank raises his arm
He's holding the live electrical cord
Shepard: What the fuck
Frank flicks the cord
which lands like a snake at Shepard's feet
in the puddle of coffee
5,000 volts surge through Shepard's body
17TH  -   - Clendenon still up
1-2 count
The wind up
But something is wrong with the
spark shoots out of the back of the set
And then the entire 17th Precinct goes
Frank has shorted out the electrical system
The cops look at each other in a moment of pissed confusion
17TH  -   - Frank lunges over the table, smashing a wooden chair over Shepard's head
He's in overdrive
Kicking the still live cord out of the coffee puddle, he then drags Shepard's body into the room, shutting the door
Frank quickly rips off Shepard's  , pocketing Shepard's  and
And then, moving very fast, Frank grabs the  can and the matches Phil left on the table
He    and holds it
He points the can at the ceiling - at the
Hits  button - Professional Fire Fighter ingenuity -
17TH  -  - sound off
kicks in, water gushing from the ceiling
Cops begin to move, investigating
17TH  -   - Frank cracks open the door and slips out
As the door closes, Shepard's eyes pop open
17TH  -  - Sprinklers rain down on Frank as he moves down the hall
Through the darkness he can see someone coming
It's Phil
Frank covers his face
searching for a place to disappear
- Nobody breathes
All eyes on the
The count is now 2-2
The pitch is a high fastball
Clendenon takes a massive swing
He nails it
The coffee shop breaks into cheers
Everyone screaming their heads off
Everyone except Satch, who just stands there, in complete and utter shock
Julia looking at him questioningly
(yelling over the madness) He was right
Everything he said
He was telling the truth
Then you believe him
Yeah  do
You bet your life  do
And they hug
The weight of the world sliding off Julia's shoulders
But someone is trying to get Satch's attention
It is the counter man, he's holding a phone
Satch takes the phone, beat, his face goes ashen
(') 'm on my way
He drops the phone, heading for the door
(') (to Julia) Wait here, 'll send a uniform
And Satch is gone
17TH  -  - Power is still off
Sprinklers still gushing
Amidst the chaos, a bathroom door swings open
man steps out
cop
Leather jacket, gold shield
It's Frank
He slips through the madness, heading down the hall and towards the stairs
17TH  - Satch races down the crowded block
dodging celebrating Mets' fans
bolting up the precinct steps into the house
17TH  -   - Phil runs in
Scanning the room
But it is empty
No Frank
No Shepard
Just a puddle of coffee on the floor
17TH  - '  - Satch charges into the lobby
The lights start to flicker back on
Chaos giving way to order
Satch heads for the stairs
And there is Frank, wearing Shepard's jacket and shield
But in his hurry, Satch has not spotted him
Frank quickly steps behind a pillar as Satch tears by him and up the stairs
Stay with Frank as he turns
calmly walking by the Sergeant's desk, gliding out the precinct door and
17TH  - disappearing into the street
(little smile) Elvis has left the building

He reaches a door
Two locks and a bell
Fuck 'em
John smashes his bulk into the door

two
three times
It bursts off its hinges
John charges in
Place is empty
Like somebody got the hell out in a hurry
few odds and ends left behind in the haste
including a pile of unpaid bills
John's eyes glaze over in rage and fury
But then he sees something that makes him stop and think
There is a telephone on the floor, in a corner
John stares at the phone, wheels spinning
He reaches in his coat and takes out his notebook
Flipping through pages
Notes on Shepard: social security, address,  registration, and a series of phone numbers
home, office, cellular
John runs to the phone
Punches in the cell number
Ring
(over phone) Hell- You have the right to remain silent
If you give up that right
Shepard is in his car, over a bridge, on the run
Who the fuck is this
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
Sullivan
You have the right to speak to an att -- Fuck you, asshole
It's a small world, Carl
And 'm gonna find you
Real soon
'  -  74TH
-  - 1969 ,  -- dead bolt turning
Front door opens and
His '69 apartment is far nicer than the place we just left John in '98
Shepard runs to the bathroom
Rips off the toilet's tank lid, reaches down and pulls out a
357 Magnum Colt Python, wrapped in clear plastic
He rips off the plastic, shoves the pistol in his waistband, heads into the kitchen
He gropes behind the refrigerator, close on an envelope glass taped to back of the fridge
Shepard's hand finds the envelope
he rips it loose
And then he opens it - revealing its contents, souvenirs, , ' ,
Shepard takes out a match to burn the photos
But then
The broom closet door bursts off its hinges
Frank instantly on top of Shepard
The souvenirs go flying in the air
Frank pummels Shepard's head and back
But Shepard smashes his elbow in Frank's Adam's apple, lands a solid uppercut square on Frank's nose
Frank's eyes watering up, Frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop the kitchen counter
Shepard reaches for his gun, points the
357 at Frank's head
Shepard's finger squeezing the trigger
It's over
But
down on Shepard's skull
Shepard drops
, the gun fires,
scrambles for the window
He's outta there, expertly thundering down fire escape
'   - Frank hits the pavement, twisting his ankle
Hears metal rattling, looks up
Shepard's clattering down after him
Shepard tries to get off a shot through the fire escape grid
The shot ricochets wildly
Frank takes off, limping and staying close to the building out of the line of fire
The streets are still empty, the city glued to their 's
Frank hits
He glances left, right, straight ahead
Central Park
Frank runs into the park
'  -
74TH
- The door is kicked open
Satch and Phil enter, guns drawn
They take in the damage from the fight
Following the trail of blood back to the kitchen
And there, strewn across the floor are Shepard's photos of his victims, the newspaper clippings, the jewelry, and the envelope with the glass tape still on it
Satch knows
-   - Frank hears pounding footsteps - Shepard is catching up
Frank's adrenaline kicking in, sprints around a bend in the path, reaches long wooden bridge spanning Central Park Lake
The bridge is being restored
Barricades across the entrance
Frank hurdles over the barricades, runs onto the bridge
Shepard trips in the dirt
Gets back up, reaches the bridge, knocks over a barricade, runs to the middle of the bridge
'
Shepard stops, listens - nothing
-  - Frank dangles below the bridge, holding onto the steel girder of substructure - 8 ft
above water
Not moving a muscle, not making a sound, barely even breathing
Crawling on Frank's arm
Caught off guard, Frank flinches, sending the rat tumbling
-    - Bridge side railings have been removed for construction
Shepard hears something hit the water
Rushes to the side of the bridge, points his gun at the water
Shepard leans out further aiming the gun at the water
Shepard's outstretched arm only a few feet from Frank's head
Frank silently swings his body forward reaching out
Snags Shepard's arm, pulling him hard, over the side
, grabs for something, anything
Wraps his arms around Frank's leg, hangs on tight
Frank struggles, kicks wildly, trying to shake Shepard off
Shepard hangs on with his left arm
Pulls out the gun with his right
He aims it at Frank's head
Cocks back the hammer
They plunge into: -  - Murky water, thick with dirt and slime, 5' deep
Frank's hanging on to Shepard's arm, trying to wrestle the gun free
But Shepard's using his free hand to gouge Frank's eyes
Frank bites down hard on Shepard's wrist
The gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom
But Shepard gets both hands on Frank's throat
Shoving his head into the shallow water
Shepard's grip is like a vise, Frank futilely tries to pry Shepard's fingers open
Frank is blinded by polluted water
Starting to lose consciousness
Desperately, he searches the muddy lake bottom for the gun
But he's getting weaker, fading out
Then he feels something
, fallen off the bridge, half buried in the mud
Frank struggles to dig it up
Summons his last ounces of strength, yanking it back and forth, it's getting loose
But Shepard's hands are squeezing tighter
Frank finally goes limp
few last bubbles float to the surface
Shepard smiles
Catching his breath, slightly loosens grip on Frank's lifeless neck
Frank springs off the lake bottom, rises out of the water like a jack-in-the-box
Holding the brick with both hands, he swings
The brick smashes against Shepard's head
Knocking him to yesterday
He drops like a rock
Frank waits for Shepard to come up for air
Nothing
Frank crawls out of the water, collapsing onto the embankment
He just lies there, heart pounding, chest heaving
And suddenly, Frank is startled by a   - the sound of eight million New Yorkers screaming in unison
The Mets have just won the World Series
Frank laughs, slowly getting to his feet
& 65TH -   - Frank's dripping blood and filthy lake water
The streets have instantly erupted with celebrating Mets' fans
giant party
Cars whiz by, honking their horns, passengers leaning out, pumping fists in victory
Frank has to yell above the racket
(over phone) 17th Precinct
Detective Deleon
(over phone) Hold on
17TH  - The Nightingale evidence from Shepard's kitchen floor is spread all over the squad room
Deleon
Satch, you gotta listen to me
Frank
We know
We know it's Shepard
No kidding
'm on the corner of 65th and
Come get me
Frank clicks down the receiver, slides in a dime, dials another number

(over phone) Hello
Frank smiles, and we dissolve to -  - The area cordoned off
Detectives and uniforms
wagon
An inflatable boat is being placed in the lake
Two police frog men are climbing into their gear
Pan over the scene to find Frank and Satch
Frank's got a blanket wrapped around him
They talk quietly as Satch walks Frank to a waiting green and white squad car
You missed a hell of a game, Frank
Next time lets put some money on it
(to the uniform driver) Get him home safe
Satch sticks out his hand
Frank takes it
They hold each other's grip for some moments
Frank starts to say "thank you", but Satch silently cuts him off
Frank climbs in the car
Satch closes the door, taps on the roof, Frank is on his way home
- '  - is asleep in bed
Elvis sleeps at the foot of it
In the shadows next to them, Julia sits very still in a rocking chair, half-asleep, half-awake
Staring out the window
Her eyes are bloodshot
She has been through hell

Elvis stirs
He looks up to : standing in the doorway
He looks a wreck
Hey, bud
Frank
And she is out of the chair
They meet in a hug
Over her shoulder Frank takes a long look at his sleeping son

Julia comes in and sets down a cup of coffee
She kisses him on the top of his head, casts a wondering eye on the radio, and leaves

He stares out the window, exhausted
And then something catches his attention
Coming from inside the house
The
He bolts from the car, runs to the door, scrambles to get the backdoor key into the lock, as -- (
) (over the ) John, John
You there
Johnny

-  -  - 1969 & 1998 John hits the squawk bar on the  which
'm here, Dad
'm here
We did it, John
We stopped him

He sits down
Wait
Something's wrong

What's wrong
don't remember
Why don't  remember
, the back of his skull smashed by the butt of a
45 wielded by
hits the floor with a thud, Shepard looming over him, reaching for a set of handcuffs
-  -  - 1998 Dad
Dad
What's
The butt of a
45 smashes the back of 's skull
He tumbles to the floor
fighting to stay conscious
stands over him, the gun pointing at his head
My turn to steal your life
-  -  - 1969 Shepard stands over Frank
Frank tires to struggle up
Shepard forces him back down, tromping a boot into his chest
You're a clever fuck, fireboy
And he snaps a handcuff on one of Frank's wrists then wrenches him to a steel radiator in the family room where he circles the pipe to the floor with the handcuff chain and attaches the other cuff to Frank's other wrist
-  -  - 1998 John is woozy
He reaches down to his holster - it is empty
Shepard has got John's 9mm in his left hand
Holding the
45 to John's head, Shepard pops the clip out of the 9mm and tosses it aside
He then snaps a handcuff around John's wrist, begins dragging him to the radiator
John's   up into Shepard's groin
The
45 goes flying across the room
For a suspended moment, both men are riveted to the
45 spinning on the floor
-   -  - 1969 Frank, struggling to breathe, is slumped by the radiator staring up at Shepard's groin
The
45 goes flying across the room
For a suspended moment, both men are riveted to the

The     can be heard upstairs
Shepard looks up
Smiles
Time to meet the family
(struggling to breathe) This is between you and me
Not any more
-   -  - 1969 Julia luxuriates in a steaming shower
Singing, softly
-   -  - 1998 between John and Shepard
-   -  - 1969 Frank desperately tugs at the handcuffs
Steel bites down on his wrists
-   - Julia smiles as she sees a figure through the curtain
Hey, Bud
Want to join me
And the shower curtain flies open to reveal
Sure do
Julia lets out a bloodcurling scream and plasters herself against the shower wall
-   - Frank reacts to the scream and tears with everything he has in him to rip away from the radiator
No way
- '  - Johnny stirs awake at the sound of the scream
-   -  - 1998 John and Shepard are in a desperate    over the gun
They  viciously at each other
Butting heads
But John is still woozy from the head wound and Shepard is still very strong
The gun goes off
-   -  - 1969 Julia is paralyzed against the wall
Staring into the dead as-marble eyes of Shepard
He looks her up and down
Nice
-   - Frank's wrists are bleeding
He can't get out
But then he sees something
Something he can use
His
Frank struggles to unfasten the watch strap
He does it
He pinches the metal clasp with his thumb and forefinger and guides it to the keyhole in the left handcuff
He works it
Nothing
Then
He's out
-   -  - 1998 John Shepard fight furiously
But John has managed to get control of the
45's
He squeezes it
-   -  - 1969 Shepard's hands are moving towards Julia's breasts she lashes out,      ' ,
-   -  - 1998 , struggling with John , in the exact spot where Julia dug her nails in 29-years ago
-   -  - 1969 Shepard grabs Julia by the throat
Slams her against the wall, knocking her unconscious onto the shower floor
He touches the  on his face, stares at the blood

No more bullets
Shepard lets go of the gun, heave John over and grabs him by the neck
strangling him
-   -  - 1969 Shepard is on top of Julia in the shower
He uncoils the garrote, snaps it taut, and starts around her neck
And then a
Instantly recognizable
Beyond adequate description
But once you've heard it, you don't forget it
, , :     12- - Shepard's head spins about
,    '
Get your fucking hands off my wife
Don't
Don't do it, Frank
You're not a killer
He is right
Frank hesitates
Shepard , grabbing the shotgun barrel
Frank
'
blood spattering everywhere
Like a wounded animal, Shepard bolts, blowing past Frank
Frank gently wraps Julia in a towel
The fading sound of Shepard thundering down the stairs
Out the door
And then softer footsteps
Coming closer
Johnny appears in the doorway
Safe and sound
-   -  - 1998 ' John starts to choke back to life
And then something happens
Some kind of - ripples through the house -- bending light - bizarrely distorting everything in its path, including Shepard and John
The shock-wave is over
But the house is different
Changed
Shepard scans the changed room - disoriented, bewildered
John pounces
Pounding blows to Shepard's head
John is on top of Shepard, hands on his neck
As John squeezes the life out of him, Shepard struggles to reach down his leg with his good hand
There's something down there
An ankle holster
Shepard strains to get his hand on the gun
He does
In a flash, Shepard has the gun to John's temple
Shepard cocks back the hammer
You were the kid
remember now
Keeping the gun pressed against John's temple, Shepard gets to his feet
(') But this time, no Daddy
John closes his eyes
It's over, he knows he's gonna die
Then a sound
sound we've heard before
sound you never forget
Music to our ears
, , :     12- - Shepard looks up to see:
----:  :  Buckshot ripping into Shepard
Impact lifting him off his feet
He lands dead on the floor
' Opening his eyes
Looking up at the doorway
Blinking through shotgun smoke, trying to focus
Not believing what he sees
-  - John looks up at his father, speechless
'm still here, Chief
-  - We are soaring high above a baseball diamond
Clear light air, you can see for miles
Float down to the field
The first taste of Spring and Softball
Picnic baskets
Flowers
Kites flying
Children running
The bleachers filled with families and loved ones
Among them sits
She's smiling, she's glowing
she's pregnant

dalmation puppy scampers at their feet, barking in recognition as
Frank Sullivan steps into the batter's box
Pitcher: 22 year-old African-Amerasian, a muscular beanpole
Embroidered on the back of the his  jersey is his nickname:
Quick shot of first baseman
- once a nervous , now a seasoned vet
And one hell of proud father
(to pitcher) Take it easy on him son, he's older than Moses
Frank sneers at Gib, then glances up at 's  in the bleachers
She looks familiar, it's the girl Frank saved in the warehouse 29-years ago
twirls his arm
Frank takes a big swing
contact
the ball fouls back behind the plate
Towards the parking lot
Where among the old Chevys and Fords sits a brand new
The custom license plate reads:
Frank's foul ball comes down hard
As the Mercedes' windshield spiderwebs we hear an off-camera scream
It is Gordo, jumping up, running across the field
From the parking lot his eyes meet Frank's
An '  shrug, and Frank turns his attention back to the game
The next pitch is high and outside
Frank takes a looping swing
driving the ball to the gap in right center
Frank jogs to first
An easy single
From first, Frank glances over at the third base coach: Her hair pinned up under a Mets cap, Julia puts two fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as
The next batter steps out of the dugout
It is John Sullivan
John as he makes his way to the plate
Check out his eyes: they're different, he looks like his father
They've got that Frank Sullivan sparkle
John steps into the batter's box, cocks back to wood
Bring me home, son
Bring me home
uncorks the fastest softball pitch you've ever seen
John jumps on it
Rips a massive shot to deep center, way over the fence
The crew in the stands are on their feet, cheering
Frank rounds third, John catches up
double high-five from Julia and they jog home together
The game is over
Frank puts his arm around John
Heading for the bleachers
little boy totters up to them
Jumping into John's arms
His name is Frank Jr
Hey there, Chief
John gives his son a kiss, glances up at Samantha in the bleachers
They share a smile
And as they step off the field, his little boy reaches up, takes John's hat off his head and puts it on his own
Elvis has left the building
John's face
In his eyes, bliss
