Written by Joshua & Daniel Goldin, Sam & Ivan Raimi and Chuck Pfarrer February 1989 - shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit : man is talking into a cellular phone
He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe
His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks
His name is
In the distance a foghorn moans
We are pulling back
Yeah
'Cause he's an asshole
Tell him no
Tell him no too
Him, tell fuck you
Yeah
Uh huh
The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building
Black is leaning against the roof of his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty space
The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches falling into darkness
No, 'll be a few minutes here
Guy comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me outs my property
Does it matter
Just another tough guy
Yeah, okay
Another hard-looking man is approaching
2
1 They're drivin' up
Black nods
Get their pieces
We got a surprise for those fuckers
2   - We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln Continentals
The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out, eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront
3   - is a well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty
4   - wears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit
His nose has been broken several times from his years in the Mexican boxing league
He was almost a contender
5   - walks with a pronounced limp
6   - is a large black man with a quiet, studied cool
7   - is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky motions
He huddles in behind the others
He is stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair
His protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows
3
-  8 wears a permanent psychotic smile
9   -  9 is middle-aged and balding
His spare tire hangs over the edge of his suit pants
He subdues a belch
He raises a bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth
ring of white chalky fluid coats his lips
10   -   10 has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice between his wide spaced front teeth
11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11 Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies
Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're ready to kick some ass
Okay, against the car, ladies
You're c gonna stand for a search
12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12 hands on the roof of their car
The dock workers pat them down and haul off iron -- lots of it
#2 Bunch a cuties
#3 Put skirts on 'em, 'd marry one
From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter
The visitors bare up in silence
13    --  13 As the visitors are led in, into the beams of the car headlights, escorted by the dock workers
The Dock Workers take up positions around Durant and his men
4
14 14 stands waiting for them
He eyes Skip, the limper
Bum leg
No leg
() was engaged to a girl with a wooden leg once
Skip brightens
() Yeah
What happened
hadda break it off
15 15 The dock workers laugh
Black indulges his wens' laughter, then cuts okay, let's cut the crap here
Durant,  got just three things to say to you
One He holds up a chubby finger
ain't selling my property
He flashes a second finger
Two
Nobody muscles Eddie Black Especially a bunch of fucks
He flashes a third finger
Number three, if you guys is unha with that, which  can already is, then we can cutcha balls of f if that'll be more satisfactory

19 19 The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he continues to hop in place for balance
Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level
Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there is now
total silence
the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer
--he trims the and of the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth
As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black: Now let's consider my points, one by one
puts a full nelson on Black
Trumayne, grabs Black's right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards Durant
One
He slips one of Black's fingers into his cigar trimmer
1 try not to let my anger get the better of me
Black screams
As Durant goes for another finger: Two:  don't always succeed
Black screams
Reaching for another finger: Three: 've got seven more points

20 2 0   -  - Looking down on the lonely waterfront building, we hear Black's screams
: 21 - 21    -  - Making jerky little movements this way and that
' : We pull focus through the nose, then back to sharp focus again
The nose fills the screen, every pore a cavern, every blemish a mountain
Blinking
The nostrils flare slightly
Looking
Still
Suddenly it is hit by a flash of light as -- - -- we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its strobe recharging
-
-
We get rapid-fire left and right nose profiles
22 22 We are in a lab
, an earnest scientist in his early thirties, is straightening up from behind a futuristic looking, tripod-mounted camera
He front the camera and instantly hits a button nt of ut
thenfro eof o 22  22 The nose belongs to   a Japanese graduate' student wearing a lab smock and glasses with thick, coke bottle lenses
Now, if everything goes according to plan, in a couple of months your nose will be on the lips of every American
He is feeding the prints into the input slot of a computer
22P    : 22P The nose is broken down into thousands of points
As each point of the nose is removed from the screen, a number is assigned
23  23 We've finally got the Imager working how we want it
24 We pan to the Holographic Imaging Cylinder
The glass 24 cylinder, wired to the computer, glows to life
24P  three dimensional holographic image of Yakatito's nose 24P rotates within
25 Peyton glances from the Imager to the computer
He types 25 on the computer keyboard
Bio-press checks out okay
He glances to
26  - 26 As it hums to life
It is a box containing linear rows of densely packed pins
Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer command
smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed evenly atop the surface of the pins
The sprays halts; the wet substance glistens
The densely packed pins rise to programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose

27 27 No more bunching
Looks perfect
don't know about perfect, but it looks like your nose
Down to the millimole
No, the bio-press won't be a problem
It's the synthetic skin's instability
If the just hold up --  give me victim and a photograph of his old face -- he'll get more than a nose
We're talking complete reconstruction damaged skin tissue
make him better looking
Hey, what's the time
fumbles for the stopwatch that hangs around his neck
Ninety-eight minute and change
Let's check in our friends

Beneath it, the words: The molecules rotate in synchronization
loud beeping tone
Suddenly, the synthetic molecule begins to waver and spin randomly
30 30 Oh no
31    31 The unstable cells fragment
32    32 Peyton shoves himself away from the microscope
Fragmentation
Time
Yakitito checks his stopwatch
Ninety-nine minute
Again
11
32 32 He stares dumbly at the stopwatch, frozen
He repeats, : Ninety-nine minute
Cells always break up at a ninety-nine minute
He punches away at a keyboard and takes the readout
Electrolytes, temp and glucose concentration
all normal
But still this ninety nine minute
Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet
Pacing, thinking; Why
What is destabilizing it
Vivification process was cake
Tissue rejection
We licked that
We're close
We're smart guys
So why can't we make these cells stable
Hokay
Let's try a ten percent alkalinity
Get those suckers too drunk to fragment
posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets
We already try ten
He pokes at a section of lab sheets
And twenty
And twenty-two
We try all phase of alkalinity
He punches the wall 12
32 32 But still a ninety-nine minute
Three month ago, ninety nine minute
Ten month ago
ninety nine minute
Yakitito punches the wall again and again
Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs
word of advice, Yakitito
Don't get emotionally involved
Watch
Analyze
Remain object --- He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech
Maybe  am lousy scientist
listen to father, get in Anaheim
Get drunk on Sake nightly, forget  am failure
Quick, Yakitito
basketball appears in Peyton's hands
He tosses it to Catches the ball
The most striking characteristic of thermionic emission
Throws the ball away
No, always you ask me question to ma me calm down
no want to calm down
32 (3) catches the ball, dribbles and throws it back to Yakitito
The answer, Yakitito
snags the ball angrily from the air
() It is most strongly depending on temperature
He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the ball
Go on
Again he pump-fakes
Yakitito flinches
This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used
Peyton tosses him the ball
Yakitito catches it
Calm now
He blinks
Amazing
It work every time

- , a no-nonsense octogenarian, and his son,
, a powerfully built, debonair fifty, stride into the lobby
They are accompanied by a couple of aides
14
33 33 , a young attractive woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair and crosses the lobby to greet them
She is dressed in a conservative business suit and carries a briefcase
Mr
Strack, my name is Julie Hastings
'm here from Pappas and Swain to represent you in the Von Hoffenstein negotiation
How do you do
And please, call me Louis
This is my father who-- Strack Sr
interrupts his son's introduction
don't want some fancy-ass woman to do my negotiating
Where's Herb Gorson
Gorson's tied up in litigation this week
Don't worry--'ve done my homework
scowls, ungraciously accepting her
( ) 'll stop worrying when you get Von Balibreaker's price down to sixty million
He turns and starts striding down the hallway, the others following
If he goes that low, lock him up
15
34 34
- The Stracks and Julie are seated at a table next to a large picture window that looks out on the bridle path
Jodhpured equestrians gallop past in the distance
Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air and cold beady eyes
He is accompanied by his attorney Myron Katz
Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving coffee
We want to be reasonable here
We said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling
But frankly Mr
Von will not be robbed
Seventy-five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel
We're ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price
: Then  guess we're only missing one element here
What's that
An interested party
Strack Jr
tries to suppress a smile
Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful
He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie
He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods
Wine is poured around
Mr
Katz, 've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth - 16
34 34 Katz leans forward, listening
Location
Location
And
location
Frankly, you have none of the above
Your fair price is fair for midtown commercial, not for riverfront
It's worth more to your client, given his plans for the area
if my client can spin straw into gold, he'll still pay market price for straw
As a matter of fact-- --Business is business
Deals vill come and go, but ze velt vill pause for a beautiful voman
and a fine wine
Our offer stands at forty-eight
Smiles a worldly smile
Let us toast a zale at ze price of zixty millions
Strack Sr
smiles
He starts to raise his glass, preparing to toast
beneath the table to reveal Julie's high heel as it digs into Strack Sr's toe to silence him
To Von Hoffenstein: 17
34 34 (2) You're moving in the right direction, but our offer stands firm
i believe if anyone had offered you more than us, you'd sharing this wine with them
She sips the wine and then, frowning, turns to the wine steward
There's been a mistake
We ordered a bottle of '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme
Is that not correct
Oui madame
'67 Beaujolais Maison Reme
Is what  have serve
Julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him
No
You have served us a 1981 or 1982
California Beaujolais
' Pleasant, but hardly worth charging
Strack Sr
, frowning, examines the wine
It's news to him
Please, Madame
serve the Reme
: Mine tastes okay
Ms
Hastings, please
The wine is fine
You're way out of your league here
'm sure the wine steward-- plucks the 1982
18
34 34 (3) The wine steward whispers sharply in French to the waiter, then turns back to the table
Please forgive us
We bring the bel Reme
at once
Gratis
Julie addresses the baron
At any rate, our offer stands at forty-eight
As she rises: And if we can't toast, we prefer not to drink
These gentlemen and have other business to attend to, so if you'll excuse us
Strack Sr
rises, angrily
He turns to leave with her, murmuring under his breath: told you to make this deal
Von Hoffenstein calls after them his wine glass held : Permit me, madame
Too fine a vine not to use for a toast
: 35 35
- As Julie and the Stracks are leaving, Julie
accidentally brushes against the Steward and exchanges a few words
Strack Jr
had been watching
He approaches the steward
How much did she pay you
19
35 35 () Monsieur,  don't know what you are talking about
For that little trick with the labels
He takes the stewards fist in his and unfurls the steward's fingers
Revealing--
Strack Jr
turns to Julie's retreating figure and smiles

Above it is another beaker filled with a brown crystalline substance
Above that is an empty beaker
The fluid disappears from the bottom beaker and instantly reconstitutes in the top beaker as a steaming brown fluid
37 37  pre-measured amount flows down coiled tubing into a coffee mug; a hand enters to add a dollop of half-and- half
Peyton's hand
He raises the mug of coffee to his lips
He looks down into his microscope

light goes out, leaving the lab in darkness except for the glow from the computer screen
Is a bulb

37 As he rummages in a drawer: So, did you ask her
Tonight
Out of habit, Peyton glances back to the microscope
This is unbelievable
You been saying tonight for weeks and still you don't ask her
Maybe  ask to marry you
Your father would never approve of me
Yakitito stares at him in puzzlement
Then: 216, no,  ask he if gbg marry you Peyton looks through the microscope; 38 38 The cells still pulsate with life

Their utter stillness and silence grows unsettling

It shows a sunset over the ocean
Very corny, distorted music over this shot
Love
Science is perplexed over this great mystery
Shot of Peyton and Yakitito in white lab coats, identical looks of perplexity on their, faces
Julie laughs
What are the causes of love
How do we detect its presence
What are its effects
These are some of the questions we will investigate in this lesson
Again the sunset and distorted music
Part one
je origins 21 ve
The sunset is replaced by split-screen photos of Peyton and Julie, age twelve
Peyton peers into a test-tube through glasses too big for his face
Julie assumes a mock-debonair pose for the camera
These lovers first met on a seventh grade field trip to the planetarium
Shot of the night sky, rich with stars and galaxies
While the narrator discussed the origins of the universe, Peyton held Julie's hand
Shot of a somewhat nerdy Peyton with his arm stiffly around Julie

52 (3) You were so slick
Our test-subjects were soon--to use the jargon of teenagers--"going out
" This "going out" period can be as short as a single date, or as long as a lifetime
Montage of Peyton and Julie throughout the years
In the case of these two--a rare phenomenon--it lasted twenty years
Although we broke up sixteen times
Sunset and distorted music
Part two
Mating rumpled bed, The sunset is replaced by a shot of Julie on a working on legal briefs, a camera-faced shadow crossing the image
Certain objects develop a special, shared meaning to lovers
Here are some objects significant to our test subjects
Shot of coffee-rings on a table
The coffee rings Peyton tends to leave
They irritate Julie, and he leaves them everywhere
Quick shots
Coffee rings on a lab report
Coffee rings on a book-shelf
Coffee rings on a wall and ceiling
Julie laughs
30
52 (4) Yet such minor irritations can strangely become endearing to the other mate
Not just yet they haven't
The slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax
The bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne Julie gave Peyton for his twenty-first birthday
Now it serves as a candle holder
; never gave you that
The champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player
The music plays over the image
Haunting
Romantic
Finally, the single Love in the ark The song continues
Julie smiles, swept away by it
This song was playing when the two first kissed
high school prom picture comes up on the screen
Peyton in an awkwardly fitting tux and Julie, a blossoming beauty
In the slide, they have been caught kissing
Now let us leave our test-subjects
The sunset again

Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her
Peyton
Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo
Julie smiles at him
Then: Dale
Yes, Julie Hastings
yes, found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that  don't think was supposed to find
From the late Mr
Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious
They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission
Peyton, behind her, massages her back
They look like payoffs
Suspicious, at the very least
Well, the way 'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first
Give him the benefit of the doubt
Under the circumstances, it's the least  can do
She hangs up
Peyton kisses her
She leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully
Reluctantly, she rises and slips on her shoes
Peyton watches her admiring everything about her
She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door

It detailed -- Strack has gotten up to pace

To the zoning commission

Does that shock you

In fact 'd surmised as much
But it disappoints you
Well it's hardly my place to-- That's right, it's not your place
Yet  value your good opinion
Surely you don't expect me to endorse it
Course not
'm sure my father never intended for you to know about it

You're not naive; you know it's a cost of doing business
Ordinarily you don't have to face it
Well,  face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and 'm tougher than that
Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development
Take a look at that model, Julie
That was my father's dream
Now it's my dream
Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future

The resident leaves the pin in the knee for dramatic effect
and he can't even feel it
With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin
115 ' 115 His eyes still closed
No response
Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation
When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated
The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon
And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve
Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain-- giving him the strength of dozen men

How  regret having to burden you with my miserable difficulties

The Darkman's eyes shift
He was not expecting this
Hung Fat is waiting for an explosion
There is none
Sensing an advantage, he presses on

All a members of in poverty
Studies the Darkman hard
How can he tolerate this
And of all your unworthy servants, Hung Fat is the most destitute
As if in response to some silent signal, four enormous and muscular Chinese men enter and stand, arms crossed, in a threatening posture
Even Hung Fat's own minable slaves sometimes ignore his wishes, and attack those people whom Hung Fat cherishes most deeply
Wahbuht, they know nothing of our golden friendship
is looking from Hung Fat to Durant/Darkman; what's wrong
Why doesn't he do something
So until that shining day -- may it soon come
-- when  shall once again be able to honor you with bounty, bid you goodbye
Good bye, Wahbuht
He is shaking his hand, pressing his advantage, invading his physical space and making mockery of him
Wahbuht, goodbye
can't believe his eyes

Hung Fat drops his hand
It dangles lamely at his side
The Darkman walks over to a bamboo chair and slumps

He removes a cigar from his breast pocket
With his eyes closed: DARX24AN You will bring me the five million dollars by the time  finish this cigar

Above, filling the top half of the frame: The Darkman's evil eyes, through the rippling heat of the cigar
Their intensity pierces the shroud of smoke and burns holes into Hung Fat's soul

Without a trace of an accent: Okay, Bob, you win

Casually he lights a cigar and continues forward

He loosens his necktie and unbuttons his collar
He takes a breath

He points the penlight in the direction of the clanging sound
An empty wine bottle at his feet is illuminated

Silence
Gettin' jumpy

Only the uppw right quarter of Peyton's face remains intact
Perfect
, Handsome
But as for the rest
The 3i,a is a hairless skull, covered with random bits of scaranf char
Without the benefit of gums or lips, the entire 3ength of his teeth are exposed down to the root, connec g crookedly to the jaw bone
One ear remains intact, the other a burnt hole
Only the rudimentary cartile forms the nose
But it is the wild eyeballs protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets, that tell tba,story
There, lies madness; a dark river of evil rage
: 319 319 They hear Trumayne's throaty , then silence
They run toird the sound
When they arrive, they see only the penlight laying upon the track bed
It's dull glow shines upon the wet walls of the tunnels
Nearby they find the gun and one of Trumayne's shoes
' look like saucers
even looks a little scared
Oh shit, man
What did he do, man
eat him
From the tunnel ahead,  approach
The two men squint, attempting to pierce the blackness

Hey, amigo, dat chew
From the darkness, a figure emerges and runs at them

The dark figure, lurches and collapses upon the ties
shaft of light reveals it to be
gagged, with his hands tied behind his back, a wild look of terror in his dead eyes

They glance fearfully to one another through the fog of gunsmoke
looks about, gets control, loads a fresh clip into his gun with an echoing
waves his arms in surrender
Good Bye

One hundred feet away and closing
Thirty feet Ten
324 324 atop the track
Durant's feet slower moving, enter view just ahead
B325 B325   ' Lit by the flying blue sparks it emits an evil laugh
Tunnel walls zip past in the background
326 326 He runs, the train gigantic behind him
Durant's face is stretched in panic
The cigar is still in his mouth, between clenched teeth
He fixes on something ahead
327 327   - in the middle of the track, a shallow depression
328 328 ' running only a shoe's length ahead of the sparking wheel
329 329 as he desperately leaps for the depression in the tracks

Is he low enough
The underside of the train comes roaring over us

The long subway train rolls into the distance
It's rumble fades
Quiet
Durant's cigar smoulders on the tracks
331 331 rises quietly into frame
His suit is still clean
He appears remarkably unscathed
He runs a hand through his hair, turns and walks slowly along the tracks
That's when we see his back: the train has raked off the fabric of his suit and pants, exposing bare back and buttocks
Somehow maintaining his dignity, Durant picks up the smouldering cigar from the tracks
He takes a puff and moves off
: 129
332 332 Darkman sits with the phone faintly ringing against his ear
Something frantic about him, the vein in his fore- head, faintly beating
While he waits for the other party to answer, he cuts into the painless wound on his arm with a surgical instrument, digging for something Finally Julie's voice comes on: We cut from Darkman's ravaged monster-face to: 333 333 beautiful as ever
-- Peyton
Where have you been
Why haven't you called
334 334 Back to the monster face: () Can --can  see you
The bullet is dislodged from the wound and drops on the table

335 laughing, his face restored, walking down the midway, one arm draped over Julie's shoulder
She laughs with him
Peyton glances at his watch
Put away that watch or 'll think you don't like me anymore
Oh, Peyton, let's spend the whole day together -- the whole week

've got to tell you, Julie
've got to tell you something about -- about me -- how 've changed

In the fire --  -- voice offscreen rises above the general noise: () See the mutant man, half man, half beast
Witness this prodigy of science with your own eyes
Peyton whirls around

(; ) Never mind
What's going on, Peyton
What are you keeping from me

335  (2) Peyton Ares at Julie
He can't bring himself to tell her
( ) 'mon, 'm going to win you the biggest' fuzziest pinkiest animal doll on that rack
Something you'll-be truly embarrassed to own
and then 've got to run
They have stopped in front of a booth where softballs get tossed at bottle pyramids
Peyton lays down a dollar and is handed three balls
Why do you always have to run
Peyton looks at the pyramid, avoiding her look
He throws the first ball; misses
- have my treatment
'm not a hundred percent cured yet--but  soon will be
He throws the second ball; misses
Can  take you back to the burn center
Peyton's vein begins to throb faintly
No
No, please
don't want you to see me there
don't want you to think of me as
an invalid or
some kind of f--ff-fff--
On that word he throws the last ball with great force
The pyramid explodes
Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to collect himself, then says quietly to the booth attendant: 132
335 (3) The pink elephant, please
The bored attendant, a cigarette dangling from his lower lip, shakes his head
Sorry buddy
It don't count if you ain't standing behind that line

The pink elephant, if you please
Na way
Julie tugs at his sleeve
Peyton, it doesn't matter
Peyton is fighting to contain his rage
in clipped words, between gasps for breath: It matters
won a pink elephant
For my girlfriend
Peyton
It's okay
Get lost, buddy

338 338 People screaming on the Tilt--Whirl
Merry-Go-Round horses bobbing up and down
Calliope music gets louder and louder
339 339 Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein bulging, throbbing
Under his-breath: 340 340 The elephant
Quickly
The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's chest
We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits
From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice: You heard me, weirdo
Get lost

Julie screams as well
349 349 Peyton reaches for the attendant, lifts him into the air, hurls him into another pyramid, which collapses
350 350 is yanked violently from the shelf
351 351 shoves it at Julie
In a voice hoarse with rage: Take it
135
352 352 Another skin blister opens
Peyton
No
'Take it
353 353 His face is starting to send off wisps of smoke
Please
354 354 She is looking at him, frozen in horror
355 355 His face is erupting into boils, which simmer and pop, giving off bursts of smoke
356 356 Peyton stares at her
Rage ebbs
His eyes become haunted
Hoarsely: Forgive me
He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped, forgotten, beneath one arm
357 357 Julie runs after him
Peyton

She is confronted by rack upon rack of clothing, shoes, body padding, and wigs
The place looks like the wardrobe room of a major studio
Peyton
364 No answer
She cautiously advances
Her eyes fall 364 upon something that makes her gasp

Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty, then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the floor

We've consolidated the waterfront, Governor
Yes, 'm aware there's been some unpleasantness but that's over now
Yes, 'm sure
You sound a little nervous, Bryant
Have a brandy, watch a cop show
The door opens
security officer appears
Robert Durant, sir
() Send him in
( ) Goodbye, Governor
Everything's taken care of
He hangs up
We hear the door open and close
Strack's smile vanishes

He looks awful--face scorched and bruised, severe limp
You look like hell, Robert

- up the steel skeleton of a skyscraper, P44 P446 stars all around us
'm glad you survived, Robert
'd hate to see your kids deprived of a role-model
They do look up to me
The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge
The lights of the city tremble over the water
glitter and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur
Kids need an example, Robert
When was a young man my father made me work high steel
That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me
(Revised Scenes 2-17-89) 162
P446 Strack gestures broadly with one arm
It was just me and the Indians, no one else crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an hour
Sure  resented it, but now-- call me crazy--sometimes  miss it, it sharpens your wits
Life on the edge
Five inches wide
Two hundred fifty feet down
High steel
He turns to face Durant
There's a gun in his hand
You don't have any kids, Robert
What are you talking about
Or should  say, Doctor Westlake
'm Durant
Robert
Durant
Then 'm going to make a mistake
There's a long beat
The vein begins to pulse on Durant's temple
His eyes grow predatory, evil

Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder
He smiles back over his shoulder
You want to see the girl
Follow me, 'll take you to her

(2) must say, Dr
Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief
Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries
That's okay
'm a good sport
He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind
And  can handle my own problems
do whatever  have to do
In fact, that's how  got my first properties
My wife--late wife--held certain deeds
sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet

Then share my dream
After all, you and  are pretty much the same

447 447 Julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder, at the furthest extremity of the growing building
Wind whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically to an upright
/ Julie
Strack laughs
Bring on the strings
Young lovers
In peril
Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they
--What a banal tale
In it,  suppose  play the villain
But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here
With this he reaches over to Durant and--
-- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge
448 448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind flapping it this way and that
On the way down it slaps against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels away again
It spins downward towards a forest of reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes in the open foundation below
Finally it lands--splat-- pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars
165
449 449 gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time, overcome by horror and repulsion
Darkman's vein pulses like csa y
Strack"s tone is almost admiring: You truly are one ugly son of a bitch
Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off the bean
The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing with rage
Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss-- As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an -beam
barely hanging on, vein pulsing
Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair
-- nothing
Darkman has been swallowed up by the night
Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie
recoils as Strack stops in front of her
He touches her hair
( ) First my wife, then my father, and now -- He places his hands on her shoulders, preparing to push her off the girder
With intensity: 166
449 -It is the tragedy of my life that always have to kill the ones  love
As he's about to push her: IDuis
Strack turns around

stands behind him, glaring angrily
Father
( ) should've snuffed you out at birth
With that Strack Sr
rips off his own face, exposing the enraged visage of Darkman
Strack reaches for his gun
451 451
Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his hand into the darkness below
battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of feet sure death on either side of them
Savage punches send Strack reeling--
--he falls onto the girder
nearby are a bunch of tools
Strack crawls toward them
167
451 CONTI1rn  451 only a few inches from his grasp
swoops onto Strack, pummelling him
' inching painfully toward the rivet gun
pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge
He steps back to give a final blow
and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance
lunges
Darkman slams into a vertical bar
452 452 The rivet gun shoots a bolt through Darkman's wrist, then the other wrist--pinning him to the -beam
Strack takes a step backward, exhausted
453 453 Now you get to watch your girl-friend die
He moves toward a terrified Julie
and reality melts around him as he tastes the hot soup of rage
454
Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders
we spin into Darkman's eyeball to find-- 455     455 Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked
456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456 dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge lighter
As contact is made the lighter explodes in a shower of gold Krugerands
457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457 head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body
Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig
He wears a funny little hat
458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458 the face of the Darkman
459  drop of liquid Peyton falls upon
cube of ice
It 459 bursts into flames
460 The camera races back from Darkman's eye
his vein 460 pulsing madly
461 '   461 insensitive to pain, he pulls, every sinew concentrated on the task
horrible grating sounds as the first rivet rips through steel
One hand is freed
The other is freed
462  462 with his back to him, doesn't have a chance to turn as: 169
462 pounces
He lifts him full into the air
Strack's legs and arms flail impotently
Darkman hurls him up, up into the air
463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs
then begins 463 to fall, yards away from the girder
464 He spins, end over end, to--
--be impaled 464 on the rebars many floors below, next to Durant's face
: 465
465 at the cut
Darkman and Julie are inside
Darkman remains turned from Julie, facing the shadows
Gently, Julie touches his shoulder to draw him toward her
Peyton,  can help
No one can help
don't care how you look, Peyton
love you
The burns don't matter
There's a long pause
Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of
his face toward her
Julie sees them in close-up
The elevator jars to a halt on street level
170
465 Take my hand
Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers
She overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his
It disgusts you
No
Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn
: This hand
it used to caress you
Now it can only tear, rip away at things
(; ) But you'll perfect the skin
You'll get rid of the scars
It's not just the scars
've changed- He grips his skull
--inside
He pulls the elevator open
() can live with it now, but  don't think anyone else can
(tears in her ) want it back
The two of us--the way it was
Darkman's voice breaks: 171
465 (2) What we had--our life together--it belonged in the light of day
He disappears into the darkness
Peyton
Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away: Peyton is gone
466 He heads into the shadows
At the edge of the darkness 466 he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a construction trailer
pedestrian reappears on the other side
Julie knows it's
Darkman
She chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic
The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she desperately searches for him, turning people around, staring at their faces
It begins to snow
Peyton
She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into alien faces in search of the man she loves
The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians, any one of who could be Darkman
We continue to pull back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards, wherever the crowd spills, into an alley
As a street- person shuffles into view: 467    467 snaps open a switch-blade
second set of arms grabs the street person and spins him around, revealing-- 172
467 Wild, half-mad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets
