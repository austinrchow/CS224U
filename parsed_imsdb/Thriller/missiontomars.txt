"  " Screenplay by Jim Thomas, John Thomas & Graham Yost Story by Lowell Cannon, Jim Thomas & John Thomas : Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of sunlight
Late afternoon on a perfect day

4, 2020
" As we hear, after a few more beats, an '
minus ten, nine, eight, start ignition sequence, five, four, three, two, one, ignition
Liftoff
tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, ludicrous
bottle rocket
We hear ' , excited
' , we see  , late 20's, kneeling, with a gaggle of eager  around him
Phil, an astronaut, has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube
(all at once) My turn
My turn
No,  was next
No, me
Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can do one
want to do one
Guys, guys, please
This is risky stuff here
And 'm a highly trained professional
Derisive  from the kids, more
Phil grins
There's little danger  will ever use him on a recruiting poster: he's messy, very hyper
Phil waves his hands for silence
Okay, okay
Uncle Phil will launch another booster
Another astronaut,  , a tall, very fit French woman, is walking by with a fresh six-pack
She tosses a beer and Phil catches it
just as soon as he completes his fuel intake
Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party
We are in the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb
- astronauts,  personnel, and their families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out blankets
Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of balloons
We hear snatches of , mostly country-flavored, from dueling boomboxes
Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed about
banner, strung between trees, reads " , " It'll take us six months just to get to Mars
Another year on the surface, then six months back
That's two years
Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, , who snags it neatly
He's got his other arm around the waist of a
As Cote moves   , on these two
Willis, a very young astronaut, early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all too well
guess what 'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on Earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me
'know
Nice try, Nick
As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically
He pops open his beer, swigs it
As she swerves around an open- pit barbecue, where other  are gathered
Cote has paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers , a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball
He turns, grinning beerily at the chef
Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't be heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two
That's a pretty good long rendezvous
, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a Hawaiian shirt and a "  " apron
An entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting this as he smiles at Malik
What are you suggesting, Sergei
Maybe you should bring a baseball bat
Yes
American baseball
Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar System Series
Please
Half you guys are foreigners
We'd crush you
No, no, we have equal crews
Three men, one woman
Same handicap
He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him
Easy now, you're talking about my wife
(seeing her approach) And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop
, early 30s, passes by with a platter of corn-on-the-cob
Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive by its alert, questing intelligence
She pauses to kiss Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them
Then she glances at Kirov, all business now
Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes
Thousand bucks make it interesting
He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who smiles, nods her cool agreement
Eh bien
Winner take all
Good
(smiles sweetly at Kirov) Bring some balls
The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as Terri moves on
Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt grin
You wanna know the sad part
Technically  outrank her
But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, 'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes, dears
" The others laugh
as she dodges a    -- they run by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a picnic table, where '  are opening containers of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad
1ST just not sure how  feel about allowing couples to go on this type of mission together
One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter
1ST (embarrassed) Nothing personal, Terri
It's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind
(carefully neutral) All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips
2ND Then they haven't studied some of the couples 've known
Laughter at this
Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really have much in common with these women -- before moving on
on the wives, who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy
One of them is looking around
3RD Anybody seen Jim McConnell
4TH don't think he's coming
1ST God, that poor man
How's he doing
2ND Totally losing it, from what  hear
Can't sleep, can't eat
Visits her grave almost every day
(lowers her voice) They say he could lose mission status
3RD Oh, that's so sad
That is just so tragic
You go to a routine physical one day, and wham
4TH After all those years of training, too
It was their whole dream
1ST Must be a pretty funny feeling for Luke Graham
'know
Now he's gonna be in the history books
First man on Mars
She shakes her head, awed by the thought
The others nod in agreement, following her glance
In the distance, a lone   stands by the garage, his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs which stretch down the driveway and along the street
Another figure, a , can be seen approaching him
the moving woman --  , early 30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband , mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the restless intellect of a scientist
He's unaware of her approach until she touches his shoulder
He looks at her with an apologetic smile
He's not coming, Luke
Jim deserves this, too
All his friends are here
And it's my last night
(gently) Your last night with us, too
He looks at her, moved
She summons a smile
He slides his arms around her waist, kisses her forehead
love you, Deb
love you too, baby
But maybe you should spend some time with Bobby
Yeah
will
Where is he
Up in his fort
He kisses her again, then goes
Debra's eyes follow him, with a mixture of pride and sadness
Luke away from the garage, into Luke moves through the crowd
Phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets
Red streaks arc high overhead
In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to #2
Deep space is so lonesome
So cold
But  guess 'll have my memories to keep me warm
Luke shakes his head
Willis is incorrigible
Finally he reaches a tall redwood playset
He looks up the ladder
sits on the platform of the tower, arms around his knees, staring up at the stars
telescope rests nearby on a tripod
He looks lonely
Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him
, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky
Who's gonna read to me now, at bedtime
Luke is surprised by the question
pause
Mommy will
like when you do it
Now we're never gonna finish our book
His voice is unexpectedly fierce
He's fighting back tears
Luke is moved
Another brief silence
Well, 'll tell you what
've been thinking about that
And what thought was -- how 'bout if  bring along my own copy
(Bobby looks at him) Then every night, wherever  am, 'll read a little bit more of it
And 'll know that you and Mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too
That way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together
'Cause don't know about you, but 'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island
What d'you say
Bobby manages a smile
He nods, feeling a little better
Luke is proud of his son's courage
Good deal
Can  have a hug
Bobby's arms go around his father's neck
He hugs Luke fiercely, and Luke hugs him back
His eyes, over the thin young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence
Then, from the distance, the sound of an
They both turn
An open Jeep is coming down the street
Its  is alone
Luke's expression changes
Recognition, then happiness
' The Jeep stops, its electric engine  down
The Driver climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon
The   are drifting this way, and he hesitates a moment, seeming to gather himself
He starts gamely towards the party, then pauses again
Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting
She smiles tentatively
, early 40s, manages a smile in return
He has dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in
Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural leader
Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her
They separate, looking at each other
Her eyes are shining
We were afraid you wouldn't come
caught a whiff of your barbecue
After that  was helpless
All the way out in Galveston
Something like that
(she smiles) It's his night, Deb
didn't want to spoil it
Spoil it
He's been going crazy looking for you
Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around Bobby
The two men look at each other, the bond between them so strong it needs no words
Finally Luke smiles
'mon
whole lot of folks here are gonna be mighty glad to see you
McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and together the four of them move   , heading towards the party
on the parking area, as we
: ( ) All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette
Willis, one of the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle
Perched behind him, arms around his waist, is   #3
They zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood
The yard is nearly deserted
The "Bon Voyage" banner has torn loose at one end and flutters limply
Here and there a napkin blows across the ground
In the distance,   sit on the ground, by the waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers
As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames
For a moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots mingling with the silver ones
(abruptly) wish we were all going
Together
The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even Woody himself
Luke glances at McConnell
An awkward beat
Then you've got a short memory
Think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training
Oh, you're not gonna bring that up again -- (laughing) 'm trying to remember, let's see, which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there
You just can't let that go -- Oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship
If they sent us off to Mars together, there wouldn't be enough fuel to lift all those egos
(laughs) Bullshit, we would've made a great crew
That was never gonna happen
was always teamed with Maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies
You know
Systems
Payloads
Listen to him
Mr
Cover-of-Time Magazine
Yeah, who landed the crippled Block Shuttle
Yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar rankings
Let it go, Luke
(smiles) Sure,  made a little noise
But putting the first footprints on Mars
Nah
That's for guys who
(looks at Luke) wrote their Ph
thesis on how to colonize the place
And guys who
(looks at Woody) read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships around their necks
He grabs playfully at Woody's neck
Woody smacks his hand away, laughing
You read the same damn science fiction books that  did
You're just not man enough to wear jewelry
He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh
You want Flash
You know you want him
Well you'll have to come through me
Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing
McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head
God, she would've loved to see you two clowns
Just one more time
He tries to smile, but his face reddens
Then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions
Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell shakes him off, rises abruptly
He turns his back on them, walking away a few steps
Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance
' McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette
McConnell has regained his composure
Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time you donated this thing to a museum
Woody revs the engine, which  lustily
He grins
Internal combustion, boys
Accept no substitutes
Luke laughs
Woody looks at McConnell
Jim, if there's ever
if there's anything Terri and  can do -- 'm okay
Really
Thanks
Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand
See you when  get to Mars, Luke
Don't solve all the mysteries of the universe, okay
Leave a little something for the next guys
'll see what  can do
Just make sure you bring some fresh beer
You got it
With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into gear
McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away
silence
Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious
We sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this
Should've been your mission, Jim
Yours and Maggie's
McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still
None of us ever wanted Mars the way you two did
Not even Woody
Twelve years of hoping for this assignment, training for it -- That's all over now
If Maggie hadn't gotten sick -- if you hadn't pulled yourself out of the rotation to take care of her -- McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger
He will not tolerate pity
Luke sees this but presses on
No, 'm gonna say this
have to say it
(pause) wanted Mars One
Hell,  battled you for it every step of the way
Never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life
But not like this
Jim, 'd give this all up in a second, if it would bring Maggie back to us
McConnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust his own voice
know that, Luke
You don't have to say it
Mars is yours now
Go get it
(pause) Take care of yourself
Yeah
You too
Luke nods
They grab hands for a second, then let go
Luke walks back towards his house
McConnell watches him for a moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep
He opens his door, then pauses
He turns
Looks up at -- tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily
Mars itself, a tantalizing prize
But for him now, more distant than ever
For him, perhaps, never to be attained
' As we see these thoughts going through him
After a moment he looks down at And the sandy verge of the front yard
' Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite yearning
Gently, a bit self-consciously, And sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint in the sandy soil
Sequence omitted from original script
Instantly we're hurled into an immense, stunning , mysterious and vivid as a fever dream
Dazzling sunlight vast plain of rust-orange soil
Countless craters
Boulders the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods
Twin moons hanging in a salmon-pink sky
On the horizon, towering, craggy peaks
And, at center -- the only sign of life -- a small, mysterious, moving puff of dust
Sequence omitted from original script
as a small, Sojourner-like, multi-wheeled robotic vehicle ambles  , jouncing along the orange Martian soil, pausing to snuffle its sensors towards the occasionally interesting rock
Lettering on its side reads "-8
" : "
" Suddenly Ares-8 pauses
Its video lens  out, fine-tuning focus, as it becomes intrigued by something  -- a higher, more distant target
The little fellow almost quivers with excitement
one-man   waits in the background, in a dry streambed, as Luke, in an  spacesuit, swings a clawed rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face
Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit
Despite that bulk, he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's)
hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely, holding it up to his clear faceplate
He's very happy, absorbed in this work, when his
Luke, you read me
Yeah, Renee
Luke,  just got -8 on line and
Well, we think you're gonna wanna see this for yourself
Luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued
Copy that
As Luke turns away, headed for the rover To  a  , seen for the first time: Valles Marineris, that planet-creasing slash
So wide, so deep, it boggles the mind: on earth it would reach from New York to
Sequence omitted from original script
The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined Luke, gathered around some display monitors
They're in jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced gravity, and heat
All are captivated by what they see We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt- covered
Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge
What's most striking, however, is a   barely protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along the mountain's ridgeline
Its whiteness is in clear contrast to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth, multi-planed symmetry
What the hell is that
No idea, boss
Where is it
Cote glances at the others
They're all smirking, as if they share some secret joke Luke's not yet in on
You don't wanna know
'mon, what's so funny
Gimme the coordinates
He leans over to read a digital gauge, but Cote covers it with her hand, enjoying the tease
Latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 9 degrees west
The Plains of Cydonia
So
(pause) Oh no
You're not telling me -- They all laugh as the other shoe drops
Luke's expression is incredulous, exasperated
Oui
Exactement
It's Kirov's fault, he picked today's sector
Hey, c'mon
We've got a scientific duty to check that thing out
Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote
They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without success to coax more resolution
Great
That's great
The first anomaly we hit, and it's gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make  look ridiculous
You know how many books have been written about that damned mountain
The Egyptians put it there
No, the Amazons
No, it was little green men
And all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets
If this gets out, we'll have every  kook on Earth spouting off on the six o'clock news
'mon, people, gimme a read here
Is that a cinder cone
Nah, too smooth
Too angular
Volcanic upwelling
No fissures
No caldera
It's an upwelling, for sure
But maybe not volcanic
The others look at him, puzzled
Luke leans in closer, with growing excitement
He points to the screen
Look at the color
And see how shiny it is
could swear that's ice
This far south
Impossible
You can't have ice at this latitude
Not unless
They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from one to another of them
They're almost trembling
Oh my God
How far away is it
Sixteen kilometers northeast
Take us twenty minutes to get there
(considers a moment) Let's send a packet to Micker
Then we'll go check it out
Slide back,  the crew in  suits, carrying gear
They walk over to
- The astronauts climb in through the hatch
The last one in pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches
We see Cote and Luke check their screens and press some buttons
Luke puts the rover in drive
, As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the Mars One Base Camp
The main   looks like a huge tuna can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, inflated-bubble
There's also an  , , and, on the other side, a couple hundred meters distant, the massive  (Earth Return Vehicle), which arrived as a separate, unmanned flight
Rows of  , arrayed on the ground, and an on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene
: () vast, impressive, -  is drifting majestically above Earth
The main hull displays both and
flag decals

" We   towards another of the station's segments, which is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight
We hear '  , over speakers
This is a truly anomalous formation
Looks like nothing we've seen so far
The structure appears to be crystalline, at least from the angle displayed by -8
On a large   , we see Luke and the Mars One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab, finishing lunch while taping this
(grins) We're all trying not to go too nuts up here, but -- we think there's a good chance this could be an extrusion from some subsurface, geothermal column of water
And if we're right
He looks at his crew
They beam like cats who ate canaries
then we've found the key to permanent human colonization
There's an   among the assembled , , and
This would be a fantastic, epochal discovery
Sits at the center console, wearing a headset
He's now the Mars One  (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is brisk, efficient, all-business
leans in for instructions
Tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this
Full-court press
The technician nods, hurries away
McConnell, sharing the intense excitement of those around him, stares up at Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the excitement their bombshell will create
Anyway, we'are going out to take a closer look at it, try to get an idea of its composition
(checks his watch) By the time you receive this, we should be just about on-site
The rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast We   to  Ares-8, still faithfully holding its point, like an Irish Setter, with its video snout The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby
The hatch door cracks open and some dust vents out
The door opens all the way and the astronauts climb out
They all look up in awe
We hear their voices
Jesus Christ
Gleams in the sun, dazzling white, its facets as planed and smooth as if an architect had drawn them
It pierces through the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left to right in front of them
Walk towards the mountain
There's a very deep, very low, staccato tone intruding over their headsets
Anyone else hear that
Yeah
What is it
Sounds like our antenna's out of phase
Can you fix it
Hey, skip,  can fix anything
Big talker
Renee, Sergei, let's break out the radar, see what this thing's made of
As they go to their jobs, the deep, barely audible rumbling tone continues
walk by, in the artificial gravity of the busy station, as  , mid-50s, approaches from the opposite direction
Beck is the tough, crewcut, -savvy head of the  Mars Program ('d by his name tag), and just now he's leading a covey of
on a tour
The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races, look as excited as schoolkids
and this is the Mars Mission Control Room, nicknamed "Micker
" understand a comm packet is incoming from Mars One Base Camp, so you may find this interesting
He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside
The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big screen
Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots
The turns to Beck, whispering curiously
That man over there
He's in charge
Who is surrounded by a   , to whom he is giving quiet, precise instructions
They hover, then depart, like so many eager bees
Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding
No, actually, that's Jim McConnell, the
Our voice link to the astronauts
Jim's been with the manned Mars program since its inception
One of our real pioneers
Will he be going to Mars, too
Ah, no
This is as close as he gets
Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing away their dishes and leftovers
anyway, that's about it
We'll send another packet when we get back
Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look
The others can barely conceal their grins
Oh, right
One more thing
Today is a very special day for a good friend of ours, and  know he's there right now
McConnell looks at the screen, worried
What's Luke up to
Now, he hates it when any fuss is made, so  won't mention his name
look of relief comes over McConnell
because the last thing in the world 'd ever want to do is embarrass someone like Jim McConnell
McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov appears from   holding a cupcake with a burning candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts "Happy Birthday" to him
Loudly
And very off-key
'mon, you Micker weasels, sing
Soon most everyone in  is singing along -- even some of the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of Beck, who stiffens unhappily
McConnell is mortified
(sings a line, then, to :) Hey, Ray
Take a look at him
Is he all red with one of those fake "'m- a-good-sport" grins
Beck looks over at McConnell, who indeed is red in the face with a fake "'m-a-good-sport" grin
And hey, you guys, check out Ray
Does he have on one of his "This- wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces
Indeed, Beck's smile is thin, sour, disapproving
Nothing you can do about it, Ray
We're a hundred million miles away
Luke and the crew finish singing the song
Luke raises the cupcake in a toast
Happy Birthday, Jimbo
Make a wish
He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle
They laugh and applaud, then wave goodbye
Catch you again soon
Take care, buddy
End of transmission
Luke reaches out, turns  the , and the display screen Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's
He's annoyed, as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's fault
McConnell returns his stare coolly
Cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover
Kirov has a big radar gun on a tripod, pointing at the mountain
Luke turns to Cote
Well
What's under there
(puzzled) Je ne sais pas
think there's something wrong with the equipment
What
mean, it can't be right
It says
it says there's metal under there
Luke doesn't understand
He walks up to look at the display screen
(points) There's ten, twelve meters of rubble and sand, and then
solid metal
That doesn't make any sense
You're reading a vein of ore
(shakes her head) No
It's under the whole mountain
The deep pulsing tone continues
Luke frowns
Nick, could the problem with the antenna be interfering
Could be
(to Cote and Kirov) Try it closer and up the power
'll watch the screen
McConnell is taping an audio message to be sent to Mars as the rest of  looks on
Beck is gone
So are the
ambassadors
Ah, we're all pretty stoked about that formation you spotted, Mars One
The folks in the geology and hydrology back rooms are going over your images and comparing them to every photomap they've got
Cote and Kirov are close to the foot of the mountain, resetting the radar gun on its tripod
The deep vibrating tone continues
Luke is some distance away, by the rover
He looks at Willis, who's still working on the rover's antenna
Nick, how we coming on that antenna
Goin' as fast as  can, boss
Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches on the radar gun
They turn towards Luke and Willis
Hey, Nick
Come show me how stupid am
can't get this to work
Willis looks at Luke
Luke nods -- Go help them
Willis starts towards the radar gun
McConnell is handed a slip of paper, glances at it
Medical wants me to remind you that you're three days late on your blood tests
know they're a bore, but you've got to get them done, or else
or else  don't know what
Just do them, okay
Willis, Cote, and Kirov get the radar gun up and running
All set here, chief
Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover
Okay
Crank up the juice and let's see what's in this sucker
McConnell checks over his clipboard list of updates
think that's about it for business
But on a personal note, be advised that, ah, none of you can sing worth a damn
in the
Luke watches the screen on the rover, as, by the mound
Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle slowly across the near slope of the mountain
We hear and feel the radar signal
The immediate result is that the pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops
Looks up from the display screen
puzzled expression
Why did that stop
split-second later, he gets his answer
We hear a , a mighty rushing of wind, as , Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the mountain, at its center
As it swirls, the cylinder picks up debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface of the slopes
Stare up at this spectacle, awed
cyclone
Some kind of energy wave
They have no idea
At the moment they're too fascinated to even be scared
- We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a skyscraper
As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing at its top into a conical vortex
It's sucking up so much dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent outer "skin"
Exchange amazed glances
Can't believe their eyes
McConnell still hovers by the microphone
Honestly, Luke, if you guys don't have anything better to do with your time,  can make some suggestions to mission medical
There are worse things than blood tests
and  from the staff in
Luke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand and pebbles flashing past his helmet
From behind
He turns
As the nearby landscape
The vacuuming effect is becoming more general across the area
More violent
And the spell is broken
He keys his throat mike, his lips moving, but no sound can be heard over the
He waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards the rover
Wind whips at their  suits as they obey him, retreating
Luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off the cylinder
Then he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn't moved
In fact he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder
Luke hurries over to him, tugs his sleeve
But still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face with a cobra
Luke follows the young astronaut's frightened gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees Beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways
Suddenly they're looking into the huge open "mouth" of it, as sand and rocks fly into the swirling darkness
The monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the mountain, turning this way, then that
Seeking them
And then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little group of astronauts
And lunges towards them
Luke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards the rover
But the suction is so great, it's as if they're held back by wires
The ground itself is , , as earthquakes begin to open fissures across the plain
The  of the vortex, the  of the earth, are like an onrushing freight train
In the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast
Suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes into Cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her instantly
Blood sprays into the wind, immediately crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets
, , As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm
An instant later he sees Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream as he vanishes
' Abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure
Scrabbling frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip
The air is almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him alive
Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final instant, as
, Is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning and tumbling like a rag doll
' His features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, and
- ' Willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the hellish maelstrom
And then that maelstrom itself, just as abruptly
Vanishes
There is an instant, ringing , as awesome in its own way as the roaring storm itself had been
On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, pitter down, bouncing
Swirls of dust and sand drift away, settling gently
The harsh orange landscape is once again calm, peaceful
And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns
As McConnell finishes his message to Luke
Oh, and  talked to Debra
She and Bobby are doing fine
Said to tell you, they're, ah, they're on their "third time through the book, page -- (glances at a note) -- page 125
" They send their love and say take care of yourself
Same from us here, buddy
Till next time, then
End of transmission
, the   ground zero, as the bass, pulsing rumble continues
the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater, with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously still with all four wheels
faithful little -8, lying on its side, partially crushed under a boulder
It gives a final, pitiful , its video snout slowly extending, then dies
And finally we come to the area where the fissure had been, and see Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand
No sign of Luke
The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking back down
Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face
The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic
The features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes, slopes, ramps
The "eyes" -- hatches of some kind
-- are closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask
We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick, scudding clouds  it, but the deep, pulsing rumble continues, low and insistent
: () We're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its docked position alongside the Space Station
Woody Blake, wearing a  jumpsuit, floats up into the cockpit in Zero-, studying a thick manual
(reads) "Problem: Hatch door malfunction, backup power fail, manual override fail
Solution: Replace circuit breaker 907B
" He straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical junction box at one end of the console
Okay
Piece of cake
He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle of fuses and wires
He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up beside him, also in a jumpsuit, and straps into the co-pilot's seat
God, who dreams up these nightmares
Don't try to change the subject
'm not
We're talking about your sister's wedding, right
Very funny
We're talking about dancing lessons
Before my sister's wedding
Honey, do you mind
've got a catastrophic power failure here
He peers into the housing with exaggerated concern
But Terri's not so easily sidetracked
Woody, we're a married couple
Would it kill you to invite me out on the floor once in awhile
danced with you at our wedding
'm not talking about shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt
mean real dancing
Cha-cha, rhumba, jitterbug -- Face it, honey, some couples dance, some go to Mars
That's life
'm serious
We've got two more months in this training rotation, but just as soon as we get home, we're starting lessons
If we never dance, people will think there's something wrong
If they see me dance, they'll know there's something wrong
Reaching past him, she pulls out the required breaker
As he reacts, surprised, she smiles, despite her exasperation
You are such a lug
Overhead, an intercom
We hear
' Cockpit, this is Control
Control, this is Cockpit
' Uh, Terri, they want us all back in the Station
Report to Micker
Who says report to Micker
' The little men who live in my head
Phil, c'mon
We just started this drill
Woody, it was Ray Beck
He told me to round up the team
Now
Woody and Terri exchange a worried look
What's wrong
Sequence omitted from original script
crisis atmosphere prevails
The big room is more crowded than we've ever seen it, with  and  hurrying by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering feverishly into microphones
On the center screen, a giant image of Mars
frantic flow of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red
Are staring up at this screen, appalled
McConnell and Beck stand nearby, briefing them
Then, at 1417, the -band continuous data stream from Mars went silent
All data -- med, environmental, everything -- suddenly stopped
While we were trying to figure out what the hell went wrong, we got a signal from the folks at the Large Array at Soccoro
At the same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from Mars
What do you mean, "intense"
(hesitates) Catastrophic
Looks are exchanged among the Mars Two crew
What about the crew
The level of energy in the pulse
didn't seem survivable
What about the
It went into Mars orbit last week
Maybe that could give us some clue
Good thinking, Woody
That's just what we tried next
He leans over, punches buttons on a keyboard
An orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around Mars, leaving a glowing electronic trail
This dot gets isolated in a viewing box, then enlarged and rotated into the computer- animated image of a small, ugly, industrial-looking unmanned cargo craft, labelled "
" The Resupply Module checked out fine
No instrument failures, no change in status
Orbit holding steady
But there was something else
The ' computer contained an uplink message -- a very faint, highly distorted transmission from Mars One Base Camp
Someone's alive
Yes
How
The message is almost indecipherable
Two teams are still working on it
You better see for yourselves
press buttons on a console
McConnell, Woody, Terri, and Phil are crowded around a monitor with Beck and two weary Still concentrating on the audio
We managed to bring out a couple more words, but we've got a long way to go
Show us whatever you've got
The technician nods, then gestures to his assistant who hits a play button
Black for a moment, then static
Out of this static comes a faint image of Luke, sitting alone at the Hab kitchen table
He looks awful -- dried blood on his face, bloodshot eyes
The image is blurry, heavily streaked, and most of what he says is lost in waves of static
make this quick
may be only ch-- (long section of static) to the site, when we
hit us just as we
--thers are all dead
Woody, Terri and Phil look at each other -- Oh, God
(following more static) low sound that we couldn't understand
Then all of a sudden there was this terrib
(another long burst of static) --stems are holding up for now, but  don't know how long  can
The monitor screen
That's it
Woody and his crew stare at the screen, stunned
This is a catastrophe almost too huge to grasp
As Beck leads McConnell and the other shaken astronauts down a corridor, Phil pauses, seeing
At her desk
- are trying to comfort her
One of these women looks up, and her reddened eyes meet
' He looks back at her, haunted
What did Luke mean by a "low sound
" In an otherwise empty lounge, the astronauts clutch Styrofoam coffee cups
Beck stands nearby
Through a large viewport behind them, stars glitter against the inky blackness
If this was a earthquake, as we're now assuming, there's usually an auditory component
But that energy pulse they picked up in New Mexico
Electromagnetic emission
Not uncommon with large-scale geophysical phenomena
(incredulous) Causing this kind of damage
don't buy it
We're missing something here
McConnell and Woody exchange a glance
Woody's right
Luke must be in pretty bad shape if he hasn't blasted out of there in the Earth Return Vehicle
That thing's designed so even one crew member could fly it back to Earth
Even if Luke was in great shape, he couldn't get home
That energy pulse would've fried the ' computers
Other than the computers, how do we think the  fared
Well, so far our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape
Which means it's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards, drives, and software to Mars
As fast as we can
McConnell looks at him, nods
They're on the same wavelength
But Beck is more cautious
Whoa, slow down
It's gonna take us weeks just to analyze this data
Right, but meanwhile, we've gotta be working up a mission plan
Luke needs us now
Luke may already be dead
And even if he's not, it's doubtful he's going to be able to transmit again
So we wouldn't know whether it's safe to land until you were almost there
What about
Terri looks at Phil --
The Saturn Imaging Probe
It's going to slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system
It could be retasked to take pictures, read radiation levels at Mars One Base Camp
Good idea Phil
If  tells us Luke hasn't survived and it's not safe to land, we swing around Mars and come right back home
Yes
We can design the mission to have a free return capability
It's a long trip, but if you don't land it's the best option
We're getting ahead of ourselves
You're forgetting the bigger problem
(they look at him) The orbits are all wrong
Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now
But we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel
We've modelled that, Ray
've modelled it
On paper, yeah
But those stresses have never been tested in space
The ship can take it
wasn't thinking of just the ship
tense beat
Again we sense the test of wills between these two tough-minded men, once good friends
know the protocols for a Mars Recovery Mission better than anybody, because  helped design them
And 'm saying these guys can do it
He's right, Ray
We've got a real shot
pause with beck weighing the odds
He looks at Woody
Give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow
Then 'll put it in the works
You'll have it by 0600
He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager
Let's get to work
McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck starts out, too, Woody stops him
Chief, could  have a word
Beck looks at him a moment, nods
Sequence omitted from original script
In a quiet corner, Woody and Beck are alone
've no longer got the right crew
(surprised) What do you mean
Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle
Bjornstrom is a geologist
He's good, but not for this
My people just lost eight months of training
This is a different mission, with a different objective
haven't been given authorization for a mission yet
But when you are, it ought to be given the best chance for success want McConnell to fly right seat
Beck's expression hardens
He's no longer on mission status
Yeah
Because you washed him out
He washed himself out
He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations, but he refused to take them
Ray, he's the best pilot  ever saw, and you've got him benched at a desk
Everybody has to pass the psych prelims
No exceptions
Jim knew that
Maggie was his wife
He didn't want to lie on a couch and share her with strangers
That was his call
But  had to make one too
It was tough as hell, but 'd do it again
His wife wasted away in front of his eyes
What was he supposed to do
Suck it up
Get with the program
What was his crime
That he was upset
That he cried
couldn't trust him
Beck and Woody stare at each other
long tense beat
(his voice softer) Not in a crisis
'm sorry Woody, but Jim lost his edge
Are you gonna stand there and tell me Jim McConnell is the same man he was two years ago
You want me to bet four more lives on that
This stops Woody, just for a beat
Then makes him press on harder, with even greater intensity
When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit out of him
It knocked the hell out of all of us
But you know and  know that he's still the best we've got
He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars
He's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together
Ray, we can do this
Give me McConnell as co-pilot, and we will bring Luke home
And that's a promise
Beck looks back at him, his features taunt
Woody, Terri, and Phil stand at the edge of the big control room, waiting and watching, in a tense silence, as , Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the 's console
Other personnel have moved away, giving them room
Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly
After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise
His eyes search the room till they find ' Woody looks back at him, nods: 'mon, man
Take it
' Is a study in conflicting emotions
But after a moment he masters his feelings, turns back toward Beck
few more quiet words are exchanged, then Beck offers his hand
McConnell hesitates, then shakes it
Both men rise, and McConnell turns again to look towards , , Who react with relief, glad that he's now a part of their crew
Woody grins, giving him a thumb's up
' As he smiles
Then he starts towards them, with a new energy in his step, a new sense of confidence and purpose
And as he   ,

McConnell and Terri laugh as Phil starts scarfing down the rest of the &Ms
Swooping at them with both hands
guess now we have our answer to the effects of long-term interplanetary travel on the human mind
The answer is Phil
(smiles) 'm gonna get an update on
It should be just about close enough to start capturing some surface images
He's drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts up to the cockpit, atop the Hab
As McConnell appears in the cockpit, he sees Woody by the forward instrumentation panel, looking at a monitor
The cockpit is also zero
Hey, Skip
Take a look
McConnell pulls himself forward
completely fills the screen
Surface details are clearly visible
Something is moving down there, an amorphous brown swirl
What do you make of that
Dust storm

Big fella, too
Headed for Chryse Planitia

They both hope he's wrong
When does  do her fly-by
Tomorrow morning, about 0600
That's when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing
They exchange a glance
Woody's right, but the thought is too terrible to dwell on
McConnell looks back at Mars
(softly) My money's on Luke
Just turning over to read "0545
" Pulls her gaze away from these numbers
Judging from her redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night
Restlessly, looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning
Nearby is her electron microscope
( ) Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed
The lower hab has artificial gravity () and McConnell can move normally
Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau
Rests there, in its leather travel frame
Beautiful, smiling, dark-haired:
Her face glows with intelligence and energy
Shifts his eyes
The clock on his bulkhead reads "0546

He glances at another digital clock, which reads "0547

He looks back into the mirror, then is surprised to hear  lilting incongruously over the loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's "Blue Moon

Phil floats in through the connecting tunnel, then stops himself at a handhold
He grins, charmed by the sight of Like a weightless Fred and Ginger
Woody is surprisingly good at this
Enthusiastic, unselfconscious
He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some passable twirls and dips
She laughs, shaking her head
What brought this on
Zero-
My last chance to be graceful
Once we're in Mars gravity, it's back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt
'll take what  can get
She grins, kisses his ear, as Phil turns, sees Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple twinge of sadness crosses his features
But when his eyes meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: Aren't they something
Over the music, they hear a  from the ' , then an announcement
Attention
Incoming packet
They all look at each other
This is it
Woody spins over to a console, shuts off the music
It's
The crew is gathered around a display screen
The lights are dim, reflecting up off their faces
By their expressions, we can tell the news is not good
It's a color, high-resolution satellite image of the Mars One Base Camp
Ghostly, dust-covered
No signs of life
Looks deserted
It's still standing, though
So is the
And look, there's the greenhouse
We know Luke survived for at least a few hours
Question is, are there any signs of recent activity
They all scan the screen
Phil spots something

He grabs a stylus and touches the screen
They all look
Using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point, the image enlarges

What the hell are those
McConnell gets it first
Graves
They all realize he's right
They sit back, stunned
But then Phil has another thought
Hold on
There's only three
That means -- Phil -- It means Luke must still be -- No
It just means there was nobody left to bury him
This quiets everyone for a long moment
Check the radiation levels
Phil keys in some commands and data pops up onscreen

Sit back, exasperated

don't see how an earthquake, six months ago, could give us this kind of distortion
That was no quake
He leans closer, staring intently
Then what the hell was it
McConnell shakes his head
But his every sense is engaged; he's like a predator just sighting his prey for the first time
We see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock this secret
Mars Recovery is speeding ever closer to Mars, which now looms large, a dusty red mysterious sphere
McConnell and crew are eating dinner while they watch a taped message from
As Ray Beck addresses them
Other  , twenty or more, have crowded in behind him, and we sense their great hopefulness and high spirits; the whole team's triumph is tantalizingly close now
We're going to continue analyzing this data and try to determine what the problem is with those images
Frankly, we're just as stumped as you guys, but we'll keep on it
(glancing around) We agree that the evidence of the graves is inconclusive and that a ground search is advisable
Be aware there are little sand storms kicking up near Mars One Base, but the big one you spotted is turning south
It shouldn't be a factor
Beck takes a breath, smiles
We're all pretty excited here and we're sure you must be feeling the same
Enjoy your meal and get a good night's sleep
We anticipate that tomorrow morning you will be Go for Mars Orbital Insertion

There's a low  of equipment
Terri and Phil are playing computer Monopoly under a single light
Terri is using touch-screen technology to move her piece
She glances at Phil
He has spread some &Ms out, letting them drift in mid-air as he performs his ritual weeding out of the red ones
She shakes her head
What if you opened up your meal packs and found that, instead of putting in everything but red ones, they'd made a mistake and put in only red ones
Hey, that's a funny notion
And what if in your meal packs, instead of brown rice, there were spring-loaded spikes that shot into your eyes
(pause) How did you ever pass the psych evaluation
When you're schizophrenic, they take the higher score
He touches the screen to roll the dice
McConnell, in his cubicle, looks away from the photo of Maggie
Haunted by memories
He rises, flips through the CDs in a storage case, pulls one out
He holds this carefully, hesitating, then feeds it into his computer
Immediately his screen saver vanishes and we see An impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a semi-darkened living room
The footage is , a bit jerky

Remembering
Luke and Woody have stepped forward,  , standing at the sides of the , where the last photo lingers
Luke waves his hands, hushing everybody

And guys, it's a pretty historic one
Both men raise champagne flutes
Let's hear it for the newly-announced Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One

Oh no, here we go
Don't get her started

Oh brother

She's a good sport
Maggie, why does this have to be about us
Mars is a great opportunity for pure science
We'll do the science
And we'll do it very well
That's what we've trained for
But what if there's more
In all our myths, in every human culture, Mars has always held a special attraction
What if that means something
Only we don't understand it yet
The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up in Maggie's spell
She has a radiant simplicity
The ; we are caught up, too
The universe is not chaos
It's connection
Life reaches out for life

He takes her hand

It's who we are

You okay
Yeah
'm good to go
Woody glances at him
It's true
Rather than being saddened, McConnell seems to have taken on new strength
renewed sense of wonder
After all these years
Can you believe it
Tomorrow we'll be standing on Mars
Woody nods, smiles
You know what
She may have been right
McConnell looks at him
If that wasn't a quake down there, then something else caused it
Or planned it
You're thinking the same thing
It's never been out of my mind
Jesus
You realize what this means
McConnell nods
Looks again at Maggie's face on the screen
She knew, Woody
She was the only one of us that ever thought there might be something down there
Yeah, and we're not leaving until we find out
Deal
McConnell nods
They clasp hands briefly
Deal
Then Woody turns
Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning back
One last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to say it until it comes out
Maggie was the best of us
McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful
Woody goes
McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on the screen
As seen through the cockpit windows
Huge, beautiful, now
We can make out swirling pink clouds, large surface features

Thick droplets of blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards the venting puncture in the hull over head
The astronauts' helmets dangle up there, awaiting use

As he unbuckles, dives from the cockpit back down into the , and floats quickly over to a storage hatch
He yanks this open pulling out a Then spins around in zero-, as his eyes track Which give a telltale hint of the puncture's location, somewhere up among the dangling helmets on the "ceiling
" Rising to this area, and shoves aside a helmet with a shattered faceplate -- its label reads "" -- to Jagged metal edges, dangling insulation
The blood droplets are whirling out through here, going into the vacuum of space
Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the puncture, firing a thick grey sealant
We hear  , , but after a few seconds they , then abruptly
The  continue to wail
Kill those alarms
McConnell punches buttons,   , and they all strain to listen, faces tense and sweating
long beat
But the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared
The astronauts turn, becoming aware of a strange phenomenon
' Have stopped in place, wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in the zero-
Then suddenly they start moving again, faster and faster, in a new direction
Down through the open core tunnel that leads to the lower Hab
Stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening
Still outgassing in the lower Hab
There must be another hole down there, even bigger
Losing pressure fast
We're gonna decompress
Computer, how long until zero atmosphere
(after a beat) Four minutes, nine seconds
If we get below 20% atmosphere, the power will shut down
Are you sure
Positive
vacuum inside the ship would cause a total electrical failure
The nav computers will fry
(to Woody) We'll lose all control
We won't be able to fire the engines to capture Mars orbit
Just then a computer screen flickers, freezes
Phil punches keys with his good hand
What he sees shocks him
It's already starting
The primary - 1 hub has been smashed
The systems are crashing
Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more calm than he really feels
Everybody switch to suit oxygen
We beat this in the simulator, we can do it here
Jim, you've got the ship
'm going
They stare at him, stunned by their immense task
'mon, people, let's go
Let's work the problem
Terri, now helmeted, is putting Woody's helmet on him, but something's in the way, chafing his neck
He reaches into his suit, pulls out
From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship dangling
As they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time for words
She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his gloved fingertips on her faceplate
Then he hurries towards the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock switches
Woody and McConnell exchange a look
At the  computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on line
His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful
Jesus, it's still bleeding
Keep the pressure on
Eighty percent atmosphere
/ The outer airlock door is now open, revealing stars, as Woody drifts through it into space
He's now wearing the , an oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle astronauts
'
With its shattered faceplate -- now useless -- drifts past Terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on Phil's glove
Floats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer
Jim, you've gotta get your spare helmet from storage
No time
Phil, can you keep the nav computers on-line
can't get this damn machine to re- initialize
And the automated systems just went down
We can't shut down the hab rotation from here
'll do it from below
We're losing pressure
You could embolize
Seventy percent atmosphere
McConnell looks at her, knows she's right
But he starts off anyway
Phil reaches out his good hand
Jim, 've got an idea
If you guys can save enough atmosphere, 'll disconnect the power in the main computer bay, then jump start the systems
'll do a hard boot
This is a radical, incredibly risky notion
McConnell stares hard at Phil
So does Terri
Has that ever been tested
Are you kidding
These machines are much too valuable
McConnell looks from Terri to Phil
It's life and death
Do it
Then he turns, and the    as he pushes away from the console and dives down into the core tunnel, heading towards the Sequence omitted from original script
where he emerges from the core into the rotating Hab deck, and pushes himself down a ladder toward the floor
He accelerates as he gets closer to the floor, then rights himself with a twist and lands on his feet -- now in gravity
Woody, in the , is hovering over the lower segment of the Hab hull, and right away we see his problem
He can't reach the damaged spot because it's spinning past him, spewing vapor
(over radio) Jim, how we doin' on the
McConnell runs to a computer terminal and starts clicking with the mouse
Just one goddamn second
Come on, c'mon
Voice print identification
McConnell
(a beat) Accepted
Shutting down artificial gravitational rotation
McConnell hears a sound up at the core tunnel
He turns, it's Terri
She holds an small 0-2 cannister, marked with a red cross
Hang on
McConnell grabs onto a counter edge as
Attitude control thrusters on the hull begin firing in pulses
The rotation of the lower Hab deck immediately starts to slow down
The great red ball of Mars drifts by
Terri, lurching, grabs a ladder strut, and watches from the tunnel as
Is also jarred by the firing of the thrusters
The rotation slows until the Hab is still
Zero-
McConnell floats
He and Terri can hear the terrifying sound of air whistling out into space through the breach hole
Sixty per cent atmosphere
(
) Get some light on the hole so  can locate it
've got a better idea
(shouts to Terri) Stay there
He starts rooting through Phil's storage area -- bags of &Ms, comic books -- looking for what he needs
Phil is now strapped into the pilot's seat
He's scared, sweating hard, but concentrating fiercely as his one good hand works a battery-powered screwdriver
He's removing the panel of the main computer bay
Over the intercom, he can hear the merciless struggle going on elsewhere
(
) 'm topside, Jim, do you know which sector
(
) 'm workin' on it
The lower Hab deck is no longer revolving
Woody pops his thrusters and drifts over the metallic skin
But there's such a vast area to search
Jesus, uh, , this is gonna be like searching for a needle in a haystack
McConnell locates a can of Dr
Pepper, shakes this violently, then tosses it up to Terri, who's still in the tunnel mouth
She catches the drifting can, confused
When McConnell speaks again, he's gasping for air
Shake out the liquid
Jim,  don't -- Shake it out near the hull
Terri shakes out soda from the open can
She and McConnell watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air, caught by escaping oxygen
It rises towards the "ceiling" of the outer hull, like a miniature tornado
Sequence omitted from original script
Woody still drifts over the hull, searching intently as his frustration builds
'mon, c'mon, where are you
(
) Fifty per cent atmosphere
Terri, staring at the ceiling, sees something remarkable
Swirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull
She can now see the ugly puncture for the first time
(gasping) Woody, the breech is in sector four
Sector four, copy that
(
) Copy, ' heading there now
Terri turns, excited by McConnell's triumph; she's just in time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts to lose consciousness
He's deathly pale
Woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting out of the hull of the lower Hab
It's some distance away from him, but clearly visible
(to himself, marveling) Sonofabitch
You never did that in the simulator
Terri pushes off from the ladder, drifting weightlessly down to McConnell
She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister, pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face
He sucks in air, color returning to his skin as he revives
'
An incredible tangle of tubes, wires, chips, as Phil's gloved fingers -- both hands now -- probe desperately through them
Where are you, you little bastard, where are you
As he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer bay
Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart, streaking into electronic snow
He shoots a tense glance at Which is flickering crazily
It shows the ship moving much closer to its critical  point, indicated by a flashing red triangle aimed down at the Martian surface
Forty percent atmosphere
Woody, popping his thrusters, moves as fast as he can towards the protruding finger of crystal, but he's not there yet
All of a sudden Woody's thrusters cut out
The ship is moving by, a meter beneath him
Woody punches his arm controls
Nothing
Then just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him, the thrusters kick back in
Woody grabs the edge, starts to move to the hole
Woody lets out a breath
(to himself) Whoa
McConnell, holding his breath, grabs a patch gun from a storage locker
Terri's still got the 0-2 cannister
He nods to her, and together they push off from the floor, leaping weightlessly up to the other side of the Hab, the "ceiling
" They reach the gaping puncture, which they now see has been only partially dammed by the soda ice
' As Phil's gloved fingers finally locate the plug he's been searching for
He hopes
And grip it firmly
Gotcha
Says a silent prayer
Then he yanks the plug
, from all around him, as the systems are abruptly shut down, in a way they were never meant to be mishandled
Terrifyingly, a couple of the monitors arc to each other as they die
Dodging sparks, Phil stares at As it also flickers and dies
Now they're flying blind
Thirty percent atmosphere
Woody arrives at the ice finger, knocks away the big crystal, then pulls his patch equipment from a pouch
In the Hab, Terri uses the base of the 0-2 cannister to smash away the interior ice chunk, then McConnell, who's getting wobbly again, blasts the hole with the epoxy gun
As he works, Terri gives him another hit of air
Twenty percent atmosphere
The lights flicker out in the Hab
Outside, Woody slaps a big square patch over the hole, rips off the backing
As it changes color and shrinks, drawing itself down into the metal of the hull
'
As Phil's fingers re-connect the same plug
From inside the computer bay
He's trembling, sweat-streaked inside his faceplate
Blood has soaked through his gauze pads
His good hand hovers over the red main power switch
The moment of truth
now
With a dramatic click, he throws the switch, hard-booting the computer system back on
He stares at the screens
Nothing happens
Come on
Come on
Frightened, furious, Phil bangs on the switch with his cordless screwdriver
When all else fails, hit something
Feeble starlight from the viewports
McConnell and Terri, drifting side by side, stare at one another, expecting to die within seconds
It feels like an agonizing eternity
Twenty percent atmosphere
McConnell's eyes widen, as he realizes this is the same as the last reading
Pressure stabilizing
Atmosphere level increasing
Terri and McConnell look at each other
Tears of relief in her eyes
He is exhausted, nearly spent, but manages a grin
She holds the 0-2 mask up to his face, and as he grips it, breathing deeply, they hug one another
The lights and computer screens are flickering back on
All of them
The cockpit lights up like a Christmas tree
Phil bounces up and down like a madman, babbling in triumph
Yes
Awriiiight
Had it all the way
Yes
Forgetting his injury, he pounds his gloved fist on the console in triumph
Shit
He wrings his injured hand, then his gaze is caught by Which pops back on, showing the ship and the  point coming perilously close together
' As he keys his mike urgently
Get back in here, guys
Woody floats above the repaired hole, scanning the nearby surface of the hull
Jim, there's a lot of scarring
'd better check for other punctures while 'm out here
(
) Negative, negative
Woody, get back inside
We've gotta start the checklist for orbital insertion
(a beat; reluctantly) Copy, 'm heading there now
Woody jets back towards the open  hatch
But as he reaches this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentarily by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him
As the huge planet is  in all its red, unearthly glory
It's so close now that individual features can be seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris, and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the Martian atmosphere
stunning, alluring spectacle
Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor
Dawn, after a very long night indeed
He whispers lovingly, under his breath
Hey, Beautiful
Then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through the  hatch
and down along the hull as stark sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a row, and the thick silver tubes that join them
There's a good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower
Then, as the ship begins to
On one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of the eraser at the end of a pencil
So small, so apparently harmless
Sequence omitted from original script
As Woody enters, stripped from the , dripping with sweat, McConnell is waiting for him
For a moment the two men just look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce hug
(whispers) Know what
You've got enough left
McConnell looks at him, understands
Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up Phil's hand
As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes
Piece of cake
Well
Easier than the cha-cha
He scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately
Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own eyes
His voice catches for a moment
don't know what you're getting so cocky about
We scored better times in the sim at least twice
(grins) How's his hand
Terri separates from Woody, looks down at Phil
Seems
Couple of the tendons are going to be a little tight for awhile
Try to close your fingers, Phil, nice and slowly
Phil starts curling up his fingers
The middle digit remains extended in the universal gesture
They all consider this for a moment
Then Phil looks up cheerfully
Well, at least 'll still be able to drive
After a split-second they get it, and the whole crew roars with , which builds and builds; they're almost giddy with the relief of the tension
Sails  , with small attitude thrusters firing as the great ship maneuvers into position for its orbital-capture burn
Mars looks very large, blood-red
The entire spectacle is majestic, awe-inspiring
, we're ready to light this candle
Go/No Go for braking burn and
Engines
All four astronauts are strapped in, fully suited and helmeted
Mars looms through the cockpit windows
The atmosphere is electric with excitement

'm fueling the engines
He flips three switches, in rapid sequence, and
As we   on the damaged fuel line, we see a tiny but steady spray of fuel venting from the hole caused by the meterorite
This freezes into eerie streamers and chunks, which slowly drift away from the ship
They're quite beautiful
(
) Optimum angle of entry minus seven degrees
Six
Five
Woody looks at the others for moment -- everyone is set, looking good -- then reaches for a last switch
Four
Three
Woody hesitates, then glances at McConnell
Jim
McConnell, moved by this honor, nods
He reaches out to throw the switch himself
Let's go to Mars
As the countdown indicator reaches "0000
00
00", a final signal , and he flips the switch
In total silence, the engines ignite
The second they do, the streamers of frozen fuel explode in a white flash
With alarms sounding, the four astronauts are slammed violently forward, against their restraints
What the -- Shut down engines
He and Woody both reach out, straining against the incredible -forces, and manage to grab a red emergency lever, yanking it down hard
Too late
, we see a terrifyingly violent chain reaction
The fuel tanks themselves explode, one after another
The supporting metal struts are vaporized
The solar panels are snapped off
Two of the huge engine bells are smashed sideways, out of alignment, while the third, trailing pieces of the cowling, goes hurtling off,  , like a flaming cannon ball
The entire aft section of the ship, including much of the lower Hab, instantly becomes a shredded, charred tangle of metal, and even worse, the explosion causes what's left of the ship -- mainly the  chamber and cockpit -- to tumble end over end, cartwheeling down towards Mars
In the windows, Mars goes crazily in and out of view
The astronauts, flung this way, then that, are all fighting against unconsciousness
Engines negative
No response
've got no attitude control
Manual separation
Blow the bolts
Negative
The  doesn't have enough thrust to correct this rotation
We're too steep
Falling into the atmosphere
From further away, the charred remainder of the ship can be seen spinning down towards Mars, which now fills the screen, looming as large as Earth, when seen from the space shuttle
The ship's motion is mercifully slowing as it hits the outer atmosphere, but just as clearly this steep, unplanned angle of entry dooms it
Christ, at this angle we'll burn up
Their    is shown -- much too direct -- with an indicated swerve into blinking red disaster
Warnings flash: How much time've we got
don't know
Three minutes
don't know
McConnell's mind is racing furiously, desperately
Where's the
The Resupply Module
Why
That's not -- Where is it
Phil punches buttons
a second ellipse appears: a blinking orange dot labelled "
" It appears to be soon intersecting with their own trajectory
Uh, it's close
Damn it, how close
(shaken) - don't know
It'll take time
We don't have time
Figure it out
Now
Phil frantically types in commands on the computer
Jim, we're dead stick, there's no way to maneuver this ship into a link-up
Not the ship
Just us
We have to go They look at him, stunned
Leave the ship
You want us to transfer in suits
Jesus, Jim -- if we don't make it -- if we miss the
There's no other choice
Phil, how close
One kilometer, that's the best  can do
They stare at Woody
We feel the full, terrible weight of his responsibility
Four lives hang on his call
Prepare to abandon ship
Sequence omitted from original script
The astronauts are outside the ship, tethered to each other with long shock cords
Other cords, clipped to their suits, trail gear bags
Phil clutches a silver metallic case -- his precious computer repair kit
Woody is in the
They're all rotating at the same speed as the ship behind them
On my mark, seven percent left thruster
Three, two, one, fire
All four astronauts fire a brief, simultaneous burst from the tiny attitude control thrusters in their suits
This stops their rotation, bringing their travel under control
The ship continues spinning in the background
Woody takes a final look at the charred, doomed Mars Recovery
The only home they've known for six months
He exchanges a silent glance with the others
They all expect to be dead in the next few minutes
Woody takes a breath, nods
Okay
Let's go
He pops the big thrusters on the  and starts heading away from the ship
The cord between Woody and the others pulls taut and they start to follow
Of Woody leading them away from the crippled spaceship, against the magnificent backdrop of the blood-red planet below
Four tiny figures, all alone in space
As Phil looks back, his eyes searching the stars
What're you looking for
(softly, sadly) Earth
(beat) Hey
When we get back
We really will have to try this in the sim
He tries to smile
So does she
How we doin' on fuel, Woody
Woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm
'm at fifty percent
(looking down) But  don't see the
Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black space, expecting to see the  coming up behind them
Happens to glance directly below
There she is
The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against the red of Mars
Jesus
She's not where  thought she'd be
We're going to miss her
Looks again at his display screen, frustrated
What do you think
We can't catch it
Not like this
(thinking quickly) Use the tether
From a compartment on the side of the , Woody pulls out
About the size of a large flare gun
There's a carabiner- like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun
We'll only have one, maybe two shots before she's out of reach
It'll be better if  leave you the gun while  run out to the
've got enough fuel left for that
You'll be going too fast
'll aim to overshoot, then brake like hell; arc it in
McConnell looks at him
They both know how risky this is, and they also know it's their only chance
Woody flips a switch on the gun and pulls on the hook
Off it comes, trailing wire
Woody clips the hook to the , then hands McConnell the gun
Seeya in a few
McConnell nods
Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender, loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the  jets at full throttle
As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the tether gun
Woody is chasing the  from above
It's as if he were in an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway
Woody is picking up speed quickly
Maybe too quickly
He checks his armpad display screen
Okay
'm on path to overshoot
'm gonna take the edge off
Woody starts braking with the  thrusters as hard as he can
Glowing with orange flame
They suddenly cut off
' Show alarm
He checks his display
'm out
Coming in hot
Still long
(beat) Abandoning the unit
'll brake with suit jets
Woody hits some buttons and the 's latches snap open
He grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes himself free of the , starts firing his small suit jets
' He's still going very quickly
, Floating close together
The tether line is still unspooling from the gun
They watch Woody, below and ahead of them, as he races towards the
Terri's heart is in her throat
Oh Jesus
Jesus
McConnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm
Still speeding towards the
His suit jets cut out
Suit jets gone
But 'm gonna make contact

-- At what velocity
Impact's gonna be a little rough
At what velocity
(beat) Thirty-two
look between McConnell and Terri; her face is stricken
'm gonna use the gun to slow you
No
You slow me and 'll fall short
It's too fast, Woody
No choice
'll be okay
Here we go
Woody's coming down on the module at over thirty kilometers an hour
He holds the hook out in front of him with one hand while grabbing the tether line with the other, and
-- he crashes into the
' Slams the hook against a receiver on the hull of the

Another couple hundred meters to go
Woody, what's your status
-- (after a beat) Uh, well, no suit jets and 'm still carrying a good deal of velocity
As soon as we get hooked up, 'll come get you
(after a beat) Uh, 'd have to say negative on that, Jim
Negative on the transmission
No,  heard you
Negative on the maneuver
am not retrievable
McConnell and Terri share a quick, anguished look
Woody, that's not possible
You're not going that fast
It comes down to the amount of fuel, honey
The suit jets were designed for attitude control, not travel
Retrieval just won't work
It has to work
Hey, believe me,  don't like it any more than you do
Woody -- Run the numbers, Jim
am
McConnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display pad
Terri is staring at him
When McConnell's eyes meet hers, they are red-rimmed
Haunted
Woody, you hang tight
We'll get into the , fire her up, drop her into a lower orbit and come scoop you up
Sounds good, Jim
It's gonna take half an hour to get the  reoriented
Woody'll be
He'll be in the atmosphere by then
Then we'll have to get her moving faster
We don't have time
You listen to Jim, honey
It's a good plan
No
We are going to -- Oh Jesus, look
The ship
Phil points
McConnell and Terri look
Is now several kilometers below and behind them
It's glowing red
then orange
then white
Then it erupts into a giant fireball, devoured by friction with Mars' atmosphere
, Are all staring at this, awed, when McConnell happens to look up again
He sees something alarming
Look out
They are drifting quickly into the
Brakes
Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down
They bang into the  at about one-tenth the speed Woody did
They find handholds and grab on
McConnell hits a button on the tether gun
Releases from the 's hull
McConnell hits another button and it is reeled all the way into the gun
Phil is already scrabbling at a latch on the 's outer airlock door
Okay, let's get inside
Phil, start dumping the cargo, or there won't be room for us
But we need those supplies for -- Dump the cargo
Hang on, Woody
Is looking back at the
Smiles with relief to see that Terri has reached it safely
Will do, Jim
He turns to look at
Right below him, filling his field of view
long beat
(softly) Hey, Beautiful
Terri makes a snap decision
She grabs the tether gun from McConnell's surprised hands, then pushes off from the
McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining
Terri, no
But it's too late
She's already out of reach, and now fires her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the
Is reaching to activate his own jets, when ' Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage
They stare at each other
McConnell wrenches his hand free, half- maddened, agonized, staring after Terri
Goddammit, Terri, it won't work
But Terri keeps on going
Looks back at the , as he continues to fall towards Mars
Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him
Terri, what are you doing
-- 'll tell you what 'm not doing, Woody
'm not going to watch you die
Terri -- You'd do the same for me
Phil is watching as Terri drops towards the distant twinkle of Woody's suit lights
The airlock door hangs open
Phil looks at McConnell, anguished
Get inside
Dump the cargo, then start the systems
(Phil hesitates) Now
As Woody keys his mike
Tries to steady his voice
No
wouldn't come for you
Not if it just wasn't possible
can do it
No, Terri, you can't
You don't have enough fuel to get me, stop us both, and get us back
Hell, you come any farther and you won't have enough to get back yourself
No response from Terri
Listen to me, goddammit
You have to stop
You have to stop now
He's right, Terri
It's no use
Terri looks at her armpad display
As her fuel indicator drops from 50 percent to 49 to
Releases her thumb from the toggle control
Stop firing
Drifts, staring towards Woody
Are on the same trajectory, going the same speed, and only about a hundred meters apart
But it might as well be infinity
Okay, honey
You gotta go back now
The hell  do
Terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger
Comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it
Watches as it comes shooting down toward him
--  -- Woody gets larger and larger, the hook gets closer and closer, and then
-- the hook stops The wire has run all the way out
Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from him
His only life preserver
Hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into the gun
What are you doing
'm gonna jet a little closer and try again
Terri, you spend any fuel getting closer, you won't get back, and if anyone tries to get you, they'll die too
No response from Terri
Is whipping back toward Terri and the gun
Woody's voice cracks; he's very close to tears
Pleading now
Honey, please go back
Go back and help everyone get down to the surface
The hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun
Terri resets the gun quickly, in an anguished fury
am not losing you
can't let you do it
can't
'm sorry
Looks at Woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something different in his voice now, a terrible resolve
Woody
Raises his hands to his helmet ring
His eyes shining
love you, Terri
God how  love you
He unscrews the ring, pops the seal
The outrush of air pushes his helmet all the way off
Woody shuts his eyes and opens his mouth
Woody, nooooooo
Ice crystals bloom with Woody's last breath
There's nothing to suck in
He doesn't fight it
He lets death come
Tears streaming, chest heaving, frantic
Woody, oh Woody, please God, no
Hovers over her suit jet toggle control
McConnell's voice, from the distance, sounds very tired
Like he's aged fifty years in the blink of an eye
Come back, Terri
Terri's thumb is still poised
Death would be better
Outside the
The hatch is still open
We see Phil inside, staring out anxiously towards Terri
(quietly, simply) He's gone
He sees no movement from the distant, small figure of Terri
Please, Terri
(long beat) We need you
' Pushes the toggle control
to one side, not forward
' Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears
She turns herself around, reluctantly
Heads slowly back towards the
On the big screen at , a glowing green icon labelled " " is shown in orbit, as a stream of computer figures crawls beside it
: "
20   " Beck stands by the  , as the latter repeats headset data
Okay, they're Go for the burn and Should be initiating the burn just about
now
Suddenly the data stream goes crazy
It shivers, streaks, breaks up
then stops
The blinking green icon representing Mars Recovery glows brighter
then vanishes
moment of stunned silence in the big room
Then a rising babble of scared, confused voices
Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen
His face goes pale, stricken
His worst nightmare is taking place, right before his eyes -- and for the second mission in a row
: The  is now on the night side of Mars
Cargo boxes, packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside
The hatch is sealed
McConnell hovers by a bulkhead
He's anguished, haunted by the image of Woody's death
We see him struggling to overcome his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate on the critical tasks at hand
In front of him, a panel has been opened; he's facing Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator lights, com ports
Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering
He's holding a palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel
He begins tapping the keys, but then stops himself
Reconsiders
He turns, looking back at Hunched on what would be the floor if the  were on land
They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting
Clearly this tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned operation
It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold
' Is a map of torment
He is shivering, both from cold and fear, barely holding himself together
He hugs his computer supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear
Is worse
thousand-yard stare
She's in shock
Knows he has to occupy them
Speaks softly
Phil
(no response) Hey, Phil
Phil looks up at him dully
We're going in blind
We'll deploy the chutes by laptop
need to get on the data bus, put in a software patch, and try to soften this tin can's landing
could use your help with the patch
After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards McConnell
He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, then takes the little computer from McConnell
He begins to tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence
That's great
Good job
(turning to Terri) Hey, Terri,  was wondering
Think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those cargo straps
Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her hand, as if she's never seen it before
Dully she reaches for another one, begins looping them together
Studies both of their faces intently
Knows that he can't push them too hard, too fast
They're moving like robots, but at least they're moving
( ) Small thrusters are firing, getting the  into position for entry into the atmosphere
Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the , as it falls away from us, towards Mars at night
The astronauts, restrained on the floor by Terri's jury-rigged strap system, hold on for dear life
The buffeting through the atmosphere is shaking them violently
We see the effect of the incredible g-forces: faces distorted, unable to focus their eyes
Each of them thinking, once again: Now 'm going to die
Sequence omitted from original script
The Mars One Base Camp looms in the foreground, like some desolate, otherwordly ghost town
And then, in the night sky beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright streak of red as the  slashes down into the Martian atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind distant mountains
Then all is stillness again, deathly stillness and silence
Beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space
He's just lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this disaster, the probable end of the Mars Program, and the certain end of his own career
He doesn't, at first, even hear the nearby
Ray
We've got some new data, just coming in
Beck looks up, his eyes red-rimmed
The CapCom shifts uneasily
He's holding a computer printout
We just -- it doesn't make any sense
We're not sure how to read this
Data
Yes sir
Telemetry reports the has left its orbit and reached the Martian surface
(pause) Crashed
No sir
Under power
Beck snatches the paper, staring at it
For the first time we see some life coming back into him
When
Sixty-three minutes after Mars Recovery went off-line
Sir, the graph reads like a controlled descent
But that doesn't make any -- Beck suddenly understands
And it's a joy to see his face, the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes
They used the  as a lander
The CapCom stares back at him, feeling the same surge of hope
It's McConnell, it's got to be
Nobody else could have pulled this off
Son of a bitch
They're alive
Sequence omitted from original script
- As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still
In the distance, the massive  still looms, perched for takeoff, the bottom rungs of its ladder buried
We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse, and the four-man rover
The oxygen still and propellant plant are almost buried
Solar panels, some of them punctured by micrometeors,  and  eerily in the slight breeze
And finally, We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole, but nearly obliterated by sand
, , Who are spooked by this desolation
They've paused at the edge of the camp
They have dragged along with them from their landing site a crude sledge, improvised from the 's hatch cover and some cargo straps
On this, their meager supplies
McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep their spirits up
He kneels, digs out the flag pole
Brushing off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the ground, packing the sand down with his boot
He stands for a moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist
Despite the cost, they have made it to Mars
When he turns, Terri and Phil are looking at him, moved
Better
(pause) Damn right
Terri, let's see if that oxygen still is operational
Phil, you better check out the
'll take the Hab
If you find Luke's -- He catches himself
Phil and Terri look at him
Just keep in touch
Phil steps from the umber sand onto the 's ladder, begins to climb
The four-man rover is nearby, sand drifted high against its tires
Terri kneels by the oxygen still, begins to scoop away sand with her gloved hands
She still looks numb
(on radio) 'm at the main airlock door
He unlatches a panel, grips the emergency lever inside, tugs it
After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks open
Little puffs of dust and sand swirl about, settle
Entering Hab
Perched atop the 's ladder, Phil, using a battery-powered drill, is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover
He lifts off the heavy cover, lets it tumble to the sand
've got  access
'm going in
Terri, you okay
Terri is still scooping sand
She's just cleared the first row of gauges
Yeah
This is gonna take awhile to get back to 100% capacity
McConnell walks through the kitchen, which we recognize
He pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew taped their final, fateful message
Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle
Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee
Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white
He spins, startled, and sees In his white pressure suit, staring back at him from the screen of a video monitor
Above this is perched the camera the Mars One astronauts used for their comm packets
This place is filled with ghosts
Phil, in the pilot's seat of the , pushes a computer's power button
The screen flickers weakly to life, startling him a bit, but all he sees on it are white streaks, crazy static
appears structurally intact
Computers are fried, just as we thought
Terri has cleared more gauges, valves
She sits back on her heels, studying the tangle of pipes
Copy that
've got busted filters here, clogged intakes
Helluva cleanup job, but so far no major damage
,
, On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere
The plants have been allowed -- encouraged
-- to grow wildly
Some are even pushing against the inflated roof
Water condenses on the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever assortment of collection jars
Liquid water
Reaches into a bucket, touches the water
His glove comes up before his wondering eyes, dripping
Grasping the implication, he looks down at his forearm instrument pad
Blinking red letters read "25 deg
" And something else -- the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly deflate, revealing his arm's shape
There's air pressure in here
Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout: "Nitr
78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%
" Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet
He hesitates, then lifts it off
Takes a deep, quenching lungful of pure air
Holds it in
Lets it slowly out
For a moment he doesn't trust his own voice
Then speaks softly towards his helmet
'm in the greenhouse
You better
you better come see this for yourselves
Phil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns
Through a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse
What is it
There's no answer
He rises
Terri rises, concerned, and turns
Through the distant, translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure can be seen, moving slowly
Jim
McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle
The dripping foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path
Everywhere he looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has come into play
He pauses, looking up
Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in the upper deck of the Hab
Its power comes from a crude water wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with duct tape, like some giant Erector set
As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged figure leaps through the foliage
It smashes into him, with a  , knocking him to the ground
McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights back as best he can
blur of flailing arms and fists, as he tries to push the creature away
Staring up, he catches a glimpse of the almost unrecognizable Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying curtain of dreadlocks
His skin is creased, weathered, above a scraggly beard
His clothes are tattered, patched together
In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull
McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off
Luke, it's me
Jim McConnell
We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes
Then he yanks his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles in the air
You're not here
Luke, it's Jim
No, no, you're not
you can't be here
Your wife is Debra
Your son is Bobby
You were reading Treasure Island with him
As he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light up with recognition
but before he can move, he is seized from behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms
McConnell scrambles to his feet
Don't hurt him
McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil that it's okay to let him go
They stand back, pulling off their helmets
Everyone is panting, out of breath
Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after another, as if still not quite certain whether they might vanish
His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse
Phil
Terri
Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell
Jim
don't understand
You're not supposed to be here
Why are you here
Where's Woody
He didn't make it Luke
Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything
He looks to Terri, who looks down
Oh no
Luke shakes his head in dismay
He seems to shrink in on himself
It's all too much for him to take in
McConnell kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him
Sequence omitted from original script
( ) Luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse
Nearby, his hotplate, pots, and some freshly harvested vegetables and greens
The others crouch around him
Luke, what happened here
flash of fear in Luke's eyes
(whispers) We fired the radar
It came
They all died
What came
They all died, but  was spared
Why
Had to be for a reason
Then, all of a sudden,  knew why  was spared
His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper
So somebody would be left to figure out the secret
He taps his forehead, significantly, then nods once or twice
The others exchange an uneasy glance
Luke, we still don't understand
Come
Comecomecome
He rises quickly and scuttles off, waving an impatient hand, without waiting to see if they'll follow
McConnell, Terri and Phil stare after him for a long moment
Phil breaks the silence
Is it just me
Or is he about two mealpacks short of a picnic
Long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain
He could be suffering from a form of asphyxia
Or maybe his whole crew died and he's been marooned alone on Mars
Let's give him time to adjust
McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went
Phil, trailing, mutters to himself
Greatgreatgreat
Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised sledge, with its meager supplies
McConnell, Terri, and Phil walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again
They hear Luke over his
So
let me be sure  understand this
Your ship blew up, with all its supplies
Then you emptied the cargo out of the , and it was totalled on landing
You've got no food, no water, no spare oxygen, nothing but what  see here
McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed
Then McConnell nods
Luke looks at him, a cracked grin
What kinda rescue mission is this
That kind
He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it off a sledge
Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil
Check it out
New nav boards for the got four round-trip tickets, baby, right in here
(softly) Four
In some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody's death seems to bring him fully back into himself
He takes Terri by the shoulders, deeply saddened
She meets his gaze
Terri
'm so sorry
He was a good man
Thanks, Luke
When there's time, we'll talk
She nods, grateful
beat
He looks at the others
This way
He starts off across the sand, and they follow
They stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt, as Luke completes his account of the disaster
When  came to and dug myself out of the sand, my faceplate was cracked
Leaking badly
barely made it back to Base
It was weeks before  could work up the nerve to go back out there and look for their
He has to pause, collect himself
Renee was the only one  could find
But it didn't seem right, somehow, to dig just one grave
There is an emotional silence
Luke turns, takes a few steps
He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust around them
McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze
Has it been blowing like this for a while
(Luke nods) We saw a big storm from space
But Micker said it was turning south
Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only he seems to see
If it holds course
McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at Luke
This -- whatever it was -- this force
You say it came directly out of the top of the mountain
You don't believe me
That's okay
But 'm not crazy, Jim
McConnell isn't quite sure how to reply to this
What did you mean by its "secret
" What secret
(pause) You better see for yourselves
Sequence omitted from original script
McConnell, Terri, and Phil follow Luke into the Science Lab area of the Hab, then stop in their tracks
Their helmets are off
It's very cold in here; their breath is frosty
-- The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many locations, all tagged and labelled
There are drawings and diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew
See, where they made their mistake was, they must've planned for it to be visible from Earth
The others turn, looking at him
Luke is aiming an electric space heater at his computer
As the coils glow red, he rubs his hands together, poised over the keyboard
Who's "they"
Luke reacts to their blank stares
He has a kind of jittery feverish intensity, a secret excitement
Don't you understand
Hundreds of millions of years have gone by
You've got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, meteor impacts -- hell, in that much time, the whole surface would've changed
So no wonder we never saw it before
Well,  mean, we saw it, but not like they meant us too
Too much dirt on it
The others exchange worried glances
Is he totally nuts
Saw what
This
On the computer screen they're looking at
Pictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground- level, in telephoto views
Rising out of a ring of rock and dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face
The white is smooth, impenetrable
It has the scale of a mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural
,    (
) They are stunned
Can hardly believe their eyes
Jesus
What is that
don't know
But whatever it is, somebody built it
And not us
few moments of silence while they try to absorb this
What about the sound
That signal you heard before the explosion
Good, Jim, good
That's the key
click of the mouse and they all , over speakers, the Hear the pauses
That's what made me realize it's a pattern -- a repeating pattern
Mathematical
Luke is trembling with excitement
His words tumble out very quickly
He's been waiting so long to share this
That's what  thought
There are distinct blocks in the pattern, and within each block the tones come in groups of three
Threethreethree
For months  struggled to analyze it, trying different constructs
Then  thought about dimensions
-- coordinates
Right
Three groups equals three dimensions
So  tried assigning different graphic values to each block, group and tone
And finally got
this
He types another command
They all look at the monitor, the glow reflecting on their faces
They are amazed again
Where we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally familiar double helix, of a  molecule -- the elegant blueprint of life
(
) My God
Is that what  think it is
that's a model of
You see it, too
Thank God
was afraid  was just suffering from a form of asphyxia
She glances at him, surprised that he overheard her earlier diagnosis
But he smiles, not offended
So, okay, so -- somebody left this thing here, somebody -- other than human
But what the hell is it
My guess is, it's a signature self-portrait of whatever species created the Face
But that  looks human
No way
It's missing the last pair of chromosomes
See
Yeah, but it's close
Damn close
The difference between a man and an ape is less than three percent of genetic material
But that three percent gives you Mozart
Einstein
Or Jack the Ripper
They look at him
Then all four turn, stare again at the slowly rotating , pondering its awesome mystery
When he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen
We can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery has on his imagination
It's been a long day
Let's get a couple hours sleep, then tackle this thing when we're fresher
Phil, your first priority will be to get the motherboards over to the
Concentrate on getting communications up first
(Phil nods) Soon as we've got the juice, we'll send a packet to Micker, tell them Luke's , and that
everything else that's happened
The rest of us will take an inventory of supplies, see where we stand
Okay
The others nod in weary agreement
As they start out, towards the relative warmth of the greenhouse, Terri looks at Luke, at his scraggly beard and his long, lank hair
She smiles, brushing some locks off his forehead
'mon
There's a pair of scissors in my medkit
Sequence omitted from original script
As in the Science Area, this space has enough thin oxygen for the astronauts to remain unhelmeted
McConnell and Luke are still going through what few supplies were salvaged from the
Luke pauses, rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek
His beard is gone, his hair neatly trimmed
McConnell enjoys Luke's own wonder at his transformation
How do you feel
Like  just got back my other three percent
McConnell smiles
Terri enters through the hatch, removing her helmet
The backup generator is salvageable, and two of the solar panels
'm pretty sure  can get the oxygen still back into production, too
So we're not in such bad shape, considering
Good work, Terri
McConnell, rummaging through Phil's backpack, drops an already- opened bag of &Ms
The  scatter and bounce all over the floor
Look at that
Phil's idea of absolute essentials
Luke and Terri smile
McConnell scoops up the fallen &Ms
He slows down as he does it, looking at the scatter of little round
Something tugging at the back of his mind
: Sequence omitted from original script
Phil's intricately designed & model of his "ideal woman", floating weightlessly, as McConnell drifts past it, plucking away a couple pieces of the candy
Phil reacting, in good- natured annoyance
The gap in the design left by McConnell's theft
As he trembles with excitement
With sudden comprehension
It's not a signature
(puzzled) What
That noise from the Face
It's not a signature
It's a test
Luke and Terri stare at him
McConnell sits in front of the computer back in the science lab area, staring once again at the mysterious  model
Luke and Terri stand behind him
McConnell's energy, his new certainty, is almost electrifying
It's asking us for the right answer
It wants us to put in the missing pair of chromosomes
But why
To prove that we're human
Terri and Luke look at each other, starting to understand
We fired radar into that thing
Concentrated sound waves
Which it interpreted as a wrong answer
Yes
It's like a, a security alarm
When it gets an incorrect response, it defends itself
Phil is listening in on radio
He's got panels open, wires dangling, as he works his ongoing repair
He keys his mike, uneasily
So what happens when it gets the right answer
As McConnell looks at Luke and Terri
(hesitates) don't know
But we've got to find out
(to Luke, pointing) Can you work this the other way
Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes
Then dub them into your recording of the signal
think so, yes
What about the radar gun
Will it accept that input
Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face
Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying
Phil is also growing increasingly nervous
Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim
What if you're wrong
Whoever goes out there
mean, what if you're wrong
Three people have already died over that thing
As Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell
Four
McConnell looks at her
Terri, if we leave here without getting some answers, they all died in vain
Terri shakes her head
We just don't know enough about that -- that thing out there to take any more chances
What are we here for, if not to take chances
His passion startles them; they've never seen him so emotional
He points at the computer screen
This means we're not alone
It means we're on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankind's history
But we've still got to prove it
Who knows when someone else will get back here
Or if they ever will
You know what Congress is like
They'll say it's too dangerous, too much loss of life, let's go back to unmanned flights
We could be the last explorers to come here for decades
We're it, guys
(pause) We're it
(quietly) We don't have to go out there
There's a better way
They look at him, surprised
Sequence omitted from original script
The familiar, plucky little figure of -8 wheels across ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back
Ares' video snout  out, extending
The familiar bass rumble of the Face is very loud from here
Checking video feed
McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he pushes buttons, and a monitor  to life
White streaks, then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance
Finally the image starts to sharpen
There
They see the familiar stark white profile of the , shot from ground level, in a
Stare at the ominous sight
They're all more nervous than they want to show
Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick as he maneuvers the remote surveyor
How close do we need to get
'm not sure
Maybe we better stop by that boulder
Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially shields it from the Face, looming beyond
The radar gun swivels, locating its target
Then stops, ready to fire
Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell
Phil shuts the lid of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively down
He nods
Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods
Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of awesome uncertainty and danger
He looks at McConnell, who finally gives a nod of command
Then Luke hits the button
From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as it's fired towards the Face
After a few seconds it stops
For a moment nothing happens
Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well
The only remaining sound is of , stirring up dust on the Martian plains
As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind
The movement is measured, stately, utterly silent
As the segment rises, it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face
No inside details can be seen
McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon, awed
They're barely breathing
Oh my God
It worked
It worked
Check for radiation
Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout
Normal
Seismic
normal
Anemometer steady
No sign of the vortex
don't know what we did, but guys -- does that look to you like a hostile gesture
No
More like an invitation
Or another test
McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening
On his face, a growing look of determination
Luke, the four-man rover
Does it still work
The others look at him, their expressions changing as they realize what he's implying
Sequence omitted from original script
McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock
Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him
The wind has picked up, and fine dust is blowing
They stop, staring off in astonishment towards The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above
The   has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers away and closing
The main body of it reaches two thousand meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand- kilometer front
Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed
McConnell turns to Luke, whose expression is grim
How long before it hits
An hour
Maybe less
How bad
storm like that
It could go planetary
And last a year
McConnell stares at him
It'll sock us in, Jim
We won't be able to take off
If that happens, with what few supplies we've got left
We'll starve to death
McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm
The others look at him with questioning gazes
He turns again
There's the four-man rover, ready to go
Waiting
Phil, how much longer to prep the Maybe forty-five minutes
It'll be tight, but we can make it
Then there's still time for us to get out there and back
He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other
Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement
Stay here
Continue the repair
If something goes wrong, you get out of here before that storm hits
Go back
alone
If we're not back in forty-five minutes,  want you to prep and launch
(looks at his armpad display) That's 1950 hours
Jim -- It's not a suggestion, it's an order
You understand
(reluctantly) understand
But -- You understand what
If you're not back by 1950,  prep and launch
McConnell nods, satisfied
Looks at Terri and Luke
Let's go
They start towards the four-man rover
Dust is swirling more thickly through the air, and the
Phil stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure
In a  , we see the rover approaching the Face, across the plains
The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the storm approaches from that direction
It's marching relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes spinning off near its purple-black base
Phil has panels off
He's reaching into the guts of the main computer, working feverishly
His repair kit is beside him
In a  , we look down across the side of the Face and its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light is streaming
Into this corridor of light, we see the rover arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels
Looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the Face
The opening towers to a dizzying height above us; the white light strains our eyes
The three astronauts as we see them, from behind, staring up
' As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic mystery before them
Luke and Terri look at McConnell
Another moment of critical decision
He keys his mike
Phil, do you read me
Phil keys his own mike
Yeah, Jim
Your signal's breaking up a little in the storm, but  read you
McConnell stares into the bright opening
Bathed in its light
We're at the Face
We're gonna need a few minutes here
Same deadline, launch at 1950
With or without us
Do you copy
(pause) Copy that
Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance
Jim, are you sure you want to do this
'm not sure of anything anymore
But  didn't come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet
Luke smiles
The three of them stare into the portal
McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of them by a gloved hand
They take a sort of collective breath
Then they walk forward together, into the light
The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a free hand
The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, textures, colors -- anything at all
They can't see walls, ceiling, even a floor
Surface seems firm and level
Roger that
Texture is smooth
've got good footing and no obstructions
Let's check our -- Behind them, there is an abrupt , like a giant airlock sealing shut
They turn, startled and nervous
Letting go of each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some sort
The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them
It's solid again
We're trapped
Don't move
Keep this orientation
The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the brightness, some twenty feet apart
(keys his mike) Phil
Phil, can you still hear me
Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the main computer
It works
He's immensely relieved
Computers are online
Ready to load software
But guys -- we're losing visibility here
He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust
Then realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio
Guys
Jim
Luke
Terri
Is anyone there
No answer
Phil stares at his radio in dread
Don't leave me
McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve
He can see that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse
He hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his right glove
Terri and Luke see this
(alarmed) Jim, what're you doing
You'll depressurize
don't think so
McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the hiss of rushing air
Jim, seal it
No
That was air going into my suit, not out
Look at your own suits -- they're not rigid anymore
We've got pressure in here
Luke looks at his sleeve
McConnell's right
Above Mars atmospheric
That's impossible
We're millions of miles from Earth and we're inside a gigantic white face
What's impossible
Terri types on her arm keypad
She's amazed
There's six psi in here
(taps more keys) Nitrogen and oxygen
Otherwise known as air
Terri nods
McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring
Luke follows suit
Hey, there may be some lethal trace gasses  haven't picked up yet, or
or
oh, the hell with it
Terri starts taking off her helmet
In a few moments, all three helmets are off
They hold them, glowing softly, against their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully
Air
And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed another kind of test
, Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled eyes
White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, plates, ramps
It's part of a  whose overall height and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose
But the hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach ramp, is unmistakable
Radiant white light streams out from within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts
Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow
At the end of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form, which we somehow sense is female
She appears benign, wondrous
This glowing  -- a holograph -- regards the astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to say "Enter
" All her motions are both calm and calming -- precise, unhurried, gracious
, Look at each other
They're awed into silence, and still tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than fear
Their eyes agree: Let's go
They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian, who retreats before them
They go through the hatch and disappear inside
Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor, but without apparent walls
The Martian stops, turns, facing them
The astronauts stop, too, uncertain what they're meant to do
Then the Martian gestures again
cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the floor in front of the astronauts
Inside it, a swirl of eerie lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies
, , Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this column, forming a loose triangle
As they stare into it, the myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their spacesuits
The whirling lights resolve into images, which relate to them the story of ancient Mars: we do not recognize
All is peaceful, beautiful
(softly) Is that what  think it is
Yeah
It's Mars
Tumbles through space towards the planet
Oh my God
- As thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface, heading in a stream out of the solar system
And a wall of fire and debris scours the planet
Oceans boil and vaporize
Two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the planet, spinning in flames
, , Involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images
As dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface
The flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons
Stare at this devastation, deeply moved
The stream of Martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system
Then we zero in on As it peels off and goes in another direction
Graphics show a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix of
The ship heads towards another blue planet in our solar system
As it was then
More clouds than now, more ocean, and the landforms all wedged together
Her voice is soft
Earth, when it was still Pangaea
Before the continents separated
Makes a fiery streak through Earth's atmosphere and plunges into the ocean
Instantly the image of the  double helix grows, filling the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new images
, , Cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing, crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms, plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs, birds, small mammals, larger mammals -- the entire stunning panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck Until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric, colored rings on the floor
The astronauts are left staring at each other across the open space where the column had been
Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their circle, taking the fourth position
McConnell is opposite her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side
The Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands
As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into McConnell's eyes
Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy
It's the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness or reserve
Staring at the Martian, he understands
They're us
We're them
We're Martians
That's what she means
Oh my God
The Cambrian explosion
McConnell and Luke look at her
Almost six hundred million years ago, there was a sudden expansion of life on Earth
The first multi-celled plants and animals appeared
No one has ever understood why
They seeded Earth
We hear a - , a single lingering high note, and simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor begins to glow brightly
It is an intense chromium yellow
Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the circle of colored rings
These shade from yellow, on the outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally reds
Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo blue, about a meter across
Small points of light glitter here, like stars against a midnight sky
Steps closer to McConnell
She has picked him out in particular
Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core
Looks back at her, nods his understanding
For the first time she seems to smile
Benevolence, reassurance
Then as abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away
Vanishes
Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused
There is a sudden, static-filled  from their helmets, nearby on the floor
(over radio) in, please
Can you
me
Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike
Phil, we're here
We read you
Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the relief in Phil's voice
And then the desperation
Thank God
Listen, this storm is really -- (loud static) -- few more minutes,  can't -- (more static) You've gotta get back to the ship
And then they hear only
His signal is lost
Phil
Phil
Suddenly the -  , at a lower register, with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as Begins to glow brighter
McConnell turns, looking at this new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri
We are in a ship
This is a ship
And the countdown has already started
Terri looks at Luke, alarmed
He's right
Then let's get the hell out of here
She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him
As he catches it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they came from, and Luke follows her
Until they both become aware that McConnell isn't with them
They turn back
He's still rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of the colored rings
Jim
McConnell doesn't turn
Jim, we gotta go
'm not coming with you
(stunned) What
Coming back, she sees how calm he is
How certain
What are you talking about
We've got to get home
That's where 'm going
Don't you see
That's what all this is for
(McConnell gestures at the ship around them) You were right Terri
This is an invitation
To follow them
To follow them home
He looks into their faces
Terri is trying to grasp this idea, still incredulous
Luke has the beginning of a half smile
have to go
This is the mission now
To find out who we are
Isn't that why we came here
Like Maggie said, "To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one
" Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words
Terri remembers too
McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them both
You know, when you think about it -- wasn't even supposed to be here -- all the accidents, everything that got us to this point, it's just
it's just
just know it's right
Terri looks at Luke
Luke is smiling
He understands
'm okay
know what 'm doing
But you're running out of time
You've gotta get back to the  and get off this planet
Now please go
Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend
once felt like  was taking your turn
But now  think maybe you're taking mine
Guess 'm a little jealous
They clasp hands for a moment
But in this moment is a lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell
Thanks for saving my life
My pleasure
Luke nods, deeply moved
He turns away, picking up his helmet, as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken beat
Her eyes are glistening
wish Woody were here to see this
He would've wanted to go too, Jim
Terri smiles
She is starting on the road to recovery
She's going to be okay
He's here, Terri
We wouldn't have made it without him
Terri nods
She digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls something out
She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes around it
Take care, Jim
McConnell smiles
Terri smiles back at him
Then she turns, picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused, looking back
Hey, Jim
Yeah
Have a great ride
Always do
Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, then hurry away, into the darkness
Looks down at what Terri gave him
' ' With the little Flash Gordon rocketship
Grips this tightly as he looks up
Sequence omitted from original script
The hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri, helmeted again, emerge from the Face
The leading edge of the dust storm is upon them
They can't see much more than a few meters
As they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again
They look at each other, uncertain what this means
But McConnell is now beyond their help
Luke keys his mike
Phil
Phil, do you read
(to Terri) He's not reading
can barely read you
Let's get the hell out of here
Is anyone there
Can anyone read me
Phil gets no response
He is shaking, almost crying
He hesitates, then starts hitting some keys
Which reads: "-
" McConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen tank
He steps cautiously onto the colored rings
Nothing seems to happen
Moving further, he takes his place on the indigo circle at their core
He looks at - As it dips from orange into red; the   are continuous now, very deep and rapid
The rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards the safety of the , as the maelstrom boils over the Face behind them
The sky is purplish black, thick with flying debris and eerie lightning flashes
Towering billows of dust chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they speed towards us, passing
McConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly , - Begins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up from the circumference of the indigo circle
Then a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops down from somewhere overhead
The two sections meet and fuse in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube
Fights against a stab of claustrophobia
Is he being imprisoned
Or somehow protected
Either way, he's virtually immobilized
In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't even move his arms
Only his head and neck can still shift
Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping switches and pressing buttons
He looks at his Which reads "1350
" , His finger hovers over a "Fire" button
He licks his lips nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button
And the words: "  " McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds him, when something catches his attention
He arches his neck, looking down
- Is beginning to fill the cylinder
It swirls in, from some unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are covered
' Widen in alarm
He strains against the sides of the cylinder but Slide helplessly across the smooth surface
Looks down again
Is up to his knees
Now his thighs
Cranes his neck, staring up
Can he wedge himself higher, can he somehow climb to safety
The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent
He can see the dust storm, boiling overhead
And now, rising into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself
These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water snakes; battered by the fierce winds
Two vast forces on a collision course
Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri stares at a dashboard computer screen
They have to shout to be heard over the
've lost the Base Camp beacon
Luke looks over alarmed
As the needle spins freely, giving no direction whatsoever
No good
We're driving blind
'll try to keep on a straight line
It's our only chance
Don't worry
've worked with Phil for four years
know Jim gave him a direct order, but he won't leave without us
The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover
It disappears from view
Phil sits in the pilot's seat
He is looking at a computer graphic that shows the engines readying to launch
With resignation, he keys his mike
This is , do you read
to Rover, do you read
Phil waits a second, then reaches slowly for a blinking red switch that reads "
" He hesitates, then actually has his fingers on it, about to flip it, when he hears a crackle of static on the radio
Phil keys his mike
This is , do you read
(very faint) Save the fuel, Phil
We're coming in
And Phil chokes back a sob
Blinking back the tears, he tries to compose himself, then keys his mike
Uh, Phil's not here right now
He left for Earth five minutes ago
Please leave your message at the beep
we see that the coils of energy are rising from the forehead of the Face, from its "third eye," spinning and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex
But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew, this is a vortex of fire
As we watch, more fiery streaks begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, cheeks and temples
These all rush upwards, like lava flowing uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face itself and spiral into the atmosphere
The peak of the forming vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds, causing a dark counter-swirl
Phil stands at the bottom of the 's ladder, gripping it to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust
appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm seeming to chase it from behind
Luke and Terri climb out, struggle towards him through the wind
Phil grips their hands, helping them over to the ladder
He looks back, confused
Where's Jim
He got another ride
Phil stares at her, bewildered
Tell you on the way
Let's go
Sequence omitted from original script
, we see that the cobalt-blue fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest
Now it's at his shoulders
It pours into his suit through his neck ring
He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid
He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing from side to side
Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth, his nose, his forehead
His whole body is submerged
The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top of the cylinder
Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath
Not so much fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting for his inevitable death
, as the energy vortex bends from side to side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the Face
As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the Martian ship
It is a flattened convex circle whose matte- metallic angles replicate the "Face" imagery
As the Face burns away around us, the Martian ship begins to rise and spin
Sequence omitted from original script
The vortex is now a tight, rapidly spinning cylinder
As it draws more and more power from the disintegrating Face, the Martian ship in its center spins faster and faster
' Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the huge buildup of -forces tears at his body
We're reminded of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the same thing about to happen to McConnell
His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his lips
His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken from his lungs
Sequence omitted from original script
As we      , we suddenly see, with him, a  of rapid-fire, almost subliminal We recognize each one
Previously, though, we saw them as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view them from new and slightly different angles
These images with glimpses of McConnell's pale, shaking, near- death face in the present
Sequence omitted from original script
Under the Christmas tree, lifts his new model rocket from its box
He turns to us, smiling joyfully
blinding white flash, and he disappears
Sequence omitted from original script

She looks up at us with a shy, proud smile
blinding white flash and she's gone
Sequence omitted from original script
In flight suits, holding their helmets, stand on the wing of a fighter jet
The radiant young couple turn to each other, kissing
blinding white flash and they vanish
In an astronaut's pressure suit, drifts rapidly towards us, reeling in along a tether
man's gloved hand is outstretched, reaching for her
As she grips the hand, we see her triumphant expression through her faceplate blinding flash; she's gone
'  - Is shaking savagely; he is very near death
And then, all at once, the
Time itself seems to stop
McConnell opens his eyes, staring
And then, fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid
He can breathe it
His eyes widen in surprise and understanding
He can breathe it
This fluid will keep him alive
His whole body relaxes, the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully trusts this launch for the first time
And then, with his eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image
And , in , the beautiful face, the shining eyes of  McCONNELL
Beatific, eternal
She gazes directly  , then smiles
Smiles back
,  , as the energy vortex changes from red- orange to blue-white
It  with terrifying power as its top starts to bend, angling like a telescope towards a specific point in the stars
Then the Martian ship -- a rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast, blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface, leaving only a blacked crater where the Face had been
,  , as the Martian ship, riding its blue-white column of energy, streaks up into the vast blackness, like a narrowly focused spotlight piercing the night
Down below, we can see the dust storm in all its vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet's surface, which it now completely covers
As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship, much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on a different trajectory
We recognize the familiar, comfortable sight of the
We see three figures in the cockpit
Sequence omitted from original script
Luke, Terri and Phil are strapped in, with their acceleration just starting to level off, when suddenly their cockpit interior is starkly bathed in white light
They wince at the unearthly radiance, shielding their faceplates with gloved hands
Dear God
Look at that
Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed
Is that him
Luke nods
Their eyes are glistening
Luke's voice is a whisper, both of prayer and farewell
Godspeed Jim McConnell
Sequence omitted from original script
Sequence omitted from original script
Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue- white scratch that in moments begins to fade
Finally it is a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless expanse of the star-filled heavens
