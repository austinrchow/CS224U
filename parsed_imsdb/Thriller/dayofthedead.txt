They're heavily armed, unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud
They are obviously exhausted
They gaze up to the city
Their deep-sunken eyes are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair
Another dead place

While  continues to   at the enemy,  swings herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears inside the place

He lurches away from the flame, his body slamming against the shed wall

Help me or die
Reluctantly the man moves towards  and the two survivors drag his limp body over the decking

32
'  (
) - It looks like a tropical paradise
Greatly separated from the other smaller islands on the horizon, its vegetation is dense and lush
There's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power lines, no buildings
What meets the eye is all natural and inviting
chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side of the island

Kill the priest and burn the church

The only way

Her heart is too callused for emotion to reach it
She just stares, her eyes dead cold like the eyes of a shark

Tall reeds and cypress moss camouflage it completely
It's at though the boat is sailing right onto dry land

- The blade chops into the top of a coconut

There are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering
Their red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells down

His madness

They flop him onto his back and  puts her canteen to his lips

He slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away
It plops into the marsh water, its contents lost
Burn the church
Kill the priest and burn the church
Burn
His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out
He squirms for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep
looks down at him
Unable to help, he moves off towards solid ground and disappears in the thick brush
After a time,  follows after him
39
- is at the edge of a clearing when  reaches him
His eyes are wide, frightened by what they see
In the ground before them there's    , fifty feet by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns
What is it
dunno
Landing pad for a helicopter dunno
Suddenly there's   , like the giant gears and pistons of a drawbridge being activated
The iron plate shudders and starts to move, downward, into the earth
duck into the nearby jungle
40
- They take cover in a thicket, both their  up and ready can be heard now, clunking sounds of metal on metal, and a few heavy thuds
There are also  on the wind but their words are indistinguishable
It's some kind of
elevator
There must be something under the ground here
maybe
military
Look
41
(
) - are rising up in to view, a dozen, maybe fifteen
Details are obscured by   but we can read helmets, heavy armaments, packs, utility belts
The impression is of a ghostly cadre of soldiers rising from hell
(o
s
) Jesus Christ
(o
s
) It is military
don't believe it
42
- What do we do
Let'em know we're here
or what
Let's just
wait a minute
Get a better look
She moves to another spot a few feet away
follows
43
(
) - , still obscured by foliage, moves off into the jungle carrying
There are   who do not move off with the others
They are standing still with their shoulders slumped, their heads lolling listlessly from side to side
They have the body attributes of prisoners yet there's something menacing about them
We , something like computer beeps, and, as though in response to that signal, the three slumped figures start to walk
They move slowly, stiffly, their feet shuffling, their arms dangling lifelessly at their sides
(o
s
) Oh
oh, my God
44
- ' eyes are wide in their sockets with disbelief, revulsion, horror
Beside her , also astonished, makes the sign of the cross

45
- As we    we see that the three slumped figures are They are wearing khakis and they are armed with Their  have been painted an identifying bright and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour
All the others in the platoon are humans
They, too, wear vests but theirs are not red but ,     emblazoned front and back
Two of the men wield     for use should the  misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co- operatively, even somewhat excitedly
the kind of excitement seen in a puppy that's just learned a new trick
46
- It can't be
Are we truly in hell
Come on
Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket, crouching all the while
hesitantly follows

Suddenly  , - startles them
They look around, up into the trees
spots something and points
, high in the cypresses, its wires running down to the brush and disappearing under ground
49
- First  comes
then
are shuffling out of the jungle and converging on the platoon
They seem to come from everywhere
Soon there are twenty or more
Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as worn by the platoon
These are solid colours, some white, some blue
None are red and none have orange circles
As   push in closer they seem to get agitated
They start growling and reaching out
poke at the more unruly creatures and   can be heard
The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the "Good Humour" men
From inside their freezer cartons those men produce
docilely take the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a more private supper
50
- What is that
Could that be

He slams his hand into his mouth to keep from making noise
No
They must have gotten them to accept

- The man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while others do the dirty work

He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble

Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what they are
walking dead

He starts to scream

He tries to stand up but he's too weak
stops his screaming
Then ' and he plops onto his back, dead

She takes advantage of the confusion and the  and bolts into the jungle at a full run

He fumbles for his   but before he can draw it   are on top of him

He turns towards the captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating
Take his gun, ass hole
He still has the strength to pull a trigger
Reluctantly  obeys, reaches down for '
Please

Maybe
We'll have a little talk first
Then

String him up

And if  don't
If  don't you'll come back after your death
You'll come back and find yourself hanging there
wanting to eat
needing to eat human flesh
You hate that thought, don't you
That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it
is weeping now
With a found spurt of energy he struggles against the rope
No use
It only brings pain
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food
crazed
You will lust for it
'll bargain with you
How many of you are on the island
Two of us
only two of us
me
and him
(He nods towards '
) don't believe you, rebel
Where are your headquarters
On the mainland
The mainland
is dead
a dead place
nobody there
Where are your headquarters, rebel
Tell me or 'll let you hang there forever
There are no
headquarters
There are no
rebels
Only the walking dead
Don't you see
They have won
Then why did you come here
To look
look for a place
a place to live in
an empty place
a
new
place
How did you know we were on this island
Do others know
Will others come
Nooooo
Believe me
There are no others
no rebels
nobody
it's over
it's ooooo
The man collapses, unconscious
66
- is dropping the thing into     which obviously already contains
wraps the mouth of the bag and begins to walk off
stops him
Where are you going, Tyler
My
"detail", sir
We're going to bury the heads
No time for that
'll take care of them
Just
following procedure, sir
They're entitled to burial
said, 'll take care of them
Just leave them there
Go help with the rest of the gear
has it in for  (we'll find out why later), and of course the feeling is mutual
sets the bag down on the ground and, seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon follows
After a moment,  motions with his head steps into view with the  , the one that ran amok earlier
The man follows  towards the jungle, dragging the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's neck
67
- : as '   jams    into ' gaping mouth
releases the noose and the two men take off, running
68
- They run to the middle of the clearing where they turn around to watch
lifts     that are strapped around his neck
He stares through the lenses, focusing, grinning
69
- : We see   staggering in the bush, clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth
70
- are the only ones who seem to notice what  has done
drops   he was going to carry off
He stares in disbelief, hatred on his face
71
- as 72
- grins as he watches the spectacle
Suddenly,    startles the captain
He drops the binoculars and spins around
He sees
'
'
He's dead
and won't come back to life
He's been shot through the brain
stand around dumbly
Those with  in their hands quickly sling them onto their shoulders
They're all afraid of the captain's wrath
walks towards the line of men with fury in his eyes
Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who fired that shot or 'll have every last one of you chopped up for feed
His eyes spot , standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his rifle slung
Step up here, Tyler
Sir
shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps forward
stares him down, his anger turning sinister
You fired that shot, didn't you
No, sir
Let me see your weapon
hands over his rifle
feels the barrel, sniffs it
It's been fired
In the battle, sir
is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out to be his favourite whipping boy
His body relaxes visibly
It may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is present
but  know some of these men well
'm sure that a few private conversations will tell me what  already know
You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag, Tyler
(Rhodes glances over at ' body) Cut him down
That's another head for you to chop off
Leave it with the others
Take the rest of his body down to the freezers
Move it, shit hill
moves off
' grin returns
: 73
- There's that   again, the
We're inside the place called  , in a huge under-ground concrete bunker
bustle around
Enormous hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from the surface
Riding on board,     prepare to unload their paraphernalia
74
- , sweating, exhausted,    made by jungle branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve
She has dipped it into a jungle stream
Cautiously she tastes the water, decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth
The   suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes look up
Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is stand on the marshy ground beside the creature's legs, jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time
She unslings her , aims it, then thinks better of firing
Grabbing up her   she runs into the darkening jungle
75
- by her shoulders
She starts to scream but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth
It's alright
It's alright
Don't be afraid
We're friends
looks into the strong, good face of , a tall muscular man, a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes that seem instantly trustworthy
There are soldiers near here
Guards
'll take my hand away if you won't scream
nods and  lets her go
There are two other humans standing behind the big man
There's  McDERMOTT, wearing the grease- covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth
She's a deaf mute, nicknamed , and she is urgently signing "Come on
Let's get outa here
" with her hands
Right
We better get away from that Bee
He might have friends
starts moving
follows voluntarily
We notice that all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles
76
- trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to chop a path with their blades
speaks in low tones as they move
Bees
That's what we call the dead
the walking dead
here on Gasparilla's island
Gasparilla
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago
His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson
Governor Dickerson
Of Florida
That's the man
He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan
Him and his family owned these islands 'round here
They was leasin' this one to the Fed
The whole underneath is dug out
There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that
Now this is Dickerson's
Gasparilla's
private fortress
Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee
and his private army, of course
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers
There were actually walking dead
in uniform
with guns
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees
They could sting, sister
We know you came up against 'em
We been watchin' you since you landed
Couldn't help
'm sorry for that
We ain't supposed to be outside
If we was spotted it could
well, it could be the end of everything
is signing for everyone to be quiet
They all stop in their tracks
McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy
With the stealth of a Mohican  pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and peers through
77
- There's   in sight built into  , are coming up out of the ground
They're armed with
Behind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come  - , all wearing vests of white and blue
Behind the lumbering creatures come      both wearing white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards
The woman is , one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave
(We'll learn a lot more about her later
) are pushing through the undergrowth right in the direction of  and her friends
shows some alarm at this but  calms her with a strong hand
has seen the approaching danger
She silently draws  ' from her belt
(With her other hand she draws   for good measure
)  McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another swallow from his flask
are getting closer
Too close for comfort
Finally,   and   turn and disappear into the bunker
The last man down pulls the hatch shut
The moment the coast is clear,    jump up from cover
follow their lead
But it's too late
have spotted them
The creatures begin to growl and make , - brings her  up chest-high, ready to repel an attack
lifts her own  but  reaches over and takes it away from her
Give that to me
Get behind me
Stay behind me
( resists, not understanding, somewhat insulted
) You ain't wearin' a vest
They been taught not to touch the ones with the circles
There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they leave us alone
The colour on their vests tell ya how much schoolin' they got
It's the ones without colours you gotta watch out for
gets behind , his orange circle acting as her shield
He reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his back
, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket
shuffles right past   McDERMOTT
It gets stuck in the bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking
, a "white", trudges within arm's reach of , growling all the while
Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes two angry steps towards the humans who back away
charges
Things happen quickly
pushes  away and swings the
An instant later ' twitches for a moment, its eyes rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground
McDERMOTT trots up beside
He takes a huge swallow from his flask then offers some to her
She puts the flask to her lips but nothing comes
She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty
McDERMOTT Sorry
Guess  don't know my own strength
wipes '  on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman
Thanks
can fight my own battles
know you can
Like  said, we been watchin' you
McDERMOTT We better get as far away from here as we can
We can work the other side of the island tonight
(explaining) We found nine entrances to the Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet
That's what we was doin' out here today
Huntin' for entrances
McDERMOTT Come on
They find a Bee done like this and they'll know somebody's been out walkin' where they shouldn't have been
bows his head over the downed
He mumbles softly
We can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the good words over the corpse of the "white-coat"
The man  was with
until today
believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two
Curse
What is it if it ain't a curse
It's a disease
It's a
a bug
a parasite that infects the brain
That sounds like a curse to me
We thought we were escaping here
We thought we'd found an uninhabited island
Christ
This place is a worse nightmare than anything 've seen yet
'm sure that's true, miss
And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'
What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man
But we're gonna beat Lucifer
We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here
Oh, what did  run into
bunch o' Jesus nuts
Religiosos
Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed
We ready to fight when we have to
And we gotta fight now
Look
fightin', mister
been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and 'm finished
don't need religion
don't need prayers
need a couple guns and a couple hands
We can sail on outa here
Find another island where there ain't so much
traffic
You think you can find your boat
There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here
You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now
You leave yourself a trail
is stopped by this
She stares at the big man suspiciously, not sure whether to believe him
We didn't see the exact spot but we know about where you landed
But we ain't ready to take you there
Not yet
You see
we need guns, too
looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas
She thinks for a moment
not very long
then she turns and starts off into the jungle
can find it myself
didn't come that far
Farther than you think
You'll get lost
You will
And there's Bees all through the jungle
ain't lyin' to ya
Religiosos don't lie
No
They just try to hold you for ransom
Fuck you, Moses
'm outa here
plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over her shoulder she disappears
McDERMOTT We can't let her go, John
We don't need her guns that bad
Billy boy
(He's joking
) McDERMOTT The hell we don't
But that's not what mean
She'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone
That or she'll be firin' off her automatics and wakin' up the troops
We'll split up
Billy, you go with Spider
Just an hour or two tonight, that's all
Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion
We'll meet up at number six and go back home together
McDERMOTT God save us
And me with me flask dry
'll never make it
splits up, moving off in two different directions through the darkening underbrush
78
- has fallen
The jungle is as black as the background on a velvet painting
is moving cautiously
She bumps into something, jumps back, her high, and freezes
Cautiously she moves ahead
one step
another
another
She steps down off a hidden ledge into  -
She manages to keep her balance but her  falls into the water and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt
Slowly she bends down and reaches into the water
swims past just inches away
recoils
Before she can reach down again she hears  , followed by
Then
She squints to see
approach on the black water
, big ones, just their very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman
She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her She spins and sees the thing
It has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the left breast
smashes her     '
It keeps coming
(So do the gators
They're getting to within a few yards
)  swings a fourth time
grabs her rifle
She pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun, topples off the ledge and into the water
When  starts to climb up on the ledge,   lurches towards her from dry land
She spins around, looking for options
The gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and slime and looking pissed
faces   on the bank
She has no choice
She aims her She's just about to fire when   out of the darkness
It's
'
From out of the night big  appears
He struggles to free his blade from the dead creature's head
scrambles up onto the muddy ledge
are still moving in and  , its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process)
Are you gonna pause to say words over the dead this time or can we be on our way
Without answering,  steams off through the bush pulling along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm
79
- on:
First there is only  , then an image blinks onto the screen
:    on  in various places throughout the huge underground facility
watch the screens gathered in groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes
The screens show scenes of  taking  from humans in are pointed at   then lowered harmlessly
are pointed at  without orange circles and The images repeat and repeat and repeat
watch the scenes with dumb curiosity
80
- This is the central area for all varieties of communication
There are  , both intercom and outgoing, there are and there are
Reflecting the panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in
run every which way,      clutter the place
scurry with   constantly repairing, patching, trouble shooting
Most of the personnel are  but there is a group of , obvious in their white lab coats
Among these is , who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two
At   ,   notices something on one of his own which monitor key locations inside The Cave
There's activity in the dormitory
and one of her assistants,  , a younger girl, move over to the video console
there shows what looks like a prison corridor
run down both sides
We can see the distinct    in the corridor reacts instantly stepping over to   and pressing  - (o
s
- filter) Gate twenty-three
This is Mary Henried
Did anyone enter the dormitory
(o
s
- filter) Yes, ma'm
Captain Rhodes
clicks off, infuriated
She hurries towards   followed by 81
- :
wearing pulls    out of a bag by its hair
It's the head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon
The hand belongs to  himself
In the darkness of  ,     takes a hesitant step forward
tries to shove   through the bars but When  lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder height
Take it, friend
Take it
It's a present
From me to you
steps forward and lays its hand on
Just remember who gives you favours
pulls hard and   pops through onto its side of the bars
The creature lurches off towards   in the shadows at the rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to   , ,   hungrily
On the cell door we notice   with a number (5) and, written in marker, the Red Coat's nickname, ""
moves past  , each holding
stands way back in the shadows
stands near the bars, growling
is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old who needs to pee
stops at   marked "
"
Inside we see  , tall, erect, not moving a muscle
grins
Well, Bub
've heard about you
Miss Henried's pride and joy
steps closer and  snarls warningly
Surly sonofabitch
want to make friends, Bub
Friends
have one more goodie in my sack here
,   interrupts
turns to see
82
- have entered through send up
The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass
Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into marked "
"
is nibbling on
Much of the flesh is already gone, but we can still recognise
The zombie turns the thing up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out grey matter
backs away, fighting nausea
spasm rises in ' stomach as well and she reels away from the hideous sight
Come, come, Miss Science
You've seen worse
God
damn you, Rhodes
God has damned us all
Are my atrocities worse than yours
You have ruined weeks of work here
We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat
No wonder they're so
hungry
Suddenly  , her hands flying to her mouth
is still dangling from '
Inside, pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of causing the whole bag to wiggle
drops the bag instantly to the floor
Taking care, he grabs the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard '      , , ,
stares in shock
runs towards the exit, trying to scream but gagging on her own acids
She's hysterical
calmly draws his , cocks, and by the powerful bullet
83
'     - 9  12  with    , There's   on the wall displaying -
guides   into a chair
stands cockily in the open doorway
didn't realise
Those were de-caps didn't know that
de-caps
revived
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive
But
we bury the heads
Oh
God
It must be torture for them
They are brutes without feeling
Though admit that 've requested cremation for myself
Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was
To say nothing of the
spacing problem
on a small island like this
thought the purpose of decapitation was to
to
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much
food
as possible
The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side
The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal
The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper
Keep them fed and they behave
Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been
You saw them in there
You gave them a fresh taste of blood
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried
They want human flesh
'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine
Not while 'm still using it
has calmed herself down
Now she feels angry, betrayed
She looks at  accusingly
Did you know
About the de-caps
'd never seen it before
But you knew
nods in the affirmative
Tears form in ' eyes
What else is there, doctor
What else do you people know that the rest of us don't
They stare at one another
Whatever bond once existed between them has been severed forever
84
- There are ,
, On  lie for dexterity testing
There are  -  on the walls, ,  and familiar
storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her catches it with his
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science
You can't even run away from the island, heh heh
Leave me alone, you
laughs loudly
faces him, hatred boiling away her vocabulary
She can't think of word that are adequate
You're
you're disgusting
You're
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, ' hope it'll never actually be used'
is stopped
by her own guilt
She turns and busies herself gathering books and papers, then she     and moves toward the doorway where  stands
(calmer, with method) Julie Grant is a behaviouralist
She's not medical
She hasn't been as
exposed to
to things
as some of the rest of us
She'll be alright
'll talk to her
She'll be alright
Oh,  have no doubt
(recognising threat in his voice) If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight 'll go to Dickerson
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately
understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice
The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat
(reading his jealousy) Rhodes, you and had a roll in the hay together when  first got here
It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which  do not want to, and which  never will repeat
So give up, mister
'm going home
to that roommate you mentioned
pushes past  into the hallway
85
- starts down the hall but  grabs her from behind
He leans in close, lusting, pressing his lips against the back of her neck
Take your hands off me
Right now
An evil grin returns to ' flushed face
He stares at the woman for a long moment, then he lets go
walks away, bristling
calls after her
Maybe you'll change your mind when it starts getting too lonely for you
stops dead
She turns back to see him gloating
'm not entirely without influence myself, Miss Science
had your roommate assigned
by Gasparilla
to my platoon
What's his name
Tyler
Yes
Toby Tyler
bubble of fear pushes up in ' throat but she is only letting her anger show
Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers
had an unfortunate little run-in with him today
In fact
you might say that Mr
Tyler is in big trouble with the
authorities
You better not mess with me, Rhodes
'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch
Think about it
No, Miss Science
You're the one who needs to do some thinking
He turns and walks away
stands still for a time, '   surrounding her, swallowing her
In the we can
86
- : as  walks through We are stunned at the enormity of the place back and forth
Storage areas hold   , ,
shift loads from here to there
comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made walls
She enters past   , showing her
87
- moves down   with   on both sides
We ,  ,  , ,
move by
are fighting
She slaps him, he punches her, she kicks him in the balls
pound on a door
The door is opened by       on his nose
, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke- filled room
stops in her tracks when she sees that outside 83 (the door to her quarters) there are   '  with in hand
The door itself is open and  move inside
turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through the hallway
As she turns a corner she is grabbed by
Toby
thank God
wait here
gotta find out what's goin' on
Hey
Slow down
What is it
Some of Rhodes' men
At the door
That bastard
didn't think he'd make his move so fast
It's because of me
Oh, bullshit, Mary
It's because Rhodes is a prick
want you to leave
Then maybe
We're both gonna leave
Leave the island
've been talkin' to Tricks
We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts
They're crated up real small
They've got air canisters
There's food inside
Even a little motor
am not
a guerilla fighter, Toby
'm not a pioneer
'm not
'm not strong that way
need
Need what
Civilised order like we have down here
Christ
can work here
Maybe my work can help
help everyone
can do more good with access to this equipment than  can off in some wasteland
For the good of mankind
That's what every monster-maker says
looks into ' eyes
She's hurt, yet angry
The kind of anger that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive guilt-nerve
We're gettin' out
Me and Tricks
want you to come with us
want that more than anything
'll send word
'll let you know a time and a place to meet
We probably won't be able to wait around so if you're not there on the dot
well
if you're not there, 'll know you're not comin'
She grabs him, holding him tightly against her
They kiss, hard and long
pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts toward the guarded apartment
follows
(walking)  don't know what they're gonna do to me
figure they'll just send me out to Stalag Seventeen but if
if it's worse than that
Tricks will know
Stay in touch with Tricks
As they approach the door to number 83,   there raise their  to ready positions
You Tyler
Yes
You're under arrest
'll take your weapon
hands over his  and begins to unbuckle his appear from inside the open apartment
What's he supposed to have done
What are the charges
Dunno, ma'm
We're on orders
Look
'm Mary Henried
'm with the special conditioning center
'm not without influence
(calmly) Mary
'll have somebody's ass for this
'll have your ass, soldier
'm not gonna stand here and
(more insistent)
She gives up
She looks into ' eyes
'll be alright
Just remember the things said
Take care of yourself
escort  down the hall without force
watches their backs for a time, then she flings her    angrily into the open apartment
She begins to cry
88
- is surrounded by   and, from it, runs off through the brush toward
we don't know what yet
and , along with   , also disarmed troopers, is led down that alleyway by
,    McDERMOTT peer out from nearby foliage
They watch the procession
John whispers
The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag Seventeen
That's where we live
That's where you gonna live, too
Hell's half acre
It's not a nice place
Them boys there is prisoners
What's their punishment
They sent out to the Stalag for a few weeks
That's punishment enough
seems to appear from nowhere
She motions and the others follow her through the thick jungle
89
- This one is We know this because we see    , mostly "civilians" with no vests, clambering there, send up wild    when are led through the gate
Inside the compound is    -  - , resembling those on ***
There's   coming off the place, a mixture of    that forms a disturbed blanket of noise
The place seems to seethe like a hornets' next
head back for The Cave as   shut the gate behind
and the other captives move toward the "village"
90
- wallow in the mud
has just taken a shit and is wiping his ass
Nearby   lies unconscious
are fighting
It's a brutal fight with
The men are really hurting each other in wide open disarray
plants herself right in ' path
How 'bout it, baby
'm big but 'm beautiful

He grabs  and flings him violently against an upright on one of the long huts
move on, abandoning , disappearing into the crowd
pulls  , - ,
' Suddenly  rises in the man's throat and he doubles over
is aware of  behind him
At his back, in the hut,    , still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam- bamming  , who is wearing everything but underwear and boots
There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as though she's been beaten brutally
She purses her deep red, damaged lips and blows  a kiss that's meant to be seductive
moves on down the street
The place is a cesspool full of human dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of man in his last days

-  fill the air like flashbulbs
This is home, darlin'
Home for us that don't make the grade
Us that ain't
good enough to live inside The Cave
We grow a little food, do a little light manufacturin'
like these here vests, we make these for the massers
We live in our own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease and jungle fever
all the time waitin' to become breakfast for the Bees
is doing a sales job on  but everything he says is truth
She hears it all, softening to ' cause
has silently lifted     out of the weeds
It's a camouflaged tunnel entrance
It's a tunnel
It's a couple hundred yards

When he pulls it out,   as the motor winds down

He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit mad
And he looks as ill as some of his patients
There are on his face and he hasn't shaved for days
He's covered with two week worth of
He starts around the table leaving to dispose of the "-"
Bury the head
Call the guard for the rest
Get it off the table for now
We'll bring this new one in

He's heard something
What is it
The tunnel

He looks at his watch

It's almost sun-up

They remove in the floor
' head pops out, gasping for air
Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened
Who are you
Who are you
He stands up too quickly
Dizziness makes him reel
He smashes into , comes up with  -  and holds the thing threateningly aimed at the stranger
It's
It's , Doc
She's with us
In the next moment,  and the others climb out of the tunnel
This here's the hospital
That's Diesel over there, the big guy
This here's Lukey and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut your tonsils out
, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins collecting , what few the rebels have
This here's all the weapons we got
That's why your fancy automatic looks so good to us
We gotta stick it over here with the others for now
They catch us with any kind o' weapon and its death without even askin' your name

Let's go
You look like you could use some shut eye
Me too
We can all get acquainted tomorrow

McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask
McDERMOTT Doc,  need a fill up
'll help m'self if it's alright with you
nods distractedly and  moves to    which contains, among other essentials,
He fills his flask eagerly
How do we know she's alright
How do we know
McDERMOTT She's alright
Christ, Rhodes and his cossacks wiped out her whole party
Dan near got her
McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask, takes a long slug from the cabinet bottle before putting it back, and moves out of the room
is left alone with
How do we know she's alright
How do we know
repeats his question, intoned identically as it was before
He's twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face suddenly seems
Are you alright, Doc
You look
you look real bad
have looked bad for four years
Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years
Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did

The others follow

This just ain't your day, is it, darlin' Sarah
can't help but snicker
Suddenly her head spins exhaustion is conquering her body as last
puts a big arm around her
Three more minutes
Then you can sleep
You gotta stay with it for three more minutes
McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain waddles back through the maze of cots
,    have moved to about the center of the big room
The patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs
How do we know she's alright
How do we know
The same intonation again
This guy's wrapping is definitely coming loose
rises up behind ' back
It's the woman whose wrist Lukey checked earlier
Its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands reaching out wantingly
turns around
Calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake, he shoots out the hand that's holding '
pulls it out and strikes again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, thrusting
Finally the creature collapses
wipes the scalpel on his already blood-covered apron
drops onto him from holes in the roof above

McDERMOTT escort speaks softly, and only when others on the street are far enough away
They supply us with disinfectant and dope
Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll
What more could anyone ask for
Most around here ain't interested in changin' their lives
The folks you met
me and them and a couple others is the whole rebel army
Nobody else gives a shit
and they're afraid o' Rhodes
They pass       that reads: ' If there were walls they'd be pushed out by the inside
and  form a wall of noise louder than the
spills out onto the muddy street, selling all sort of delights accost  and his group
They seem to be havin' a good time
Some punishment
You disappear in here, darlin'
You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins
You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice
Rhodes, he counts on that
It all makes for food in the freezers
They come to       that reads:
This is your hotel
'm not gonna stay here with you but 'll always be close
You gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you said you was able to do
nods
smiles at her
His warm, trustworthy eyes seem to glow in the dark
Some may notice that you're new
Just deny it
You'll get away with it
Nobody really looks at each other around here
Go on in
Get some sleep
He squeezes her hand tightly, then he turns away and moves off with McDERMOTT

Tired of     he's working on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on ' plate
He snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth
As soon as he tastes it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting disgustedly

He moves it to his mouth and pops it in
Alright
Way ta go, Kemosabe

She pulls up and watches with a kind of dubious interest
stops chewing
He looks up with exaggerated sadness on his face
Slowly his mouth opens and the chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips
He throws his fork down angrily
They won't learn to use forks if they don't like the breakfast you're serving, Ted
The fork is like a game to them
If they get into the game maybe they'll learn to like the food
It won't work
Suddenly  jumps up from the table

Suddenly he grabs her
She pulls away and he crawls after her, his belly bouncing along the floor

He reaches for her blouse
It tears away and for a moment he gets a chubby handful of bare breast
