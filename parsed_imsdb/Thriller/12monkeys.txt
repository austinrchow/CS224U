The heavy door clangs shut behind him
He's alone

On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock

The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders

Cleared from quarantine
Thank you
You two wait outside
He's got a history, Doctor

You're not going to hurt us, are you Mr
Cole

No, sir
The  exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door
Why don't you sit down, Mr
Cole
goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down
We want you to tell us about last night

The  don't say anything
They just study him carefully
(worried) mashed the spider, didn't
We'll get to the spider later, Mr
Cole
Right now, we want to know everything that you saw

Where you collected sample #4, what street was that
Uh
It's important to observe everything
think it was
'm sure it was 2nd Street
As the  start to whisper animatedly among themselves, ' eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall
One headline screams, "
"  Another features a photo of an   (
, who we'll see again later on) and the words,  , "'    "

Startled,  closes his eyes obediently

But we  their

What does he look like, the man who just spoke
How old were you when you left the surface
The  blur into a cacophony and   the droning
at the airport

s
) Flight 784 now boarding at gate
Suddenly, a , followed by raised , interrupts the monotonous airport routine
As   and his  turn to see what's going on, a man we'll call
, his face averted, hurries past them, bumping   with a Chicago Hulls Sports Duffle Bag
sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates
Just then, a '  cries out, "
" turns back toward the Security Check Point just as scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running
, hitting the floor close by, looks up at   with panicky eyes, and asks
Just exactly why did you volunteer
/  - ( ) comes abruptly awake
Seated now, he's facing the
Wake up, Cole
Uh,  didn't hear the
(tapping a pencil on the table) asked you, why did you volunteer
Well, the guard woke me up
He told me volunteered
The  react, whispering urgently among themselves
starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as the  speaks to him
We appreciate you volunteering
You're a very good observer, Cole
Uh, thank you
You'll get a reduction in sentence
keeps his face impassive
To be determined by the proper authorities
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole
Have it taken away
No, sir
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people
An opportunity to reduce your sentence considerably
And possibly play an important role in returning the human race to the surface of the earth
We want tough minded people
Strong mentally
We've had some
misfortunes with "unstable" types
For a man in your position
an opportunity
Not to volunteer could be a real mistake
(tapping his pencil again) Definitely a mistake
gives away nothing
He's in a box here
He has no choices
He stares at the tapping pencil
- strikingly "real" world of bright colors
Extravagant paintings adorn the walls
, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an  of thirty seated on folding chairs
Still among the myriad microwaves, the infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally small, byte-sized now, tinier even than science lurking in some vague electricity where, if we listen we can hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us, "We are no other than a moving row Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold In Midnight by the Master of the show
" As the  reads, we  the audience, mostly or

) "The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it
" Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the looks up from the text just as , tumbling, shuts off the beeper and rises, embarrassed
As she makes her way to an exit, the glaring  continues
"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair: Drink

, and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses
Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff
All they got was his name
They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him
He's been tested for drugs
Negative for drugs
But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs
No drugs
You believe that

You have him in restraints
Were you listening
We got two officers in the hospital
Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse
Look at him
Still on his feet

In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly
That would explain the bruises, guess
The struggle
You want to go in
Examine him
Yes, please
You said he gave a name

That's everything we got
None of the James Coles on the computer match him
No license, no prints, no warrants
Nothing

My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that

And  want you to trust me
Can you do that, James
May call you "James"
"James"
Nobody ever calls me that

Have  seen you someplace
No, not possible
Listen,  have to get out of here

What kind of information
It won't help you
You can't do anything about it
You can't change anything

Do you know why you're here, James
Because 'm a good observer
Because have a tough mind

You don't remember assaulting a police officer

They wanted identification

What's wonderful about the air, James
It's so clean
No germs
You're afraid of germs

Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James
This is April, right
July
(sudden panic) July
Do you know what year it is
What year is it
What year do you think it is
1995
You think it's July of 1995
That's the future, James
Do you think you're living in the future
(slightly confused) No, 1995 is the past

This is 1989

Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says
It's very important

We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated
What are we for then
We're consumers
Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what
You're mentally ill
That's a fact

But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on
There was this one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played
He couldn't quite grasp the idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't just make it be yesterday for him, turn back time ha ha
What a fruitcake
This last thought actually penetrates ' focus on the  and he turns to  who's picking up speed again
Seriously, more and more people are being defined now as mentally ill
Why
Because they're not consuming on their own
But as patients, they becone consumers of mental health care
And this gives the so-called sane people work

You know what "crazy" is
"crazy" is "majority rules"
Take germs for example
Although  is preoccupied with the  struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"
Germs
In the 18th century there was no such thing
Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway
Along comes this doctor

He tries to convince people
other doctors mostly
that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you

He goes, " don't believe in germs
Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap

Hey, you believe in germs, don't you

Of course not,  never thought you were
You want to escape, right
That's very sane

You want me to, don't you
Get you out

Why don't  escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right
'Cause 'd be crazy to escape

Here's my theory on that
While  was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health
was interrogated, x-rayed, studied thoroughly
Then, everything about me was entered into a computer where they created a model of my mind
They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting
Is he serious
Is he crazy
Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic
(cont
) Then, using the computer model, they generated every thought  could possibly have in the next, say ten years, which they then filtered through a probability matrix to determine everything  was going to do in that period
So you see, she knew  was going to lead the Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the pages of history before it ever even occurred to me
She knows everything 'm ever going to do before  know it myself
How about that
