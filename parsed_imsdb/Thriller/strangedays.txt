by James Cameron & Jay Cocks from a story by James Cameron 11, 1993 -------------------------------------------------------------- 1:06   30, 1999 Blackness
We hear: Ready
() Yeah
Boot it
burst of bright white static exploding across the darkness
high whine on the audio track gives way to street sounds and rapid breathing
wavers and stabilizes:  nervous
We're in a car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front seat
Our  looks down at a    in "our" hands
red  is flashing
We slip the recorder into a coat pocket
Okay
It's goin'
'm recording
The guy riding shotgun, , is just pulling a pantyhose over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask
He turns,    , pissed off
Good one, dickhead
Thanks for waitin' till  get this fuckin thing on
You tryin' ta
me, or what
He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it
Our  looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up over our field of view
We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video
Real honest-to-God point of view, with no cuts, no music
This is not film, it is human experience
The driver is a Hispanic guy named ""
Lane is a white guy who looks very strung out
Couple of crackheads
The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald with primer
Next alley
just pull in slow
(turning to us) Hurry up will ya
Here
He hands us a big stainless steel revolver
The  looks down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the rounds, snap it closed
Diaz pulls the barge into an alley
The headlights illuminate overflowing dumpsters
Chicano busboy is making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which he has chocked open
The busboy goes back inside
Let's go
Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our ears
We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now
Through the door, after Lane, moving fast
Into the kitchen
Fluorescent glare
The busboy turning, surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face
Freezing him
Lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any language
Our hand puts the magnum in the  's face
We get them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with the shotgun
He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the front room
We hear voices as we approach the swing door
Go through
Whip pan left, then right
Scoping the layout
Low-rent place
Red wallpaper
Closing time
Middle-aged Thai , by the cash-register, counting money
Young Thai , cleaning up
They look up, stunned, as we put the gun on them
(shouting, edgy) Don't move, don't talk, don't do nothing
Our  is whipping around, from the front door to the owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he steps back from the cash-register
We scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred bucks in tens and fives
Now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up
Into the walk-in cooler
The steel door closes on four scared pair of eyes
looking around, seeing
a dish-rack
Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch
Locking them in
Lane heading out the back door
Laughing, as he looks at the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him
We follow Lane to the car
Snap a look down the alley one way, then the other
Shit
Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the alley
Heartbeat goes triple time
Scrambling into the car
Door not even closed and  has it in reverse, burning rubber as he launches back down the alley
The car grinds along one wall as  steers wildly backward
Sparks right next to us
Then-- As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out into the street
The cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us as  cranks the wheel and punches it down the street
He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between cars
We pull off the stocking to see better
The cop car surges onto the street behind us
Looking ahead
red light
Cars stopped, blocking the way
Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the cars, into the intersection
near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating
Another red light ahead
Don't stop
Truck entering the intersection
Everyone yelling cuts the wheel but too late
Clipping the truck and spinning
The street outside smearing past like the view from a Tilt-a-whirl
Then
Hitting something, God-knows-what, and launching up and over, and-- Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass
It gets quiet and still
Tinkling glass as Lane moves
Then  is screaming
The car is upside down
Crawling out of the side window
frenzy now
Whip pan to see the cops pulling up
Then whipping back to the wreck
The engine is burning
Flames spreading rapidly
inside, pinned, upside down, blood pumping across his face
Our hands pulling Lane out
He comes up running
We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness of an alley
Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody yelling
Gunshots
Looking back
Cops next to their car, firing
Ahead, Lane running into shadow
Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor
Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding the door open as we dive through into-- stairwell
Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time
Trying the door at the second floor landing
Locked
Shit
Running up
Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up
The  is finally broken by a
: But we don't know where we are yet
We see a man in extreme close-up: just his eyes and mouth
The eyes are closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is watching a movie in there
This is
This is great
the doors are all locked
Who are these losers, friends of yours
: as we reach the fifth floor landing
Lane is coming unglued as he finds this door locked
We look down, see cops coming two floors below
One cranks off a couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing
Pounding up the last flight
Finally
The door is unlocked
Blasting through it, behind Lane, onto the roof
Running all out past  units and pipes, air vents
Looking up: an  helicopter orbiting close
It flicks the xenon onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue daylight
Running along the edge of the roof
Looking down
Car burning upside down in the street below
The gas tank explodes, filling the street with orange light
We don't slow
We're running all out
(
) Wow
the gas tank is a nice touch
Oh, oh, end of the line boys
Ahead, in  we see the edge of the roof coming up
Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and separated by a 20 foot alley
But Lane doesn't slow down
He leaps across the void and makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl
We reach the edge and look down
Six stories
No ladders or fire-escapes
Whip to behind us
Cops running across the roof
Come on
Fucking jump man
The  backs up from the edge and then runs toward it
Out into the void
Moving
airborne
then
Right into the parapet wall
Slipping down
Brick wall right in our face
Bloody fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along the edge
Looking down
feet dangling over a sixty foot drop
cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below, oblivious
Breathing raspy
Snapping a look up as the pipe gives way
keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up but
Snapping a look down-- Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy scream-- Ground rushing up-- Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and running out of the way as-- Pavement fills frame
burst of violent red light
Sound like a gunshot
but no echo
Only silence
And blackness
: Lit by miles of fluorescent
Empty and echoing
Close on Lenny
He has something on his head
Something that looks like a mutated set of Walkman headphones, except they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples and over the forehead
""
Lenny whips off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched
Goddamnit
You know  don't deal in snuff
How many times  hafta tell you
Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "", a pale- skinned creature of the night in -shirt and leather jacket
Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground of the near future
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny
Well you could've at least warned me
You know  hate the zap
when they die
It just brings down your whole day
Jeez, Tick
Sorry
is low thirties
Handsome
Charming
And you better check to see if you still have your ring after you shake with him
He is wearing an expensive Italian jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie
" His Rolex isn't real
His greasy hair is too long and curls around his collar
He needs to shave
little sleazy
But he has energy, and heavy street smarts
Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97  1035i
Tick is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit 70's van
There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled inside the van
Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to him, like a drug dealer
In fact the whole setup looks like a drug deal, but it's not
Though it is illegal
The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes, and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals
They are about the size of  tapes, and hold about 30 minutes of sensory experience
everything a person sees, hears, and feels
recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at the moment it is happening
How'd you get the tape
Why didn't the cops put it in evidence
With all the blood  guess they didn't see the rig
Guy had it under a wig
Yeah, but how'd it get to you
got ways, Lenny,  got ways
(off Lenny's impatient look) Okay, okay
got a deal with some a the paramedics
My guy pages me and  pick it up at the morgue
So whaddya think
This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand
Right
Tick
Not to dash your hopes, but don't deal this kind of product, you know that
'll give you four for it, cause 've gotta cut off the last bit
And my customers want uncut
Fuck that
The last part's the best
You dry-dive six stories and blammo
Jack right into the Big Black
don't deal black-jack clips
It's policy
got ethics here
Yeah, when did that start
Come on, man
It's what people want to see, and you know it
So lay it off to somebody else
Come on, Lenny
got expenses got to get this rig fixed
Look at it
Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized stainless steel   , the record deck we saw earlier in the
Also in the bag is the , a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the human head (this is different from playback trodes)
The whole works are covered with congealed blood
Give me six at least
This's a good clip, here
Gets you pumpin'
Yeah, well, the first part's okay
Better than the usual soaps you bring me
Now that is cold, Lenny
always bring you choice
Lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet, pulling out a tape
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend
it's a test-pattern
Nothing happens
'm snorin'
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life
Bring me street life
And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor
' said that
Look, 'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer
Ha
That's for fucking sure
What else you got
: / Lenny in his , driving through the  streets
Streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a calligraphy of light
Lenny works the cellular, gets messages on his  , weaves in and out of traffic -- punches the buttons on his radio, changing stations all the time
Raw, nervous energy: like a kid who can't stay still
It's a hard hustle in the big food chain
Look, Jerr
'm nothing if not a man of my word
'll drop the money by tomorrow, next day latest
It's a little crazed right now
Yeah, on my mother's eyes,  swear
Thanks, buddy
(hangs up) Prick
(to the car ahead honking) What kinda move you call that
Lemmings
Lenny turns up the radio
- , as the talk-radio provides commentary
Lenny's car passing under glowing Santa Clauses on the light-poles
Banners proclaiming the coming "Millennium " festivities
- it's a little after 2 am on December 30th, 1999
the second to last day of the whole darn century, and the phone lines are open
Dan from Silverlake, you're on the air
Transition to a rougher section of town
Buildings roll by endlessly, tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns
some are burnt-out ruins
Uh, hi
So Dan, are you looking forward to the New Year
building is burning out of control
In the foreground, silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus-bench
Not really
mean what's the point
Nothing changes New Years day
The economy sucks, gas is over three bucks a gallon, fifth grade kids are shooting each other at recess
the whole thing sucks, right
So what the hell are we celebrating
shanty-camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass
Homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants
Their lives in shopping carts
You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of guy, aren't you Dan
Well  for one happen to think that us making it 2000 years is worth celebrating-- Lenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and blasts
Something fast
a rap-metal hybrid
Anger and energy
fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance, Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter
Cops in riot gear, with -16s, on patrol in a Hispanic neighborhood
coming out of a bar with a nervous businessman
We don't hear the conversation
Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit jacket
Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away
Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the number
Ahead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint
The cops have thrown a block across the street and are shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through
Lenny slaps his  against the side window with one hand, not missing a beat in his conversation
This is just part of life in
(on cellular) Jimbo
'm there, Jimmy
Right now, can't you hear me knockin'
working his way through a crowded club, music pounding
Strobe lights
We don't see much
He hears his phone rings and pulls the tiny   out of his breast pocket
Sticks a finger in his other ear and answers
, back in the , on the streets
On the move
-- so you line up the talent, shoot the clip, get it to me by Monday
Client wants a guy and two girls, the guy wears
yeah, know, thinks he's being original
Girls have to be young
So don't use your mother like you usually do
Yeah, you too, pendejo
And no big tits
French tits
That's it
like Champagne glasses
you got it
What a pro
Page me
to the security checkpoint of a gated community
The white upper-middle class hiding behind walls and paid security
If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd know that there won't be another thousand years
Right now we are in the Last Days, as foretold in the book of-- The Last Days
You mean the coming of the Apocalypse, right
The Rapture
Lenny fishes around in the glove compartment, flipping through about twenty plastic security passes for different parts of town, all bogus
He finds the right one and flips it onto the dash
Yes, that's right
You only have to look at the signs
there are wars and rumors of wars-- The    at the guardshack hits him with his light
(lying) live here
The cop waves him through
Lenny is the right color
Now just so the rest of us know how much time is left, when is the Rapture supposed to hit, exactly
Is it midnight New Year's Eve
And   to a burst of news videotape, enlarged, noisy, distorted
images of a great gathering in the desert, the faithful waiting for God's sign as the millennium approaches
Is that midnight  time, or Eastern Standard or what
mean, what time zone is God in, anyway
pray for you all
Lenny's  cruises past an overturned burning car
There is no-one around
He barely glances at it
Common sight these days
If it is the end of the world, Lenny's not going to let it break his rhythm
(cellular) just got something in, Bobby, you might appreciate
211 at a Thai joint goes south, and these three scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run
It's a beauty, two thumbs up
Parental discretion advised
'm talking it's the master, not some stepped-on copy
One of a kind
He slides into a booth with , a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses too young
pretty, stoned-looking girl is leaning against Skinner
Yo, Skinner
The Skin Man
(fingering his jacket) Red leather
Nice feminine touch
(laughing) Fuck you, Nero
Whattya got for me
:  of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy
Lovemaking in point-of-view
We look down, see  , a woman's body
our hands moving over the other woman's torso
The image is dark, a primal impression
Sound of harsh breathing, rustling sheets
in the booth with Skinner
Lenny has Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his belt, next to his pager
He is hunched over the table, "sampling" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset
Like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail
Yeah,  can use this
(to the stoned girl) but honey you gotta move your eyes slower next time
It's too jerky
It was her first time, Lenny
Cut her some slack
:  tapes and money changing hands
tape sliding sensuously into a deck
, through the windshield of his car
Neon moving over him
:  Aerospatiales circling, their xenon lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a futuristic war zone
, the infrared camera shows green-screen images of people in cars, in their homes
like footage of hyenas shot at night in total darkness
The impression is of a society under siege, an occupied nation
a watched society where the camera eye and the police spotlight define our reality
Go ahead, caller, you're on the air
My name's DeWayne, and  got a New Year's resolution for the po-lice
Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down with 2-
Unit cops with a bunch of Salvadoran gang kids racked up against a storefront
dozen 16 year-old girls and guys, hands against the wall, acting bored, as the cops walk up and down, reading IDs
2-
What's that DeWayne
group of cops have two black guys proned out
Nearby a crowd jeers, shouting insults
black kid throws a beer bottle and one of the cops chases him into the crowd
2-
The big two thousand
Comin tomorrow night
Out with the old and in wit da new
See for the Man, no new is good new, what 'm sayin
He like to keep it the way it is
But we going to take it, make it new, make it our own
History gonna start right here, right now-- cuts him off as his cellular call connects
Hi, Dave, this is Lenny
(pause) Nero
Lenny Nero
That's right
Oh, is it late
Sorry
It's just that  have something that might be of interest, and since  always call you first-- (pause) Uh, huh
Well, what would be a good time
Okay, sure
Catch you then
: Light and noise as the customers drop quarters for synthetic thrills
Lenny is talking to a nice-looking street kid in his early 20's named
Let me get this straight
you gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a hair net and bang some beautiful babe
don't know,  gotta think about this
Lenny smiles and pulls out a -net
He motions Eduardo into the shadows
Okay, let's get you wired up hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors
What's all this squid shit
As Lenny works, fitting the network of sensors over Eduardo's head, he holds class
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device
Got it
There's gonna be a test
Hey, fuck you, man
Easy, Eduardo, easy
Preserve a sense of humor at all times
Okay, the receptor rig
what 'm putting on your head
sends a signal to the recorder
(Lenny holds up the recorder) See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire
You gotta keep the recorder close
five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what  mean
Yeah, right
Lenny fits a wig from his briefcase over Eduardo's head, turning him into a headbanger
Eduardo scowls at this set-back to his suavete
Some tips
Don't dart your eyes around
Don't look in the mirror or you'll  yourself
You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event
But don't wait too long,  don't want to be going out for popcorn
And don't act natural
Don't act at all
Just forget the thing is on
Got it
No problem
star is born
: - woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train track at night
The woman has no shoes, her feet bare
stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe pointlessly to her chest
She is swearing and crying, runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale face
Despite this we see that she is attractive, though her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt sexiness
Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane of curly red hair
She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her life has just begun to harden her features
She looks lost and without hope, in fear of her life
Her breath comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild
She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking behind her frequently
police helicopter is circling
Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over the cars
She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car as the beam passes over
Looking under the cars she sees an  patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her
It moves on
She continues her run, moving away from the direction of the patrol car
She reaches a chain-link fence
Crying, she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her dress
Another patrol car passes two blocks away
She crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of sight
: - Iris sprints down an alley between buildings
Rats scatter into the shadows ahead of her
She doesn't seem to notice
All she cares about are the police lights, and the sound of the helicopter droning, circling
She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well- lit street beyond
There are people here: downtown low- life street people
half-block away is a brightly lit sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station
She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign, feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding
She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely glance at her
on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes and boots of winter
the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block, behind her
are  , who are scanning the street
They look intense
Revved up
They are  , a massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties, and  , an aggressive hard-on in his twenties with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a ferret
She's a hooker, vice'll have her in the book
We can pick her up later
No
Now
knows the cops are behind her
She is terrified to turn
Finally she can't stand it any more
She breaks into a run
The patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring after her
Iris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track runner
The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to her and the cops jump out
Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full- tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose groceries go flying
: Iris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the filthy tile floor, and comes up running
Panting with fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a hurdler
The cops pound down the stairs two at a time
Spreg draws his 9mm
In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness
a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey
Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them
They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop and his boy wonder
The two cops reach the platform
No Iris in sight
as they slow to a walk, scanning couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains, eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover
(
) Do you request back-up
Negative
Suspect is a black male, age 35 to 40
We're handling it
train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air few people board
There is only the sound of the cops' footsteps as they move along the empty platform
With a pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close
Suddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a full sprint
Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes, thundering along the platform to intercept her
Engelman straight-arms his pistol
Iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut
Her momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling
She gasps for breath and looks up to see
Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she just came through as the train starts to move
He tries to force the doors apart
can't
He aims his gun through the window
Thinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and presses herself up against the solid wall next to the door, where he can't see her
, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train
He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt
Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her
He is still running alongside, pulling on her
Trying to drag her right out through the window
She struggles
Bites his beefy hand
He swears and lets go
Then makes one last grab
Gets his fingers into her long mane of hair
Yanks on her
She comes half out the window, screaming
Then
The hair pulls off her head
Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a red wig
He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol and fires at Iris
She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor
couple of shots hit the metal outside
We see Iris has short hair, platinum white
In it are a few of the many pins which held the wig securely in place
She gasps for air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over
on the platform, watching the train disappear, as Engelman runs up
Spreg looks at the wig in his hand, disgusted
He turns it and looks inside, at the cap
inside the wig: there is an intricate network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of the wig
The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal box, the size of a cigarette case
It is a
Iris was wired
Spreg just stares at the  , eyes going crazy wide
Oh shit

'  - ' 4
Lenny trudges through a heavy security gate into the center court of his ratty building
The pool furniture is in the pool
Gang graffiti marks the walls
Bars on all the windows
One of the doors looks like somebody opened it with an ax
The pool lights give the place an eerie, dead glow
Can out slick Lenny really live in this dump
Through a barred window we see Lenny approaching as we hear the   on his answering machine in the And
(
) Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be there, you got to help me, come on, pick up, pick up
Through the window we see Lenny fishing in his pocket for his keys
: - Iris at a pay phone in the cold of an all-night gas station
you got to be there for me
Shit, 'll call later
: ' As Lenny unlocks the door, all he hears is Iris' "'ll call later
" He picks up the phone as the connection breaks
: - Iris continues to grip the phone even after she has hung up
She looks desolate, without hope
: ' doesn't stop to play back Iris' message, or any of the twenty others on his machine
He just deadbolts the door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then carries his Haliburton
toward the bedroom
And we see the truth of his reality
Lenny's crib is a shit-box
It is a small one- bedroom, barely furnished
couple of chairs
Swap-meet couch
Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a table, cables strung everywhere
God knows what this stuff is
There is aluminum foil taped to all the windows
Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes everywhere
The bachelor apartment from hell
High-tech low-life
He goes into the bedroom
Mattress on the floor
Same infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated by racks of tapes
Squid tapes
Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes off his clothes and hangs them over a chair
He sits on the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed
This is the private Lenny: No plans
No dreams
Nothing to look forward to but another day of the hustle
He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head, fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes, squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say "
" Only the dates are different
He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some minute adjustments
Sips his vodka
Leans back
Closes his eyes
And hits
/ : We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a on Rollerblades
By our motion, it is obvious that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well
The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking up at our discomfort
We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we realize the  is his
The girl takes our hands, skating backward, towing us along the boardwalk
It is a sunny afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all around us
The woman is  , a singer
Lenny is desperately in love with her
It's not hard to see why
She is beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way
Her hair is a wild dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular
intense
She moves with a lithe, sinuous grace
We are staring at her eyes instead of concentrating on skating
Whammo
The  spins and we are sitting, looking up at Faith as she circles, laughing
She skates over to help us up
, on his bed, smiling
He punches Fast Forward
kinetic blur of digital hash, then
We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the steps to a beach apartment
Inside it is funky and comfortable
Music from a disk player she left on
Bob Marley singing "Three Little Birds"
Faith, covered with a sheen of sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom
We follow her
She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts to dry off
Sunlight comes in the window lighting up Faith like she is in a spotlight
We move up behind her and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser
He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the music
He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her sweaty belly
Then leans down and licks the sweat off her shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he can replay and relive the moment
Their eyes meet in the mirror
They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her halter and caresses her nipples
She moans softly, responding
She turns to him, and our  shifts directly to her
She is right in front of us, in
The intimacy is power
(laughs) Hey, you going to watch or you going to do
Watch and see
We lean toward her, until her eyes fill frame as they close in a kiss
We (Lenny) keeps ours open
Our hands pull her halter over her head
Then she pulls up on Lenny's -shirt, laughing
We see it go over our eyes, blocking the view for a moment
Then Faith kisses Lenny's bare chest
We are looking down at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as Faith kisses lower, kneeling in front of us, unbuckling our belt and we-- in the here and now
Lost in playback memory bliss
He inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically recorded pleasure
Lenny pulls Faith up to his face, kissing her, then pushing her gently to the bed, where we lie down together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled sheets
She looks up, right at us
love your eyes, Lenny
(she touches our eyelids) love the way they see
, lost in the swirl of sensation
He touches his tongue to his fingertip
we look down at Faith as we enter her
She gasps and closes her eyes, grabbing the headboard with both hands
There is only the sound of gasping breaths, the creaking bed frame
She rocks with the rhythm of our thrusts, borne away by the intensity until she cries out
, reliving the past, under the electrodes
He reacts to the past orgasm
The tape ends, Lenny slowly takes off the trodes
There is a tiny tear at the corner of his eye
: ' / 2:14 ,  30 Lenny cracks an eye as the Sony 35" blinks on in alarm mode: news flashes of the day before New Year's Eve
police preparations for the epic Millennium
shebang downtown, the National Guard doing riot prep, etc
Sunlight comes like lasers through holes in the aluminum foil over the windows
Lenny goes to the kitchen in his underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle
Good morning
The  screen shows a murder scene with cops milling around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the ground
It cuts to a file photo of a severe-featured black man
bodies of two men found early this morning under the Hollywood freeway have been identified as rap star Jeriko One and bandmember James Polton, known to fans as "Replay"
third body, that of a woman, has not yet been identified
With his band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko One's outspoken political stance and violent lyrics have stirred nationwide controversy
:  little later
Lenny sucks on the popsicle while he puts the night's wardrobe together
This is a ceremony he observes carefully
Suit laid out on the bed, shirt beneath the jacket
Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble -- well, maybe -- tries another -- that's the one
: Lenny, behind the wheel of the
He is revved up, his look dialed-in
He's on the move
Seizing the day
(on cellular) You know  can get you anything you want, anytime you want it, just not right now
We'll hook up at the club later
Around eleven
Yeah
Lenny wheels into a parking lot, finds a space, grabs his Haliburton and steps out, heading for the front door of the Coral Lounge
: The decor is sort of Polynesian
Goofy tropical motif murals on the walls
The place has a mixed bag of customers, including upwardly mobile low-lifes who have graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office
It is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure cooker
Lenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a number of the early regulars
We get the impression he knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes
He leans on the bar
Hey, Lenny
Anything without an umbrella
He gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket: Fabrizio
Lenny my man,  think you want to meet a friend of mine
Lenny follows Fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed  power- casual, sitting at a booth across the room
Looks like money to me
Lenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows Fabrizio across the room
Don't forget your friends
10 percent, Fabri, like always
They slide into the booth with
Keith, this is Lenny
Guy  was telling you about
He can get you anything you-- (cutting him off) Just a second
Not to be rude, Keith, but  got to ask, are you a cop
understand
No, 'm not
You understand
Attorney
Right
Am  right
That's right
Lenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the table
Tassel shoes
Entertainment law, would be my guess
(off the guy's scowl) Relax
just like to guess, is all
It's my job to know people and what they want
what's behind their eyes
Lenny gives people their heart's desire
Ain't that right, Lenny
That's right
My second question gotta ask, so we get our bearings here
have you ever jacket in
Have you ever wiretripped
No
(a winning grin) virgin brain
Well we're going to start you off right
So what do you know about this
Save us some time
(shrugs) Just what 've read
That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire
And now it's gone black market
So, uh, do  get the deck from you
'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost
since my thing is the software
Clips
That's right
Clips
(Lenny leans in, working the guy) Look,  want you to know what we're talking about here
This isn't like only better
This is life
It's a piece of somebody's life
Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex
You're there
You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it
feeling it
What kind of things exactly
Exactly anything
Whatever you want
Whoever you want to be
(handing Fabrizio a twenty) Fabri, get us another round, would you
Fabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar
You want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can
But 'm assuming a guy like you, you wanna go skiing you fly to Aspen
That's not what you're interested in here
It's about the stuff you can't have
right
The forbidden fruit
Keith nods, mesmerized by Lenny
Like running into a liquor store with a
357 magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins
Or
(pointing discreetly) see that guy, with the drop-dead Philipino girl friend
(Keith looks) Wouldn't you like to be that guy for twenty minutes
The right twenty minutes
can make it happen
And you won't even tarnish your wedding ring
Keith touches his ring self-consciously, then grins
(hooked like a carp) Sounds good
can get you what you want
You just have to talk to me
'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls
'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious
You say it, you even think it, you can have it
You want a girl, you want two girls
don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about
you want a guy
You want to be a girl
see what that feels like
You want a nun to tie you up
It's all doable
(flushed, sweating, ready) Talk to me about costs, here
Listen, before we get into numbers, want you to try a taste
got a deck with me
What
Right Here
(grinning) Step into my office
: /' Close on Keith's face, as he sits on the sink counter reacting to a Squid tape
He jerks
his mouth drops open
he gasps
His hands start to move over his body, feeling it wonderingly
He gasps again, tilts his head down, moans
and Lenny hits Pause on the Playback
Keith opens his eyes to a grinning Lenny
You were just an eighteen year old girl taking a shower
Are you beginning to see the possibilities here
: / figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit
She tries the door of the car: locked
She looks toward the Coral Lounge, debates whether to go look for Lenny
Better not
She takes a Squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a note on the label: "
" She drops the tape through a 2-inch gap in Lenny's sun roof
and it bounces off the seat, onto the floor
She looks through the windshield, totally distraught, trying to see where the tape landed
and sees the reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street
She crouches next to the , trying to blot herself out
And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground, crying, afraid to move
: man in his late 30s: longish hair, no shave since the weekend, army jacket bulking over a massive frame daunting figure as he approaches the bartender
() Where is he
Bobby, the bartender, cocks his eye toward the restrooms
: / Lenny unlocks the men's room door and walks down the dingy corridor with her new customer, Keith
Yeah, 'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public
(grinning) You nervous
Forget it
The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me-- Behind them, the door of the women's bathroom whips open and the guy in the army jacket grabs Lenny from behind and him face-first into the wall, jamming a
45 against his skull
() Don't move
That's it, assume the position you miserable techno-perv puke
Cop style, the man in the army jacket kicks Lenny's feet apart
Starts to cuff him
(to Keith) Beat it fuckwad
Ash-white, Keith lays a smoke trail down the hall
On the main floor of the club, Fabrizio sees him splitting and hurries after him
Back in the corridor, Lenny spins around and shoves his attacker against the opposite wall
The guy offers no resistance
In fact, he's too weak from laughing
() Gotcha
Damnit, Max,  was with a client
You think that's funny
To mess with a man's livelihood
It's not funny
You see the look on that preppy puke's face
Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders
(laughing a little) Okay
It was funny
But it cost me money
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks
And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal
You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring
Let me buy you a drink
Least you can do
Max Peltier, which he mispronounces "Pelcher", slings his arm fraternally over Lenny's shoulder
They cross to the bar
Max roars greetings to several regulars, pushing between strangers like an out of control tractor
Yo, Pelcher
Mad Max
Fuckin'  right 'm mad
might kill every man in here
But first 'm buyin' my buddy here a drink
(seeing another regular) Hey 'Neal
You were right, your wife does give good head
Max lurches onto a barstool and hunches there like a misanthropic bear, pounding the bartop
Bobbyyyy
Tequila por favor
Double shots
Make it Tres Generaciones, huh
Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad
Hey, nice tie
Thanks, Max
'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe
That's not sayin' much
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle
Max raises his double shooter
To the jungle
Where outa the blue some shitbird can cap you in the back of the head and ruin your whole day
He downs it in two fierce gulps
You were lucky, Max
Yup
So darn lucky
wake up with a
22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension  can't live off of
Good thing  wasn't any luckier
Bobby
Another shooter right here
Bobby pours for Max
You seen Faith lately
Lenny reacts visibly to the name, his whole demeanor sagging
Naw
She won't call me
Just as well, Lenny
You gotta get past it
mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre
Thanks, Max
'm touched by your concern
: Iris, working her way from the front door, staying on the fringe of the crowd, wary, moving toward Max and Lenny at the bar
just hate to see you pining away
It makes me want to vomit, frankly
(philosophically) Broken hearts are for assholes
(seeing Iris) Hey, Iris, you okay
Lenny,  got to talk to you, it's serious
(looking at her face) What happened, honey, some john get rough on you
(to Lenny) mean talk private
Please, 'm in trouble, and so is Faith
(as Lenny reacts to the name) There it is, the magic fuckin' word
Lenny takes Iris by the arm and pulls her away from the bar
Can we go to your car
There's something you have to see right away
He nods and steers her toward the front door of the Coral Lounge
What's going on
: /  - Lenny and Iris come out the front door
It's a bad situation
if they get me  know they're going to -- She bridles like a startled horse
Lenny looks at what she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot
Must be the cops
He turns back
She's gone
What the hell
He looks back at the red light
and edges around the corner to see what the cops are up to
It's not a cop car
It's a tow-truck, with Lenny's  on the hook
Lenny runs to the  , who looks like a biker only meaner
Hang on, that's my car-- Not anymore
Belongs to the bank
Hey wait a second
Ignoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift, and Lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm
The guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a
38 in Lenny's face
Oh, yeah, that's the answer
Two million years of human evolution and that's the best idea you can come up with
(driver continues with the hoist) Okay
Look, whattya get to repo a car
Two hundred
Two fifty
'll pay you three fifty, right now
All you gotta do is drop it off the hook and say you came by, your mark wasn't here
Simple
Make a few bucks
Do a good deed
Huh
You got the cash on you
was going to write you a check, if that's-- The guy is getting into his truck
Okay, okay,  totally respect that call
would want cash
They'll take my check inside
can see you're pressed for time, just give me two minutes
here keep my watch for collateral
He hands the guy his watch
It's a Rolex
Be right back
Two minutes
Lenny gets to the front door of the Coral Lounge, turns just in time to see the tow-truck pulling out
Lenny runs after his car, yelling, watching it recede
Son of a bitch
Lenny walks back to the bar
He sets his Haliburton up on the truck of a car and pops it open
He takes out a tiny digital cellular phone and dials a number
While it's ringing he takes another, identical Rolex knock-off out of the briefcase and slips it on
: - hand pulls a ringing cellular out of a black jacket
Follow the hand and phone to the face of a black woman
""
Late twenties
Striking features
Hair pulled back tight to her skull
She is driving, but we don't see the car, or anything but her face
Hello
Hey Lenny, whatup
(listens a beat; then) Uh huh
Uh huh
Sure
So what happened to your car this time
: - black limo pulls into the lot
It is a Continental armored stretch, downsized from today's standards
The door opens and Mace gets out
She is compactly built, dressed in black slacks, a conservative black jacket, heavy rubber-soled shoes
She glances around as she heads for the Coral Lounge entrance, the unconscious sweeping gaze of a security professional
: Mace scopes the room quickly, professionally, then heads for the bar
Max and Lenny at the bar
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket
An ex-cop that doesn't carry
It's embarrassing
oughta not be seen with you
(as she slips up behind them) Hey, Mace
What's goin' on
She plants herself between Max and Lenny and takes a generous handful of their nachos
Greetings, gents
(to Lenny) So let's hear this week's sad story
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it
mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately
Have you noticed
Mace and Max exchange a weary look
No
haven't noticed because make my payments
So, Max Pelcher, how's the
business
Sucks
(attention caught by ) Hey, Bobby, turn that up
The Bartender obeys: it's more news about the Jeriko One killing
There's file footage of Jeriko and his band, the Prophets of Rage; interview with a lot of furious fans, mostly black inner city kids; and a news clip of Jeriko at an outdoor rally, exhorting the crowd with near religious fervor: (
) The  is a military force turned against its own people
We live in a police state
The mayor and the city council sit up in their offices with their social programs that don't work
they're rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic
But the new day is coming
Two- is coming
The day of reckoning is upon us
History ends and begins again right here
Right now
Max raises a glass in salute to the  screen
To the end of all things
(slugs down the shot) You know how  know it's the end of the world
Because everything's been done, every kind of music's been tried, every government's been tried, every fuckin' hairstyle
How you gonna make it another thousand years, for Chrissake
On the , clip of Jeriko's speech has been replaced by an interview with Jeriko One's manager
Tran is Vietnamese, and around Lenny's age
He's angular, suave, cool as an early frost
Dialed in
Lenny sees his face on the screen like a personal nightmare
'm telling ya, it's over
We used it all up-- (riveted to the ) Shutup a second
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo
Yup
He was Jeriko's manager
(to screen) Bummer, Tran
Lost your golden goose
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy
But  mean isn't he Faith's new-- (she mouths the word "boyfriend") Sssssh
Not in front of Lenny
You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him
, Tran is being jostled as he walks, answering the reporters questions in a glare of minicam lights
The  have said they believe this is a gang-related incident
Can you comment on that, Mr
Vo
We have no facts yet
All we know for sure is that we have lost a great artist, that a great voice for change is now silent
Lenny, scowling, pushes away from the bar
Mace goes with him
Thanks for giving me a ride
just have a few stops, mostly on the west side-- Whoa, whoa, whoa
said 'd drop you home, but 'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds
've already pulled twelve hours today
(upbeat again) Come on, Mace
This is gonna be a big night
Can't you feel it
The energy in the air
There's money to be made, dreams to sell
Sleaze to peddle
Just a couple of hours
It'll be fun-- Excuse me
What part of  don't you understand
Mace, you're my friend
need you
Plus 'll give you 25% of what make tonight
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends
Lenny starts to whine like a puppy
Mace gives up
Jeez, you're pathetic
Okay,  got a pickup at the St
James
'll take you there, you can get a cab
(an arm around her like a buddy) Mace
You're a life-saver
(resigned) Driving Mr
Lenny
: - As Lenny and Mace cruise the night streets, passing the ongoing pageant of cops and decay
Mace glances at Lenny, sitting next to her in front, and at his omnipresent Haliburton
So, what's up with you
Another busy night selling porno to wireheads
No, wrong
sell experiences
Sex is only part of it
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs
Way  look at it,  actually perform a humanitarian service
save lives
Uh huh,  wanna hear this part
Okay, take some executive
bored with his life, bored with his wife
he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar
Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got , that he'll infect his wife
And maybe he really does catch something-- Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are
But now the risks are outa line
The streets are a war zone
And sex can kill you
So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks
Lenny, this shit's illegal
Define illegal
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months
(kidding) Yeah, but that was for love
Define love
: - Mace's limo wheels up to the hotel on the strip
soberly-dressed Japanese executive is waiting next to the doorman
the car, Mace spots him and scowls
Dammit, Lenny, you made me late
Lenny opening the door before the car stops
What's his name
Fumitsu
Mr
Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express
Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation
We do it to make sure that out  clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests
just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind
Fumitsu nods politely and Lenny opens the car door for him
Lenny jogs around behind the car to the front passenger door
Um, excuse me
(can't stand to say it) Sir
Excuse me
Mr
Nero
She walks calmly to him
(hissing through her teeth) What the fuck are you doing
(winning smile, innocent) Coming with you
You will not live to see the morning
: - As the limo stops at an elegant home in this top-bucks, old-line residential area
There is a loud party in progress, with a couple of hundred guests spread through the house and backyard
Mace scowls deeply as Lenny gets out of the car and starts into the party with Mr
Fumitsu
They are laughing uproariously and getting along like old friends
: - Mace, having a cigarette with other security drivers, watches Lenny through the tall windows of the old Spanish house
She sees him working the room, rubbing up against the money, networking
No dialogue
pantomime of Lenny working his prime turf
She stares at him for a while, then looks at her watch
Sighs
: /
/ - as a tall, stern figure suddenly slides into Lenny's path, a top cop named
Nero
(uh-oh) Strickland
Commissioner Strickland
Sure
Whatever
See, since you shitcanned my career,  don't even have to call you sir
One of life's small pleasures
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter
was invited here by a close friend, Mr
Fumitsu, see he's right over there
Lenny waves
Fumitsu waves back from across the room
don't like disappointments, Nero
And do you know what disappoints me very much
Your sex life
Your existence
: - Mace sits in her limo, talking on the cellular
Now listen to me
you have to get to bed young man
mean it
No watching "Tales from the Crypt" don't care what Cecile says
'll see you in the morning, baby
Night, night
As she hangs up, she glances out the window in time to see
Lenny flying over a hedge
He lands on the sidewalk, then scrambles up and brushes himself off as loom toward him
He adjusts his wardrobe and walks with dignity (but quickly) toward the car
Are we having a bad night
(glancing back) Let's talk in the car
: /
'  - As Mace pulls out, Lenny starts fitting a pair of playback trodes to his head
Mace glances at him in disgust
He hits his playback button
Lenny's  as he talks to Faith
Back when things were good
He's wiring her
They are playful, like a couple of kids
feel like you're turning me into a just want to see what we're like together through your eyes
He turns  the record button
Then We see the two of them standing together, reflected in a mirror
We are Faith now
don't feel anything
Is it on
Forget it's there
Make me forget it, baby
He turns her to him
They begin to make love
Faith's face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy passion
sudden
Lenny opens his eyes to see
Mace's glowing countenance
She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head and tossed them out the window
Now she's yanking him out of the car by his lapels
Hey, careful on the jacket
This is Armani
(he looks at her) You angry
've had enough of this shit
(getting back into the car) You're on foot, Lenny
In
Are you crazy
Mace starts to peel out, but Lenny leaps and plasters himself on the hood
Mace pretends she doesn't see him
(as they drive along) Can  come in please
'm having a hard time hearing the stereo
Mace jams on the brakes and Lenny slides off in front of the car
Now she starts to move forward
need my case
It's still in the back
Get it
He quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back door
Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace
Listen, can we talk a little bit here, like two rational adults
Mace hits a button on the dash
The privacy divider rises suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling
That would be no
've had it
No more wirehead shit in my car
You understand
You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here
'you mind
She lowers the divider, releasing him
Lenny straightens his jacket and tie
Runs a hand through his greasy hair
thought we were friends
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another
You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act
Well 'm out got a kid,  got rent,  got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support
'm just trying to hold on here
So am
Just trying to get by
No, you're just trying to get off
Macey
've never seen you like this
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life
You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next
And you're getting strung out
you don't even see it
Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer
know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me
Thanks, Mace
Really
Look,  gotta get some sleep
You still like me, don't you
We're still buddies
She hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm
(a tiny smile) Yeah
don't see a way out of it
Macey,  know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish
It's on your way
Jesus, Lenny
Begging
Groveling
Any pathetic behavior at all
Will that help
Faith's there tonight, and 've got to talk to her
Sure, Lenny
(she puts the car in gear) The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love
: - As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens the door
Come on, let me buy you a drink
Let's drink and make up
(Mace shakes her head) Alright, 'm going to see Faith
That means you can watch me suffer
'll be in agony, you'll feel so much better
Total and thorough payback, whatdya say
Mace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman
: Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the Retinal Fetish
The place is a fringe hangout, a converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor thundering labyrinth
Steel cage-like partitions of chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp atmosphere
The music is a bass tech-thump, and the clientele are young and on the rough side
Cybergrunge
There are many large video screens running a continuous montage of wild graphics and images
a flurry of disturbing videos:  baptized by William Burroughs
The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows
You can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain)
Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with metal detectors
They barely notice as they are scanned: it's routine there days
Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur 9mm, and her state carry-permit
The security guys check her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check
Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go immediately to one table
It seems to be in a pool of light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind
: Lenny watches a man at the table holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him
It is
He's a mover and shaker in the record business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep everyone in his orbit
The woman is
We recognize her from playback as Lenny's ex-girlfriend
But now her hair has been dyed jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle
She is wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer silk top
She has on too much make-up, which gives her features a feral-doll quality
Faith looks like what she is, a rock star wannabe
But the look is red-hot
Tran looks around the room
His eyes miss nothing
And show nothing
His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her
His fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure behind her ear
fingers touching her head now
a moment of suspended time
and she trembles
Just a little
For a second
Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's personal security force of four:  , a whippet- thin skinhead; , a none-too-bright armbreaker in the classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called ; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, , aka '', possibly the most lethal of the four
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse
Guy named Wade Beemer
Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97
Rams
that's football, right
He can't take his eyes off Faith
Mace scowls at the tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar
Forget her
She still loves me
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit
Trust me on this
She's my destiny
Destiny
You living in a perfume commercial
She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride
You'll see
Mace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the crowd
toward Faith
Several patrons greet him, just as in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny virtually ignores them
Approaching the main table now
Ringside
Tran sees him; no reaction
Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little tougher to read
Pissed off, maybe, or just tense
Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming
But they stay casual
Lenny doesn't break stride
It's like a game of chicken without cars
Beemer stands, covering Lenny with his shadow
Vita looks up at Lenny with cobra eyes
Tran gives him a glance; royalty amused by Lenny's presumption
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny
For old time's sake
Make a couple bucks for the holidays
You're not a client anymore, Tran
wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls
(glancing at Faith, back at Lenny) already got everything  need from you
Cut it out, Tran
Too bad about your guy Jeriko
Tough break
Show a little respect, Nero
The man was an important artist
Yeah, important for your label
Which no doubt is why you're in mourning
Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead
You'll make out
always do
Faith, can  talk to you a second
don't think that's a good idea, Lenny
just got to talk to you for one second
About what
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it
Tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly in the general area between his table and Lenny
don't feel anything between you
See, your trouble is you assume too much, Lenny
You assume there's something where there's nothing
You assume you have a life
But you're only hustling pieces of other lives on tape, and broken parts of your own
Faith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny
(icy) We have nothing to talk about, Lenny
Joey, make sure Mr
Nero gets safely to his car
Joey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall
Faith, call me, okay
No, Lenny
Wade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts him moving
She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering
As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him coming the other way
Tick, listen,  can't stop right now
but 'll call you tomorrow about that thing we were talking about
He's working the room even as he's getting dragged outside
Lenny the loser
Panhandler of stolen dreams
Leave him alone, Tran
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him
Don't talk to anybody
You understand
Not with everything that's going on right now
You're too goddamned paranoid
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale
: Beemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside
of people enters the club
Lenny brushes off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the entering crowd
: Lenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor
Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below
And one face, looking up at him
Kind of casual
Lenny clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out
Decides he doesn't know him
But we do
It's Spreg
Lenny walks on, crosses to a door, and enters
: / tiny room overlooking the dance floor
Crammed with electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana, whipping from one deck to another, hands flying
He's in a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five Lenny as he walks in
So, those rascals still haven't grown back yet, huh
(peering under the blanket on his lap) Nope
Guess not
Any day now, though
(handing Tex a Squid) Present
Something  had made
Let me know what you think
Hey, alright
Got something here for you, too
(passes him an envelope) It just showed up tonight, don't know who left it
Fan mail from some flounder
Lenny looks at the envelope, which has "Nero" hand-printed in block letters
Tex takes a pull from a flask as he takes a squid-deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in
He puts on the headset and pushes
we are on a beach
Early morning
We are running flat out, with the wind
Looking down
we are barefoot on the wet sand
Foaming water races up the sand and breaks around our strong male legs
Looking up again, to see our running companion
a beautiful lithe woman in shorts and -shirt
She laughs and we speed up
An exquisite moment of pure life force
'
as a tear leaks from the corner of his eye
He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful music
We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift
Tex opens his eyes
Looks for Lenny to say thanks: but Lenny's gone
Not a guy to hang around for thanks-yous
: As Lenny comes down the stairs from the  booth, tearing open the envelope
An unmarked Squid tape falls into his hand
The   dim and the   come up
And Faith is standing there
Like she beamed in
She is wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her milk-white skin
Her black hair frames her eyes, giving her an intense feral look
Faith starts to sing
Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes
the band kicks down with a wall of thundering sound
Faith explodes into motion
Her body convulses like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her
Her voice becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren
The pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on its eve of judgment
Lost in the song, Faith has found herself
She wheels across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak
techno-erotic pagan
force of nature
Lenny is mesmerized
He has seen this before, many times
But it always has the same effect on him
He is transported into another world by her, a world in which there is only the two of them
, eyes on the stage
a big piece of the puzzle suddenly fits
She's never seen Faith perform before
Holy shit
Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any way
She is merely taking what's in her head and letting it out
She doesn't care if they are there or not
Now shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and holding the note
holding it longer than you believe she possibly could
Then nothing
When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk away
Fuck you
: / & At , Lenny wends his way through the warren of corridors
past dim rooms full of wire junkies and playback freaks, all trapped into Squid nirvana: post- modern opium dens
Sinister and scary
He glimpses Faith, going into her dressing room
He hurries
but she doesn't even look around when his reflection appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity table
She is drenched with sweat
Spent
Chugging a beer
This is the first time they have been alone together in real-time for months
Pain and the memory of joy
Hi, baby
've missed you
know
Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you
'm already hurting
She doesn't turn
Just watches him in the mirror
Most of the scene plays this way
It is a cold parody of their love-making playbacks
You have to go
mean it
Yeah, , whatever you say
Just answer one question
Is anything wrong
Iris said you might be in trouble
(startled, turning to him) You talked to Iris
When
Tonight
Well  haven't seen her in months
Who knows what's going on in her head
You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you
know you Faith
You're afraid of something
What's going on
Let it alone, Lenny
It'll take care of itself
It's Tran, isn't it
This guy is poison, Faith
Listen to me
He's got you walled in on all sides
And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you
That's a good one, coming from you
Why don't you just split
You don't love him, anybody can see that
And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys
He has his uses too
What
He gonna record you on his label
Maybe
Come on, Faith
He's just toying with you
And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers
Lenny is right behind her now
He puts his hands on her shoulders, tenderly
Look, baby, 've watched you create yourself out of nothing
You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it
And you will
Damn right
It's you up on that stage, not him
You don't need him
She shrugs away from his touch
Cold again
You have to get out of here
If Tran catches you he'll
he's acting crazy
He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid
He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around
Max Pelcher
You're kidding
Yeah, for about a month now
Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay
And stay away from me
Stop trying to rescue me
Those days are over
'm a big girl now
Stop trying to save me, okay, because  don't need saving
Just
give up on me
Can't do it
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat
Because they always say "The End
" You always know when it's over
It's over
Now please leave
have to go on again in a couple of minutes
She looks at him and, after a moment, he nods and leaves
As the door closes behind him, Faith tosses her towel on the table
She looks frightened and alone
Hell
: / Turning a corner from the dressing room into the , Lenny runs into Max
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy
was gonna tell ya
Hey, it's just a job
feel like shit about it
You should feel like shit
figured, what the hell,  could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was  at the same time
Do us both good
Right
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you
(already over it) Hey, at least you got a job
(slaps him on the back) Watch her for me
Stay on her
'm on her
Lenny climbs the stairs to the  , pushing his way through the crowd
Vita, watching the backstage area leans over to Tran, whispers in his ear
Tran makes a sign to Beemer, and he stands to go after Lenny
Mace, at the bar, sees the Tran-Vita-Beemer action, looks around for Lenny
Can't find him
But figures there's got to be only one reason Beemer's on the prowl: he's looking for Lenny
She whips out her cellular
: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful come-along hold and hustling him toward the back of the club
Lenny's cellular rings
Can  get that
He reaches for his cellular, connects with
, over by the bar
Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, think Tran's got Beemer looking for you
: Lenny, as he's hustled out the rear door
Thanks for the tip
: /  - Beemer shoves Lenny into the alley and shuts the door behind him
recognize you
You're Wade Beemer
Running back for the Rams, am  right
Beemer, who was about to go to work on Lenny, pauses
Yeah, that's right
saw you play, man
You were good
Like a fucking freight train remember saying
So what happened, injuries or what
Bullshit politics
It's always politics
Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right
But  could pay you more not to
See what mean
could write you a check right now-- Come on, let's go,  got to get back
(pulling money out of his pocket) Okay cash
Logical
Here's everything  have on me, what do you say
How about a Rolex
(barely a glance at it) already got a real one
Come on, it won't be too bad
It's not personal
(taking off the Armani carefully) Just not the eyes
Beemer swings
: /  - As Lenny approaches the car, moving painfully, dabbing at a bloody nose
Mace looks at him pityingly
They oughta get some lights back there
person could get killed slipping on those stairs
Let's go
: an eerie    of Mace and Lenny getting into the limo
Then we see: Spreg and Engelman, the two street Hun cops
Watching
: ' Lenny slumps in the back seat
You're some piece of work, you know that
Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you
mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all
have crawled through the gutter
through every wrinkle in the human brain
What 'm saying
But you still come out this goofball romantic
It is my sword and my shield, Macey
Lenny finds the anonymous tape in his pocket
He looks a it, puzzled
What's that
Present from Faith
No idea
He opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts the Squid rig on and closes his eyes
Maybe he can forget about Faith a minute
He punches
: the first thing we notice is that the  is distorted visually
The colors are de-saturated
Almost black and white
Yet the detail is crisp and clear, almost hyper-real
down a windowless hallway at a large hotel
An apparently endless row of doors
The Wearer's glance goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time
We come to a particular door
There is a sign on the door
The Wearer moves to the room next door
Looks both ways
The corridor is empty
It's a test pattern so far
"Our" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical gloves
They look like male hands
The snapping of the rubber is the only sound in the corridor
The  hunches down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with lock-picking tools
Several seconds and the lock is very professionally picked
Alright, a little & action
We enter the dark room, which is vacant
The drapes are open and we see city lights
It is night
One gloved hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the moonlight coming in the window: the
The Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear holding
a black ski-mask
He pulls it on, leaving the subsequent  seen through the eye-holes of the mask
The Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser
He has avoided his reflection up until now
We see a man, dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of course the ski-mask
Totally anonymous
Hey, getting good
Solid suspense build
The Wearer crosses to the balcony door
Opens it quietly and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's balcony from the one next door
The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the other balcony
We hug the wall, looking furtively into the room
It is a suite
In the living room we see a woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar
She turns
It is Iris
She is wearing a -shirt and panties
Probably ready for bed
She looks like she can't sleep
Pours the Scotch shakily
, the streetlight washing across his face
He gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread
we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight
We can hear the television on in there
Using a steel jimmy the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and silently opens it, slipping inside
We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her movements
Water running in the bathroom
We come around the door frame
Bedroom dark, bathed in  glow
Iris in the bathroom, washing her face with cold water
We move toward her
Crossing the room as she reaches for a towel
We are now only a couple of feet away
She comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying her face
She lowers the towel, turning away
her eyes whip back
Widening in terror
She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed
We go after her
Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small automatic
She whips it around toward us but we grab it and twist it away before she can fire
She smashes the palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed, lightning-fast
We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the bedroom door
Across the living room and down the short hall to the front door
Closing rapidly on her as she somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the hall
Slam
We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor
Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric stunner
We nail her right in the back between the shoulder blades
She sags to the floor, gasping
We zap her again
The Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor
nobody in sight
We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and drag her back into her room, locking the door
, reacting
Going white
What is it
Go to the Sunset Sheraton Just go
Lenny goes back under the wire, seeing
a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom
propping her up with her back against the white tile wall
grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one to the steel towel rack above her
She is moaning
And crying
(voice distorted) haven't seen your face haven't heard your voice
you can still let me go
The Wearer hits her with the stunner again
She jerks and gasps for breath
We see our latex-gloved finger come up in front of us and hear
Moving quickly now
Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack
Pull out something
a set of playback trodes
Our hands place them on her head
She stares uncomprehending
What
We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside the pack
a record deck, some wires, a small metal box
Holy shit
He's jacking her in to his own output
She's seeing what he's seeing
She's seeing herself
Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her
wide- eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping
Helpless
And she can feel what he feels
The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls out something else
black athletic headband
We slip it over her head, down over her eyes
blindfold
Now she can only see what the wearer sees
And also from the bag we pull
a yellow plastic object
With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by segments when they get dull
It extends with an ominous clicking sound
We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her - shirt, laying it open
Exposing her torso
We then look down and slide the knife under the side band of her panties, slicing them off
We put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death
'  of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the Sunset Sheraton
Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in his seat as if ants are crawling over him
He is experiencing the stalker's exhilaration
we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below his knees (-rated please) and reach for Iris
Kneeling in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her hips forward onto him, pushing into her
Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels
She feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the killer's exhilaration
, sweating and barely able to breath
Mace stops the tape
concerned by Lenny's reaction
He opens his eyes
Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may reveal
But he shakes his head
He has to know
He pushes her hand away and punches
The sweaty, grunting horror
The stalker picks up her slit -shirt and quickly wraps it around her neck
He knots it tight and twists one powerful hand into the knot
The muscles in his forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter
The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the -shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her jaw
Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die
Her death comes at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her
blasting off the planet on total overload
terror, pain, death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same instant
, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains out of his skull
(like a mantra) On my God
Oh my God
, a glimpse of the Wearer's hand relaxing the knot
Iris' head lolls
Her mouth is slack and open
We remove her blindfold
Her eyes are half-lidded
Very dead looking
Our fingers gently push them wide open
, looking like he has been gut kicked
He gasps for breath
, as the killer's hand calmly moves Iris' head from side to side
studying her dead face
Her staring eyes
He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye, the pupil wide, seeing nothing
burst of static
End of tape
Lenny opens his eyes
He fumbles open the car door and practically rolls out onto the sidewalk
The trodes pull off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk to a darkened storefront where he leans for support
He doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach
Mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to his knees
She holds his shoulders while he throws up again
My God, Lenny
What is it
Black
Jack
Blackjack
don't understand-- Snuff clip
It was Iris
She said she needed my help and
aw Jesus, Mace
the sick fucker killed her
Are you sure it's real
Lenny looks up, in the direction of the hotel
Mace follows his glance
They notice for the first time: cop lights; cop cars; ambulance; coroner's wagon
on Iris' body, in a bag, being loaded into the coroner's van
: /  /  - Neon reflections on the roof of Mace's limo as it pulls into the lot and slides up to Max's car
Max is sitting in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings from a take-out carton
He looks up as Lenny and Mace get out of the limo
Sees their expressions
Ohhhh shit
: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace's Lincoln, has his head propped in his hands
His eyes are distant
replaying
Still shocked to his soul
Mace paces nearby
Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes on, playing back the tape
His face is transformed into an ashen mask lit by neon
mouth open in shock
With shaky hands he stops the deck
Opens his eyes
Long beat
He glances down at the dim- sum carton in his hands
Well
've lost my appetite
(lofts it into a nearby dumpster) For about a year
He gets to his feet, offering the deck and trodes to Mace
No way
Max pulls a hip-flask full of tequila from his army jacket and takes an eye-watering pull
Offers it to Lenny, who follows suit
You alright
'okay
Yeah
No, not really
Let's work it
Not now
don't want to think about it-- Come on, Lenny
You used to be good at this stuff
Play it down
What's the perp doing
He stalks her
He rapes her
Then he does her
And he records it
Thrill kill
Wants to see it again
And again
He records himself raping and killing her-- But at the same time he's sending the signal to her-- So she feels
what he feels
while he's in her
The thrill while he's killing her
is sent to her, heightening her fear
which in turn heightens the turn on for him
(turns to him) 've seen a lot, Max
So've
Too much
But this is a bad one
Top ten
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction
killer and victim merging
orgasm and agony merging
And he records it all
And gives it to you
Wants to share
That's right
He wants to share
Needs an audience
This is one sick puppy
Why me
Mace is hugging herself
Edgy and tense
Cause you're the man, right
The Magic Man
If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach
've never dealt in black-jacks
Never
Everybody knows that
He's skull-fucking you, bud
Trying to get a reaction
Maybe pushing you to do something
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created
It's the dark end of the street, Lenny
How do you like it now
Jesus, Mace
Back off
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody
Take the tape to the cops
Uh unh
No way
They'd crucify me
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around-- Naw, he's right
They'll figure Lenny's the perp, or go through his client list, ruin his life
such as it is
Look, 'll call the guys in Homicide
tell them she was a friend of mine and they'll keep me in the loop
Get me the forensics and all that
(he opens his car door) Get some sleep
'll call you when get something
(he starts his car) And Lenny
'd keep moving if were you
: ' The elevator is huge -- big enough for a truck -- and Lenny seems small in the huge space, while shadows crawl across his body as the old machinery pulls him up toward
, in the loft above
She looks into the vast bedroom
at Tran sitting in a chair, tranced out under playback trodes, his eyes closed
She softly closes the sliding door and walks across the cavernous main room
The place is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge television screens along both walls
Otherwise there is little light
The cavernous loft is sparsely but very expensively furnished
Haute-tech design
Total contrast to Lenny's ratty digs
'  through the cage-door of the elevator as it reaches the loft and Faith is revealed, waiting for him in the shadows
He slides open the cage-door and she moves quickly to him
(whispering, furtive) You're crazier than  thought, Lenny
Coming here
Tran's just in there
Iris is dead
She was murdered
Faith stiffens
We see the fear, now, exposed
Who did it
Don't know
But this guy's real damaged goods
Iris knew someone was after her
and she said you were in danger too
(he grabs her shoulders) Now no more games, Faith
Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now
Come with me right now
Don't even think about it
Then what
Then what, Lenny
You going to protect me
Big tough guy
You're a talker, Lenny
You don't even have a gun
(hurt) have a gun
It's under my bed
You don't know what you're fucking with here
Tell me
from the shadows, like the whisper of a blade in the air
Go ahead, Faith
Tell him
Tran steps forward, totally at ease with the situation
Out of the shadows behind him step Joey Corto, Duncan and Vita Minh
Look, Tran
Lenny just came by to give me some bad news
An old friend of mine has been murdered
You remember Iris
tragic story, no doubt
(to Lenny) How'd you get up here
Charm
(looks at Faith) Uh huh
Look, Nero
'll make you an offer
(he grabs Faith by the arm, steps closer) Take her
Right now
If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go
'll let her choose
Faith always knows what she wants
(he turns her loose) Hands off
See
Lenny glances at the open elevator right behind him
So close
She just has to take one step to him
and they will be out of there
Together
It's alright
He means it
(to Faith) do mean it
(to Lenny) And  mean this
if Faith stays you go away and never come back
You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again
You understand
She glares at them both for a long moment
Emotions play across her face, complex and unreadable
She steps back, taking her place at Tran's side
made my choice, Lenny
(to Lenny, nodding toward the elevator) You're going down
Joey Corto and Duncan shove Lenny roughly backward into the elevator
Corto slams the gate shut and slaps a button to lower the lift
The last thing Lenny sees as he descends is Faith's face, above him
don't love you, Lenny
Give up
: /' Faith is crying as Tran comes up behind her
You said you were going to get her out of this
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in
(he moves very close) It was touching the way you stood by me in there
"Stand by your man"
was moved
You were very good don't think he even understands that you did it for him
He doesn't know what's going on
Leave him alone
'd love to
But he keeps showing up
And you keep talking to him can't have that-- And he slaps her
Really hard
Decks her
He's trembling with rage
and something else
Fear
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head
Fuck you
(walking away) Maybe later
: /' The huge elevator, with Lenny its sole occupant, descends through the shadows toward the first floor
Lenny watches the shadow patterns on the wall through the iron grillwork door
He's still thinking about Faith
even when the elevator reaches the first floor and Mace comes into view
She's waiting for him
He steps forward
But he can't open the grillwork door
And the elevator doesn't stop
It keeps going down
Lenny, spooked, works the door hard
as Mace disappears from view above him
and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement
With Vita and the beef squad waiting for Lenny, stoney- faced
Last stop
All out
Lenny tries to keep the door shut, but Duncan wrenches it open
Vita grabs Lenny and twists his arm painfully behind him in one fluid move
They hustle him toward a dank basement room near the elevator
(speed-rap) Listen, can we be smart here could make it really worth your while
could cut you a check for 500 each
hell, make it an even grand
'm not saying you don't land a couple shots, just go light is all 'm saying
here, take my Rolex
Lemme see
glimmer of hope in Lenny's eye as he whips it off his wrist
Corto doesn't even look at it
Gets it over his hand about mid-way, then -- using the watch like a pair of brass knuckles -- clobbers Lenny in the face
Watch parts go flying as Corto steps away and Duncan slams Lenny up against a column
Vita weighs in
gut-punching Lenny savagely
She works him expertly, with a series of painful jabs
He sags to his knees
Not only is this painful
It's goddamn humiliating
And Duncan and Corto enjoy every second of it
We tried to find a smaller girl, to beat the shit out of you, Lenny
but it was short notice
Vita grabs Lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one rock-hard arm
She is cocking back the other arm for a pile-driver punch when
Suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her
Mace drives Vita head first into the steel column
Duncan lunges in and grabs for Mace
This is a mistake
Mace doesn't fight fancy
And she doesn't fight fair
She fights to win
And she is awesomely fast
Her moves are street moves, coupled with arm-locks and come-alongs she has been trained to use as a security driver
Lenny recovers enough to size up Vita, who is still a little stunned
She has blood dripping in her eyes and can't see too well
But she charges him
And -- being the gent that he is -- he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair
Mace drops Duncan about the time Vita is hitting the ground, leaving
, who fumbles out a Beretta 9mm and sticks it in Mace's face
He sniggers, loving the upper hand
Safety's on
And like a jerk, he looks
She snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly fast, twisting the gun out of his hand
She continues to twist his wrist brutally and Corto goes down to one knee, groaning
She takes his Beretta and backhands the barrel hard across his face
Mace releases his wrist and he crumples in a heap
She and Lenny back out the door
Then Lenny runs back in and kicks Corto in the ribs
Lenny
Mace grabs him and pulls him out of the room, then slams the metal firedoor behind them, locking it with a piece of junk wedged behind the release bar
: - Mace and Lenny hotfoot it toward the parked limo
Mace is disassembling the Beretta without looking at it
She chucks pieces over a chain-link fence as they go
Lenny brushes himself off, checking his jacket for damage
He is high from winning the fight
Is this great fabric or what
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot
Never really thought about it
: ' Squid : the killer enters the vacant hotel room, passing the mirror on the dresser
(
) Come on
look in the mirror
You know it's there, you're keeping your eyes off it, you bastard
Who are you
: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace near him
He knows what he's doing
He's worn before
a lot
So that gives you something
It gives me
don't know
maybe two hundred people who  know wear
As he talks Lenny fiddles with some custom electronics gear
The back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire connecting it to some kind of amplifier black-box which he is using to boost the gain
Don't crank the gain any more
You're gonna fry yourself
need to see more
get more detail
Something
feel his presence, so strong
Mace watches, concerned, as Lenny puts the trodes back on and hits playback
Squid POVs: strobe-like images of Iris' rape and death, separated by burst of static
as Lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons, searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on the tape, trying to manage his revulsion
until Mace yanks the trodes off and Lenny sags back on the couch
He rubs his eyes
He is seeing ghosts, afterimages burned into his visual cortex
The room is alive with them, shimmering
No more, Lenny
Yeah
'm ghosting pretty bad
Lenny see Iris' terrified face
Literally
It floats iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly
She came to me for help
should have read it better
just figured, y'know
another strung- out hooker having a bad night
It's not your fault
Lenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen
She goes with him
Sex killers act alone
So there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made
Cops know they'll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene
Lenny sucks down four Tylenol with a long pull from a bottle of vodka
And anyway, nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker
They're roadkill
Requiem for Iris
Mace watches Lenny rubbing his eyes, waiting for the Tylenols to hit
See, it's all about what they see walking in
dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration
they'll see a trick gone wrong
Random kill
The kind you never solve
But that doesn't add, does it
No it doesn't
Because Iris knew somebody was after her
Lenny, wound up like a Swiss movement, starts pacing
She said "If they get me"
They
Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason
So the guy's not a sicko
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak
The point is, he was a hitter
Somebody wanted to shut her up
But why not just put a little lead in her ear
Because it had to look random
Not connected to anything or anyone
(he seems to run out of energy) But then why give the rape to me
That's where it gets a little strange
And what about the guy that was following me
Now you're really getting paranoid
Lenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples
The question is not whether  am paranoid, but whether  am paranoid enough
You want to rub my neck
Sure
Mace sits next to him and starts to work
Strong, knowing fingers
Lenny starts to relax a little
How's Zander
He asks about you all the time
It's been weeks since you've seen him
Lenny sort of keels over
His head slumps in her lap
'm sorry about getting on your case earlier
just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and -- anyway
'm sorry
(drifting off, joking) 'okay
know you still love me
She looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture
He is out cold
Mace gazes at Lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't seen before: unguarded
Caring
Loving
And we get it: she does love him
It makes no sense, and it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her
but there it is
She shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now
Maybe not ever
She leans her head back against the ratty top of the couch, sighs
And keeps her hand moving soothingly on his head
: /
' / - Mace pulls the limo into the driveway of a modest stucco house in Inglewood
It's dawn
neighbor is walking the dog
Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of toys left scattered in the front yard
Inside, , age 6, is watching  in his pajamas and eating a bowl of cereal
Behind him, on the couch, is Mace's younger sister , zee'd-out
Zander frowns at her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch
Where were you Mom
Did you meet a guy
Just Lenny
Right
That explains it
Are you going to make me beg
Zander scrambles over to his mom, throws his arms around her
Big hug
(looking at weird stuff in cereal) What is that
Cheerios and wieners
made it myself
It's good
Well give me some then
'm starving
: ' 2:20
31 Lenny wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing
He is on the couch, still clothed
He hears Max's voice on the answer machine and groggily grabs the receiver
(
) Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed
'sup, Max
: /  - Max, on the cellular, across the street from a church where mourners stream out of a memorial for Jeriko One
The sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further off -- a cordon of very anxious-looking crowd control cops
Not a whole hell of a lot
They've just been saying words over Jeriko
Tensions running pretty high down here
'm telling you
across the street
as Tran comes out of the church with Faith next to him
Corto, Vita, Duncan and Beemer form a loose protective shell around them as the press bears down, shouting out questions
Tran ushers Faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after her
The rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the car as it pulls away
: Max, still on the phone to Lenny
(
) Faith
Yeah
She's leaving with Tran so got to boogie
Real quick
Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name
Paid cash
Looks like she was holding out
Yup
Hey, so  heard you dropped in on Tran last night
Another slick Lenny move
(
) He's in this somehow
don't know how
Just stay close to Faith
'm on her, amigo
No worries
Gotta jam
: ' As Lenny is hanging up he notices something stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his front window, next to the door
"" is printed on the envelope
Oh shit
He opens the door, looking both ways
No-one is around
He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars and takes it inside
Of course it contains a tape
He stares at it with dread
Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck
He picks up the trodes and places them on his head
He notices his hands are shaking
He takes a deep breath and punches
:
As expected we see the de-saturated signature look of the killer's vision
The Wearer is walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment building
We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken deck furniture
We walk through a breezeway to an ally- like courtyard behind the building
We approach a door
the back door to Lenny's apartment
The killer picks the lock on the back door
Opens the door and enters
The apartment is dark, blacked out
We are in the kitchen
We stop and listen
Water dripping in the sink
Soft snoring from the living room
Moving to the other room
Slowly, silently
Furtively looking around the door frame to the living room
There is Lenny, crashed out on the couch
Now moving stealthily toward him
Kneeling down beside him
Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep under
Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow plastic razor knife
With his thumb, the killer extends the blade
click, click, click, click
The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward Lenny
The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat
Draws it slowly across
not leaving a mark
The  backs away and -- static as the tape ends
,   , whips off the trodes, freaking
He feels around his throat with one hand
can't feel anything
Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he inspects his neck minutely
There is a hair-line red line over his carotid
He looks around the room wildly, his heart hammering
Slowly, he gets his breathing under control
Then
he hears something in the kitchen
tiny click
His eyes go wide
Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently into the bedroom
He fishes around under the bed and pulls out a  22
45 auto pistol
He stalks silently toward the kitchen
Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine
He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine under a bunch of dirty socks
He inserts it quietly, wincing as he chambers a round
Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door
He edges around the frame, pie-ing the room
Cop reflexes intact
Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny look
She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the bottle of instant on the counter
She is dressed casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon jacket over a tank-top
Whatup Lenny
(hands shaking) Jesus, Mace
: ' little later
As Lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag: clothes, a playback deck, a box of
45 hollow points
He grabs his grimy old Second Chance body armor from the and stuffs it into his Haliburton
When Mace sees him do that, she knows things are freaky
Where we going
Anywhere
(finger to his lips) We'll talk about it in the car
Mace glances around
unnerved by the possibility of audio surveillance
Hand me that box of tapes, will you
He's pointing to a shoe box full of "Faith" tapes
Mace hands them over with obvious distaste
He throws them in the bag, starts to zip it
then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror: something's the matter
What is it
This tie doesn't go with blue
He yanks off the tie and grabs another
: /
'    - Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of  on the last day of this millennium
There are cops in body armor and helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles
Helicopters orbit endlessly
And a National Guard tank rumbles down the street
State of siege
The car radio is on, with 's poor Man hyping the impending Millennium  party
the New Years Eve mega-bash of the century
Ten square blocks of madness, with live music, fireworks and the actual rich and famous of hobnobbing with us peons
Also yours truly the Poor Man will be there at the  bandshell, giving away "Millennium " and " 2-" -shirts by the truckload-- Lenny is keyed up and tense
He keeps looking out the back window
Will you relax
There's nobody back there
Mace, the guy had a knife
To my throat
In my living room
Relaxing might be right out, okay
You better keep a low profile for a while
No shit
You got someplace in mind
: /'  - On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five
Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander laugh
Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself
Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like to see more of
Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend , and Curtis' friend
These two guys are about 18, dressed in gangsta garb
They are listening to "The Prophets of Rage" on a  player, and watch Lenny with a dispassion that flirts with distaste
What do you got
(pulls a tape out of his pocket) Today  have
(seeing the tape) Lenny, have you lost it completely
Easy, there, Mom
Easy
This is audio only
(hands tape to Zander) John Coltrane
" Love Supreme
" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful
Let's play it now
Later
Your mom'n  are heading right back out
Groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news
Cecile even musters the gumption to speak up
Hey, come on,  been baby-sitting a full 24 hours,  have to get ready for the party tonight
Cecile
Mace frosts her with a look
You don't mess with Mace
(to a disappointed Zander) You're not the only little boy have to look out for, honey
Zander nods:
Lenny gives him the grip
Zander's hand outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph
: : squid tape of Iris' death
Quick barrages of the savage imagery interspersed with bursts of static
until Tick slips off the trodes
He's been totaled by what he's seen
Whoa
That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer
Well
the guy's fucked up
We know that, Tick
No,  mean the killer's got some kind of distortion in his visual cortex
The color and gray-scale values are all messed up, like color blindness
He gives the tape a fast run through his processing equipment
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there
Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something
Some kind of trauma (shaking his head) This is not good
don't like this at all
What
Well, it's cutting awful close to me
mean she was just here
Who was just here
Iris, man
Pay attention
Wait, wait
wait a minute
Iris was here
Yeah, she came by last night
Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip
What clip
What was it
don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it
Said  wouldn't want to see it
She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her
Like insurance or somethin' She never gave me a tape
(to Lenny) Think back about what she said
Exactly what she said
(revved up) She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car
Something in your car
Lenny and Mace swap a look: oh shit
: - 6:05
The last night of this millennium is falling
Mace's limo pulls to the curb
The yard is located in the vast no- man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near harbor piers
The impound office is locked
Closed for New Years Eve
Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with the long-handled bolt-cutters
They enter the yard
Mace is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows at them, growling, its head low on an attack run
Mace fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low amperage, not lethal)
It whines and flips over twice, then runs off behind some parked cars
That's a handy little attitude adjuster
(sees his car) Damn
'm boxed in
Lenny and Mace approach his , blocked in by ten other cars, so he's not getting it back this trip
He unlocks the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace covers them with the tazer
puppy-like whine comes occasionally from behind some cars nearby
We catch a glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them warily
Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side, still wrapped in the note
He reads the note: "
" What's it say
He crumples the note
Nothing
Let's go play this back
returning to the limo
As they reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams
It is the two cops,   , out of uniform, but looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and Mace
They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or later he would lead them to the tape
Give me the tape
Right now
What tape
'm just trying to get my car back but the place is closed-- Shut the fuck up Nero
Engelman grabs a fist-full of hair at the top of Mace's head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull
(cool and even) Lenny, give them the tape
It's in my case
Okay
'm going to open my case
Facing us, where we can see it
Lenny slowly opens the Haliburton
He takes out the tape and holds it out toward Spreg
Take it and turn her loose
Okay
Absolutely
And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that way
Spreg edges forward and takes the tape
Then he points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire-- Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into Engelman's leg
Engelman screams in pain
Mace twists out of his grip
Engelman shoots the dog
Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and dives for the car
The case takes three rounds from Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover
Mace just seems to vanish
She reappears over the trunk of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's chest, knocking him down
Lenny and Mace scramble into the car, starting it up
Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body armor stopped the slugs
No blood
He comes up firing
He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it pulls away
No damage
They realize the limo is a bullet proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked nearby, to give chase
Spreg's face is a mask of rage
He slams the truck in gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even has the door closed
: /
- Mace has the big car floored
She looks in the rear-view as the truck gains on them
Mace is doing her thing
what she's trained for
Security driving
She whips some moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them
(holding on) Oh no, we're not being followed, Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny
They hear rounds hitting the car, and look back
The truck is right behind them
Shit
Take it easy
The glass is bullet resistant
Bullet resistant
Whatever happened to bullet proof
Lenny
Calm down
This is what do
slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a parked van
Mace accelerates
The truck stays with them
Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an -47 assault rifle
He rips off several burst which riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns
The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the rounds don't come all the way through
Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them
The impact drives them sideways
Mace swerves to miss a light- standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse buildings which front the harbor
The truck stays right with them
Engelman fires bursts at the tires, shredding them off the rims
The limo thunders along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange sparks
Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings
No way to turn
Ahead is a short concrete pier
She hits the brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier, stopping before it reaches the end
They are trapped
: - Engelman and Spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover behind it
They rake the limo with bursts from their - 47s
Lenny and Mace keep their heads down below the door frame
It sounds like they are inside a steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band
But the armored body panels hold
Lenny is punching his cellular
Goddamnit
911 is busy
It's okay, Lenny (he looks at her hopefully) They'd never get here in time anyway
Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door on her side (away from the bad guys)
It is jammed from the sideswiping
Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a gallon gas can
He uncaps it and throws it across the pavement
It slides under the limo, glugging its contents onto the ground
Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it
He tosses the flare under the limo
-
The gas can explodes in a fireball
The Continental is engulfed in flames
From the inside all Lenny and Mace can see is fire
All the windows are covered in roaring flames
(matter-of-fact) This is bad
The gas tank's going to go any second
Mace slams the car into gear and floors it
The powerful Lincoln thunders forward
It crashes through a chain-link fence and launches right off the end of the pier fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black water
Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact
The car sinks
: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting there amid the junk
Shafts of light play down from the big streetlights at the end of the pier
, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb
Are you out of your fucking mind
Fire's out, isn't it
She scrambles into the back seat
She wrenches at the rear seatback, pulls it free
and crawls half-into the huge trunk
Water is up around their legs
She grabs her shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge
Get in here
Come on Lenny, move it
Mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in
Get ready to hold your breath
She aims the ten-gauge at the trunk latch mechanism
Lenny, kick out hard, then just follow me
Okay
He nods
She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel
The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles
Lenny and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier
: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside the slimy concrete wall
Lenny comes up beside her, spluttering
Her hand goes over his mouth
They are in the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road ties
Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the black water over the barrels of their AKs
Let's get out of here
They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there
Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier, chest-deep in the water
They hear the truck pulling away
They let out a big exhalations of relief
walking on the pier, shoes squishing
They leave a shiny trail behind them
can't believe we had to give them the damn tape
Yeah, me neither
It was one of my favorites
Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday
'm going to really miss it
He feels around in his jacket pocket
He pulls out the nice and dry in its plastic case
He holds it up to show a grinning Mace
Are we impressed yet
: /
'  - 7:45
Lenny and Mace, still wet, riding in the back seat of Curtis' car
(pissed) got better things to do on New Year's Eve than be some kinda damn chauffeur
Hey Curtis
Just drive
Curtis swears
But he shuts up and drives
Those two guys were cops
You sure
It's the walk
Something
Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address
We gotta keep moving
Mace takes it in
She nods
: ' Mace comes in the front door and walks straight to the , switching it off
Zander and Cecile are shocked
Lornette, girl
what's going on
Lenny goes past them and starts grabbing his stuff
wardrobe bag, playback gear
(to Zander) We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey
We're going to watch fireworks from there
Let's go
Chop chop
Aw, Mom
Come on Zander
You can ride on my shoulders
Here you go
Lenny hoists him overhead and goes out the door
Cecile catches up to Mace in the hall, just as she is opening a locked cabinet and pulling out a little
380 auto, holster and ammo
Cecile, get in the car
Now
: /
- Sirens pierce the night
Two pillars of fire are visible blocks away
There are dark crowds of people everywhere
People on the sidewalks, lighting fireworks
There are flashes and explosions
It could be a celebration, or a war zone
Maybe both
Or one about to turn into the other
Mace is driving, scanning the streets
She has her
380 auto in her hand, resting in her lap
Lenny is riding shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back seat
: '  - It is gang territory pure and simple
Blacks and Hispanics
Graffiti everywhere
Burned-out buildings
Lenny sees abject poverty, here
Even so, people are partying
They pull up to the front of Cecile's apartment building and get out
There are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who give Mace the local hand-sign
She returns the sign automatically as she carries Zander past them
Yo, Mace
Whatup wit you, homegirl
You never come roun' here no more
Lenny follows with his wardrobe bag
The homeboys give Lenny the eye as he brushes past them
Mace chills them with a glare
He's with me
: '  - small and dingy place
Cecile has done her best to make it a home
Mace and Lenny go into the kitchen and shut the door
He quickly sets up his playback deck on the table
He puts on the trodes and pulls the tape out of his pocket
Then he pauses, looking at it apprehensively
knowing that it contains the answer to all this madness
He puts it into the deck
The deck closes
He punches : /  - Mace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis on the balcony of the apartment
visible through the window
Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic weapons, making her flinch
She goes back into the
Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table, trodes in his hands
Stunned
Face the color of old cement
Hands shaking
Tell me
can't tell you
You've got to see
Uh unh
won't do it
Mace
know what you think about the wire
But 'm asking you to do this
It's that important
Mace sees how serious he is
She nods:
He puts the trodes on her
Sorry this has to be your first playback
He hits play and Mace reacts as the sensory input hits her
She opens her eyes
Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see double
She bites her lip as the sensation of being another person floods through her
: We are Iris
Riding in a car
Fixing our makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor
Iris flips the sun visor back up, revealing the moving street
It is night
We look down, and recognize the dress Iris was wearing when we first saw her, two nights ago
She puts her lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist
Iris turns her head and we see the driver
It is
He is laughing, talking to someone in the back seat
Iris looks and we see , Jeriko's sideman, and another woman,
They are amorously entwined
Then they are all laughing and passing around a bottle of Jim Beam
The car stereo is thumping loudly
Iris'  swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's hand caressing her thigh
She puts her hand on his chest and leans close to him
Jeriko grins, then looks up and swears at a wash of red/blue cop flash
Shit
Fuckin' Five- Our  swings to the rear-view mirror and we see an car behind us, with the gumball machine on
spotlight hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren
Jeriko pulls over, but they are on an overpass
no shoulder
(on bullhorn) Go to the bottom of the ramp
Jeriko and Replay are both swearing
He pulls the car down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a warehouse district
Our  looks around nervously
Black shadows and concrete pillars
No-one around
Cars whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on Mars
The car is stopped next to a train yard
We hear the rumble of diesels nearby, the clank of freightcars
We see the outlines of   advancing through the beam of the spotlight, their guns drawn
(jumping out of the car) Goddamn, now what you pull me over for
If  was going any slower 'd be parked-- 1 Get down on your knees and put your hands on your head
Now
2 Everyone else, out of the car and down on the ground
Our  comes up and out of the car
Jeriko is righteously pissed off
He's not following orders
1 Put your hands behind your head right now
He goes along, madder than ever
The cops get Replay down on his knees as well, in the wet gutter next to the curb
The cops are closer now
We see that they are  and (to us) Put your hands on the hood of the car and don't move
We exchange a look with Diamanda
Fucking cops
But Jeriko is winding them up
Not giving them the pleasure of the humiliation
You can see it escalating
suppose you stopped us cause you had suspects fitting our description in the area, what you're gonna tell me
What was the description
Two black males in a car
Yeah, right, heard that one before
As Engelman pulls out Jeriko's wallet, looks at his , Jeriko checks name tags
Well you stopped the wrong black male tonight officer
what is it
Spreg
Officer Spreg
Cause 'm the 800 pound gorilla in your mist, fucker
make more in a day than you make in a year, and my lawyers love to spend my money dragging sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you into court
Get a man down on the ground with no probable cause
Fuck you
Shut the fuck up
He kicks Jeriko down on his face
Jeriko hits the ground hard
(yelling) Leave the fuck off of us, we weren't doing anything
Shut up
Don't make me walk over there
Engelman shows the  to Spreg, saying something we can't hear
You're that rap puke
Jeriko One
You're the one getting all the gangbangers to form citizens groups and go downtown
trying to rake the  over a cheese grater
That's right
And you're gonna be in my next song, motherfucker, it's called Robo-Spreg
Replay starts laughing
Diamanda stifles a giggle
Spreg is white-lipped with rage
Years of frustration coming to a head
Too many disciplinary actions, too many suspensions, too little appreciation of the tough job they do
It's a song about a cop who meets his worst nightmare, a nigger with enough political juice to crush his ass like a stink bug
You're gonna be famous
Spreg looks around the empty street
Looks at Engelman
Down at Jeriko, proned out on the pavement
Replay's laughter in his ears
don't think so
And shoots him
Twice in the back of the head
Just like that
Diamanda screams
Replay tries to roll to his feet
Spreg shoots him twice in the stomach
Replay is screaming
Rolling around, holding his guts
(shouting) Hey
don't hear you laughing
Engelman's yelling something at him we can't hear
Spreg turns, eyes wide with adrenaline
Get the bitches
Engelman hesitates and then spins toward us
Diamanda is screaming, backing away from Engelman
Spreg shoots Replay four more times
We spin one-eighty and start to run
Hear shots
Spin back
to see Diamanda dropping to her knees
Engelman shoots her again
Then raises his gun toward us
We spin away
The world becomes a kinetic blur
The sound of shots
We see puffs of dust on the ground in front of us
Missed shots
We tumble over a guardrail and roll down an embankment
get up and keep running
Train tracks ahead
Looking back
here come Spreg and Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us
We hear the thunder of a train
spinning again to look forward
Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track
Almost to us
We leap forward
Over the track
The diesel roars past behind us
Looking back
a black wall of moving steel
Backing away from it
We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down
trying to aim through the wheels
Hear the impotent pop of their guns over the roar of the train
Turning to run again
We see a tiny hole appear in a sign right in front of us with a metallic
Running and running
Looking back
No pursuit
Train still rolling by
Can't see the cops
Running, running
Heart pounding and lungs heaving
Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to fill the night
Looking down
one shoe on, one shoe off
Iris' hand takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest
We move forward into the dark train-yard as-- And Mace sits stone still
Shakes
For a beat
And another
Then she tears the trodes off and throws them across the room, near where Lenny is on the cellular
(into phone) Hang on
Hang on, Max
(looks at Mace) You see
see
(trembling) see the earth opening up and swallowing us all
Yeah  know
(into cellular) So what do we do
: /
'  - As Max drives along a crowded downtown street
(into phone) Don't talk to anybody
Anybody
You're invisible
Okay
Just meet me at Tick's in a half hour
And Lenny
don't get pulled over
: '  - Lenny pushes "End" on his cellular and looks at Mace
The first-time impact of the Squid experience, and the killing of Jeriko, still haunts her
We've never seen Mace scared
But she looks scared now
We got to make another copy of this
Little life insurance
You know what this tape could do if it gets out
(tucking Glock in his waistband) 've got a good idea, yeah
People finding out
seeing
that the  just flat out executed Jeriko One
Jesus
Maybe they ought to see
Maybe
But tonight is probably not the best night
Come on, we're rollin'
: '  - Cecile catches them on the steps as they are leaving
Lornette, when you gonna stop laying off everything on me
We had plans tonight-- (steely) Listen to me, little sister
There's something going on, and it's very big
Now you've got to take care of Zander
And stay off the streets tonight
you hear me on this
Cecile gets the message
She nods
Curtis
What about you
Do we understand each other
You stay put
Yeah
'm wit it
Mace and Lenny go on down the steps to the car
(to Cecile) Damn
She worse than you
: /
- Lenny and Mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver the dark streets
Xenon searchlights crisscross the rooftops nearby
They see patrol cars passing on cross- streets, lights flashing
It feels like the entire is looking for them
Everywhere in the street there are small crowds, street parties in progress
People drinking and firing bottle rockets
The police watch everything
So, let's see, 've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the all trying to kill me
Happy new year, Lenny
Well, look at the plus side
There's a plus side
Yeah
You gave up your hot tub tape to save me
That's real progress for you
It was a tough call
still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops
don't think those cops did Iris
think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her
Why
To break the trail
If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too
Our killer is running as scared as we are
Which makes him really dangerous
Judging by how scared  am
They pull up to the checkpoint; Lenny squirrels into the seat, hiding in the shadows, as Mace flashes her security pass and the cop waves them on
Lenny lets his breath out slowly
: /' Lenny and Mace pull in with a  of brakes and park the car
Sound of rock music -- some kind of refried psychedelia -- coming from Tick's van down the ramp
Mace and Lenny get out, approaching the van
Hearing tires squeal, they turn to see Max pull up
He gets out wearing an ill-fitting rental tux
Music louder, echoing in the empty garage, even though the van is shut tight
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating
You may be a little overdressed for this party
(Lenny pounds on the van door) Yo, Tick
It's Lenny
Open up
Mace slips out her
380, on alert
(knocks again, then opens rear van door) Tick,  got to talk to you, man
oh shit
Tick's slumped in the back of the van with playback trodes on his head
He's breathing, but otherwise he's still
Near lifeless
cyborg after a power outage
All the equipment in the van is trashed
(as he starts to examine Tick) He's been cooked-off Is he dead
No
But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs
They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain
Mace hits "Off" on the built-in  player
The sudden silence is creepy
Lenny gets right in front of Tick's eyes, shouting at him, at the top of his lungs
' : We see a roaring blizzard of inchoate static
Somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of Lenny's face, almost invisible
We hear the tiniest ghost of his voice, like a radio playing two blocks away
He's totally cut off from the outer world
How long does it last
(off Lenny's look) Oh
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks
This seems a little sophisticated for them
These are not subtle guys
There's more to this whole thing than you think
Whattya mean
All 'm saying
you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes
've heard stuff
What stuff
Smoke
Rumors
've heard stuff about a death squad
group a guys loyal to the hardline school
Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands
while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control
Lenny takes this in
All the fight goes out of him
This is just too overwhelming
Jesus
Yeah
So don't walk near me in public, alright
Thanks, buddy
See
things weren't bad enough
They weren't fucking bad enough
The only card we have to play is the tape
You know, we get it to the media somehow
Yeah, right, blow it open
(interrupting) Mace
no disrespect
but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history
They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada
Okay
what about Strickland
No
Bad idea
Who's Strickland
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland
The sanctimonious prick who busted me out
His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it
know this guy
If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him
Listen to me, Lenny
stay away from cops
All cops
You have no way of knowing who you can trust
Mace looks from one to the other with a growing expression of outrage
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen
It happened
The executed one of the most important black men in America
Who the fuck are you to bury this
Fine
Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains
The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground
And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves
It'll be all- out war and you know it
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war
You really want that on your head
Hey, Max, Mace
whoa
time out
/ (together/annoyed) What
Whoever killed Iris did Tick
It's the same sick wirehead shit
Same reason
to burn the trail
If Faith knows anything about this, and think she does, then she's on the list
So
who's driving
: / - Roadies are loading out gear through the back doors of the club into a van in the alley
Lenny and Mace and we follow them between the roadies, going through the doors into
grungy black corridor
The thunder of music gets louder with each step as Lenny and Mace walk down the corridor with purposeful strides
Through chainlink partitions and banks of dark equipment, Lenny catches glimpses of the stage
He can see Faith in a blue-white spotlight
She is a whirling dervish, convulsing with the divine madness of her music
Beyond her, beyond the lights, in the gloom
Lenny can just see Tran and his entourage
Dressed in tuxes, they look out of place
clearly on their way somewhere else as the evening progresses
Faith whirls to a stop as the band crashes in a final downbeat
The spotlight goes out and the set is over
, clapping
Watching
, Max arrives through the crowd, scanning for Tran
spotting him
, bathed in sweat, walking along a dark corridor backstage
, as she walks through the shadows, like a fighter returning from the ring, soaked and breathing hard
shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth, pulling her into the shadows
Terrified for a split second
before she recognizes that it is Lenny
He pulls her into the room and closes the door
It is Tex Arcana's  control room, full of monitors and constantly changing graphic images
Tex is not there
Lenny
Jesus
You scared the Hell out of me
Faith sees that Mace is standing there, in the shadows, waiting
She turns back to Lenny with a frown
What's going on
Faith, we know about Jeriko
Iris made me a copy of the tape
Oh God, Lenny
was trying to keep you out of this
But she seems relieved now that he knows, now that there is someone to talk to
How did it happen
What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire
We should talk alone
No
Mace is in this
Tell us
Tran's gotten obsesses with playback, a total wiretrip junkie
And he's such a control freak, he's been having people followed, videotaped
recording his business partners' calls
Wiring up people left and right
: / Tran looks at his watch and gets up from the table, impatient
Let's go get her
We're late
Max shows up suddenly, right in front of him
Stopping him
Tran, listen
was wondering how you want me to work it tonight, down at the Bonaventure
You want me downstairs at the party or upstairs at the suite
Where you going to be, mostly
: ' While Max stalls, Faith talks
Tran and Jeriko weren't getting along
He was afraid Jeriko was getting ready to dump him, but he wasn't sure, so he started with the surveillance
couple nights ago he wires up Iris and sends her and the other girl, Diamanda, over to Jeriko's table
:   , Iris, wearing a wig, leaves Tran's table with Diamanda and moves toward
a booth in the Retinal Fetish where Jeriko One sits with Replay
Iris stands over Jeriko for just a moment
Then he nods, smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in the booth right next to him
That night Iris calls up, freaking
She comes over and Tran watches the tape
He just loses it
He can't believe the disaster she's gotten him into
He's terrified the cops will beat it out of her who she was working for, and come looking for him
: '  as a tear-streaked and frantic Iris is telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her (we don't hear)
Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin- lipped with rage
She crumples to the floor, sobbing
Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's poison
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch
Why didn't he just go public with the tape
Save himself that way
: An image of Tran burning the squid tape
It blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like a venomous snake
The scandal would wipe him out
If it got out that he had his own artists under surveillance
he'd lose all his other acts
He'd be over
Now we see Tran, more composed, comforting Iris
He wipes at her tear-streaked face
Hands her a wad of bills
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do
Yeah
he figured out what to do all right
You think Tran killed her
The killer knew right where she was
Because he put her there
What a nightmare
: Tran impatiently gestures to Corto
Go get her, Joey
Stupid bitch
(to Max) We'll talk about this later
: ' Mace is getting the sixth sense feeling that seconds count
Come on
We're out of here
Lenny gets close to Faith, taking her face in his hands
Leave here with me, right now
Mace sighs heavily, rolls her eyes toward the ceiling
Faith considers her options
Then she smiles at him
Okay, Lenny
My guardian angel
Faith hugs him, and he clutches her
Mace locks her jaw and looks away
This is hard for her
: Mace leads the way, with Lenny following, gripping Faith's hand like Orpheus leading Eurydice out of Hell
They push through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor
Half-lit, in alcoves, far-gone wireheads loll in semi- consciousness
Faith looks back and sees: '  rounding a corner
spotting them
They start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking protesting people out of the way
Mace, Lenny and Faith break into a run, pounding down the corridor
Behind them, Duncan leads the charge
Suddenly shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path with his wheelchair
Duncan crashes over him, toppling the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor
Vita, Beemer and Corto go around the sprawl
Tex, like many legless men, has incredibly strong arms
Lenny looks back to see him pounding Duncan's head against the floor
Teach you
(pound) to mess with
(pound) a helpless cripple
Lenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobe-flashes and a wall of sound
Behind them we see Corto and Beemer hurling partiers aside, cutting a swath, while Vita moves like a mongoose through tall grass
Mace drops back, going tail-end- Charlie
her bodyguard mode kicking in
, charging through the jostling crowd, Lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and
is right in front of him
In the whirling shapes and colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a white tux
He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the bottle in the other
In one lightning-fast move he uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw
Faith screams as Lenny staggers
Tran swings again, smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head
Lenny sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass
Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted viciously behind her back
They go around a chain-link divider and double back, heading for the exit
Lenny staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as Faith passes within a few inches of him
He slips down the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost in the pounding darkness
Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a cat as the Posse arrives
She stands guard over him like a rabid dog, her
380 auto straightarmed and covering them expertly
Corto eyes her with hatred
The stitches on his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his last run-in with her
He backs off
(to the others) Not here
Lets go
They back off, fading into the crowd
catching up with Tran at the exit
Mace watches them recede
Then she bends to Lenny
Max arrives a moment later and they lift him to his feet
: / - Max and Mace support a semi-conscious Lenny, hustling him to the car
As they are putting him in the car, come through the crowd, eyeing the bleeding Lenny
Everything's cool
Too much to drink
Lenny picks this moment to slump sideways, falling half out of the car
The squid tape of the Jeriko kill falls out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement
Mace's eyes go wide
The boot of one of the cops is inches from it
Yeah, uh
he slipped on the stairs
We're taking him to emergency
(to the nearest cop) Excuse me
The cop steps back, giving Mace room to push Lenny back up in the seat
She surreptitiously kicks the tape under the car, over to the driver's side
Go to Cedars
It's closest
Mace nods and goes around the car
Max starts asking them questions and the cops turn away, distracted
She picks up the tape and gets in
Closes the door
Let's out a big breath
: /  - line of expensive cars waiting to valet park
Tran's limo jumps the line and swoops up parallel to the elevator doors
The posse get out, scowling at the valet who swallows his protest
Tran emerges, helping Faith out with a firm grip on her arm which he does not release as they head for the elevators
They push through a group waiting for an elevator
men in tuxes, women in gowns and diamonds
The elevator opens and Tran's entourage sweeps inside
Beemer and Duncan block any civilians from entering
They ride in silence a moment
Faith is pale, her jaw clenching
Tran has her arm in a tight grip
There is a march-to-the-gallows feel about the moment
Well, 'm certainly in the mood for a party
(to Wade) Take her up to the suite
(to Faith) Have a glass of champagne
or six
'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year
live for the moment
The elevator doors open, revealing
The heart of the
New Year's ball glitterati event in full swing
Red carpet, minicam lights and paparazzi
Limos pulling up outside four deep
Movie stars rubbing elbows with politicos, music movers and shakers chatting with city hall types
This is a party to celebrate the millennium, sure, but its main function is to celebrate the celebrants: if you're here, there's no need to be anywhere else
There is a heavy police presence, as well as lots of private security
Tran exits the elevator with Vita Minh, Joey Corto and Duncan
They wedge through the crowd, Tran smiling
Nodding to people he knows
: '  - Lenny is in a chair in the kitchen, listening to Max on the cellular
He is holding a dish-towel full of ice cubes on his scalp
It is soaked with blood and his Armani jacket and silk shirt are spattered
Mace lifts the ice pack to check that the bleeding has stopped
You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass motherfucker, you know that
She slaps the ice pack back down
Owww
Take it easy
(to phone) Uh huh
So where are they now
: / , leaning against a pillar
He looks over his shoulder, around the column
' : through a dense throng of glitterati we see Tran and his entourage seated at a table, holding court with music types and politicos
He's got her up in the room, under guard
And he's still working the party
acting smooth like nothin's nothin'
So buddy
say we work a trade
(
) What do you mean
Give him the tape
See
It's fucking brilliant
The tape for Faith
know he'll go for it can set it up
(
) This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right
Come on
If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all
Whattya say
(same old Max) Just get your butt down here
If 'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room
It's 2203
You writin'
: On Lenny, at the table
He dabs his finger in the blood on the ice pack and writes the number on the table top
2-2-0-3
Got it
Stay on her
(
) intend to
Lenny punches
Mace looks at the number written in blood on the white formica
Her eyes ratchet up, boring into Lenny
Not noticing, he gets up, still woozy, and staggers to his wardrobe bag across the room
Okay, we gotta get over there
(opens the bag) Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something-- 'm not going
Whatya mean
We're going
Tran's gonna do her right there unless-- Lenny
shutup
Just park your mouth and listen
It's a set-up
Think about it
Why's he been sending you tapes
To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking
Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand
crime of passion
This guy's bent enough to think of that
Lenny nods, hearing what she is saying
That sounds right
(but it changes nothing) 'm going
He reaches into his wardrobe bag
pulling out the box of "Faith" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the suit
Mace's frustration explodes as anger
She grabs his shoebox full of tapes
Holds them up to him
You gonna get yourself killed for this
This toxic-waste bitch
She dumps the box of tapes on the floor
She starts stomping on them with one heel, crunching several into junk
What the fuck are you doing
Lenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up, trying to stop her, push her away
They struggle for a pathetic, tragic moment
Mace snaps
She grabs him by the lapels and swings him around, slamming him back against a wall
Lenny
This is your life, Lenny
Right here
Right now
This is realtime
not playback
Real
time
Time to get real
Understand what 'm saying
she doesn't love you
Maybe she did once,  don't know, but she doesn't now
These are used emotions
It's time to trade them in
Mace's tone becomes more gentle
We see that her outburst is, beneath it all, coming from a place of compassion
Lenny, memories were meant to fade
They're designed that way for a reason
Lenny seems to crumple
He knows he has to let go
But it is so painful
Have you ever been in love with somebody who didn't return that love
Mace gives him a look like, jeez Lenny, are you dumb sometimes
Yeah
Lenny
have
It didn't stop you from loving them
Right
Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them
guess
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them
Did it
No
It didn't
Lenny's eyes are brimming with tears
He makes no attempt to hide it
doesn't brush them away
worked Vice, Narcotics
Violent Crimes
and  saw every known depravity
was lost, Mace
In outer darkness
Then  busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker
When  met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank
Another lost soul
You never told me
But she was different
There was a light in her eyes
and she had this voice
It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body
Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice
helped her
And  promised her that 'd always be there
to protect her
(long pause) See
It's not about what's in her head
It's what's in mine
can't let go of the promise
It's
like
it's all  have left
No, it's not
Mace takes his face in her hands
She kisses him lightly on the cheek, where the tear-track is
Come on, Lenny
Let's go to a party
: - 11:07
we see there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of downtown
Arc lights sweep the sky
There are two outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding
There are lasers, strobe-lights
People are literally dancing in the streets
if they can move at all
Huge projection video screens are set up all over the place
is connected to other cities all over the world by satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time zones
The excitement has been building all evening as midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast
It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia blow-out
Madness in the streets
And Lenny and Mace are stuck in it
The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial Mardi Gras
People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as they go by, or press their faces against the glass
It may be the party of the century, but it looks like the middle of a third world revolution
That's it
Let's bail
And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the protesting horns behind her
And we see that she's wearing a short black cocktail dress
Lenny comes around the car, through the wild crowd
He's in his other suit
Snappy
Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her 380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg
She pulls the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between her upper thighs
In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a quarter anywhere on her body
The dress is cut low at the top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular legs
High heels doing great things for her calves
Her braids now loose and full, like a mane
Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take
He is caught by a sudden realization: Mace
you're a girl
Good, Lenny
can see why the detective gig didn't work out
Come on
They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity
Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the fore
The whole street is vacuum-packed with people
Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an unparted Red Sea of man and machine
They will move through the various strata of society as they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum
It is like all of , from poorest to richest, compressed into a few square blocks
There are cops everywhere
Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear
Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance
metal detectors, cops
plus you have to have a 500 dollar-a-plate ticket
Got your ticket
No
They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake
Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace follows
They pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty feet away, his back to them
: It is
His black eyes scan the crowd
: moving with purpose through the vast steaming factory of the kitchen where a thousand dinners are being prepared
They are ignored by the bustling staff
: Lenny and Mace emerge from a service door into the glitterati crowd, heading into the ballroom
They scan the room
You see Tran
Uh unh
Lenny whips out his cellular and recalls Max's number
He hears the phone connect
It starts to ring
'
as the crowd parts for a moment
He sees talking to a city-hall type
Lenny turns away before Strickland sees him
(to the ringing phone) Come on, Max
Come on, buddy
(two more rings) Damnit
He looks around now
Starting to feel the creeping edge of panic
No Tran
No Max
Alright
We're going up
And do what
Take on his whole posse
still got one ace to play
Tran's got what  want
and 've got what he wants
Lenny pulls the Jeriko tape out of his breast-pocket and holds it up
Mace just stares at him completely outraged
That's the original
There are no copies
(not getting it) Exactly
That's why it's a make- able deal
Mace gets very, very close to Lenny, and her voice drops to an odd, cold
lethal-sounding
growl
Look
That tape is a lightning bolt from God
It's worth more than you, more than me, more than Faith
You understand
It can change things
Things that need changing before we all go off the end of the road
And you do not have the right to use it for currency
(Lenny's eyes are wide) You go
you go alone
This is where  draw the line
care about you Lenny
a lot more than you know
which makes us both pretty stupid
But you pawn that tape, you mean nothing to me
Lenny doesn't know what to say
Tough choice
He clenches his jaw
And turns away
He strides into the crowd, heading for the lobby and the elevators
, watching him go
Wanting to run and stop him
But she's said what there is to say
She turns away, desolate and churning with emotion
The moment lengthens as she wrestles with it
You see her fury, her sadness
and her protective instincts
Her resolve fails her
Ultimately, she must protect him if she can
Ah, hell
Lenny-- She turns, running toward the lobby
And
Slams into him
He came back
Lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm
Closes her fingers on it
See that guy
(pointing) The one with the ramrod up his ass
That's Strickland
Mace follows his look to Strickland, across the room
Take it to him
cop
You want me to trust a cop
No
Trust me
He unclips his playback deck from his belt and hands it to her
(nodding slowly) Oh boy
(she takes a deep breath) What if you're wrong
Then we'll be right where we are now
Yeah, right
Fucked
: It is a glass-cage scenic elevator, running up the outside of the building
10th floor
The last passengers step out
When the doors whoosh closed and Lenny's left alone there's only the sound of Muzak Christmas carols
The elevator rises, the lights of  spread out below
He is hyperventilating
: Mace threads her way past tables circling a dance floor full of dancers and makes her way through celebs air- kissing each other
But as she gets near Strickland's table, he stands up and excuses himself
He starts toward the men's room
And Mace follows him
: ' / few guys in tuxes tending to themselves
Strickland enters, crossing to a urinal
He unzips
Mace steps up beside him
Guys behind her looking on, slack-jawed
Mace pays no attention to them
Strickland, stern and flinty-eyed, raises one eyebrow
Yes
She puts the playback deck on top of Strickland's urinal
He scowls
There's a tape in there you need to see
mean right now
While see is looking at Strickland, a young comes out of a stall, and goes to the sink
He glances in the mirror at Mace
If it wasn't New Year's Eve, 'd arrest you for possession of illegal equipment-- (interrupting) Just look at the tape
You want to know who killed Jeriko One
Go in the stall right now and hit Play
The young cop steps up behind her
Sir, is there a problem here
Mace turns
Oh shit
She backs away from them
Damn
knew it-- Strickland motions with his eyes and the cop grabs for her
Mace twists viciously out of his grip, knocks him down and vanishes out the door
hefts the recorder, pondering it
His expression is opaque
: / Lenny comes out of the elevator
Standing at the corner, where he can watch the elevators and the corridor, is Wade Beemer
Lenny doesn't break stride
Just walks toward Beemer
He's not afraid anymore
He's pissed off
Beemer moves toward him
Now, Wade, can we talk here, like two human beings-- We think he's starting the usual negotiation
But when he gets in range he lets fly with a line-drive right, straight into Beemer's face
We're talking a John Wayne haymaker punch
He staggers back, surprised and dazed, and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can
He drops to his knees, sucking wind
Lenny draws his Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of handcuffs off his belt
Okay, we're starting to believe he might have been a cop once
It's not personal
: Mace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past the tables when
she's grabbed by
He gets her in a good tight come-along
Like any good security person, the hold is not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted
steps up next to her, closing ranks
around behind the bandstand
Joey Corto walks up to her, looking mean and smug
Mace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur
Her open palm breaks Corto's nose with an audible crunch
Corto screams and grabs his face
Aw, not the fucking nose
She slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt
He keeps the hold
Mace drives her free hand back into the approximate position of his nuts
Even though Duncan looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired effect
Mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a buffet table
Vita draws a knife in a lightning move but
Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in her face
Vita says the smartest line of the night
Hey, enjoy the party
Mace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her gun innocuously tight to her side
She spots a red "Exit" sign above a fire door and goes through
: / Lenny closes the stairwell door, giving us a quick glimpse of Beemer handcuffed to the steel railing
Lenny moves down the empty corridor
He approaches suite 2203
The door is ajar
Always a bad sign
: - Mace finds herself back in the millennium madness, among the street crowd who don't even notice her
She holsters the gun and moves away from possible pursuit
The sky explodes with purple light as huge fireworks go off overhead
crack like thunder follows
Then more flashes
The countdown to midnight has begun
The party is building to a crescendo
It seems to have a surreal, nightmarish quality
She passes a  in a clock suit, who keeps adjusting the hands closer to midnight
: 2203 As Lenny enters the suite
It is very quiet
Dark
Lenny's heart is pounding
He moves through the luxurious suite, gun in the low-ready position
Lenny can barely breathe from the tension
He notices that one balcony door is open
The roar of the crowd comes in like the sound of surf from far below
Fireworks explode across the sky, and the cheers sound like distant screams of slaughter
His feet crunch on broken glass
a shattered champagne bottle
lamp is knocked over
He reaches the door to the bedroom and looks in
The room is empty
The bed is unmade, the bedspread and sheet pulled off
This isn't right
None of this is right
: / Mace is scanning warily as she circles the hotel, looking for a way back in
She turns and sees  in the crowd, not twenty feet from her
He is looking right at her
Not recognizing her for a moment
Then
he realizes who she is
He starts toward her and Mace pushes people out of the way, breaking into a run
Engelman charges after her, pulling out his rover to call Spreg
: / Lenny looks back at the living room
Suddenly he notices something on the coffee table
It is an envelope, with hand-printed on it
He is drawn to it, hypnotically
He opens it
and with a nightmarish sense of destiny a falls out into his hand
: - Now both Spreg and Engelman are stalking Mace through the crowd
Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn
He hammers through anybody that gets in his way
Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian runner
Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead of her
a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a doll (New Year's Baby) in the other
Death watches her pass
: / , moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on his head
as his finger punches down
we approach room 2203
It is the familiar monochromatic vision of the killer
Our hands open the door quietly with a keycard
We enter the suite
Some of the lights are on
We see Faith out on the balcony
Watching the sea of madness below
She comes back in, carrying an empty champagne glass
She grabs a bottle off an end-table and up-ends it
Empty
She hurls it across the room, and it shatters against the wall
We approach her, standing with her back to us
Closer
Only a few feet now
She whips around, startled
Gasping loudly
But then
she recognizes the wearer
Oh
didn't hear you come in
, in a blast of static
Lenny jerks at the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up
:  new image resolves out of static
Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed
We climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps
We turn her onto her back
She has been blindfolded
The Wearer goes warning
Like the hiss of a snake
Our hands seize her wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at the head of the bed
The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set of trodes
They are placed on her head
the spidery gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair
' guts have turned to water
He is shaking his head in horror
No, no, no
we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow plastic razor knife
The blade clicks out to its full length
Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open, starting between her breasts and going down out of sight
She groans, squirming away from the cold knife
The killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body, which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory
The knife deftly cuts off her panties
We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her hips, pulling her to us
, gagging
Overcome by revulsion and horror, mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from the tape
as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck
Faith begins to pant in tiny rapid breaths
We tighten the belt slowly
tears the trodes from his head
He clutches his stomach, gasping for breath
Carrying the playback deck, he staggers into the bedroom
to the bed
He stares wildly around the room
One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored
In the mirror he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed
It is covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form, propped up against the wall on the far side of the night stand
He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom door
Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a trembling hand
With horrified apprehension he pulls on the sheet
It reveals the head and upper body of
Tran Vo
The last thing he expected
Lenny leans close and sees that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant
He looks like Tick did
Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on
The fireworks and screaming outside sound like some nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an end
But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape
He hits
where it left off
Faith's body lurches with the Wearer's thrusts
His hand tightens the belt
Lenny feels the climax building
Faith's body shakes as the killer comes
she cries out herself, in pain
or is it
The killers hand releases the belt
We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning
Suddenly the  whips sideways to the mirrored closet doors along one wall
In the mirror is a reflection of the bed and on it Faith
And on her
Pants down, her legs pulled up around him
They are both gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering orgasms
He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly
is stunned beyond his power to imagine
He does not have the strength or the will to stop the tape
Max's hands remove her blindfold
She looks right at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure
Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her
She reaches for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust
We slump forward onto her, and her face fills the
love you
Lenny is reeling with these revelations
His best friend is the killer
And the woman he loved loves him
But the tape is not over
as Max's eyes whip around in response to a sound behind them
The bedroom door is opening
Tran is standing there, stunned
Maybe the first time he's ever been surprised in his life
What a way to start
Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our
45 from the night stand and whipping around
putting the muzzle right in Tran's face
We pull him roughly across the room, too stunned to resist
You're going to die, you're both going to fucking die
We slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag
Using the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor with his back to the mirror
Our eyes whip to Faith
She is freaking out
We see Max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking fast
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby
Do you believe that
Isn't that right, Tran
You pinhead
Oh my God
don't believe this is happening
Believe it
Now bring me the trodes, baby
Come on, quick
What're you going to do
Still in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes
Max puts the trodes on Tran's head, then pulls something out of his pocket
It is a booster box
He plugs it into the deck
He takes the gain control and cranks it all the way up
He's setting up a cook-off
Tran's eyes go wide when he figures that out, starts to splutter
You can't just
kill him
'm not
Just a little poach job
Jesus
Hey, he was going to kill you
And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass
Tran freaks at that point but Max jams the gun deep into his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his words
You shut the fuck up, right now, 'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger
-
Faith shrieks, thinking Max shot him
But it's just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this has already happened relative to Lenny entering the suite)
Look, baby, it's now of never
the guy is a known input junkie, so a little  won't surprise anybody
It's the only way we can be together
You know it's true
My God
We don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is about to happen, or to the realization that she has the capacity to let it happen
Here's how much  love you, baby
She stares, transfixed, as Max reaches for the deck
He punches
Max puts his hand over Tran's mouth to muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a screaming chainsaw of static from Hell
The screaming outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special madness
The  turns, looking out the window
staring fixedly at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks
Like the fireworks inside Tran's head
Lenny takes off the trodes
He is wrung out, drenched with sweat
We see that there is a figure standing in the doorway behind him
Lenny turns, not surprised to see Max there with his
45 aimed at Lenny's chest
Max's surgical gloves look incongruous with his tux
Don't make any assumptions about our friendship, Lenny
Lenny stands up, slowly
No
suppose not
didn't know you were colorblind, Max
Only way  could stand your ties
Max moves up to him cautiously, and takes the Glock out of Lenny's waistband
'll have that
Glock 22
Nice
Where's Faith
sent her to the party
figured 'd wait up here until you killed Tran
What makes you think 'm gonna kill Tran
Max looks out the window at the fireworks
Waits for a flash, knowing that the bang will follow
Keeping his own 45 on Lenny, he aims Lenny's Glock at the catatonic Tran
One right into Tran's forehead
The crack of thunder from the fireworks masks the sound
You just did
Jesus
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die
Shit being number one
Max sticks Lenny's Glock in his waistband, keeping his own 45 trained on Lenny
Lenny knows the next bullet is for him
He does what he does best
talk
So
killed Tran
Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me
That's pretty much the way it happened
in the living room, moving silently up to the edge of the door frame
She looks through the crack between the door and the jam
Her : Max with the gun on Lenny
Wait a minute
Now 'm remembering
killed Iris too, didn't
That's right
They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment
The one  left for you at the club was a copy
Was  a really busy guy
Did  do Tick too
You bet
Did you like it
Lenny drops the cutesy role
So why Max
why d'ya have to do Iris
She never hurt anybody
, reacting to this
Picture it
feel like  gotta share this with somebody
It's too perfect
won't say anything
know
So, 'm working for this puke, right
And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker
But also  gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control
Lenny nods
Starting to see it
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith
So  say to myself, if turn the job down, he just gets somebody else
And  lose Faith
to coin a phrase
So to buy time, do the skank
still gotta do something about Tran
figure it's him or me
but  can't cap him without a chump to take the fall
And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend
a known criminal
who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend
No plan is perfect, Lenny
Hey, cheer up
World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway
You must be so pleased,  followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump
You got froggy on me a couple times
: The Underground Garage, where Tick has been cooked-off
We see Max running his number on Mace and Lenny
Lenny buying it
(
) thought that riff about the Death Squad was pretty good
hadda keep you from bringing the cops into it
again to
So there never was a death squad
Naawww
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts
Yeah
Pretty zany, huh
All this shit caused by a random traffic stop
Hey
nothing means nothing
You know that
Look around
the whole planet's in total chaos
You gotta take what you can, while you can
Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin'
22 in the back a your head any second
:  brief, violent flash from the Jeriko tape: Spreg shoots Jeriko
How did you hook up with Faith
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right
But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me
'  say, ''ll buy you a drink and explain
' And she says
'So, do you enjoy watching me
' Max turns and sees her in the doorway
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby
know
don't always do exactly what 'm told
(she walks slowly toward them) So  said, 'Do you enjoy watching me
'  And you said -- come on Max
said, 'Yeah
'd even do it for free
' Uh huh
And  said, 'That's good, because  like the feeling of someone watching me
acquired the taste from Lenny
' Lenny looks between Faith and Max, feeling like the asshole of the western world
Faith moves up close to Max
She puts her hands lightly on his shoulders, caressing them
Max grins, realizing she is 100% with him
(to Lenny) And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--' 'We might as well make the best of it
' (crushed) Jesus, Faith
Faith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders and arms
Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in both hands and deflects the gun
Lenny
Lenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun
Faith pulls the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the room
Fucking bitch
Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face
Faith grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away
His "hair" comes off in her hands
prosthetic wig, containing the squid-net array
Max's head is shaved to a Sinead 'Connor stubble
He looks demonic, grimacing with effort as he struggles with Lenny
He continues firing
The shots hit the mirrors of the reflected images of them shattering
Faith, screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards
The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on them from above
Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry
Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into the doorframe
They tumble together into the living room, falling together over the couch
Lenny pounds Max's hand against the glass coffee table, shattering it
He forces Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops the gun
Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a split-second before his hand touches it
It skitters under the couch, out of play
Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut, and grabs him with both hands
He hurls him against the wall
Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious punches from Max
We feel the tide turning
Lenny goes down to one knee
Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open
Lenny throws a lamp
Max ducks and charges through
Lenny spins away from the downthrust
The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into the bone
Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away, pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand
Max tackles him and they crash together through a sliding glass door onto the balcony
Explosion of flying glass
Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him backward toward the railing
At the last instant, Lenny twists with all his strength and spins Max into the railing, using his weight against him
He pushes hard and Max topples
As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him over
Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie
Lenny has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he is being strangled by the tie
Lenny is starting to black out
In agony he gropes with his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the handle of the knife
He jerks it out of himself
Max sees it coming a split second before it happens
Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's hands
Max takes the express elevator to Hell
He hits 12 stories down, on top of a video truck
Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his jacket
Faith runs to the railing and looks down
All the strength goes out of her legs
She sags to the floor
Fireworks continue to boom across the sky
Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his quest
She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her
He turns and walks away
It's hard
But he keeps walking
: - , in the madness of the crowd, we move with Spreg as he searches for Mace
He sees her from behind, walking near one of the stages
He moves up behind her, aiming his pistol at the back of her head
She turns and
it isn't Mace
Another girl in a similar dress
Spreg curses and looks around
Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running
He points to her position and Spreg charges after her
He has his baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people out of the way as he runs
Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people out of her way
Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look
Spreg fires at her
People drop, their screams drowned out by the pandemonium
The gunshots don't register above the concussions from the fireworks
No one notices the shootings
Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people block his shots
Mace won't fire back in the crowd
, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting tower
He has lost sight of her
He starts to reload his pistol
Mace comes up to him silently from behind the tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt of her pistol
Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across her forearm
Her
380 clatters to the ground
Mace bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her palm up under his chin
His head raps off the metal
Mace is like a she-panther
She rips the baton out of his hands and cracks him once across the windpipe
He drops to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe
shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head
She spins to see Engelman, charging toward her
Before he can fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg, using him as a human wall
She clamps an arm around his neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt
She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet
He convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping like a fish
She holds the current on him while she goes over and kicks his gun away
She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt
Spreg glares at her through the blood running into his eyes
She raises the baton
All the way down
He slowly drops to the pavement, face down
Now that she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's
The crowd of partiers stares
Can't believe what they're seeing
Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other wrist to the base of the tower
That's when in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and see a black girl crouching over two of 's finest with a police baton
The cops advance toward her
Wait
Let me tell you what's going on here-- The nearest shoots her with a tazer
She spasms and goes to her hands and knees
One of the cops kicks her down
She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the breath as the batons start to fall
The crowd around them watches fascinated, gasping
Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg
They crack her with their batons, telling her to stay down
Another one kicks her in the stomach
in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking cops
And then they come out of the crowd
one, then three, then half a dozen
Just normal people
black, white, Latino people
that can't watch this happen any more
They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down
It becomes a brawl
Then cops are running in from everywhere
We see the trigger point of a full-scale riot
Cops in full riot- gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a space
helicopter  comes straight down from above, like the divine light of God
Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up
Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on the way, forming a human wall
They get the crowd settled down
Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland and several ranking officers
He surveys the scene
Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still handcuffed to each other and the steel tower
The beat extends
Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses
Then
He points at the two prone cops
(to the nearest officers) These two are under arrest for murder
Strickland looks Spreg in the eye and holds up Lenny's squid tape
Spreg and Engelman react, knowing they are over
The helicopter Xenon gives the whole moment an otherworldly quality
Like they are in some celestial court of judgment
Get some medical attention for this woman
Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland
He runs to Mace and kneels next to her
Are you okay
trickle of blood runs down her face
She nods weakly and reaches for him
They hug, then they both wince in pain
Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and Engelman
One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower
got 'em, Lenny
, grabbing a gun from the holster of the closest cop
He waves them back with it
Then puts it in his mouth and fires
He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting blood
Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground, bathing in his blood
You see him going insane, right at that moment
His face is suddenly demonic
, the street-monster cop,
His glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace
He has Engelman's gun in one blood-drenched hand
Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace
He keeps the pistol down along his side
Spreg exists at the center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do
He has a gun so they can't rush him
But he's a cop, so they can't shoot him
Several officers shout at him to drop the weapon
You barely hear them over the pandemonium of the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks
Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg, completely unhinged, lurches toward them
Engelman's body slides over the ground, leaving a snail-track of blood a foot wide
He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and
Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take the fire, and
The  executes Spreg in a hail of fire
He drops like a sack of cement
The smoke clears
Lenny blinks
realizing he is alive
He faints
Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot
He opens his eyes
Yeah, what
Mace and Lenny are being escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of cops who part the rowdy mob before them
Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up
Lenny's arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound
They support each other like two soldiers after a battle
Mace sees Faith
, escorted by a couple of cops, passing near them
She is in handcuffs and her eyes are dull
Mace turns back to Lenny
Are we under arrest
Naw
They just have to ask us a few questions
for about six hours
They pass , with the (plastic)  still in his arms
Life out of Death in the endless continuum
Lenny pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past
They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance
The guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit jacket
Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad car
Lenny sees
The  , who smiles at him and puts his hands at midnight
We hear a roar passing through the crowd huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight
Lenny and Mace look around
the wonder of it sinking in
Mace and Lenny let it wash over them
the deliverance from darkness
The exultation of the moment flows through them as the people lift their voices in a great cheer
Balloons are released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard
Couples grab each other and kiss passionately
(grinning) Hey, Lenny
We made it
Yeah
We did
She hugs him
Then pulls back
Friends
yes
And always
But there's that line that she can't cross
Only he can do that
Well
(she shrugs) Get going
You're still bleeding
See you downtown
Yeah
See you there
as he walks toward the ambulance
They open the back door for him
The walk is hallucinatory
with confetti falling like snow, and the hysteria of the crowd
He looks back at Mace as the paramedics help him up into the ambulance
The back doors close
, watching him go
cop gently takes her arm, opening the squad car door for her
She turns away, her face sad amid the exultation of the crowd
She gets into the back seat
The door slams
Strickland gets in next to her
The driver starts the car
They start to move, and
There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and
The door is wrenched open
hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out
Lenny
His eyes are full of emotion
He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her
like there's no tomorrow
She grabs his head and won't let him break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't
Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his watch
Reflex
Because if there's one time you don't need a watch, it's
12:01
1, 2000 as Lenny and Mace stay locked together, while the cops wait for them, and the world begins again
