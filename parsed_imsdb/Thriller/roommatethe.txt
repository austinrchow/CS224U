Written by Sonny Mallhi Revision by Frank Baldwin April 9, 2009 - Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm room
The room seems alive, somehow
As if it's waiting patiently for this year's kids
long beat
The room darkens for an instant
Just the sun, right, dipping behind a cloud
Maybe
- , we   a hallway full of
They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting
- , 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm
She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just above her shoulders
She's dressed casually, but still chic
No parents
She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the other, and a huge suitcase in her hand
And she's staring through the building's window at
Newly-minted   milling about inside
Their parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces
- Sara walks to the registration table smiles up at her
Hi
Sara Matthews
She looks her up in the computer
She plays with a simple silver chain around her neck
Des Moines, Iowa
Wow
Flyover country
She says it nicely, but it still stings
Sara smiles gamely
You're in room three-sixteen
Welcome
She hands Sara a room key
She fingers it, smiling

- Sara as she
Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels
She bumps into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off
Sara stops in front of Room 316
- She opens the door and looks in on: run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room
Tiny; bathroom down the hall; twin beds
Heaven
Sara steps in
She looks at the two empty beds
Big choice here
She drops her stuff on the bed by the window
She sits down on it
beat
'm really here
First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her duffle bag and sets it on the dresser
It's a picture of a , maybe ten
She looks a little like Sara
Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam   off the cart
It's full of pin and chalk marks
She sets it by her bed
Told you we'd make it
She steps back to the doorway
As she hauls her suitcase off the cart
Another cart slams into hers
box tumbles off the other cart
Sorry
Bad driver
Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair -- clean up the mess
slew of clothes lie on the carpet
And peeking out from under them
a bottle of vodka
The girl smiles sheepishly
In case of emergency
() 'm Tracy
Sara

Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands
- gorgeous fall day
Sara strolls across the quad, taking it all in
Kids tossing frisbees
hacky-sacking
sunning on the grass
Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm windows
- Sara's cell phone buzzes
She answers it
Hey
Yeah, it's amazing here
met this really cool biker
He's taking me to Mexico this weekend
() Hello
() Hi, Mom
Just tell him 'm kidding
Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop
She eyes a work/study ad on the wall
Everything's great
() No, she's not here yet so  got to choose my side of the room
She tears a tab off the flyer
- Establishing shot of Carnegie, a solid red-brick dorm
'  - Sara's half-settled in now
The wall beside her bed is peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style
She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair photo shoot
She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page
Sara walks over
She opens it expectantly to see
4
Tracy, Tracy's roommate , and two other
All dressed to party
Psi
's throwing a bash
Let's go
Psi
They're a frat
Beer
guys
don't know
might just hang and wait for my roommate
Groans all around
"Come on"
"Lame-"
Sara bites her lip, considering
She smiles
Alright
Just let me change
The girls cheer
- Establishing shot of a proud frat house
Students piled on a giant porch and there's a long line going up the steps to the front door
Music blasts out of the windows
- Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the head of the line, stepping into the house
They're met by a (motions to a crowded keg) If you want beer, 'll need 's
For a frat party
Seriously
He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands
Kim steps around him
don't drink anyway
Tracy looks at her, mouth agape
5
There's punch and non-alcoholic beer over there
He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups
No one is around it
Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer
Come on, just us
We won't tell
The bouncer is tempted but not budging
Honestly, 'm just a pledge
They'll kick me out
She stomps by him
Wuss
Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table
Turns back to Sara
You want something to drink
What's the point
Tracy huffs as Sara walks into
We're talking extreme fire hazard
extreme moral hazard
Sara moves through the crowd
Her clothes are low-wattage, but stylish
She's drawn to the music coming from a large room
-   on stage
They're not very good, but they don't care
Sara finds a spot along the wall and watches them
In particular -- cute goof, spastically whaling away
He's mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed
Really into it
Sara chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him
He definitely stands out
Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder
Tracy pulls herself in with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band
Juice spilling over the brim of her cup
Sara stays by the wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her
6
(yells over the music) Why aren't you dancing
To this
They're not that bad
Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd
Now all three start jumping up and down to the music
Sara's getting into it as Tracy chugs her drink
-   - rules the room now
Sara and Kim are dancing with others from the floor
Sara notices a speck of punch on her shirt
She stops dancing
Wets her fingers and tries to rub it out
Crap
Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around
Where's Tracy
She was getting more punch
Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing onto the stage next to the 's table with a bunch of other girls already dancing
She starts dancing suggestively, egging on the crowd
Uh oh
Guys yell out
"Show em
" Several hands armed with camera phones stretch out above the crowd
() Tracy
Tracy can't hear her
Sara starts making her way to the stage
Tracy is dancing, getting into it
She grabs the bottom of her shirt
Teases the crowd
7
() Tracy
Don't
Sara slams into , 21, the  from the band
who inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt
Sara gasps
Damn
Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd
Camera phones clicking all at once
Sara looks up
Oh
Woops
() have to go clean this up
She turns
Looks like my plan backfired
Sara turns back towards him
What plan
To spill beer on you so  can start a conversation
You spilled beer on me purposely
() You pissed
She looks at him
Pretty good looking
Goofy smile
It's hard to be mad at him
She then grabs a beer out of a dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen
'll get over it
He laughs, making her smile
8
'm not sure how she's so wasted
All she's had is punch
Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand
Come on
- Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of the punch
It's pretty good
She drinks some more
It doesn't taste that strong
Exactly
He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of hers
Stephen
By the way
Sara
-  : Stephen and Sara are dancing
She's holding her cup
Drinking, bumping into a couple of people
Stephen laughs, grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and  her, bringing her close
She notices, for the first time, that he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her other hand
Hey, why do you get to drink beer
Twenty-one
Old man
9
Tell me about it
My back is killing me
They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against his chest
Besides, frat brothers don't have to wear those ugly wristbands
Ugh
You're in this frat
He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people behind her
Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing, Holding up a cup of punch
() Did you try the punch
It's pretty good
What happened to Tracy
Kim shrugs
'm the worst roommate ever
Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which Stephen notices
Do you want to look for your friend
Sara looks at him sweetly
Nods
They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom of the stairs
Sara rushes over to her
couple frat boys stand over her
Not sure what to do with her
( ) got her
10
She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself
The frat boys notice her struggling
#1 Who's got you
Tracy nearly brings Sara down to the floor
But Stephen's there to catch her
Guess that would be me
But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both
Who's got you
Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm
The other arm around Sara's waist
() Apparently God
Sara rolls her eyes
- Sara, Stephen, and Tracy stumble into the dorm lobby
Sara wears a jacket Stephen gave her for the walk
Kim and step forward and grab Tracy
Thanks Sara
No problem
They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen
They step into the elevator
Holding it for Sara
You want us to wait
Sara turns and glares at Kim
An obvious "
" Kim lets the doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen
11
You know, 'm going to be pulling kitchen duty all week for helping girls leave a frat party
It's like opposite everything we stand for
Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss
Then separates, but her lips still very close to his
(low and romantic) Does that make it worth it
Honestly, no
She laughs out loud
Do you want to come up
( ) More than  can tell you, but that wouldn't be fair
Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket
He stops her
Keep it
till next time
Thanks again
For everything
() And, sorry about kitchen duty
He smiles
and walks away into the night
Sara looks after him
and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which suddenly makes her a little more queasy
- Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes
She reaches her door
She takes one more deep breath, then opens it
12
316 - Sara closes the door behind her
Almost pitch black; just a little moonlight through the window
Sara knocks into her lounge chair
Ow
She reaches her bed and plops down on her back
Breathing hard
Clenching her eyes shut
The room is spinning
She may puke at any second
She struggles to sit up
She fumbles for the lamp next to her bed, almost knocking it over
She hits the switch, revealing: The other bed
Sara screams
Hi
The girl takes her picture, further blinding and disorienting Sara
Who are you
Rebecca
Your roommate
Sara calms, catching on
What are you doing
Taking your picture
Why
Rebecca shrugs
Sara grabs her stomach
Oh shit
Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door
Rebecca smiles
13
- : Sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room, holding her head
The door is slightly open
- It's dark
Rebecca's covers are pulled up to her neck
Her eyes are closed
() Rebecca
No answer
Sara makes it back to her bed
She falls onto it, and turns toward the wall
Rebecca's eyes open
And they stay open
She watches Sara go to sleep
- It's the middle of the day and students carry their books everywhere
- Sara wakes
Headache; dry mouth; the works
The sun through the window is way too bright
She slowly turns over to see
Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room
In the light of day, we see that she's a knockout
Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that flank an awesome stereo system
Rebecca sees that Sara's awake
Hey Sara
Sara stares at her blankly
Who is this girl
What happened last night
Rebecca smiles
We met last night
14
Right
(racking her brain) Starts with a
""
Close
Rebecca
She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin
Come on
It'll help, trust me
Sara washes down the aspirin
Thanks
Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched
( ) didn't throw up on you, did
() No
You made it to the bathroom
Sara looks around the room
Her lounge chair has been moved to her side
Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall
They're various self-portraits of Rebecca
Sara looks at one where Rebecca is staring straight back at us
No smile
Did you do those
Rebecca nods
They're really cool
just like capturing my moods
beat
Sara closes her eyes
Bits and pieces of the night before are coming back to her now
Rebecca -- did you take my picture last night
15
() Yeah
It's just something  do
For my drawings
() 'mon, let's hit the bookstore
The walk will help your head
Sara rolls over, groaning
It's too damn early for me
It's three in the afternoon
Sara's eyes bug out
Holy shit
- Sara walks along the back aisle, weighed down with textbooks
All look used and worn
Fashion Design
Psychology
Calculus
She spots the last book she needs and reaches for it just as another  reaches too
They both pull back, neither sure who has claim to it
So what do we do
Sara looks her over
Checks out her outfit
Nice bag
Dior
() Yeah
Sara snatches the book
'm on financial aid
16
- Sara finds Rebecca by the art supplies, she's picking up the stuff she needs
Sara scans Rebecca's books
They're all art books, shiny and new
Sara's phone rings
She looks at it: ""
She sighs
Her finger hovers over the "talk" button
beat
She hits it right before it goes to voicemail
() Jason
What are you doing
(
) just wanted to hear your voice
told you not to do this
(
) need to talk to you
You're just making it harder
(
) Sara, listen
want to come out there
() But you didn't come out here, remember
That's the problem
She says it too loud
Other students in line are eyeing her
(') () 've gotta go
Sara hangs up
She exhales, flustered
That didn't sound good
Boyfriend
Ex
Off Rebecca's confused look
17
It's complicated
beat
Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up
They walk along the stacks of books
We dated since tenth grade and were supposed to go to college together
() We both applied to Brown
got in; he got wait-listed
stuck to our agreement and we both committed here
Then two weeks ago
a spot opened up at Brown
and
No
He took it
(Sara nods glumly) What an asshole
Yep
Do you miss him
Sometimes  think  do
It's hard to let go
() Believe me,  know
But, you're in college now
girl's gotta move on
Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit
She looks at her phone
and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the register
- Rebecca sits on her bed, drawing
Sara is putting her books away on a shelf
As she reaches the end of it, she notices something out of the corner of her eye
Oh my God
What
18
Sara walks to the closet
Her modest clothes hang on one side
But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's am so jealous
know
've got a lot of clothes
Mind if  put some on your side
No problem
Borrow anything you want
Really haven't worn half of them
Sara reverently fingers through them
Chloe
De La Renta
Alexander McQueen
Jimmy Choo shoes
Miu Miu handbag
Some still carry their price tags
Jesus, some of these 've only ever seen in Vogue
My parents idea of bonding is to turn me loose in Beverly Hills with a Platinum card
Oh, you here
Pasadena
Off Sara's confused look
(') About 20 minutes away
That's cool
You can go home on weekends
Free laundry
Free meals
Not gonna happen
Sara gives her a puzzled stare
19
It's a long story
Let's just say nothing's free in my house
She wants to know more
but it's too soon to pry
She nods at Rebecca's drawing pad
Can  take a look
She walks over
Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest
No
Sara stops dead in her tracks
Rebecca realizes that came across pretty harsh
Not till it's done
Nothing personal
It's just my
process
() wouldn't want to show you anything unless it was perfect
( ) Sure
- Establishing shot of a big college cafeteria
- Sara and Rebecca have just finished their dinner
thought you were a design major
Why are you taking Calc and psychology
The girls get up with their trays
(with a smirk) am
want to be well-rounded
(off her look) And they're requirements
20
(
) Hey Sara
Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim
Sara walks over, but Rebecca doesn't follow
Hey
Tracy
Kim
this is my roommate, Rebecca
She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance
Sara waves her over
Rebecca comes, reluctantly
She flashes a small wave
Hi
How formal
What can we call you
How 'bout Reba
Tracy sticks her finger down her throat
Gag me
like Becca
Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too
How 'bout Becky
Becky's good
The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval
like Rebecca
Buzzkill
Rebecca walks out
Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim
21
- Sara enters the Design building
- Sara peeks in the open door of a classroom
Frustration in her eyes -- the class she couldn't get into
She watches   -- long-haired, dashing -- lecture his students
So
here we are
Design 101
And each one of you is asking yourself the same question
(he taps his own chest) Who is this guy
Why should  turn off my Blackberry and pay attention to him
Mild laughter from the class
'll tell you why -- because  hold the keys to the kingdom
Think of your favorite designers
Marc Jacobs
Vera Wang
Rick Owens
Magicians, right
've got news for you: All of their magic stems from the same source: the fundamental principles of design
() can teach you those principles
He lets the power of his words sink in
The journey to the catwalks of New York
Paris
Tokyo
starts right here, in this room
And all you have to do is open your minds
Man, she wants in
: 22
- Sara stands by the door, watching the students file out
As the last one leaves, she screws up her courage and walks in
- Professor Roberts is gathering up his papers
Professor Roberts
He flashes a disarming smile
'm sorry to bother you, it's just
() absolutely must take this class
'm afraid we're full
But don't worry -- Intro Design has three other sections
But you're not teaching them want to learn from the best
He smiles at her
What's your name
Sara Matthews
() brought a request form
She holds it out to him
He takes the form, but his eyes stay on Sara
Roaming over her
Tell me, Sara -- why should  sign your request form when 've turned down a dozen others
Would that be fair
Sara's face falls
long beat
23
No,  guess it wouldn't
Thanks anyway
She walks toward the door
Roberts' eyes go to her ass
But
( ) Who said life was fair
You happen to have two things  can't teach
He walks to her
and hands her the signed form
Style
And Desire
He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara
Sara clutches the form to her chest, smiling
- Sara and Rebecca sit on their respective beds
Rebecca listens to her Walkman
Sara types on her laptop
Hey
Rebecca removes her earbud
What's your Facebook page
'll add you as a friend
don't have a Facebook page
Myspace
Nope
don't spend a lot of time - Sara stares at Rebecca
No way
Come here
Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's shoulder
24
: Sara's Facebook Page
Her picture in the corner
Pictures and posts from a dozen friends
Among them:  ,   in her 20s
Who's she
Irene
She graduated from the Art Institute out here last year
() She's an artist
design apprentice for Marc Jacobs
Hey, check out these posts
Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was amazing"
"Milan in the Fall"
"Off to Barcelona"
etc
mean
who doesn't have a Facebook page
Rebecca laughs
Okay, okay
'll get one
Tracy knocks on the partially open front door
and marches right in
Cancel those library plans
Guess who made the guest list at Rebar
() You guys in
trust you have fake IDs
Of course
don't
Yes you do
Thanks to my badass self
25
Tracy pulls out a fake
She walks to Rebecca and holds it out to her
peace offering
Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat
then goes back to her sketchbook
'll pass
Clubs really aren't my scene
Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the  in her hand
- posh Los Angeles bar
Loud and packed to the gills with mostly young students
Sara and Tracy stand at the bar, getting jostled, looking like
two naive college kids
As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys check them out, smiling and mouthing "Hi
" Sara tries to ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven
How great is this
No parents
No curfews
No shit
They clink their empty glasses in a toast
Can
She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse
Too bad Rebecca blew us off
Talk about the life of the party
Don't be mean
'm just saying
She's just a little hard to get to know
Yeah right
26
As Tracy rolls her eyes
The  sets two drinks down in front of them
He nods down the bar at
-
Tracy flashes them a smile
Sara's not so sure about this
What do you think
think
Tracy raises her shot glass
She and Sara clink and drink
Tracy waves at the suits again
Thanks guys
We can do better
She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor
-   - Sara and Tracy whirl in the hot mix of bodies
Having the time of their lives
moves in, his eyes on Tracy
Tracy loves it
They dance together as Sara watches, smiling
Tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from Sara
Sara is now dancing by herself
moves in on her, but she politely dances away
She scans the dance floor for Tracy
Where'd she go
She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of her
- Sara walks into the crowded ladies' room
Tracy
27
- bummed Sara walks out of the club alone
She rubs her arms against the chill
She nervously tugs on her silver chain as she scans the  loitering outside
() Tracy
She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against hope that Tracy will magically appear
No luck
She starts walking down the street, away from the club
Weary and unnerved
- Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark
Her cell phone rings
She stares at it
Two more rings
She picks it up
Hello
(
) Would you accept a collect call from
Sara Matthews
Yes
She smiles
- An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city
No cars in either direction
lone white 328i  with a black soft top sits next to an ancient pump
Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle, sticking it in the fuel tank
Starts pumping
(0
) Can  help you out
She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station attendant
His name tag: "Rick"
Rebecca sizes him up
28
'm fine
Just in a hurry
She keeps pumping
Speeding it up
Rick ambles up to her, treading beyond appropriate personal space
He points to the "Full Service" sign
Just doing my job
She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the gas pump and squeezes
She looks down at his hand on top of hers
Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away
All done
She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it back at the pump
He stops her
Motions to her face
You have a little something
No, she doesn't
He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back
(') The hell
His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle
Sorry
But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him head to toe
He scrambles backward out of range
(') Sorry again
Rick
The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every direction
She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter
Rick's pissed
Charges towards her
You spoiled c--- He spots the lighter in her hand
Dead stop
She absentmindedly flicks it
It sparks but doesn't light
29
The gas is now pouring towards him
The meter on the pump is still ticking up
He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him and drops the still pouring nozzle
hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls out a loose hundred dollar bill
Places it on top of the pump
Pussy
She gets into her car and drives off
Leaving Rick soaked in gasoline

- Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window
Hugging a cup of hot, sobering coffee
Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot
The headlights shine right in Sara's eyes
and now turn off
Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the car
She waves
Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for the door
- Rebecca walks up to Sara's booth
Nice car
Thanks
() So, where's Tracy
No idea,  couldn't find her
Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table
As long as 'm here
you hungry
Starved
Sara smiles gratefully
Rebecca opens the menu
30
can't believe she ran out on you
know
Thanks for coming
Rebecca looks up from the menu
Tracy had her shot tonight
Tomorrow you're all mine
'll show you the big city
the right way
And  promise  won't abandon you
Deal
Sara smiles
Deal
- Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room
These are the modern pieces little wilder than the old stuff
She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease
She doesn't just walk past pieces -- she studies them
Sara's impressed
Sara's cell phone buzzes
She checks the display: "Jason"
She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes
She buries her cell phone in her purse
Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it
Okay,  have no idea what this is supposed to be
() Even  don't get that one
Come on,  want to show you something
- Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings
In the background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince exhibition
31
They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of Greenmeadow
" It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask
Her eyes peer directly at the viewer
Blood is smeared on her smock
This is my favorite
Sara steps closer to examine it
Rebecca stays behind her
love how he captures her personality through her eyes
It's like she really wants to help you
Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt
She really wants Sara to like this painting
Sara moves even closer
She squints, trying to see what Rebecca sees
The woman's expression in the painting is actually pretty sinister
Sara's a little freaked out
but she turns to see Rebecca's hopeful expression
Sara brightens
Amazing
love it
- Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores
Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor
Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes
That is so cool
No graffiti in Des Moines
Sure
"Bobby loves Jenny
Chrissy loves Rick
" Nothing like this
Rebecca pulls out her camera
Hey, smile
Sara poses
but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in
Both of us
32
They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length
Rebecca clicks
She looks at the picture
She can see the tattoo parlor in the background
Now that's one "art form"  don't get
Needles into skin
No thanks
have a tattoo
Rebecca smiles
Yeah, right
But she can see in Sara's eyes that she's serious
Really
Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily"
My older sister
She died when was nine
Oh, 'm sorry
(pats her heart) This keeps her with me
always wanted a sister
Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they walk down the street
- Sara sits on her bed in sweats, typing on her laptop
Rebecca sits on her own bed, glancing over at Sara as she draws
Guess who 'm listing as my favorite artist on my Facebook page
() Richard Prince
Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched
She walks over to check out the rest of Sara's Facebook Favorites
Favorite book, favorite band, etc
33
() Your favorite movie is "Coyote Ugly"
Don't laugh
It's about a small town girl making it in the big city
Isn't every movie
They both laugh
- Sara, in shorts and warm-up jacket, runs down the sidewalk
Her head's on a swivel, taking in the city sights
- Rebecca takes down a few of her drawings
In their place, she puts up a big "Coyote Ugly" poster
She straightens it out
Satisfied
She checks her watch and walks to the window
She looks out, anxious for Sara to come home
She looks over at Sara's side of the room
Curious, she starts perusing her things
Books
CDs
She walks to Sara's dresser and picks up the picture of Emily
She tenderly brushes Emily's face with her thumb
She spots Sara's silver chain
She picks it up and places it around her neck
She fingers it carefully and looks at herself in the mirror
She smiles
- Sara finishes off her run strong, striding out the last ten yards to the dorm
She catches her breath and hears a kitten
Sara looks in-between the columns outside the dorm and finds a
She's cute as they come, a black-and-white furball
Hey there
34
The kitten purrs
Look at you
She kneels and pets it
The kitten purrs
No collar, baby
Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching
: - Sara quickly walks in and closes the door
Rebecca sits in her windowsill, drawing
Sara sits down on her own bed
She notices the "Coyote Ugly" poster
( ) Wow
thought you'd like it
Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket
She cuts Sara a look
Sara sighs
Apprehensively, she unzips her jacket and the kitten pops out
Rebecca sits up
The kitten jumps over to her bed
She pets it
Sara
know,  know
It's stupid, and 've just broken about forty different dorm rules, and  should just take it to a shelter
() What do you want to name it
Sara's face lights up
She smiles gratefully
Really
35
It'll be our secret
Just between us
Rebecca keeps petting the kitten
Getting more attached
named her in the elevator
Cuddles
She smiles and scoops her up
Suddenly, her smile vanishes
Is that my necklace
Rebecca touches it
She'd forgotten she still had it on
Sorry
was just trying it on
Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly takes it off
Sara takes it back, annoyed
She rubs it protectively
This was my sister's
Oh
Sara looks at it a moment longer
She looks at Rebecca
You can borrow anything of mine
Except for this
Okay
It's the only thing  kept of hers
Rebecca nods
Sara sits down on the bed next to her
'm really sorry
It's okay
You didn't know
Were you two close
Yeah
You're the first roommate 've had since she died
So, it feels a little odd
36
In a good way or a bad way
Sara smiles
good way
- Establishing of life at the quads
- cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy couches
More like a living room than a coffee shop
Lots of laid-back  and
One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now rushing back to the register for the next order
Her - , clearly stoned, moves in slow motion
Not a care in his world
( ) You wanted a mocha smoothie, right
Do you know what's in that
The kid shrugs
Sara hops to the blender and guesses some ingredients
She starts it up
She takes her hand off the lid, and
, splashing mocha smoothie all over her apron
She's frozen in shock
The co-worker casually hands her a towel
She snatches it
She turns to find
, standing at the front of the line
This seems like a pattern
Sara smiles
She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc
She leans in and speaks quietly
Just because  kissed you doesn't mean 'll let you cut in line
So what does it mean
37
She coyly shrugs
Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon are reviving a sacred tradition tonight
Sara stares at him blankly
He smiles
We're having another keg party
dunno
'm still having flashbacks from the last one
Sara laughs
You know what
How about if  use you as my excuse not to go
Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron
- Sara walks off the elevator, still sky-high
She walks through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch television plays in the background
Hey
Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops
Her tone is cold
Hey
Psi
tonight
So you can ditch me again
Sara
the guy had a Porsche
And a hot tub
That's your apology
Tracy jumps up and walks over
38
What  meant to say is -- 'm sorry --  totally screwed up
Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out
She watches Tracy and Sara
Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes
Sara laughs
forgive you
Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug
Over Sara's shoulder, she spots Rebecca looking at them
Tracy flashes a big smile
Relief at making up with Sara
But that's not how Rebecca takes it
But you're on your own at Psi
Because
( ) Someone has a date
Rebecca hears this
She slips back into the room and closes the door
Sara turns and walks down the hallway
- Sara walks in to find Rebecca slipping into a black dress
You look
nice
() Thanks
Richard Prince is having a showing
bought two tickets
() Since he's your favorite artist
Actually,
sort of have a date
() Oh
Okay
Major downer
Rebecca goes back to getting dressed
Heavy silence in the room
Sara watches her
beat
You know,  could reschedule
39
(being a martyr) You don't have to
want to
On one condition
Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on Rebecca
They both look at Rebecca in the mirror
Wow
Rebecca smiles
love it, who's the designer
What are you, a label whore
Who cares
got it at a flea market and it looks great with the dress
Rebecca nods in agreement
It just needs one last touch
She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her dresser
She places them in Rebecca's hand
'm gonna jump in the shower, then we'll head out
She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door
Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm
She turns towards the full-length mirror behind the door
As she leans into the mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced
She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the skin of her right lobe
After a moment of hesitation
small pop
She flinches
Blood trickles down her ear onto her neck
She wipes it off with her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear
- Sara and Rebecca at the Richard Prince showing
The paintings are all similar to the one we saw in the museum
series of women, peering at the viewer
40
Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings
Every guy in the room is checking out these two babes
But Rebecca's into the art, and Sara is texting Stephen
: "sorry
next time : (" Rebecca notices and frowns
Sara puts the phone away and starts studying the paintings
- It's night and there's not a soul in sight
- We track slowly down the empty hallway, towards the door to the
- Sara sleeps peacefully
Cuddles lies on top of her, awake
Her eyes glowing in the dark
Creepy
But not as creepy as
Rebecca in the other bed
She's staring back at the kitten
Envy in her eyes
Of Cuddles
or of Sara
Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed
She walks over to Sara's bed
but not to pet Cuddles
She stands directly above Sara
Looking down at her
If Sara would simply open her eyes, she'd see her
- Tracy is passed out in her bed
She stirs as she wakes
She reaches around her, slapping her end table
Water
need water
She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty
She groans
She grabs an empty cup
opens her door
And lets out a sharp little scream
-  - Rebecca sits right across from Tracy's door, her back against the wall
Staring at Tracy
41
Rebecca
What are you doing
Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to comprehend her
beat
She stands
and walks to her
Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose demeanor
Rebecca stares right into her eyes
She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches
Rebecca turns and walks down to her room
At her door, she turns and smiles
She disappears into her room
Tracy stands there, spooked
- of Sara and Rebecca walking to class
Tracy walks ten yards behind them, waiting until
Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down different paths
Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up
Hey
How was the party
Are you still the beer bong queen
But Tracy's in no mood to joke
She pulls Sara to a stop
Listen
something is up with your roommate
What do you mean
She was outside my room this morning
Doing what
Waiting for me
opened my door
and there she was
Just sitting there, staring
Like some psycho
Are you sure
42
You don't believe me
No, it's just
why would she do that
Why don't you ask her
've gotta go
'll see ya later
Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on
Tracy turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building
Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway
Tracy leaves in a hurry
/ Sara sits in her Design class
Professor Roberts stands at the podium
Three white design mannequins behind him, each sporting a different fashion style
Contrary to popular opinion, beauty is not in the eye of the beholder
It's in the hands of the designer
Sara listens intently, soaking it all in
Her cell buzzes with a text message
She discreetly takes a look
Who can tell me the difference between fashion and style
: "4th & ford
be there now
" Sara smiles at the message
Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and calls on her
Miss Matthews
Without missing a beat, Sara replies
Fashion's something you can buy, but style you either have or you don't
43
Exactly
All the money in the world can't buy you style
But it can buy you a good stylist
The class chuckles
Professor Roberts smiles
- Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she walks
Rebecca is waiting, holding two cups of coffee
Hey
How'd you know when my class got out
Rebecca shrugs, playing it off
'm your roommate
Sara smiles and grabs a cup
Thanks
: - They walk through the quads
Other students are around, some strolling leisurely, others rushing to get to class
Listen
Tracy told me something kinda weird
She says you
scared her this morning
Rebecca stops and looks at Sara
She starts laughing
What
Yeah
44
It's more like she scared me
She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl
She almost knocked me over
beat as Sara ponders it all
She smiles
The girl does like to party
Anyway,  wouldn't worry about it
Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from Irene: "where r u
" gotta go meet Irene
(raises her cup) Thanks for the coffee
Rebecca watches her walk off
She takes another sip
- Sara gets out of a cab
She looks up at a big building
- Sara walks through a design studio
Models and make-up artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars worth of dresses
Sara loves the place's chaotic energy
She knocks on an open door and sees a   being worked on by a designer who isn't much older
, 28
(mouth full of pins) Finally
She gets up to hug Sara
Nearly tearing the dress
-  - Irene is putting a dress together on a
Sara watches in awe
An   walks by
checks on Irene's work
nods his approval
and leaves
so want to be you when  grow up
45
Hell,  wanna be me when  grow up
- ( ) She's going to be a star
Irene rolls her eyes
You know, your dad left me four messages last week
Making sure 'm looking out for his baby
Oh god
hope you told him 'm closing down the library every night
told him  haven't seen you
And that for all  know you're a crack ho by now
Even the model laughs
Perfect
- Sara walks along, looking for a table
She spots Stephen sitting by himself
Drumming on his leg with a pencil
Ignoring the open textbook in front of him
She sits down across from him
They both smile
haven't seen you around too much since you blew me off for dinner
Sorry again
Actually, how about dinner tonight
Hellllo
'm studying
She takes his book
He's on page two
Page two
Busted
46
Yeah, but it's really dense
Off Sara's smile
(') Okay
Let's go
- Kim exits the bathroom and passes Tracy coming the other way
How's it goin
Hey
Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she walks, steps into the bathroom
- She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste
She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the curtain closed
As she shampoos her hair
The lights go out
You have to be kidding me
Hey
The only light is some distorted moonlight through the window
Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel
Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall
The lights come back on
She sighs happily
sheds her towel
and steps back under the steaming water
beat
The lights go off again
Goddammit
She turns off the shower
beat of silence, but now
one of the other showers turns on
What the hell
Hey, how about turning on the light
47
No response
Yet another shower turns on
Who's out there
Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along the wall again
She turns on the lights
The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers
Tracy stares at them
beat
know it's you
She walks over to the shower
beat
She rips away one curtain
Nothing behind it but the running shower
She turns it off
She stares at the other curtain
Sara thinks you're weird
She told me
She pulls back the other curtain
nothing
She turns off that shower, too
But she can still hear running water
She looks back
The curtain from her own shower is closed again
The sound of running water behind it
She walks over
Not funny, Rebecca
(under her breath) Bitch
She grips the curtain
She steels herself
She yanks the curtain open to see
Just running water
Tracy shakes her head
She looks around -- no one
She slips her towel off and slips back under the water
Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower
Freak
Just as the warm water starts to relax her
, pile-driven by Rebecca
The curtain comes right off the rings
Tracy is slammed against the shower wall
She hits the floor hard, with Rebecca on top of her
Water pelting them both
48
Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against the wall
The shower curtain covers her from the neck down
Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca
So Sara thinks 'm weird
Let me tell you what  think
think you're a little whore, and a bad influence on her
And  think that if you tell anyone about
what 'm about to do
you'll regret it
Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other hand beneath the shower curtain
Tracy's eyes widen further
Rebecca finds what she's looking for
gets the grip she needs
and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain
muffled scream from Tracy
Tears stream down her face
Rebecca stands
As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor, Rebecca looks down at
The bloody ring in her hand
Nice belly ring
She tosses it to Tracy
and walks away
- Sara and Stephen are sitting on a couch
His arm around her shoulder, lightly playing with the ends of her hair
'm going to flunk my test tomorrow, thanks to you
Then let's make sure it was worth it
She gives him a slow, lingering kiss
Duh, joke's on you
was going to flunk anyway
She smiles
49
- Rebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the bathroom
She hears steps and voices in the hallway
She smiles -- must be Sara
She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep
But the steps pass her door and keep going
Not Sara
She turns on the light
Worry in her eyes
She picks up her cell phone and dials
- Sara and Stephen step off the elevator
Time to say goodbye
Thanks for helping me
not study
Anytime
He kisses her
Sweet and tender
Until
Sara sees Rebecca
Standing just five feet away
Staring at them
Where were you
Oh, hi
kept calling and calling
Oh
turned my cell off at the library and forgot to turn it back on
() Rebecca
this is Stephen
He flashes a smile
Rebecca doesn't even look at him
'm going to bed now
'm glad you're okay
She walks out of the lounge
beat
That was awkward
Sara bites her lip, as if to say: "What can you do
" 50
You got a curfew
Well, she's right
shoulda called
He smiles -- no big deal
He kisses her and steps into the elevator
They look at each other, waiting for the ancient doors to close
Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more kiss
The doors close
Sara smiles; what a night
She glances down toward her door and sighs
- Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees
Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman
As they reach the fork in the path
guess 'll see you later
Sara
( ) Last night
was just worried about you
You don't need to worry about me
can take care of myself
Okay
Rebecca slowly nods
Sara
We're good, right
beat
Sara nods and smiles
- Sara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them
Stephen is reading Rolling Stone
Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page
She gets a message for adding a new friend
from Rebecca
She clicks to add her
51
Rebecca sits in a chair on the other side of the library
Unbeknownst to Sara and Stephen, Rebecca watches them through the glass
Sara clicks onto Rebecca's Facebook page
She's listed only one friend: Sara
She's posted the picture of her and Sara in front of the graffiti wall
And some of her drawings
And a picture of a pretty brunette teenager, captioned "Maria
" Sara looks at Rebecca's interests
Favorite Artist: Richard Prince
Favorite Passion: Drawing
Favorite movie: Coyote Ugly
Sara smiles
Best Friend:
Her smile fades
'm already her best friend
That's a little sad
Stop
But the look on her face says she agrees
Maybe she  likes you
if you know what  mean
She looks at him quizzically
don't
He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively
(') You
are
a
moron
He grins
- Rebecca watches Stephen kiss Sara, her expression is tough to read
Is she jealous
or entranced
Sara gets up and leaves
Stephen goes to the stacks
52
-  - Stephen, alone, searches for a book among the remote stacks
The stacks are massive and endless -- row after row of them
Stephen thumbs through books, not finding the one he needs
He drops a book and bends down to pick it up
Over his shoulder, we see
'  in the space between the shelves
She's in the next aisle over
Stephen replaces the book
He walks down the aisle, looking at the numbers of the books
Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle
Her hands gently brush against the books, her eyes on Stephen
He turns in her direction and stops in his tracks
So does Rebecca
She's completely still
Stephen walks over
He puts his hand on the book that covers Rebecca
He's about to pull it out and reveal her
But it's not the right one
He keeps walking
He reaches the end of his aisle
and Rebecca the end of hers
She's right around the corner from him
He reads the markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which direction to go
Rebecca's hands are sweaty
She's nervous
Does she want to get caught
Stephen turns right, away from her, and starts down the next aisle
Rebecca softly exhales
And now whispers to herself
Stephen
Stephen stops dead
Did he hear something
Guess not
He keeps going, scanning the book numbers again
Shit, wrong aisle
He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle
But it's
We hear a door close in the distance
53
- Stephen and Sara walk on a tree-lined path
Holding hands
He checks his watch
Should we head back home
They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide, jungle gym, etc
The question is "whose home
" Hmmm
'll make you a bet
go back to your place or you take me home to my twin bed and roommate
What's the bet
She eyes the jungle gym
: -  - Sara and Stephen are each hanging from the jungle gym
This has been going on for a few minutes
Both straining
Stephen's worse off
This is kind of a stupid bet
Why'd you agree
Apparently, 'm kind of a stupid guy
Making me laugh isn't going to help you
They stare each other down
She's stifling a laugh, much more in control as Stephen is straining
54
He tries to swing his legs and kick her
She avoids him
He catches a peek at her bare midriff
Finally, this makes him fall
She then lets go, victorious
(') was a gymnast until  hit a growth spurt my freshman year
Stephen brushes himself off
Dejected that he was "this close"
She walks up to him
Cocky
Gives him a playful shove
(') So  win
He gives her a playful shove back
So
She seductively walks back towards him
Takes his hand
So
let's go back to your place
She gives him a seductive grin
- Rebecca sketches in her bed
She looks at the clock: 1:00 a
m
And no Sara
History is repeating itself
and Rebecca's pissed
She rips out her sketch page and throws it away
She starts pacing the floor
She angrily moves Sara's chair back to her side
She whips out her phone and eyes the dial button
She starts to dial
but kills the call
She picks up her sketchpad again
Suddenly: from Sara's desk
Rebecca pulls out the desk drawer and finds Sara's cell phone
On the call screen: ""
long beat
She pushes the talk button
but just listens
(
) Sara
Mmmm
55
(
) Sara, you answered
Thank you
Can we talk
about us
Rebecca's eyes clear
She's in control again
She sits down on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor
And now she lies down
() miss you
She moves her hand across her stomach
(
) () You do
want you, Jason
(
) want you, too
But
Rebecca's hand moves toward her panties
miss touching you
Do you miss touching me
(
) Like you wouldn't believe
Prove it
-  - Sara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever
Kissing madly, missing each other's mouths
At his door
he cracks it open and peeks inside
His room is a disaster
Definitely a new world record for empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes
Just give me thirty seconds
You're kidding
56
But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him
Sara leans back against the wall
Flushed, breathing hard
-  - Stephen is a whirlwind
He tosses everything -- beer cans, clothes, study papers -- into one big garbage bag
Almost there
(
) (through the door) 'm going to start taking my clothes off out here
Yeah, right
He's not quite buying it
but he's cleaning faster
(
) Oops
There goes my shirt
She's got his attention now
He speeds up
You know  don't believe you
() Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to be my strip tease
(
) There go the jeans
He's popping breath mints
while clearing off his bed
'm just going to put your clothes back on and make you strip again
(
) Hmmm
What's next
Top or bottom
Stephen stops and stares at the door
-  - Sara stands there, fully dressed
She looks down the empty hallway
57
Who do we have here
Hey guys
Let me ask you
Bra or panties
Bra
Okay, okay
Just calm down
The door swings open
Stephen stands in front of her, grinning
knew you didn't have the guts
She flicks her bra at his face
He catches it, shocked
He tosses it aside and yanks her into the room
The door slams shut behind them
- Rebecca is breathing harder and faster now
Still holding the phone, from which we hear Jason's moans
Say my name, Jason
Until  tell you to stop
She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow beside her
Both her hands ease back under the covers
(
) Sara
Sara
Sara
Rebecca writhes, eyes closed
- Sara and Stephen make out in bed, half-naked
He lies on top of her
Looking into her eyes
Sweet and intimate
Sara
- Rebecca writhes and moans
(
) Sara
Sara
They moan together
Louder and louder
and now they finish
long beat
58
(
) (catching his breath) Jesus, Sara
That was incredible
Rebecca smiles
(
) miss you so much
Her smile dies
She picks up the phone
cruel gleam in her eyes
Don't ever call me again
She kills the call
And now deletes it from the phone log
- Carnegie Dorm on a bright, clear morning
- Sara, hair mussed up but eyes shining
Sara opens her door and steps in
She's tentative, expecting Rebecca to jump down her throat
But Rebecca smiles
Well, good morning
Hey
Sorry  didn't call
forgot my phone
No problem
Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone
She quickly checks
No calls
Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles
Come on
don't  get any details
() nice girl doesn't kiss and tell
They laugh
nice, easy vibe between them
59
You want to go get some breakfa-- Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down the hallway
Oh no
Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed
Sara turns the corner to see
The resident assistant, with Cuddles cradled in her arms
Sara apprehensively walks up to him
Is this your cat, Sara
Maybe
She's cute
She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms
She turns to walk back to the room
And if you keep her,  lose my job
Do we understand each other
She stops
Turns
Looks at him
Yes
Sara walks back to her room
Rebecca stands in the doorway
They exchange despondent looks
Screwed
'  - Irene opens the door and Sara walks in
What took you so long
walked
60
You didn't
It's ten bucks for a cab and 'm a student
Sara
You can't just walk around downtown
at night
This is not Des Moines
Duh
Seriously, listen to me
That's why  own a gun
Sara's shocked
What
Absolutely
Big cities are crawling with crazies
Sara moves into the apartment
Her phone rings
She answers
Hey
Oh, Hi
Yeah, 'm over at Irene's
meant to leave you a note
Uh huh, uh huh, oh
That's a good idea
Let me check, hold on
Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene
( ) Do you like cats
Yeah, why
We have to get rid of one
Can't
Travel too much
Poor thing would starve to death
61
You're right
(back into phone) No, she can't
Huh
Oh  don't know
whenever  get there
Bye
Who was that
My roommate
More than a little overprotective
That's no fun
So, where is it
What
You said you had a surprise for me
Oh yeah
went through my closet
There's nothing here 've worn in the past six months
Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes
You're kidding, all of these
Oh no
What
what
We have no closet space at the dorms
Rebecca's already using half of mine
Oh my God,  just had the best idea
What
Why don't you move in here with me
62
Seriously
Yeah, 'm never here
The place is huge
Ditch the roommate
And, the building allows pets
Huh
Let me talk to Rebecca about it
Great
() So, how's Jason
really liked him
We broke up
Yeah
he sucked
-  - Sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet
The bags spill out into the room, taking up floor space
Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open
She's staring at Irene's Facebook Profile
There are some racy pictures of Irene and some girlfriends
Hey
What're those
Irene gave them to me
She had a lot more but we don't have the room
Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles, huh
Well, maybe that's not a problem
Really
63
Yeah
She actually suggested that move in with her
What
() You want to move
No, of course not
love living here
with you
Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a bright spin on things
Look, 'd still technically be living here
So you wouldn't have to get a new roommate
Her place is huge and it's not like you couldn't use the extra closet space
'd just move some of my stuff over, and spend a few nights a week there
We'd both have a lot more space
don't want more space
want
She checks herself
beat of awkward silence
Nothing's set in stone
It's just something to think about
Plus we'd be able to keep Cuddles
As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares across the room at
Cuddles
- As Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking by herself
Tracy
Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking
As if she didn't hear anything
Sara hurries to catch up with her
64
Tracy
hey
Oh, hey
Tracy smiles, but weakly
The girl's lost all her sparkle
Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's
heard you changed dorms
Yeah, Conrad Hall
Seemed like a better vibe
Well, we should get together
Like grab a bite or something
Right
(
) Sara
Sara turns and waves at Rebecca
Hi
Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara
( ) 'll call you
But she's already walking away
Tracy
What was that about
don't know
She just walked away
Well, she's always been a flake
65
- Sara whips up a latte for a customer, her cell phone to her ear
She's really got the hang of this job now
In charge, moving with a purpose
She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand and points him toward the sink
He starts washing blenders
( ) Hey
do so call, Mom
Geez
Her latte customer rolls his eyes
Moms
He takes his drink and walks away
Well, actually,  was thinking 'd do Thanksgiving here and see you guys for Christmas
She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what she's hearing
Ya know what, 'm at work, and 'm really getting slammed
There isn't another customer in sight
'll call you later, okay
Tell Dad  said hello
Bye
She hangs up the phone and sighs
- Rebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag
As she carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on Sara's bed
She scoops her up
Looks like it's just you and me tonight
- Rebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry room
66
- Rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying
Cuddles plays with a sock on top of a nearby washer
Rebecca checks on her clothes
They're dry, with two minutes still left on the timer
She stuffs the clothes into her duffle bag
She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles
She pets her gently
She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside
( ) See how nice and warm it is in there
Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth
Rebecca closes the door and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass
She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the dryer moving for a sec
Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and gets back up
Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time
Cuddles stumbles
Flips over
The dryer beeps
Cuddles meows at Rebecca, wanting out
She reaches into her pocket
and pulls out her last quarter
She gently places it in the slot
: 15
Rebecca stares through the glass at the kitten
She fingers the button
Before she pushes it -- : - Sara walks in to find Rebecca sprawled on her bed, crying
She rushes over
Hey, what's wrong
Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red
Ashamed
Cuddles got out
67
Oh no
In the dorm
Outside
What
was doing laundry
took her with me
She jumped out of the bag and ran outside
went after her, but
() 'm so sorry
Sara stands, pissed
She wants to really go off on Rebecca
but the girl's so distraught, so fragile
Maybe she'll come back
() She won't
'm going to go find her
Do you want me to help
But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her
- Sara and Rebecca sit alone at a table
Eating quietly
Maybe it's
just karma or something
We weren't allowed to keep her anyway
You're not mad at me
It was an accident
() It's just
stress after stress, you know
68
Is something else wrong
beat as Sara decides whether to confide
My parents really want me to come home for Thanksgiving
You don't want to go
It's not exactly the most festive holiday in the Matthews household
() Emily died two days before Thanksgiving
beat
Rebecca pats Sara's hand
know  should be there with them, but it's like there's a ghost at the table
You can come with me
() What
Rebecca sits up, her excitement growing
Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my house
Your folks wouldn't mind
() Please
Like they'd even notice
Okay, we'll see
Thanks

- Professor Roberts stands at the blackboard, wrapping up a lecture
Your midterm designs are due Friday
Remember, class: Simplicity
Who founded our industry
Eve -- when she handed Adam that fig leaf
Students laugh on their way out the door
As Sara walks past Roberts
Sara
Could  see you in my office, please
() Sure
've got a class right now
But 'll come right after it
- Sara knocks on Professor Roberts' open door
She steps into his office
It's small and intimate, with books stacked along every wall
Scraps of fabric are pinned to cork boards
Roberts smiles at her from his chair
He walks to the door and closes it
He walks back, pulls a chair close to hers, and sits down
She crosses her legs, her knees accidentally brushing against his
don't think  need to tell you how impressed 've been with your work
() Every year  go to Fashion Week in Paris
It's dazzling
The photo shoots
the parties
that incredible runway
When the first model bursts through the curtain and hits that catwalk
Sara, a roar goes up from that crowd that's like
nothing you've ever heard
() The college allows me to take one student
All expenses paid
() 70
(-) Full backstage access
Usually, it's a senior
() But it doesn't have to be
Sara's pulse is racing
'm not sure  understand
Are you saying what  think you're saying
'm saying you have a shot
You'd have to earn it, Sara
Of course
'll do
anything
Roberts stands and walks to the window
He looks out at the quad
and now turns back to Sara
'd like to see more danger in your work
Your designs are always crisp; they're always clear
But they're a little
safe
That stung
Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face
Roberts walks over to her
Don't be afraid to go to some of the
He delicately taps her temple
(') darker places in here
Okay
He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now
He looks into her eyes
The best designers push the boundaries of what's
acceptable
They take chances
Do you like to take chances, Sara
Sometimes
71
So do
He kisses her
Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her chair
She stands in front of him, shaking
can't believe you just did that
took a chance, that's all
With a student that  trust
better go
Sara grabs her books
As she heads for the door
Paris, Sara
Fashion Week
Don't blow the chance of a lifetime
She hurries out of the office
- Rebecca sits alone at a study table
Sara walks up and drops down her books
Students look over from other tables
Sara doesn't care
She sits down and stares blankly into space, trying to forget what just happened
Rebecca leans over, concerned
What's wrong
My design professor just kissed me
Rebecca turns very serious
She gets up and sits down next to Sara
Are you alright
Sara nods
Yeah, it just really creeped me out
And  think the asshole's married
72
Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's
- Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day
He tosses some design sheets into his briefcase
He opens a desk drawer
grabs his wedding ring
and slips it onto his finger
He hears  in the hallway
The sexy, unmistakable clicking of a woman's heels
They come closer
and now stop at his door
Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock
Nothing
He walks to it
He can see the silhouette of two feet at the bottom of the door
He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him
He opens the door, revealing: Rebecca
She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black jeans, and silver stiletto heels
small purse on her shoulder
Roberts swallows his surprise
Professor Roberts
That's right
'm glad  caught you
Actually,  was just
But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels snapping on the worn hardwood floor
- Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her back inside
They face each other
You're not one of my students
Not yet
That's why 'm here
73
She steps to his desk and leans against it
Her cool manner is disarming
beat
'm failing Intro Pysch
And why is that
Because 'm bored
thought it would be all about Freud, and deep dark secrets
But it's brain chemistry
Synapses
can't stay awake in class
'm sorry to hear that
But 'm not sure what  can do to help
Tomorrow's the last day to drop a course without penalty
Unless can add another one in its place, 'll fall way behind in credits
Daddy won't take that very well
He might even pull the plug
Which means
() 'm pretty much at your mercy, Professor
Roberts smiles
This girl is a trip
Is she for real
She's so calm, so steady
Roberts can't get a handle on her
Look, 've always made it a policy not to accept any students this late in the term
Do  look like just any student to you
She smiles
and eases up onto his desk
Facing him
Pretty feet dangling, ankles locked
Jesus
She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk
She sees the framed picture of a
She picks it up
Your wife is very pretty
74
Ex-wife
The game is on now
Roberts slowly walks around the desk, until he's behind Rebecca
In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off his wedding ring
He palms it
few things 'd need to know
Ask me anything
He's circling the desk now
Predator and prey
Do you have any design experience
None
What do you know about clothes
Only one thing
And what's that
definitely look better out of them than in them
What an answer
Roberts stops in front of her
He moves in close, between her parting legs
He looks into her eyes
Still steady
think we might be able to work something out
Great
Just tell me and 'll do anything
Kiss me
() 'll take it from there
75
He kisses her
She opens her lips for a tantalizing second, and now gently pushes him away
He holds his ground
He's had a taste -- he wants a lot more
Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens
Ow
You're hurting me
Professor, stop
Roberts stares at her in shock
He's not even touching her
What's going on
Rebecca smiles again
This girl is whacked
But damn, Roberts wants her
And her eyes are inviting him back
As he presses in to kiss her again
She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the floor, gasping for air
He drops his wedding ring, which rolls away across the floor
Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open
We can see the Walkman inside
She takes it out
Smiles at him
Birthday gift
You should get one, they're great
She slips on the earbuds
plays with the Walkman for a few seconds
and now hits the play button
We hear their prior conversation, played back
Great
Just tell me and 'll do anything
() Kiss me
'll take it from there
() Owl You're hurting me
Professor, stop
Rage and betrayal in Roberts' eyes
You bitch tease
Oh, 'm not teasing
She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the floor
76
Do you see enough danger in me now, Professor
Did  go to a dark enough place for you
He recognizes his own words to Sara
What
How did
Who are you
He lunges at her ankle
She steps out of his grasp
and slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand
He yells again
She trusted you
She walks toward the door
Please don't do this
Twenty years
Everything  worked for
'll pay for that tape
Rebecca stops at the door
She kneels, picks up his wedding ring, and rolls it across the floor to him
Yes you will
She walks out the door
- Sara sits on Stephen's bed
She is looking out the window, holding a theory book in her hand
Stephen watches her from his side of the bed
Anything wrong
Sara is taken out of her own world What
Are you ok
Yeah, sure
77
She smiles
Stephen smiles back
Sara looks down in her book again
- Sara looks up at the building
She sighs before she enters
She walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students pass her
She steps into the doorway and sees
, standing at Professor Roberts' podium
She gestures for everyone to come in
Sara, like the rest, is confused
Welcome
'm Professor Jacobs
'll be taking over the class for the rest of the semester
Sara can't believe it
She takes a seat and turns to the next to her
() What happened
- Sara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed
She sees a half- dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself in the corner, drawing
Sara joins her
Remember what  told you about Professor Roberts
Yeah
He's gone
What do you mean
78
Well, they're calling it a leave of absence
But what  heard
someone sent the dean an anonymous recording of him hitting on another student
Oh My God
know
That's called Karma
- Sara serves up two fresh lattes
and now leans against the counter to watch the band
Stephen's band
He catches her looking at him
She smiles
Seriously smitten
- Stephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up
've made a decision
You ready
Lemme hear it
'm gonna quit the band
No
Really
Why
It's a waste of time-and we suck
Why would you say that
Well, let me think about this
The only places we can get booked is at my own frat house and at my girlfriend's coffee shop
79
() You're right
You guys do suck
beat
Hold it
Did you just say girlfriend
You heard me
So you think it'll be fun to stay here during Thanksgiving
Dinner at the frat, the football games
Don't forget the always awkward, homoerotic humor
Sounds like a blast
Oh
For sure
- somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror on the back of the front door
very strange expression in her eyes
She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now
Punches herself on the temple
Hard
She staggers, nearly knocked out
She straightens
Looks in the mirror
Her skin is already bruising
She punches herself again
Same spot
And again, with her other fist this time
And now a shot to her shoulder
And another
It's painful to watch
But she's getting more and more numb to the blows
She inspects herself closely
and now reaches down and grabs an artist's
It looks like a large, retractable box cutter
She extends the blade all the way out
She pulls up her shirt
Turns to the side a bit
Places the knife against her skin and
: 80
- Sara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal position in a corner of the room
Sobbing
Sara drops her things and runs over to her
Oh my God
What happened
She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her knees
Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms
Rebecca
It's okay
You're safe now
Talk to me
was looking for Cuddles
man
pulled me into an alley
He tried
Sara holds her
She can't finish
It's okay
It's okay
Shhh
got away
You're alright now
Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt
She pulls it up and sees a slash
Gasps
- Rebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in her underwear
Sara is tending to her wounds
Ice for the bruises
Disinfectant for the cut
Rebecca flinches
It's not deep, thank God
But you should see a doctor
No
Rebecca, you need to
And then the police
81
Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job
don't want to
can't
Sara pulls out her cell phone
You're calling them, or  am
There's a psycho walking around this campus
( ) Please
didn't see him
She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts
Okay, okay
won't call
Just let me help you
Rebecca calms down
Let's Sara finish
Watching her intently as she works
-  - Sara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen
Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go home for the holiday
Sorry about not staying
But, Rebecca
get it
( ) 'm going to make out with my pillow and pretend it's you
Just say you'll miss me
'll miss you
Rebecca pulls up in her car
Sara gets in
Rebecca gives Stephen an " win" look as Sara closes the door
82
- : Sara looks down at her phone
haven't heard from Jason in weeks
It's weird how he just stopped calling
It's what you wanted, right
Sara nods, reassuring herself
Yeah
Yeah it is
Sara looks out the window
Rebecca shows a hint of a smile
- Rebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
- Rebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the mansion
Sara is in shock
This is your home
It's my parents house
It was never a home
- Rebecca and Sara walk in
Rebecca's on edge, flinching as Sara closes the door
Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room
Her father gives her an awkward hug
() We didn't think you would make it
83
Her mother sees the bruises on her face
() What happened
Nothing
Nothing
This isn't nothing
() Leave it alone
Sara is stunned
But Rebecca's parents cease
Her mom gives her a tender, protracted embrace
Rebecca endures it, barely raising her arms
Hello
And you are
'm Sara
She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look
You didn't tell them
Sara's my roommate
() 'm Jeff
Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara
It's so great to meet you, Sara
'm Alison
Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm
Come on, let me show you my room
'  - Rebecca slams the door behind them, startling Sara
84
You didn't tell them we were coming
They didn't need to know
Rebecca plops down on the bed
Sara looks around
It's a typical teenage girl's bedroom
Except, no posters
Just drawings covering the walls
The drawings are of teenage girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one teenage girl
They're odd, but compelling
These are interesting
Yeah, some of my high school work
haven't gotten around to takin them down
- Family and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large dining table
The contents of the house are expensive but not pretentious
Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage her parents, who are undaunted
All smiles and warmth
Rebecca's a pretty great artist
Yeah, we think Rebecca is so talented
Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery
She's an awesome roommate, too
(looks at his daughter, ) That's nice to hear and 'm sure she likes you because she never brings anyone home before
Rebecca stares at her father
85
Dad
What
As a parent you worry
You protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and she's on her own
'm just relieved she got a good roommate
Sara cuts discreet looks around the table
Who are these people
Sara, 'll make up a room for you -- She'll stay in my room
Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along
'  - Sara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep
Sara has made a makeshift bed in the middle of the floor
We can share the bed if you want
Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the walls
On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the drawings of Rebecca looking at her
Sure
Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca
They lay back to back
Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed
Thanks for coming
Next Thanksgiving, you can run interference with my family
Done
Sara closes her eyes
It's silent
Rebecca turns over beat
She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara
She ever so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair
86
Sara opens her eyes for a second
Not sure if she felt something
She closes them again
- Jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen
He's lived here long enough to know his way in the dark
Jeff opens the fridge
The soft light barely illuminates Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father
Jeff jumps
He recovers, standing by the open fridge
Becs
You scared me
Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty look
We know how much she hates nicknames
'  - Sara wakes up alone in bed
She can hear soft voices from downstairs
She climbs out of bed and walks to the door
- Sara stands at the top of the stairs
She walks down them and to the kitchen doorway
She peeks inside to see
- Rebecca and her father sitting at the table
Just the moonlight through the window falling over them
Spooky
How're you doing
Fine
My grades are good
That's not what  meant
She looks down at the table
87
'm making friends
Jeff, very subtly, cringes
long beat
Rebecca, look at me for a second
Now she looks at him
Your mother and  are very fond of you
know
He doesn't know what else to say
Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall
Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the beach
on the ski slopes
on a cruise ship
They smile happily at the camera
Rebecca isn't in a single picture
just wanted to make sure
Good night, 'm heading back to bed
He rises
Sara turns and walks up the stairs
- Sara waits by the front door
Alison walks in
Hi Sara
Hi
Rebecca's going to show me some of her high school hangouts
Wonderful
Alison peers up the stairs
Rebecca seems to be doing well
Uhhh, yeah
think she is
88
Is she taking her medication
Medication
Alison turns to see
her daughter at the top of the stairs
Did she hear them
She walks down
Hey sweetheart
She kisses her on the cheek
Rebecca is annoyed
( ) Ready
Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words
Medication
She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully
Have a great time, you two
- It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street
Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk
Sara cuts discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca
Is everything okay
Yeah
It's just
She wants to ask her about that medication
Nice to see where you come from
() Come on
Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks
The takes their money
but keeps staring at Rebecca
She doesn't pay any attention to him
Sara takes her coffee
89
Thanks
The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out
What's she doing with Rebecca
The girls sit at a table
The cashier and  keep glancing over, whispering to each other
Rebecca shoots them a look
Like a warning
They quiet
Start doing busy work
( ) used to come here like every day after school
The door opens
walk in, laughing and chatting
One  spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks
Sara recognizes her
It's , the girl from Rebecca's Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches
The chatting girls all fall silent
You know them
They went to my high school
Friends
Rebecca doesn't answer her
She's focused on making eye contact with the Brunette
The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves
Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance
As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible
The other two girls walk to the counter
They sneak glances at Rebecca as they order their drinks
Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls
Rebecca doesn't waver
She keeps staring at the Brunette
Suddenly, Rebecca gets up
Let's leave
Rebecca walks towards the door
Sara, confused, gathers her things and gets up
Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table
The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights
90
Hello, Maria
() Hello
The other girls walk over
Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over, sending shivers down their spines
They want to back up their friend, but they look as scared as she does
Sara watches all this from a few feet away
Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful
Oh,  wanted to introduce you to Sara
My roommate
Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over
Almost as if she feels sorry for her
Hi
Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face
An awkward beat
Everyone's tense
Sara clears her throat
Well, we better go
Rebecca snaps out of it
Nods
They start to walk out
But as they open the door
Rebecca
Everyone turns to Maria
She looks Rebecca in the eye
We were never friends
Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth
The tension building
Maria doesn't back down, though
She needed to say this
Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently
Come on, let's go
- : Headed back to school
Sara looks out the window
Lost in thought
91
guess college is a fresh start for both of us
Rebecca doesn't look at her
Just a hint of acknowledgement on her face
Sara's phone buzzes
This gets Rebecca's attention
Sara looks at the text message she just received from Irene: "back in
lemme know abt movin in
" Irene's back in town
Sara types and sends a text back
Rebecca watches her
- Sara's running through the quad
/
- Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in the front door as a student walks out
She bypasses the elevator, heading straight to the stairs
- She bursts out the door and into the hallway
- She walks in, still a bit out of breath
Rebecca is packing her back-pack
(not looking up) Good run
(between deep breaths) Great
You wanna go get dinner
'm going to the art studio
Oh
Okay
Catch you later then
92
Don't wait up, Sara
() feel inspired
She's out the door
Sara notices that Rebecca left her sketchpad behind on her bed
She eyes it for a beat
Looks at the closed door
As she steps toward the sketchpad
Rebecca charges back in
Forgot my pad
She snags it from her bed and leaves
Sara eyes Rebecca's dresser
But first
She walks to the door and opens it
Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the empty hallway
She hears the elevator ding
Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser
beat
Is she really going to do this
Yes
She slides open the top drawer: Supplies
The second drawer: sketchpads
She leafs through them: Empty
She searches the third drawer: Sweaters
She feels around beneath them
Wait a minute
She pulls out: Two bottles of prescription medicine
"
For
" Both bottles are full of pills
As Sara stares at them
She leaps out of her socks
But it's just Stephen
Your door was open
Oh my God
Sorry
Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug
Stephen holds her tight and speaks, muffled by her neck
93
What are those
beat
Should she bring him into this
That's what  intend to find out
- Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her drawing pad in her other hand
Her arm is wrapped around a pole for balance
She stares out the window
No emotion
She looks like she's staring at her own reflection
The train comes to a halt
Riders shuffle around
Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down
She opens her drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper
She looks up and we see what she's been staring at: Irene
- Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer
Sara googles "Lithium and ", and clicks on an entry
() -- anti-social personality disorder
Also known as sociopathy
They look at each other
Jesus
thought she was just weird
It says lithium can control the condition
(nodding at the bottles) Maybe these are refills
Maybe she's been taking it all along
Certainly doesn't seem like she's been taking them
He's right and she knows it
beat
94
think it's time  moved in with Irene
- stylish, hip night club
sophisticated crowd
Irene and three  sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic martinis and watching the dance floor
And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around her
She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca
Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom
As she winds her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices Rebecca
She pauses to watch her , , '
-  - Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up
The door opens and closes
She glances over to see Rebecca walking in
Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene
She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms
Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss
Rebecca is watching her in the mirror, and Irene knows it
She applies the gloss and smiles at the little kick it gives her
Her eyes find Rebecca's in the mirror
'm sorry to stare, but you are so beautiful
Thanks
So are you
Great lips
What kind is it
It's cinnamon
Caffeinated
girl never knows how late she's gonna party
Rebecca smiles
beat
95
Can  try it
Irene hands her the lip gloss
Rebecca takes her hand and pulls her close
She kisses Irene full on the lips
You're right
cinnamon
Irene smiles
This room's heating up fast
Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's
Why don't we get out of here
'd invite you to my place, but  have a roommate
As luck would have it, 'm only two blocks away and
no roommate
What are we waiting for
'  - An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to the world
She grunts and finally opens her eyes
She wipes the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent the night
Irene sits up and turns off the alarm
Shit
She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table
: '  - Irene get's up with the empty glass in her hand
She stumbles out into the
She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen
We stay in the hallway as Irene enters in the kitchen and switches on the light
96
We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her glass
It's quiet for a moment
She drinks
She fills the glass again
Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand
She switches off the light in the kitchen
But as she starts to go back to her room
Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene
: - Sara is going for a run through the city
She stops at an old art deco apartment building
- Sara spots Irene's name on the buzzer and calls up
No answer
- She walks out the door
Looks around
And takes off running again
: - Sara, hands on hips, walks down the hallway and opens the door
- She finds Rebecca, sitting on her bed
Drawing
She lights up when she sees Sara
Hey
Hey yourself
Where were you all night
97
Oh,  got inspired
just lost track of time
Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper, grabbing a towel
She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her tattoo
Sara grabs a robe
beat
She's nervous, but she needs to do this
Time for the "big talk
" She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca
-- want a tattoo
(' ) Will you come with me
Uhhh
Please
It would mean a lot to me
won't be able to do it without you
Sara looks into her plaintive eyes
So much want in them
Um
sure
Okay
- The girls walk along the wall, checking out the samples
You can't rush this, Rebecca
We can always come back
know what  want
Okay
'm out here if you need me
Sara sits down as the   escorts Rebecca upstairs
She looks giddy and nervous
Sara waves
When she's gone, Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene
98
- Sara, bored, leafs through a tattoo magazine for the 100th time
Her phone buzzes
response from Irene: "outta town for a gig
will call when back ; )" Sara's relieved
Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs
Wincing in pain
Sara puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up
Let's see it
Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just under her collarbone: "" Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her
() Think of me as your sister
Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara
If you want
you can call me Emily
Sara clenches her fists
She's shaking with rage
She moves toward Rebecca, whose grin fades
What's the matter
Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out of her
And Rebecca can't believe it
She's that far gone
Her eyes search Sara's for an answer
Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door
Rebecca watches her leave through the front window
Sara never looks back
: 99
- The elevator doors open
Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps out, carrying a box of her things
Stephen waits by the door
This is all you're taking
'll get the rest of my things when Irene comes back to town
He takes the box
Then notices -- Where's your necklace
She instinctively rubs the base of her neck
can't find it
It's okay
Sara
'm not going back up there
He hands her the box
Time to man up
Wait here
'll go look for it
She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative
- Sara walks out to the cab
Pauses
She's tempted to look back at her dorm room window
but she doesn't
Good thing, too
Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down
Her face is blank
Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank
- Rebecca still sits at the window
She holds her camera up, taking a picture down below
She turns as Stephen enters
She puts the camera down
100
Have you seen Sara's necklace
Rebecca solemnly shakes her head
He looks around the dresser
In the drawers
Flips over Sara's pillow
Rebecca watches him
What did  do
He stops searching
Looks at her
She just needs to move on
With you
He doesn't answer
He keeps searching
but he can feel Rebecca's eyes on him now
Creepy
He gives up
If you do find it, can you let me know
Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his picture
Stephen stares at her, unnerved
He finally snaps out of it and walks out the door
She watches him go
-  - Sara is cleaning, trying to make a dent in a world-class mess
She doesn't mind -- a big weight's off her shoulders
You should call someone
The dean's office
Or at least your
She keeps cleaning
And tell them what
What has she really done to me
No one can do anything
() It's the weirdest thing, Stephen
The girl's own parents are afraid of her
101
Well, she sure scared the shit out of me
Sara really wants to change the subject
She holds up two of his t-shirts
Are these dirty or clean
Stephen sniffs the shirts
Somewhere in between
She throws the t-shirts at him
- Sara heads to class, walking faster than usual
Bumping into people as she looks around, making sure she'll spot Rebecca before Rebecca spots her
She makes it to the front door of the building
She looks back at the quads
- Sara locks the front door and heads back home
She walks down an empty quad
She slows at the sight of
Rebecca
Walking directly towards her from the other end of the quad
No one else is in sight
Sara thinks about veering off to the side
No
She can do this
She walks straight ahead
Rebecca keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the pavement, listening to her Walkman
Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other, preparing herself for the confrontation
Ten feet away now
Five
But Rebecca passes her without looking
Sara walks a little further and turns around
Rebecca keeps walking
Did she even see her
102
- Sara hurries up the stairs to the fraternity house
-  - Sara reaches Psi
and closes the door behind her
She looks around at the messy first floor
At the    in the living room, yelling at the hoops game on
Sara smiles
She's safe
- Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the open door to the hallway
She's sketching, still wearing her Walkman
Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the floor, but we can't see what she's drawing
Sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from outside the room is too loud
Stephen is on the bed, reading
He's used to it
She hears a loud commotion from the hallway
Frustrated, she gets up
- It's a couple of guys playing nerf basketball
Seriously
Is it a game to be as loud as you possibly can
She waves her arms like a crazy person
(') How many walls can you possibly bump into
They just return blank stares
She slams the door shut
-  - Sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to shout down the hall
Stephen eyes her warily
Her cellphone rings
She pulls it out of the purse: Jason
103
She hesitates
and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as she gets up from the table
Hey, 'm going to hit the library
( ) can walk you there
No, it's okay
Party starts at ten
Really cool band
hear the drummer's really hot
He may be, but 'm sleeping with his girlfriend
She kisses him
-  - , a handsome all-American Midwestern kid, stands in front of Sara's dorm
He's talking into his cell phone
Sara
'm actually
'm in front of your dorm
just flew in
'm at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210
Call me, okay
He hangs up
Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the door before it closes
- Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser
Opens the bottom drawer
Her sweaters
She fishes underneath them
Pulls out her lithium pills
But just looks at them
Anger in her eyes
She puts the bottle back
104
- Jason walks through the hallway, checking the numbers on the doors
He stops in front of Sara's room
Knocks lightly on the door
No answer
Knocks again
- Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door, ignoring the knocks
Almost catatonic
Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest, shredding it to pieces
- Jason writes a note
He folds it and slides it under the door
He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the elevator
- Rebecca stares at the note for a moment
She walks to the door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note
- know you won't take my calls, but 'm here and  just want to see you
'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until
however long it takes
Please
Love, Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash
-  - Rebecca lets the water soak her
Eyes open
She runs her fingers through her now long dark brown hair
Black water trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain
105
- Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her reflection
She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long pair of shears
Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal
She gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears, still looking at it in the mirror
She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter
Just above her shoulders
- Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet
She opens it and thumbs through some of the clothes that Sara left behind
She pulls out a dress
Holds it in front of herself as she stands in front of the mirror
Nice -- but something's missing
Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain
Which she caresses in her hand
- Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book
Enjoying the silence
- raucous party in full swing
Stephen's band has just finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage smiles at him
Help me find the keg
Sure,  have to go look for my girlfriend anyway
She walks away
"Jerk"
He grins
and now checks his watch
Where's Sara
-  - The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca
Or is it Sara
The hair
The dress
The tattoo
Rebecca looks just like her
106
As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the necklace
She walks along, looking at the room numbers
She stops in front of a room
She's about to knock
but she sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an open room
She walks to the cart
She peeks inside the room
and now plucks the master key card off the cart
- Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed
The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for a silhouette of a woman to appear
She closes the door
Jason barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep
Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight
She stares down at Jason
She slips off her dress, which falls to the floor
She's in just bra and panties now
She climbs onto the bed beside Jason
He starts awake
-- Shhhh
She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over
She starts kissing the back of his neck
Sara
() You got my voicemail
Mm-hmmm
Kissing his back now, moving lower
Oh, man, Sara
Oh, that feels good
She works her way back up to his ear
() Turn over
107
Did that sound like Sara
But as Jason turns over, he sees
The hair
The necklace
That unmistakable "Emily" tattoo
() Close your eyes
He does
She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she needs to
She settles onto him
And now starts to move
And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap
Flat against the skin of her back
Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut
love you, Sara
She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven
Her hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife
But she doesn't love you
Jason's eyes fly open
That wasn't Sara's voice
And those aren't Sara's eyes boring into his
Rebecca leans down, her face to his
Jason's eyes widen in shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the knife deep into his gut
He gasps
You hurt her
She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel
He shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open
- Sara's still reading
hand touches her shoulder
She jumps, but it's just the
We're about to close
Sara can't believe it's so late
She puts her things away
Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the "1 new voicemail" message
She's about to press the voicemail button
But a text comes in from Irene: 108
"Im back
Get your butt over here, 've got another surprise for you
" - Stephen walks around, beer-less, searching the crowd for Sara
He checks his watch
Pats his pocket -- no cell phone
He heads up the stairs and into his room
- Stephen picks his phone off the dresser
Sees he has a new voicemail from Sara
He plays the message (
0
) Hi Stephen, it's me
'm stopping by Irene's, come on by
want you guys to meet
it's on 524 South Grand, Apt
708
Love you
He groans
sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens
All hands on deck -- the keg's still alive
'  - Sara comes fast-paced down the sidewalk
She enters Irene's building
' Sara rides up the elevator
/ Sara walks to the door of Irene's apartment
It's open but there's not a sound
No music, no cocktail chatter
She checks the apartment number again
It's the right one
She knocks lightly
No answer
Irene
'  - Sara steps into the foyer
109
She walks down the long entryway into a newly-renovated living room
Dark and empty
Sara's starting to feel uneasy
Irene
There's a bedroom dead ahead
Warm light pours out
She slowly walks to the open door
looks in
and freezes
'
Horror-stricken by what she sees
The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above
Irene
She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a bedpost
red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth
Sara can't move
She stares at Irene in shock
() Irene
Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror
As Sara starts toward Irene
(
) Some role model she turned out to be
Couldn't even take care of herself
Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand
Sara drops her phone on the floor
Rebecca
Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara
Sit down and shut up
Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene
Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone
Listen to me
All  ever wanted was to be your friend
beat
Sara knows she has to play this just right
Rebecca, you are my friend
110
No
Shut up
We're not friends
We're here because you betrayed me
Rebecca, 'm sorry-- Stop it
Stop saying things you don't mean
protected you
From that whore Tracy and that nasty little kitten
and That scumbag of a professor
() Even that loser ex-boyfriend of yours
What're you talking about
What'd you do to them
What'd you do to Jason
got rid of them all
And how do you repay me
By leaving me
Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment
She looks at Irene
Sara digs deep
lifts up her face
and looks Rebecca in the eye
She puts everything she has into this
Rebecca, please forgive me
long beat
Rebecca's face lights up
Now we can start all over again
Let's make things the way they were, Sara
That first day
Just the two of us
Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands
Rebecca
After all
you can only have one best friend
No
Don't
Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head
Irene starts to buck and thrash
But it doesn't help her
Lay still bitch
Please
Don't do this
Sara stands
She stares at Irene
She can't watch her die
She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun
Stop
mean it
Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming
Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara
She cracks Sara across the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor
She kneels down beside Sara
Worried
clearing the hair from Sara's face
() Shh
'm so sorry
Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand
It skitters across the floor and out the door into the living room
Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed
She puts her in a chokehold
Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the chokehold
She slams her back against the wall
And again
Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip
She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her
As Sara rises
Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of her
As Sara gasps for breath
Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun
Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it
Rebecca turns around and goes for the door
112
Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's head
'
Huge relief in Sara's face
But
Rebecca bangs the door
(
) Don't do this Sara
Sara takes the scarf out of Irene's mouth and pulls against the steel handcuffs
Useless
- Rebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door
Don't make me hurt you, Sara just want to be your friend
Sara and Irene are frantic
My phone
My phone
She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table
She rushes for it
No good the wire is cut
Shit
The window
There's a fire escape
You can reach it
Rebecca looks around for the gun
Throwing chairs and furniture around
She finds it
Picks the gun off the floor
- Sara races to the window and throws it open
There's just an empty street below
She eyes the fire escape
nearly impossible leap away
But Sara's out of options
113
- Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge
Her foot hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories
and smashes to pieces in the alley
Sara shuts her eyes
- Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires
The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head
Feathers go flying
Irene screams
Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand
know you're scared, Sara
But promise, everything is gonna be okay
She stops short at the sight of
Sara on the ledge
Rebecca turns and stares at Irene
Fresh panic rising in Irene's eyes
Sorry, Irene
But she's my friend, not yours
She raises the gun at the helpless Irene
But out of nowhere ,    , knocks her arm
The gun fires wildly, one bullet
- Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge
She grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall
() Ohgodohgodohgod
The more she screams, the more she loses her grip
114
- Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror, shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with Stephen
Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward
He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying out of Rebecca's hand
Stephen gets on top
He lifts his arm high and balls his fist before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking her out cold
He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he races for the window
(
) () Stephen
Help
Hurry
He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her
- Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name
He grabs her arms
Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up
Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets her cry
He smiles
Okay 've got you
Everything is gonna be okay
He pulls her halfway in the window
But a shadow rises behind him
loud unpleasant sound
Irene screams
Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock
Something's wrong
And now Sara stares in horror as
Blood runs down his face
He looks into Sara's eyes
and lets go of her
115
She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen disappears from the window frame
Using the brick wall for leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in time to see
Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window
He slumps to the floor, revealing: Rebecca
She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild
Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the window
She helps Sara in
They tumble onto the floor
Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen
Stephen
Stephen is out
She sees the gun in his belt
She pulls it out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca
The gun shakes violently in her hand
Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on the floor
You won't do it
We're fr-- Sara pulls the trigger
Click
Rebecca stares in shock
Click
Click
Click
Click
Sara closes her eyes in frustration
She drops the gun
Tears stream down Rebecca's face
She can't believe Sara pulled that trigger
But as if flipping a switch
Rebecca's sadness turns to rage
She balls her fists, her knuckles white, and
at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall
She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where
Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of Rebecca's purse everywhere
Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes
It hurts her to hurt Sara
Friends help each other
They take care of each other
Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca
116
Rebecca
We were never friends
That's the last straw
Rebecca comes hard, murder in her eyes
She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from the floor, and slams her against the wall
She starts choking the life out of her
Sara's face turns red
Redder
But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens
Her eyes stare in shock
Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand
The utility knife is in her other hand
stuck between Rebecca's shoulder blades
Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her
She won't let go of Sara
As she gasps for air, she sees
Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt
Sara self- consciously notices her looking at it
Rebecca reaches out and grabs Sara's hand
Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from around Rebecca's neck
Irene is trembling in the bed
Too shocked to say anything
() Sara
She races over to him
He's barely alive
Stephen
Hold on
She finds her phone on the floor
She steps back to Stephen and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911
He looks into her eyes and smiles
She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes
- It's a warm, spring day
Sara, melancholy but looking in much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career
She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck
117
She opens the front door and walks in
Students milling about look at her
Know who she is
We see Kim and Tracy
They don't say anything
Don't know what to say
Sara opens the door
The simple room is identical to her previous one
She hesitates at first but then walks in
There is a box marked "" filled with the things she left behind in her old dorm
There's a knock on the open door
(
) Welcome back
Hey
How are you feeling
Stephen enters the room
Better now
You being here's gonna help
Sara smiles
(') How's moving in going
Just got here
Well let me give you some time to get settled in
Actually,  need you right here, right now
Stephen grins
He likes where this is headed
Okay
: Sara and Stephen push the twin bed into the hallway
118
This isn't exactly what  had in mind
Sara grins
Now  can get settled in
'll be back to pick you up for dinner
You gonna be ready
Absolutely
Stephen takes off down the hall
Sara follows him with her eyes before she goes back into her room
Sara sits down on her bed
She watches the empty space where the other bed used to be
She just stares at it
The camera slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming gallery exhibition
