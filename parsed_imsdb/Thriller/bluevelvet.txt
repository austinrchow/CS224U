Jeffrey, your mother's on the phone
It's an emergency
Thanks for keeping me waiting so long
As Jeffrey moves quickly toward the telephone
'm sorry, Louise
17

Louise slowly follows Jeffrey, but stays in back of him
Jeffrey picks up the phone
Hello

Louise looks at Jeffrey crying, then turns away
Jeffrey hangs up the phone
: 22
'  - Mrs
Beaumont hangs up her phone
just next to the phone traveling into a shadow is a winged termite
: 23
-  - Jeffrey is waiting in a girls dorm lobby for Louise
Girls are milling around
Louise gets off an elevator with some other girls
She forces a smile at Jeffrey as she comes toward him
Can't you come to the damn airport
Jeffrey
can't
really can't have to go to that class tonight
can't get out of it
really can't
love you, Jeffrey
'll miss you
Alright

'm sorry, Jeffrey

Damn it

They kiss
: 24 : 25 26
- Jeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and , who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses, are waiting for him
They are parked illegally and another car is honking at them
Their trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things
They are waving and yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention
He finally joins them and kisses his Mother, then his Aunt
Hi Mom
Hi Aunt Barbara
They   hellos
(a bit concerned) Where's all your things, Jeffrey
This is it
Mrs
Beaumont looks at Jeffrey
sent a trunk home yesterday
This is all  have
You look good, Jeffrey
Did you have a nice flight
Yeah
How's Dad
He's alright
We'll tell you on the way home
27
'  - They get in the car
Aunt Barbara is driving
She is not a good driver and makes Jeffrey nervous
He watches her every move from the back seat
They drive on surface streets
Many gas stations, traffic lights, bars
He had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think there's some sort of clot, or tumor, or something in there
They're doing all sorts of tests
On the surface, he looks pretty good, but there are problems
They think he may have to stay in two weeks now, at least
You can go see him though tomorrow, Jeffrey
They tore down the  & , Jeffrey
Did you see that
Aunt Barbara that was 5 years ago
: 28
'  - The car pulls into the Beaumonts' driveway
The neighborhood is quiet and dark
: 29
'   - Jeffrey, Aunt Barbara, and Mrs
Beaumont enter the living room
Mrs
Beaumont turns on a table lamp
cold circle of light hits the light blue rug
Home again, home again, jiggidy jog
They look at Jeffrey
He looks at them
: 30
'  - Jeffrey enters his small attic-type bedroom, turns on the overhead light, and sets his suitcase down
He goes to his desk and leans across it to look outside
'
- The street is dark, except for a pool of light from a street light
- breeze of cold powerful string  blows as we watch Jeffrey stare into space
31
' / - Mrs
Beaumont is calling upstairs to Jeffrey
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready
(
) (calling) Be right down
Mrs
Beaumont joins Aunt Barbara at the breakfast table in the kitchen
This is marvelous jam
Are you going this morning
think Jeffrey would like to see his father alone
Jeffrey comes down the stairs
Everyone says their "good mornings," and Jeffrey sits down to breakfast
What time are visiting hours
've made arrangements with Dr
Gynde for 10:30
But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over;  need the car this morning
Well
Okay
Jeffrey, when you see your father
Yeah
He doesn't know you're out of school
He thinks it's a vacation for you
What
It would be too much for him
So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him
Thanks a lot, Mom
Jeffrey
Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store
maybe going back to school will be an option one day
hope so
think it's important not to get depressed
Depression is a terrible thing
They say it can bring on illness
(angry) Aunt Barbara
'll try not to get depressed
: 33
-  - Jeffrey follows a nurse to a hospital room
Please wait outside while Dr
Gynde prepares him to see you
Prepares him
She peers into the room
Jeffrey does too
34
- All he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical machinery
Doctor Gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to Jeffrey
Hello Jeffrey
Hello, Doctor Gynde
How is he
He's fighting hard
Jeffrey
it's very important that your father doesn't try to move
he's been immobilized
It would be very painful for him
sit close
you do the talking and moving
He knows you're here
He became very emotional
don't think he likes the idea of you seeing him like this
Nurse Cindy goes to the bed
She begins to pull the curtains back revealing Mr
Beaumont
(smiling a big smile) Mr
Beaumont
Your son is here to visit you
Then we see Mr
Beaumont
He has numerous tubes and needles going into different parts of him
stainless steel device holds his head perfectly still
Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves
(shocked but concealing it) Hi Dad
(speaking as plainly as possible, but sounds like mumbling) Hey Jeff
Jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but remembers his father cannot move
Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good
(lips moving but hardly any sound) uh uh
Are you feeling okay
(more mumbling) uh uh
Tears well up in Mr
Beaumont's eyes
Before Jeffrey can stop him he reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he manages to form words
(more plainly but under strain) Good to see you, son
(holding back tears) It's good to see you, Dad
Jeffrey squeezes his father's hand
35
- Jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home
He kicks up little clouds of dust as he walks
He has some time to think about things
He sees a green bottle in the distance
He gathers up a few more rocks and pitches them one by one at the bottle
He misses
He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange
He looks closer
It is a  , covered with crawling ants
Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around
All he sees are houses - some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene
No one seems to be around - No one seems to be watching him
He looks again at the ear
We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it
There is dried blood on part of it
Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto it
Again, he stands up and looks around
, a  goes into the back door of a house
Nothing more
Jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it
: 36
- Jeffrey goes up the front steps
37
- and to the Reception Desk
is standing behind the counter
Hello
could you tell me if Detective Williams is still working here
He's up in Room 221
Right up the stairs
: 38
221 -   - Jeffrey enters Room 221 and sees the desk marked, "
," however, the desk is empty
are talking at the end of the room; one of them comes toward Jeffrey
Are you Detective Williams
Yes
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont -  live near you
believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store
Sure  do
understand he's in the hospital
How is he
He's alright,  guess
hope
They're doing tests, that's why 'm home from school
was over at the hospital this morning and  was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood
there behind Vista,  found an ear
(matter of factly) You did
human ear
Yeah
've got it here in this bag thought  should bring it to you
Yep, that's right
Let's take a look at it
Jeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside
(continuing) That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't it
Let's run it down to the Coroner's Office and see what they make of it
Then, want you to show me exactly where you found it
: 39
'  - Jeffrey, Detective Williams, and an  '  are looking at the ear, which is sitting in a medical dish on a table
' The tests will take awhile
Meanwhile, we'll check the morgue records
don't recall anything coming in minus an ear
The Coroner's Officer turns to Jeffrey
' (continuing) Now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a heart, or even an arm, we would assume that there was a corpse, however, a finger or an ear
the person may very well be alive somewhere
What can you tell about the person from the ear
' Well
when the tests are done, quite a lot Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear came off a dead person
Right now,  know what you know
It's a real human ear
The human was, or is, Caucasian
also
It looks like the ear was cut off with scissors
40
- Jeffrey is out with Detective Williams and a    who have roped off the area and are doing a grid search
is also there taking flash pictures all around the field, especially where Jeffrey has told them he found the ear
Detective Williams takes Jeffrey aside
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and 'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential
Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel
Got it
Got it
Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did
Come on
'll drive you home
It's on my way
: 41
'  - Mrs
Beaumont and Aunt Barbara are doing the dishes
The news is on a small portable television
There is a broadcast on the mounting crime wave
series of murders are being discussed and a police drawing mug shot is shown on the screen of the suspect who is at large
: 42
'  - Jeffrey is sitting at his desk daydreaming
He suddenly picks up the phone, hesitates, then dials
Hello
please
Louise
is she there
Louise
(very happy) Yeah
How are you
He's okay
in the hospital for tests
(very serious) miss you so much
(smiling now) What have you been up to
Louise,  don't know
've got to see how my father is It costs a fortune in that hospital
When did he ask you to that
Look can't stop you
Go ahead
Just go ahead may never be back, go
ahead
Look Louise, stop trying to explain everything
Just do it
let's talk again in a couple of days or somethin', okay
Yeah,  still love you
Goodbye Louise
Goodbye
Jeffrey sits alone in his room, thinking things over
: 43
'  - -   ' , we  very close to the ear, gliding slowly around the crevices approaching the dark hole
huge, low rushing of air , : 44
'   - Low light
Jeffrey enters the room
Aunt Barbara and Mrs
Beaumont are watching television
Aunt Barbara is knitting
'm going out for awhile
(looks at her watch) Do you want the car
No, 'm just gonna walk around
Alright
Jeffrey
you're not going down by Lincoln, are you
(yelling back) No
'm just going to walk around the neighborhood
Don't worry
Aunt Barbara and Mrs
Beaumont continue watching the television
On
we see a man's shoes
He is sneaking slowly up some stairs
: 45
- Jeffrey walks along the dark streets
The same sombre  plays low and slow
Some of the houses have a few lights on, some are dark
Some windows have a slow uneven blue flashing light, indicating the television is on inside
Jeffrey continues walking through the night
In the trees, the shadows continuously re-arrange themselves in mysterious, sometimes frightening patterns
46
- Jeffrey finally comes to the house he's been looking for
He goes up the front walk
Now, at the last minute, he feels a little foolish and has second thoughts about knocking on the door
He looks in a window
Inside, he sees a nicely-lit living room
He goes ahead and knocks
very pleasant-looking middle class answers the door
Hello
uh
my name is Jeffrey Beaumont
Is Detective Williams in
Oh, yes, Jeffrey
Come in
He'll be back any minute now
You're welcome to wait
Is it urgent
47
'   - just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all
Maybe  better go
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee
(thinks a bit) Alright
48
'  - She leads him back to the kitchen where she has him sit at the kitchen table
She pours him a cup of coffee
was sorry to hear about your father know your mother from church
It's such a shame
Yeah,  know
Would you like a piece of cake
No
No thank you
It's a real good chocolate cake
Duncan Hines' devil's food
real good
Yeah

49
'   - Out in the living room,   and her ,  , come up from the basement
They are both carrying books
Sandy is a very good looking, high school senior and Mike is a big, handsome football player type
50
'  - Sandy
Sandy and Mike come into the kitchen
Jeffrey has a big piece of chocolate cake in his mouth
(continuing) Jeffery, this is my daughter, Sandy, and
her boyfriend, Mike
They all say "Hi" to one another
Mike's gotta go
(to Jeffrey) Nice to meet you
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh
Yeah
It was nice meeting you too
They leave and go out the front door
(smiles) He comes over to study
(smiles big) Yeah
The front door opens
(
) Pam
In the kitchen, John
Detective Williams comes into the kitchen surprised to see Jeffrey
Oh
Hello, Jeffrey
what's up
He kisses his wife
Come into the study a minute
(getting up) Excuse me, Mrs
Williams
Certainly
Jeffrey follows Detective Williams into his study
: 51
'  - Detective Williams' study is filled with filing cabinets
The desk has two phones and is covered with papers and folders and a picture of Mrs
Williams and Sandy
The police radio is asking for Detective Williams as they enter
(to Jeffrey) Shut the door
Detective Williams speaks through the radio while Jeffrey shuts the door
(continuing; in radio) Detective Williams here
yeah
Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton
yeah, copy
(clicks off radio, turns to Jeffrey) Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us
Very interesting
know you must be curious to know more
(scratches the middle of his back) But
'm afraid 'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case
One day
when it's all sewed up, 'll let you know all the details
Right now, though
can't
understand
'm just real curious like you said
was the same way when  was you age guess that's what got me into this business
It must be great
And it's horrible too
(a cold look comes over Detective Williams) 'm sorry Jeffrey
That's the way it has to be
Anyway
'm sure you do understand
Jeffrey studies Detective Williams' face as they walk back to the living room
52
'   - (calling into the kitchen) Mrs
Williams
Thanks for the cake
(coming out from the kitchen) Oh, you're welcome
Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey
Say "goodnight" to Sandy
We will
Good night
Jeffrey leaves and they shut the door behind him
53
- As Jeffrey leaves the light of the front yard and enters onto the dark sidewalk, he hears Sandy call out behind him
Are you the one that found the ear
Jeffrey stops and turns around
Sandy comes up to him
Yeah, how did you know
(coyly) just know, that's all
remember you from Central
54
- They slowly walk down the street together
Oh yeah
You were pretty popular
Didn't you run for some office
Yeah  did
treasurer
Shouldn't you be studying or something
Am  bothering you
No
You're not bothering me
You a senior
Yes
How is Central these days
Terrible
boring
What else is new
right
Yeah
What are you doing now
'm home from school
My father's in the hospital
That's too bad
What do you know about the ear
anything
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it
(she smiles) Come on
you brought it up
Do you know anything
don't really know much but bits and pieces hear things
My room is right above my father's office
The ear
there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person
That's direct from the Coroner's Office
The person is unknown
There are a couple of cases  get mixed up on, but  think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear
heard some of the same names
Do you know who was brought in for questioning
There were at least three, maybe four
But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear
There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned
and a musician
and some others
Were all these people questioned this afternoon
No
this has been going on for some time several months
About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river
They were from people who were reported missing
They never found one complete body
only parts
The ear is from a missing person maybe
Maybe so
It's a strange world isn't it
Do you know what building the woman lives in
Yeah
It's close by
that's what's creepy
They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except  don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her
guess you have to get back home soon
Not really, why
(then she understands) You want to see the building
Come on, 'll show you
: 55
- Jeffrey and Sandy walk through the light of a street light
The street sign " " can be read
They walk into darkness and continue down to an apartment building on the right side of the street
(nodding toward building) That's the building
She lives on the Seventh Floor
Don't stop to look long the police are watching
Where are they
don't know
you're not supposed to see them
They're supposed to see you
They begin walking slowly back to Sandy's house
Did they find out anything when they questioned her
don't know
like  said, she's not my father's case
Oh yeah
What about those other people
Anything
My father is watching the businessman
The businessman had a partner who disappeared
left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids
They think he's been murdered
You really do hear a lot, don't you
Yeah,  guess so
(they continue walking) What are you going to do now that you're home
have to help out in my father's hardware store
they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while
which is nice
Still, it must be kinda rough
It's not bad
but it's bad enough
it's a lot worse for my father
(Jeffrey points to a house) used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world
Jeffrey and Sandy both laugh
What happened to him
don't know
he moved away
: 56
- Jeffrey and Sandy walking and talking, sometimes laughing in the distance, while the  theme, haunting yet warm, plays over
57
- They arrive back at Sandy's home
in front of Sandy's home
've gotta go in
Thanks for the tour
It was nice talking to you
Sandy just looks at him shyly before she turns to go up the front walk
(continuing) guess 'll see you sometime
guess so
Like you said
It's a strange world
(smiles) Yeah
Good bye
Jeffrey watches as Sandy goes inside her house
He watches her house for a moment and sees her cross the living room
He turns and walks away
Again, the     swell up as Jeffrey walks through the night
: 58
'   - Jeffrey is poking around in the back room
He picks up some bug spraying devices
He yells out to an old black man who works in the store
Hey, Ed, okay if  borrow these bug spraying rigs later on
Ed peers into the back room
Spots Jeffrey
Listen Bud
If you need to spray for bugs they're yours
It causes me no pain
Okidoke Ed
Thanks
: 59
'   - Jeffrey puts the stuff in the trunk of the car
There are several "Awake" magazines there too
He gets in the front seat and drives off
: 60
'  - Jeffrey driving
He looks at his watch
It is 3:30
61
- Jeffrey is parked across the street from the school
High school kids are pouring out the front door
In a moment he sees Sandy come out with two or three other girls
They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey
He starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls up alongside of them
very close
Sandy suddenly recognizes him
You hungry or thirsty, or both
(taken back) don't know
'd like to talk to you about something
Just a minute
pull over and wait a minute
Sandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to them
There is some whispering and giggling and then, (to the girls) Please, don't say anything to Mike
promise
The girls promise
Sandy goes around and gets in the car
don't want to cause any trouble
'm here, aren't
(smiling as though he knew) guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon
Ooooo, you are smart
Just don't get too smart
: 62
- Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in a booth
Jeffrey's grilled cheese on white bread and a coke have just arrived along with Sandy's coke
Alright, now tell me
What is it
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience
sometimes, in some cases
it's necessary to take a risk
got to thinking
'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment
you know
sneak in and hide and observe
You said it was a strange world
and you're the strangest part of it
Are you crazy
she is possibly involved in murder
This gives me the creeps
Settle down
have a plan which  think will work
There is very little for you to do, but  do need your help
Aren't you curious about my plan
(thinking and intrigued, plus she is beginning to like Jeffrey) It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan,  guess
(getting excited) Alright
the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that  could crawl into later
Now, how are you going to do that
Right out in the car  happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig
will go to her apartment and be the pest control man
will spray her apartment
After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and will then jimmy a window
What will  say when she comes to the door
You will be a Jehovah's Witness
have a few "Awake" magazines for you
You don't have to keep her very long
a few seconds is all 'll need
Whatiya think
don't know
it sounds like a good daydream,
but actually doing it is too weird
too dangerous
Let's just try the first part
If that goes well, we'll see about the rest
No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this
You've got a point there
: 63
' / - Jeffrey and Sandy are in the car
Jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls
Now
we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes
can stall if it's more, but need time to find a good window
alright
Alright
Let's go
64
- They get out of the car
Sandy has the "Awake" magazines
Okay, 'm going ahead
Wait a minute, what's her name
Oh bother
Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor
Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy
Thanks
Dorothy Vallens
Okay
good luck
three minutes, no sooner
Alright
Good luck, yourself
Jeffrey takes off in the direction of the apartment building
: 65
- Jeffrey walks up the front steps and goes in the double outer doors
66
-   - He looks up and down the mailboxes and finally finds "
Vallens, Apartment Number 710
" Jeffrey goes into the lobby
: 67
-   - Jeffrey climbs the stairs
An   is making her way down the stairs
She sees Jeffrey and his rig
Well, it's about time you came
Jeffrey forces a smile at her and after she's gone
(to himself) That's a good sign
He keeps climbing
He arrives at the Seventh Floor
and finds Number 710
He knocks and waits
He looks around
the hallway is empty
opens the door
She is a very beautiful woman in her late thirties
She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick wavy hair
Full red lips
Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe
Yes
What is it
Pest control
gotta do your apartment
Oh God, that stuff stinks
(as he goes in) Nope
it's new stuff
no smell
Oh yeah, that's good
68
'  - Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying
All the while he's getting a good look around the apartment
There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape
Jeffrey looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying
The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed
Suddenly, there is knocking at the door
What is this
Grand Central Station
She opens the door
Jeffrey looks
It's not Sandy
, with a yellow sports coat, is standing there
Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the looked around Dorothy to see him
Dorothy says something to the Man which Jeffrey cannot hear
The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone
The whole thing looks to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter
On a long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts
He wraps things up and gets out
(to Dorothy) That oughta do it
Yeah
69
-   - Jeffrey leaves
Out on the stairs, he finds Sandy with her "Awake" magazines
Are you alright
Yeah
let's get outta here
What happened
As they go downstairs, was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me
Was it alright
Yes and no
Did you recognize him
No
only saw his back
He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall
didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me
didn't have time to get a window, but  found this key
(he shows it to her) Pretty nifty, huh
Yeah, if it opens the door
Yeah
70
-   - They get to the door of the apartment building
You go first
71
- They leave the building separately
When Jeffrey gets to the car, Sandy isn't there
He looks around
He starts the car and drives off
There, up ahead, he spots her
He pulls over and she gets in
So
what's next
Pretty clever
Are you game for more
owe you
since  goofed up this one
You didn't goof it up, but
you still owe me one
want to sneak in tonight
It's Friday
do you have a date tonight
Yes
do
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl
guess you would have a date
that does that
72
' /  - Jeffrey is driving Sandy home
You really want to do this, don't you
don't want you to get involved, really, mean,  do, but if something went wrong mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder
They pull up in front of Sandy's house
(making up her mind - against her better judgment) 'll tell Mike 'm sick
There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me
Afterwards he can go out with the guys
Just so the record is kept straight though, love Mike
What do want me to do
(studies her a moment, then) First of all, we'll have a nice dinner
Try to find out where Dorothy sings
already know
The "Slow Club
" It's on Route 7
Great
'll pick you up around eight o'clock
Is that good
Yeah, but don't pick me up
my father may think it's strange
'll walk over to your house
'll be there at eight o'clock
Okay
You better get out before someone sees us
Sandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her house
Jeffrey calls out after her
See ya
: 73
'   - The television is on
Some crime show is playing, but the  is very low
The   is over and is giving Mrs
Beaumont an injection of medicine
Aunt Barbara is sitting nearby
That will take care of you, Frances, for another week
don't want you to overdo things either
Take it very easy
'll see to it, Bill
Good
feel fine
That's not the point
You're under a great deal of stress
don't overdo it
don't be foolish
Jeffrey enters the room - to say goodnight
Doctor Gynde
my whole family's sick
What's going on
'm not sick
Jeffrey points to his head and makes a circular "crazy" gesture
They all laugh, except Aunt Barbara
(continuing) We'll see who stays in my will
They laugh again
(to his mother) Can  use the car tonight
Of course, Jeffrey
They say their goodnights
74
'  - Jeffrey and Sandy are looking at each other
Jeffrey turns back to driving
Sandy watches Jeffrey drive then she turns and watches the stores and shops go by
When she is turned away, Jeffrey turns and look at her
Sandy is thinking
What's the plan
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens
We'll watch her for awhile
'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment
Brilliant
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and will plant myself there
This is not my usual Friday night
: 75
" " - The   is a sleazy night club on the outskirts of town
It has a dirty trash-strewn parking lot in front of it, where Jeffrey and Sandy park
They get out of the car and enter the club
: 76
" " - ' (French accent) Good evening
two
Yeah
Could we get a small table in the back
' Surely, come this way
They follow him and are seated
' May  get you something to drink
'd like an ice-cold Heineken
(she might as well) That sounds good
Two
' Two Heinekens, thank you
The Maitre d' leaves
On stage a   is telling jokes
The jokes are tailored for this kind of working-class crowd
The people are laughing
The place is almost full
Jeffrey and Sandy are taking it all in
(to Waiter) When does Dorothy Vallens come on
(flustered; overworked) don't know
pretty soon
Who knows
After the Waiter leaves, That guy was filled with information
They pour their beers
(raising his glass) Here's to
an interesting experience
'll drink to that
They drink
: 77
" " - Later
Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner
The
is arranging a floral art deco microphone and a  , a  , and a are on stage
(very low key) Ladies and gentlemen
The Blue Lady
Miss Dorothy Vallens
There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue laughing, talking, and drinking
Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage
She smiles
The house lights are still up
As she sings the first lines of " " the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on her as she sings the word, "Blue
" This is a very sexy and slow version of the song
During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into
Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "
" They hear the first few lines before they get out the door
78
" " - They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off
: 79
'  - Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city
They don't talk as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another
80
' /  - They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop close to the building
Jeffery cuts the engine
It is very quiet
Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or watching
Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the Seventh Floor
It is dark
Sandy moves
Every tiny sound is heard
Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building
Jeffrey,  don't think you ought to do it
Why not
It's crazy and dangerous
My God shouldn't have told you
It'll be okay
don't think you should wait out here though
think you should go home
Can you drive this car
Yeah
but
Leave it in the front of your house for me
okay
Could you wait a little while
this key may not fit
wish you wouldn't do this
It doesn't make any sense
Let's go somewhere and have some coffee
'm going in, Sandy
'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went
don't want to see you tomorrow
Mike's coming over
Oh, okay
can  call
Okay
yeah, call
Look
it can wait till Sunday
Call tomorrow
It's okay
Good luck
hope you can sneak out okay
You're going to wait until she's asleep
Yeah
'm going to wait here until she comes
Are you sure
'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up
Okay
Jeffrey nods
Okay
thanks
don't know if you're a detective or a pervert
That's for me to know and for you to find out
'll see you
mean call you
okay
Okay, okay
Bye
Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door
He looks in one more time at Sandy
They stare at each other silently
Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car
Sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building
She slides over and sits in the driver's seat
: 81
-   - Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor
comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor
He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until the man goes downstairs
Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710
He takes out the key and looks around
No one
He inserts the key
It fits
He turns it
The door opens
82
'  - He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door
It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness
Soon he finds his way around
He decides on the closet to hide in
However before he goes in to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the darkness
He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom
Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty child's room
In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a propeller on top
The kind that plays music when the propeller turns
The hat is sitting silently on the bed post
He quietly closes the door
He returns to the closet
Once inside, he checks out how much he can see
Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment
This is where he will stay
He moves around some to relax
He takes several deep breaths
He looks at his watch
It says "10:17
" 83
' /  - Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and street
84
'  - In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to stretch his muscles which are getting tired
Again, he takes several deep breaths
He looks at his watch - it says 12:45
(to himself) Oh no, hurry up Dorothy
Come on
and gotta pee
Great
it's now or never
Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to the door of the bathroom
His foot hits the door and it makes a loud noise
He freezes
85
'  - He moves again into the bathroom
He starts to pee
Heineken
: 86
' /  - Suddenly Sandy sits up alert
87
- car drives up and a  helps Dorothy Vallens get out
They walk into the building
: 88
'  - Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else is so quiet the water  seem very loud
89
' /  - Sandy begins to honk the horn
90
'  - Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom as the tank is still filling
, he hears something
a key going in the door
He bolts toward the closet
He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front door opens
Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - , except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door
(
) (we're watching Jeffrey trying to control frightened breathing in the dark closet) Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow
You want a drink, or something
(
) better get back
thanks anyway
Goodnight
Goodnight now
The front door shuts and the living room lights go on
Jeffrey can see Dorothy come toward him
She walks  , almost to his face, when the phone
She turns immediately and goes to answer it
Jeffrey almost passes out
He thought he'd had it
He overhears
(on the phone) Hello
yes
yes sir, Frank
Let me talk to him
Please Frank, sir

Don
It's okay
Don't worry
Don
can you hear me
Is little Donny
Is he there
Don
You mean Meadow Lane
Frank
What's the matter with him
know
When
Okay
In an hour
'll be sweet
Momma loves you
Okay Frank, sir
She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands
(to herself) Frank, you son of a bitch
She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail
She nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch
She puts on a record, " "  She sits back down and chews her nail again, listening to the ; she starts to cry
She stops herself and takes the record off
She starts taking off her stocking
She then takes off her dress
Underneath, she has on a bra and panties
She crosses the living room, goes down the hallway into the bathroom
Jeffrey can't see her too well now
She takes off her panties in the bathroom
She is now naked
She looks at herself in the mirror
We see Jeffrey's face as he watches her
She disappears from view completely and we  her start a
: 91
'  - Jeffrey's face
He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again
He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can
She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe
She doesn't see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden
She closes the door
It shut
Jeffrey is in almost total darkness
He listens
He can around, then silence
He hears the kitchen sink
He  her
Now he can see her
She sits down on her bed
She looks up
Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight
She looks at the closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it
She slowly gets up
Jeffrey doesn't know what is up
He looks but she walks out of view
, he hears a  , and just as suddenly, the , and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him
When she realizes that    , she  , very loud
(crazy scream, then) Put your hands up, on your head
Get down on your knees -
What are you doing
Who are you
What's your name
'
Jeffrey
Jeffrey
Jeffrey what
Jeffrey nothing
You tell me
Let me see that wallet
(reads his license) Jeffrey Beaumont
What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont
wanted to see you
What
Are you kidding me
Who sent you here
Nobody
Shit
You better tell me something
was
an experiment
Just to see if could do it
An experiment
Hey, 've seen you before
sprayed your apartment
took your key
really didn't mean to do anything but see you
Tell me what you saw tonight
(scared, nervous) saw you come in, talk on the phone
get undressed
(interrupting) The phone
What did you hear on the phone Tell me
Word for word
(trying to remember) You said hello
to Frank
You wanted to talk to someone
Don
and little Donny
You said something about Momma loves you
and something about a Meadow Lane
something in an hour
don't remember any more
Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking
That's right
That's what  said
You have a good memory
Then what
Well
Then you got undressed
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress
(quietly; feeling guilty) Never before this
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you
(gets an idea) Get undressed
want to see you
No
Come on
, you come on
Take off your pants want to see you
Look
'm sorry
Just let me leave
No way
Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife
She goes to Jeffrey
Now she has a knife and a gun
He's scared
Get undressed
want to see you
Jeffrey begins to undress
First he takes off his shoes and socks, Then his shirt
He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off
Now he is only in his underwear
He does
(continuing) Come closer
Dorothy has a strange look on her face
She reaches out and pulls Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees
She looks at him
(whispering) What do you want from me
(quietly, getting very hot) don't know
(whispering) What do you want
Dorothy is getting very  and begins to talk in a childlike voice
She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts
Don't move
don't look at me
Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him
Do you like that
Yes
He tries to touch her
Don't move or 'll kill you
She looks at him
(continuing) Do you like talk like that
No
Lie down on the bed
He lies down
He looks frightened
There's a ,  on the door
Dorothy looks  frightened
She quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to Jeffrey
(whispers, frantic) Shut up
Hurry
Go in the closet
Don't say anything or you'll get killed
mean it
is heard louder at the door
Jeffrey picks up all his clothes and gets in the closet
He's naked and hiding in the closet
Dorothy closes her robe and glides to the front door
Jeffrey sees  come in
Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut
He is wearing a tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket
He's got on a pair of blue jeans and boots
He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go off" - presence
He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy
He sits on the couch
Hello, baby
(annoyed, condescending) Shut up
It's daddy
shithead
Hello, daddy
(can't-you-remember- anything-attitude) my bourbon
Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink
As she passes the closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face
She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank
Frank sips on it
sit down
get your chair
Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down
She adjusts her robe
(studying her) spread your legs
Dorothy slowly spreads her legs
She can see Jeffrey staring out of the darkness of the closet at her
wider
She opens her legs wider
Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his bourbon
He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at Dorothy, her body - her crotch
Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting
Frank suddenly reaches to his belt, where he has a small canister and a mask
He opens a valve on the canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth
The canister is filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange sounding
The result is frightening
(high voice) mommy
Dorothy jumps
She keeps looking at the ceiling
(continuing, with high voice) (frightened) mommy's here
(high voice) Baby wants to fuck
Then, Frank's voice goes to normal
(normal voice, but loud - like an army order to himself) Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her
He takes one more gasp of helium
(high voice) Baby wants blue velvet
Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank
(whispering) Okay
Frank slowly moves Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the texture of the velvet
His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body underneath
His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the velvet robe
Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear
Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug
He warns her
Don't look at me
He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth
Then, he pushes her arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way
Frank sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way
Dorothy is moaning
Frank is breathing very heavily
He feels her crotch
Don't look at me
(heavy breathing) Daddy's home
He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy
He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him
Faster and faster, then he has a climax in his pants
Dorothy's head is falling back
She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet
Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank
(screaming) Don't look at me
He slugs her in the face
His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from deep within him
On his hands and knees, he moves away
The robe pulls out of his mouth
His breathing is even heavier now
He stands and begins to move around the apartment
He goes to a wall, turns off the lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying
Dorothy moans softly
It gets very quiet and still for a moment
Then, Jeffrey hears Frank with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom
The high, strange sound reverberates in the distance
Jeffrey can't make it out - soon, he hears Frank's high laughing
Frank comes back into the living room
The mask is around his face
All his breathing - every sound is high
He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door
Stay alive baby
See you next Christmas
Frank leaves and shuts the door
The apartment is silent except for Dorothy's moans
Jeffrey is stunned
He doesn't move
He watches Dorothy in the half-light
She rolls over and starts crying
The crying is deep and genuine
Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her
He bends down and touches her
She flinches and turns to see him
She turns back sobbing
He tries to get her up
Why don't you come lie down
Come on, 'll help you
She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed
She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall
He covers her with the sheet
Don't
(referring to the sheet) don't like that
What do you want
Nothing
Are you alright
Sure 'm alright
(she starts crying again) 'll go then
He starts to put on his underwear
They're inside out
He tries to turn them around
Don
No
Don
Hold me
'm scared
Hold me
Please
Jeffrey turns to her
He studies her
He reaches out and takes her shoulders
He moves down and holds her
(whispering) Thank you
honey
(whispering) It's okay
It's okay
They lie together for a long silent moment
Do you like the way  feel
(hesitates) Yes
See my breasts
See
Jeffrey looks
Yes
See my nipples
Yes
(whispering) You can kiss them if you want
Fell them They're getting hard
Jeffrey starts to move closer
Dorothy closes her eyes
(continuing) Go ahead
don't mind
Jeffrey can't help himself
He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her breasts
They both are getting very hot
Feel me
Jeffrey is all over her now
Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him
You can hit me, if you want to
No
please
won't
Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the wall
Stop it
She moves and won't let him feel her anymore
She holds his hands away
(whispering) Do you like me
(whispering) Yes,  like you
(whispering) You can be my special friend and come and put that in me
They start making love
Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying
What's the matter
Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face
very hard
Get off me
Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face
Dorothy goes into the bathroom crying all the way
Jeffrey sits, confused
Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy
true scream of horror
He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong
92
'  - She is just flushing something down the toilet
The water  rushes
He turns to her
She is trembling and in a state of shock
made it go down the toilet
What
He looks in the swirling water
It looks like an ear revolving around and around then whatever it is disappears
made it go down the toilet
Jeffrey looks up
he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down" on the mirror
He looks down into the sink
At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood and a smear of fresher blood
Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating in the bathroom
93
'  - Frank in bathroom
94
'  - Frank at door saying "see you next Christmas
" 95
'  - (inner voice) Next Christmas
Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy
What was it
An ear
Another ear
(out loud, to Dorothy) What was it
(strangely - extremely frightened now that Jeffrey may have left it) Do you know
No
(breathing heavily, strangely) You don't
No
What is happening
Maybe you don't know
know you though
You're Jeffrey Beaumont and  know where you live and  know ways to get you and know ways to kill you
Please don't talk like that
You're upset
'm not helping you
'm sorry for what did
better go
Go then
can't let you put it in me now but  want you
like you
Then don't talk about killing
Did  say that
didn't mean it
or did
(laughs) Sometimes  think it would be fun
(strange smile) Go ahead, you better leave now
can't open myself to you now
'll tell you a little secret
(she leans close) want to die
Don't say that
It's a secret so don't tell anyone
Some day 'll show you where
've gotta go to sleep now
(frightened by her craziness) He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink
He takes another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and turns, goes through the hall to the living room
He crosses slowly to the door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the bathroom
He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him
She stares into the sink
Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe 'm leaving now
She is whispering something to herself
(very faint whisper) Help me
help me
please help me
Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do
96
'  - Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room
He looks around and sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's
Suddenly he remembers the photograph that Dorothy hid
He picks up the pillow and sees a picture of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed hat with a propeller
He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage license
It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don
(
) Don
Oh my God
He hides the photo again
He sees Dorothy's telephone
He memorizes the number - moving his lips with each digit
He goes to the front door and opens it quietly
97
-   - He looks out into the hall
It's empty
97A
-   - He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs
These steps are cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud
He goes through a door marked ""
98
- and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk
He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths
He looks at his watch
2:30
He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy
He secretly worries about what he's gotten into
99
'   - Jeffrey enters the house
along the rug in the dark to a foot
The lights come on
the leg to Mrs
Beaumont waiting in a chair, staring
(startled) God
you scared me
Is something wrong
What's happened to your face
Nothing
'm fine
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey
There's got to be some order, Jeffrey
thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late
: 100
'  - Jeffrey gets out of bed and goes to the phone
He dials a number
Louise Wertham, please
okay
(waits) Louise
Jeffrey
Hi
What's up
(pause) Good night
Louise
Are you kidding
(long pause) Well, Louise,  wish you a lot of luck and if things don't work out, think you should go into comedy
Jeffrey hangs up the phone hard
He shakes his head
101
'   - Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store
He thinks
He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down
He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down
(to himself, out loud) How can  help her
can't tell her to go to Detective Williams
She'll think 'm a policeman
She has my address
She can go there
if she has to
'll tell her
and her
and she thinks 'm Don
her husband
Where the hell is Don
- maybe he died
Jeffrey dials the phone
Hello

Williams

- The searching, mysterious  plays over while, is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope
Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in
(
) This is what my father's disease looks like
Yes
The  is seen in
Cells are moving
The Doctor makes a change in magnification
The cells are huge - then, even bigger
They are so big we can hear them moving
103
" " - The parking lot is half-full
strong wind is blowing trash around
Jeffrey parks his car
104
" " - and enters the club
He speaks to the Maitre d'
table in back, please
' Certainly Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey
'll have an ice-cold Heineken
' One Heineken, certainly, sir
Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves
It is very dark and smoky inside
He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting with some other  watching Dorothy sing
They are sitting two tables away
Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious- looking
He looks right up to her eyes
In his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers
Again her first number, " ," segues into "
"  This song she sings mainly to Frank
When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly
Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside
" " - He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's
He gets into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits
: 106
" " - Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the Among them are Frank and his friends
They get into a black Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway
Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them
He has to gun the car up to sixty-five to catch up with them
107
- The mysterious  plays
He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right
He waits at a light right behind them
Inside they are lighting cigarettes
The light turns green and Frank takes off
Jeffrey follows them through a dark area down by the docks
He follows them up a narrow street through dark factories
108
- Dark, low  now
Up ahead, Frank parks his car
Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his lights and engine
He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment building next to a bookbinding factory
They disappear within
The electric lines above buzz loudly
Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street
He reaches Frank's car which is making popping and clicking  as it cools down
He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it down in his notebook
He continues on to the apartment building
109
- '  - Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes
He sees a name - Frank Booth
The name gives him the chills
The apartment number is 26
In the distance, he hears footsteps
He quickly leaves
110
- and crosses the street down to his car
He gets in and waits
Frank comes out of the building and crosses to his car
(out loud to himself) 'll bet  know where you're going
He follows Frank as he pulls out
: 111
- Jeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car
He watches Frank leave the parking lot
112
- He follows Frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear
He seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment
113
- Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait
: 114
- storm is building
There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car door as he gets in
His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine and leaves
Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone
(thinking out loud) shouldn't go in
shouldn't
but 'm too curious
and  have to try to help her
He then gets out of his car as the wind is building
115
- and runs through the vacant lot
116
- to Dorothy's building
117
-   - He goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on 710
moment passes, then the door flies open
Dorothy looks as if she was expecting Frank to be coming back
Dorothy Hi
can  come in
(looking around the hallway) Yeah
hurry up though
They go inside
118
'  - Are you alright
Dorothy breaks down crying
No
'm not
Jeffrey goes to her
Why are you here
whatiya want
uh
(still crying) looked for you in my closet tonight
(a little laugh) It's crazy,  don't know where you came from but
like you
That's not crazy
like you too
Dorothy looks up
They stare at each other for some time
liked being with you last night
same here
There is a loud knocking on the door
(she starts to stagger) Oh shit
(frightened) Frank
can you stand up
'm alright
go hide
This won't take long
Be quiet
Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door
She holds her head collecting her fragile self
Dorothy goes to the door and opens it
It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple sports coat and light blue double knit pants
His eyes are glazed and his face is broken out in a sweat
Frank gone
Yeah
but get outta here
He's comin' back
Bull
Alright, suit yourself
He's comin' back
What for
(shaking) 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for
Frank's got you really loaded tonight
(getting upset) Yeah, maybe so
Frank's got me
and you
and really it's all thanks to Don
isn't it
remember that
Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs
Oh he forced you, huh
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in
he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good
just feel so horny
'm supposed to be here watching you why can't  be here fucking you
Listen
know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing
let me wet my whistle, baby
(cool, but real mad) No way
get out
'm gonna tell Frank
'm gonna tell him what you said
Okay, 'm goin'
You'll see
'll get you
Dorothy kicks the door after he closes it, then she chains it
Jeffrey comes out of the closet
(talking softly) Nice guy
Who's he
Who's it, you mean
, Dorothy starts to shake and cry
Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him
She starts sobbing again
(continuing) Oh God
Don
Why can't  just die
(quietly, soothing her) There you go again
stop saying that
You can make it
can't
can't
You think you know so much
Take it easy
What's goin' on anyway
Why are you in so much trouble
Dorothy is sobbing and Jeffrey is holding her
There is a long silence and she calms down
(whispering) don't
okay
Just don't
just be with me
(now very strangely) Oh God
Come with me
Who are you
Come up here
Dorothy takes Jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back
119
-   - to a back stairway leading to the roof
120
-   - The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full moon
The wind continues to moan
They move to the roof top and Dorothy leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building
very sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the wind
(as she stares down) Look
(turning to her quickly) No
(continuing to look down, her eyes widening - she whispers) Falling
No
Please, Dorothy
Why are you in so much trouble
He moves closer to her
(continuing) Who is Don
(very crazy and angry) Don
Are you in with them
(whispering) No
But you're in very big trouble
Why are you so interested
Why do you keep asking me
came back to help you
You said do let girls sneak into my house
You know where  live
if you need to
come to where  live
Who are you
Maybe 'll need to
you like me, huh
Yes
(whispering) or do you just want me
'm going to let you enter me now
No
should go
Please
please stay
She makes him kiss her
he really likes it
Once again, Jeffrey and Dorothy get
Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof
Dorothy cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the roof
Why Dorothy
We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it
Don
have to make it hurt
want there to be nothing again
Don
(as she slams her head again and again) She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish kiss
Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls
: : 121
- Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into darkness
He continues down the sidewalk
He looks up at the starry sky
The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely
: 121A
Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points of light appear on Mr
Beaumonts distorted dream face
He is trying to speak
He's trying to say "Jeffrey
" 121B
Another dark image appears
robin sits in a tree at night
Very close
There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound
121C
Now Dorothy's apartment building at night
very low angle looking up to the roof
Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from the roof
It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is a red high-heeled shoe
As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of Dorothy's which open into a scream
121D
Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified
122
'   - Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that 've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house
Okay honey
that sounds nice
Jeffrey
think you've got termites in the house
Oh yeah
Have you seen any
've seen a few
Well,  haven't seen any
wouldn't worry about it
Look
better go
Okay honey
Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls
She moves into a dark area and taps
Something falls
She reaches down
In   we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick carpet
Then in   we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look
She looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls
We   the dark walls of the house
: 123
'   - They all sit around the dining room table
They have their heads bowed in a prayer before dinner
We thank you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost
Amen
They start passing food around
Like  was saying
if you toss the ball like this, with your fingers just down here, that thing'll spin like a beauty
real straight
(teasing him) Yeah
Then how come nobody caught anything last week
(not laughing) 'Cause we had a bad day
You play any sports, Jeffrey
No
Looks like you'd make a good runner
Well
mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football
mean
no offense
Jeffrey looks around and sees Sandy looking at him
She then gives a stern look to Mike
Then Mike and Sandy both look at Jeffrey
(not offended) No
you're right
mean
some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered
Yeah, well  never wanted to get slaughtered much
(not getting any humor) Well, most guys don't
mean that's the point
You all mind if  take my vitamins
No, Mike
but there are vitamins in the food, you know
Everyone laughs
Yeah, but  gotta supplement that
gotta take a bunch of zinc too
The body is like a machine
has got to stay in perfect tune for perfect health
That's what 'm interested in
Sandy looks at Mike
Oh yeah
and a few other things
Everyone laughs again
We've got some Heinekens
Yeah
like Bud myself
'll get it
Mike, whatiya want
guess another glass of water
Sandy and Jeffrey share a look
: 124
'  - Mike and Sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement
Jeffrey is sitting on a chair nearby
The television set is on
(calling downstairs) Who wants dessert
It's blueberry pie
and ice cream
Jeffrey and Sandy say "yes
" None for me, thanks
Jeffrey looks over at Sandy
Mike sees this
There is more tension growing
(referring to
) What are watchin' this junk for
You can change it if you want to
don't know why we have to watch
Mike
We don't have to watch it
Come on
Mrs
Williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert
Here you are
Would anyone like coffee
That sounds great
Anyone else
Alright Jeffrey, just a minute
Mrs
Williams goes back upstairs
Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their dessert
Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie
Mike stands up
'll be right back
He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs
Once around the corner he stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another
Well, how did it go
What happened
Well
've found out some things
nothing really for certain
There are some strange people involved
What did you see
Well
(looking around, feeling funny) Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else
you know what  mean
Just then, Mrs
Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey
She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs
This seems strange to her
Mike
Are you alright
Mike starts upstairs
(mumbling) Yes
Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by
Mrs
Williams and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs
Williams enters the basement
She throws Sandy a concerned look
Just then, Mike calls downstairs
Sandy
Could  talk to you a minute
(calling up) Sure
just a sec
(to Jeffrey) Excuse me
125
'   - Upstairs, Mike is by the front door
Come on out a minute, okay
Okay
They leave
125A
'  - Downstairs Mrs
Williams picks up some dishes
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and 'll get to the dishes
Sure thing
please don't worry about me
Can  help you with the dishes
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not
just relax and enjoy your coffee
'm sure Sandy will be back soon
Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down
Jeffrey
Yes
If you want to come up a minute, 'll show you some pictures
126
'  - Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study
(continuing) Take a look at these
These are the photos of the vacant lot where you found the ear
You might find them interesting
Jeffrey begins going through the pictures
They are 8  10 black and white prints
Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite beautiful in an abstract way
As he goes through them
These are beautiful
How's the case coming
Okay
Anything you can tell me
The criminals are winning
Is that why you say it's horrible
Yes
guess you've seen some bad things
Yes  have - so bad  wouldn't poison your mind by telling you
Why do you do it
won't let the bastards get me up against the wall
It's an act of defiance
Yeah
get it
Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos
piece of cloth in the grass
Carefully he asks
What is this
What color is it
(leaning over to see) Blue
It's Blue Velvet
Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset
Detective Williams puts the photos away
Can  use the car for a while
Sure
What's up
want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen
Dairy Queen
(he holds his stomach) Oh yeah
Sure, that sounds great
: 127
/  - Jeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car
She pulls out
They drive away
What's with Mike
He got a little jealous
'm sorry,  didn't
It's okay
Don't worry about it
The car glides along
Jeffrey and Sandy smile at one another
They drive on
You want a Dairy Queen
No way
'm about to blow up
128
/ - Sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church
The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night
You want to tell me about it
It's a strange world, Sandy
this is what  have found out
What think  have found out
Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don
they have a son
think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears
think he is holding them to make her do things for him
think she wants to die
the ears were for her a warning to stay alive
there is another man involved
call him the "yellow man"
you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door
don't know what he does but think he's on drugs supplied by Frank
Frank is a very dangerous man
(quietly) Wow
Should you tell my father
don't see how  can
and  can't prove any of this
got all this information illegally
also it could get you in trouble
You saw a lot in one night
Actually
've been in twice
(uneasy) Twice
without her sensing anything
(lying) Yes
(pausing) Did you see her undressed
Yeah
mean
a little,
you know
Yeah
(a searching, slight smile) That doesn't bother you, does it
Who, me
Why should it
(seeing some jealousy and and happy for it) That's what  thought
You're sure right
It is a strange world
Why are there people like Frank
Why is there so much trouble in this world
don't know
had a dream
in fact
the night  met you
(she reflects silently on this before proceeding) in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins
you know, birds
robins stood for love
and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love
and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference
guess
until the robins come there is trouble
Yeah  guess so
(he turns to her) You're a neat girl
So are you
(laughs) mean you're a neat guy
We better get back
guess so
you want to help me watch Frank
'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow
with a camera
Sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street
They begin driving back
129
/  - No, silly - 'm still in school you know
but 'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned
You better be careful, Jeffrey
will
'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay
They pull up in front of Jeffrey's house
Okay
be careful
Okay, Sandy
130
'  - Jeffrey gets out of the car
He goes around to her side and looks down at her in the car
She looks very beautiful
He stands there for a moment
Can  give you a kiss good night
(pauses, trembling) You better not, Jeffrey
Okay
okay
Goodnight
See ya tomorrow
Sandy slowly drives off
Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes inside his house
131
'   - The house is very dark and quiet
Jeffrey finds a note by the one table light is on
The note is from his mother
It reads, "Jeffrey hope you enjoyed yourself
See you at breakfast
Love Mom
"   postscript is written on the note by Aunt Barbara
"Jeffrey, honey,  found these
Love, Aunt Barbara
"  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites
He picks one up and studies it
Again we see a huge  of a termite in the half-light
Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement
132
'  - Jeffrey paces nervously
He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers he dials Dorothy's number
There is a "click" but no one speaks
Jeffrey instinctively speaks
Hello
(telephone
) Speak to me Fucker
Jeffrey hangs up immediately
He's scared
(to himself) Stupid
So stupid
now she might be in even more trouble with Frank
hope not
hope not
tomorrow  have to find out more about Frank
133
' /  - Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of Frank Booth's apartment building
The camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box
Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching
steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps
Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures
We see a  walk down the street and turn up the steps
Jeffrey shoots, but really only gets the back of the man
Damn
He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating
: 134
' /  - Later in the day
Jeffrey sits waiting
He looks at his watch
It says 2:00
As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man
the Yellow Man
They head for Frank's building
Jeffrey hurriedly removes the shoe box and begins snapping pictures
They mount the steps and disappear within the old dark structure
Wow
: 135
' /  - Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00
(out loud to himself) Fifteen more minutes
Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera
He starts shooting as   come out the door
It is the Yellow Man and a man who is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache
He carries an alligator-skin briefcase
Both are talking together and now laughing
Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to cover the camera as they approach
The box falls
The Yellow Man looks, but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the glove compartment
The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his
Jeffrey decides to follow them
He waits a few seconds and starts off
136
- They drive through town
137
- to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building
Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them
At a metal landing they stop
He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance
The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees
He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder
Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point
He looks at his watch
"3:25"
You gotta wait for me Sandy
'm on a real roll
He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase
138
- then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking
At the end of the alley he turns left and stops short
139
- He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars
He walks closer
Through the crowd he sees a broken window
Hanging in the window is a dead man
Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head
On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock
Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head in horrible positions
Jeffrey stands next to two black guys
Suddenly one of the police officers start pushing everyone away
Jeffrey turns to them
What happened
#1 He was blown away man
can't you see
#2 That cracker was the biggest dealer in this section of the city, brother
the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe
It's a speedball heaven in there
Oh yeah
What about the woman
#1 Probably just a whore he happened to be with at the time
Man oh brother
#1 This is the way the world is my man
take a good look
Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off
: 140
- Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing
She is frantically looking around
Jeffrey stops for her
(looking beyond the car) Jeffrey looks around
big   is running up to a chain link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey
Everything stops for a moment
Then, Mike runs off
Oh great
141
' /   - Sandy goes around and gets in the car
(continuing) You were late
'm really sorry
What am  going to do
You want to go talk to him
Yeah, but
don't think it's going to do much good
Let's go
'll try to talk to him later
: 142
- Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth, but having the same things as before
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals
That's what makes it so good
You wanta hear what  saw today
Shoot
Number one
saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank
Now
the only trouble is
what does this prove
(thinking) Nothing really, but it's interesting
they know each other
they seem to like each other
Maybe
But  think the Yellow Man is on drugs
think Frank supplies him
Oh yeah
Number two
saw the Yellow Man come out
This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase
They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance
Number three
now get this
In the distance was a murder
a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken
Jeffrey
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place
can't believe what you are finding out
Are you going to continue with this
Are you going back to her apartment
Yeah
Jeffrey
Why
'm seeing something that was always hidden
'm involved in a mystery
'm learning
and it's all secret
You like mysteries that much
Yeah
you're a mystery
like you
very much
Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth
They stare at each other
Oh yeah
Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently
She pulls away
Don't
please, Jeffrey
Jeffrey looks at her for a moment
You worry about me really
Yes
is that so surprising
Yeah worry
a lot
got you into this
: 143
-   - Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building
He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door
He knocks on the door and Dorothy opens it
Come in
Hello
144
'  - Dorothy closes the door
She chains it
They kiss
The kiss gets hotter
The feeling begins
They move down the hall to the back bedroom
They've never made love there
As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat with the propeller
He picks it up and spins the propeller
It makes a bit of music
Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller
She gains some control of herself
Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand
It used to make me laugh
but
'm sorry
maybe  better go Dorothy
Yes
Frank- Frank is coming
No
how could he
Don't go
You think 'm crazy, don't you
want you to stay
(crying) don't hate me
(very nervous) sure don't hate you
'm not crazy
(thinking) know the difference between right and wrong
That's good
Jeffrey moves to get out of bed
(she poses) Do you like my body
Sure  do
She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue
She gets down in a pose and holds it
'm a statue
you can feel me
you can do anything you want
Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about
: Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness
(dreamily) What do you want to do
'm doing it
Are you a bad boy
Whatiya mean
Do you want to do bad things
(very dreamy) Anything
anything
(whispering hot) What do you want
want you to hurt me
No
told you
don't want to hurt you
want to help you
think  know some of what is happening to you
(she doesn't react) Dorothy
Frank has your husband and son
Dorothy
Doesn't he
You have to do something Dorothy
go to the police
No police
(pushing herself back against the headboard; then frantic) No police
Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd
She turns into a little girl
She has a frightening little girl smile
You like to open me
don't you
Yes
(thinking with a grin) What if  told Frank that you opened me
For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment
It is empty
Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy
That wouldn't be too good, would it
Frank would open you
Okay
know you've been scared
now you want to scare someone
(smiles very strangely) Does that scare you
Shut up
Beeeee careful
(scared and mad) Come on Dorothy
What if Frank came over here and found us
The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind
Look, snap out of it, will ya
Kiss me
They kiss
(continuing) Do you love me
Do you love me
asked first
Sometimes  think  do
And sometimes you think you don't
Well, get away then
She bolts up
Wait a minute
Wait
Whatiya want
For cryin' out loud
Just get outta my bed
She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face
Jeffrey struggles with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams out at his face again
He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the wall
She smiles through the pain
Oh God
are you alright
She falls on him and smothers him with kisses
See
see how you hurt me
Now
Open me
enter me
Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness
We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it
love you Don with all my heart
No
it's not Don
But he can't stop himself or her from making love
Come inside me
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
(very frantic) Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
The movement subsides
There is silence in the room, except for breathing
didn't mean to hurt you
Shhhhhh
Now  have your disease
You
what
You put your disease in me
your semen
it's hot and full of disease
There's no disease,  can tell you
Men are crazy
then they put their craziness into me
then it makes me crazy
then they aren't so crazy for awhile
then they put their craziness in me again
(starts crying) it's burning me
but  love you do,  do
Did you know that
Did you know that  love you
(very apprehensive) 'm glad you do
There's so much  want to tell you
'm in so much darkness though with things moving
there is darkness sucking me
It's kissing me and darkness is entering me
in every hole
It's opening me to a death
Dorothy
no
(whispering) If  die, then they'll be free
It's getting late, isn't it
can tell
it's a cold feeling when it's late
It's warm then it gets cold
Jeffrey
feel it getting cold
You called me Jeffrey
did
are you
Yes
Why are you here
(Jeffrey gets on top of her again) Hmmmmmmmm
Ok
No
not really
(they kiss - very hot) but also because  really want you to be alright
Dorothy stops and looks at him - she holds his face
She starts to cry
You do
you really do
She continues holding his face - looking in his eyes crying openly
he pulls him down to her
Jeffrey
Jeffrey
Jeffrey
Jeffrey smiles
guess  should go
want you to stay with me
think  better go
146
'  - Later
Jeffrey is dressed and Dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her robe
She is combing her hair
One or two lights are on now
She looks at Jeffrey and smiles, brushes some of his hair back from his face
You're my special friend, aren't you
(whispers) have you inside of me still
(big smile) It helps me
need you
Jeffrey doesn't know what to say
He starts walking toward the door with Dorothy beside him
(lying) 'll call you
Okay
soon
Do you think 'm too fat
What
'm getting a little bit fat
hate that
You look beautiful to me
She pats her hips
Right in here
fat, fat, fat
Dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it
The hall is empty
There is some noise on the stairs
Suddenly, Frank and   of his come into view on the stairway
(to Dorothy) Oh no
(her eyes glaze over - she's gone again) No
(calling out to Frank) Hi baby
Who's this fuck
He's a friend
from the neighborhood

On a ride

Hell, that's a good idea

Hey, let's go
Frank grabs Jeffrey and pulls him along
(continuing to Dorothy) Come on
We're goin' for a joy ride
147
-   - Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway
: 148
' /  - Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat
Jeffrey is sandwiched between two very dirty strange guys in the back
Frank is driving very fast and very crazy
Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which periodically blares out police reports
At the lights, when they turn green, Frank lays rubber
Where you wanna go
know
We gotta see Ben
We gotta, right
(laughing) Yeah
we gotta see Ben
The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs
Liquor and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors
They are blurred visions because of the speed of Frank's car
Driving music plays
Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making turns
The Ford bounces off several curbs
Dorothy occasionally steals a glance back at Jeffrey
She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, mostly in fear
Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes
149
" " - Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a hault
They all pile out
Frank grabs Jeffrey
Come on
wancha to meet a frienda mine
Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too
Okay Frank
(to Jeffrey) What kinda beer do you like
(just says it) Heineken
He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar
150
" " - Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place
Frank has Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster
In the back there is a black man fondling a white girl near a doorway
151
- " " - They go through the door to a back room
few naked girls are there near beds with curtains around them
One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit around her head and pillow
Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard
He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat
Hey shithead
that's the last time  get you high and watch you freak out - motherfucker you tore my coat and  lost my lucky piece of blue velvet, man
152
'  - to the black and white photo of a piece of cloth in the weeds in the vacant lot
(
) What color is it
(
) It's blue
blue velvet
153
- " " - Hey Frank 'm sorry buddy
Yeah
get ready for a love letter
When you least expect it
Frank
please man
big love letter
Frank pushes him down on the bed with the dried vomit whore
They leave Willard
154
- '  - and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps
Frank bangs on a door at the first landing
Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer
Hey Ben
It's Frank
tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door
It's
His voice is very horse from years of smoking
(very gracious) Frank
Come in
Hey,  brought some friends
and some beer
Fine
Welcome
Come sit down
155
'  - The apartment is very large
All the furniture is over-stuffed
In the room there is a very much over-weight  dressed in black and a greasy-looking
On the couch, a   plays with a large doll
(getting higher all the time) Suave
goddam are you suave, you fucker
You want some beer
(smiling) Certainly Frank
(to the fat woman) Darling, get some glasses
We'll have some beer with Frank
Won't you sit down
Everyone kinds of mills around
Paul sits down in a chair and starts laughing at some private joke in his head
Shit Ben

The Big Lady brings the glasses in and sets them on the card table
She looks worried
She gives a helpless pleading look to Ben
Raymond
Where's the fuckin' beer

You want me to pour it
No,  want ya to fuck it
Shit, yes

Good, let's drink up

If you like Frank

Frank's friends, Paul and Raymod, laugh
(laughs loud) Cheers
Suave man

Here's to Ben
Frank slaps Jeffrey in the face
Hey neighbor
Here's to Ben
(stunned, grabbing his face) Here's to Ben
Do you see, Ben

Ben goes to Jeffrey
Thank you neighbor
let me see your face
did he hurt you
Jeffrey shows him
(continuing) Oh

Suddenly Ben slugs Jeffrey in the stomach
Jeffrey doubles over
(continuing again) Is that any better
Frank almost dies laughing
Everyone else joins in
Ben turns to Frank
Frank,  have something for you
Excuse us everyone
por favor
Hey
let Tits see her kid
As Jeffrey tries to catch his breath, he sees tremendous emotion fill Dorothy's face
She rushes forward
Raymond grabs her by the arm and takes her into another room
Jeffrey hears her crying out
He hears a small boy
(
) Donny, oh my Donny
(
) Mommy
155A
- '  - Dorothy is sobbing and clinging to Donny
He is crying and gripping her like a small monkey would grip its mother
Suddenly Donny breaks away, screaming
Mommy
You left me
you stopped loving me
(coming back into Ben's living room) Okay
let's hit the fuckin' road
we're givin' our neighbor a joy ride
let's get on with it
Bye, Ben
Ya wanna go on a joy ride with us, anyone
You
(looking around) Dorothy rejoins the group
She's in a state of shock
Frank pinches her cheek
(continuing) No smile for Frank
No
Okay, fuck it
Let's go
Oh you wanna come with Raymond
Raymond has picked up the greasy girl
See you Tuesday, Frank
Right Ben
'
'll fuck anything that moves
156
" " - They leave and pile back into the car
157
' /  - Now there are four in the back
Raymond starts necking with the Greasy Girl
They speed on into the night
Frank drives through various dark streets
158
' / - then out onto a highway and goes over 100 mph down a two-lane highway
(to Jeffrey) Hey
You like to walk
What
Let's take our neighbor out
Let him fuckin' walk back
(laughs) As Frank is driving Jeffrey sees Dorothy nervously look at the road and surrounding countryside, then questioningly at Frank
She senses something about where they are going
Where are we going, Frank
Hey
Tits
'm taking your neighbor to the country
maybe something for you too
(very anxious) Frank
You want to see him too, right
Yes, but
Then, shut up
Frank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey
(continuing) Hey
What's this fuck got to do with anything
159
' /  - Frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees
He turns violently around to Jeffrey
What are you lookin' at
Nothing
(locks eyes with Jeffrey; long pause) Don't look at me, Fuck
shoot when  see the whites of the eyes
(takes helium) You like me
Jeffrey is quiet
(still high voice) Look at these
What are these
Come on, Frank
Let's go
Please
Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see
Don't say , Fuckhead Those are my breasts
Can  feel 'em
If you want to
Frank takes helium
Baby wants to pinch 'em
She winces and tries to pull away
(continuing) What's the matter
Give 'em back
They're just a little red, that's all
let me feel 'em again
Come here
Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again
It really hurts her and she is frightened and in pain
Hey
leave her alone
Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard
She stifles a scream
Jeffrey gets mad
He hits Frank hard in the face
Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey
Frank stares at Jeffrey
out of the car fuck ,
160
' /  - Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window
His distorted face is hideous
He opens the back door
Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey and pull him out of the car
The Greasy Girl laughs nervously
Frank
he didn't mean it
Leave him alone
come on
He didn't mean it
Shut up
Gimme your lipstick
(takes gas) Hey, pretty, pretty
Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight
He puts lipstick heavy onto his lips
While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey
Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the mouth
Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul have a hold of him
Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches of red lipstick on his face and mouth
Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy
He grabs Jeffrey and presses his frightened face against the front window
Then, the back window
Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses Jeffrey's face against the rear window
Inside the car, this show is crazy and scary
Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car again
(to Jeffrey) You're fuckin' lucky to be alive
Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank
Dorothy and the Greasy Girl watch in terror
Don't be a good neighbor to her or 'm gonna send you a love letter
straight from my heart, fucker
You know what a love letter is
It's a bullet
straight from my gun, fucker
Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever
Understand, Fuck
Yes
'll send you straight to hell, Fuck
Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins feeling Jeffrey's face with it
(continuing; breathing heavily) You feel good
feel my muscles
Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps
(continuing) You like that
(to Raymond and Paul) Hold him tight for me
Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face
Dorothy screams at the car window
: 161
- '
of rocks on the ground
He slowly picks up and looks around
The car is gone
He is swollen, bloody, and covered with lipstick
His pants have been pulled down and " " has been written with lipstick on his legs
He struggles to his feet and pulls his pants up
He fastens his belt and begins limping up the dirt road highway
: 162
-  - Jeffrey dials
Yellow Cab
Is this Yellow Cab

on Route 7
(he looks around) Just by Meadow Lane
163
'  - Jeffrey remembers Dorothy mentioning "Meadow Lane" on the phone
164
'  - Jeffrey remembers Frank saying "You want to see him too, right
" and Dorothy saying, "Yes
but
" 165
-  - (continuing) Meadow Lane
There's a big Nehi sign
Okay
'll wait, don't worry,

: 166
'  - Jeffrey is sleeping
His face is swollen and bruised
The clock says 4:30 p
m
: 167
'  - The clock says 1:30 a
m
Jeffrey goes into the bathroom
Looks at his puffed face and takes two aspirin
He stumbles back to bed
: 168
'  - The clock says 7:30 a
m
and Jeffrey gets up and stretches
Owww
His muscles are very sore
: 169
'  - At the breakfast table
Aunt Barbara and Mrs
Beaumont are staring at Jeffrey
don't want to talk about it
Everything's okay now
don't want to talk about it
Sometimes it helps to talk things over
for instance, many marriages are saved by
(interrupting, smiling at Aunt Barbara) Aunt Barbara
love you, but you're not gonna get it
He holds his fist up
: 170
'  - Jeffrey dials the phone
Mrs
Williams
Hi, this is Jeffrey Beaumont

Sandy

Good

'  - Sandy on her phone
We broke up
No

Jeffrey

'  - Jeffrey on his phone
Great

Jeffrey

'  - Ok but  promise  won't mention you
Okay

See you Friday night, if not before
: 173
- Jeffrey climbs the stairs up to Detective Williams' office
174
221 -   - He rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with fear
Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man
Their eyes lock
Jeffrey freezes
Excuse me
Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man
He shakes with fear
He slowly turns around
The Yellow Man is studying some papers on his desk
Again the Yellow Man looks up
This time he is slightly suspicious and he cooks his head
Jeffrey cannot move
Finally, Jeffrey is able to step away
As he leaves the Yellow Man's line of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door
(inner voice) Gordon
Gordon
a police inspector
wait a minute
wait a minute
175
- Jeffrey remembers the black guy saying: "The police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe
" (continuing, inner voice) The police
the police
Gordon
177
'  - Jeffrey remembers Frank's voice in the distance: "Gordon went right up to them - in broad daylight of course - 'cause he's the man, right
And he took all those drugs away
" 178
221 -   - (continuing, inner voice) Took all those drugs away
Gordon took those drugs away
: 179
- Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos
He stops in front of Detective Williams' house and hesitates
Jeffrey's face has a troubled look
He approaches the front door
He hesitates again before finally knocking
Detective Williams answers the door
Sandy is in the background
When she sees the look on Jeffrey's face, she knows why he's there
Jeffrey
Come on in
Hi
Hi Sandy
'm sorry to bother you, but 've got to talk to you
Okay
come on in
Looks like you had a bad face lift
(with a goofy smile to Sandy) Yeah
180
'   - Sandy gives him a concerned look
Jeffrey follows Detective Williams to his study
181
- He closes the door behind him
Okay
Okay
gotta tell you
've
discovered some things
Anyway  have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them
The first picture is this
He shows him the picture of Frank and studies Detective Williams' face as he sees it
(continuing) This is Frank Booth
His address is on the back of the photo
He, in my opinion, is very sick and dangerous
This photo here is of Frank with another man as they went into Frank's apartment
Jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face extra carefully
Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's
(continuing) And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy
here's the photo
think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people
think Frank has taken her husband and her son
(continuing) have no hard proof of any of this
Her address is also on the photos
think these people are involved with drugs
and murder
think Frank is killing drug dealers and
(he decides not to tell Detective Williams everything) and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs
had to tell you  got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure
had to tell you about these things in case it could help
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved
can't tell you the whole story took it upon myself
can't say more
Is Sandy part of this
No
not at all
(referring to the photos) Who knows you have these
Only you
and the photo lab
You're all through with this now
Yes sir
sure am
Detective Williams studies Jeffrey, then the photos
For now
Alright
you better be
And Sandy better not be involved with this, can tell you
Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later
Yes sir
Jeffrey leaves the study
182
'   - In the living room, Jeffrey looks at Sandy
Everything okay
Yeah
think so
just had to tell him some of what  knew
Is Friday still on
You didn't tell him about me
No
Detective Williams comes out of his study and sees the two of them talking
He sees some nervousness
Sandy quickly changes the subject
should never had gotten you going on this
(changing, smiling) Yes Jeffrey
Friday's on
Okay

: 183
'   - Jeffrey waters the flowers and bushes as his father had done
His face looks much better
: 184

His Mother and his Aunt Barbara are there too

- of cells moving - dark cells move in - the picture gets dark
: 186
- Jeffrey is driving over to Sandy's
He has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front of the Williams' house
Its lights are slowly revolving on top
The engine idles
a Man is inside
his head down, studying some papers
Jeffrey barely notices all this, as he heads for the door
Mrs
Williams answers the door and Sandy is behind her in the dining room
Hello, Jeffrey
Come in
187
'   - Jeffrey enters and crosses the room to Sandy
You all set
Detective Williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing in a briefcase on the dining room table
Just then a man comes up to the door which is still open
Jeffrey turns to see
It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man
All the color instantly drains from Jeffrey's face
(yelling inside) Hey John - get a move on
Detective Williams turns
He sees Detective Gordon
He turns again
He sees Jeffrey's expression
Sandy hasn't seen it yet
Detective Williams goes to Jeffrey
He looks him straight in the eye
He also positions himself between Jeffrey and
Gordon
Easy does it Jeffrey
Behave yourself
don't blow it
Sandy becomes curious and moves over to Jeffrey and her father
Jeffrey decides to trust Detective Williams
The Yellow Man (
Gordon) yells again
Come on John, get it in gear pal
So long Jeffrey
You two have a nice night, okay
Okay
What is it
Just some fatherly advice
That's right
Jeffrey and Sandy head for the door
The Yellow Man's and Jeffrey's eyes meet once more
The Yellow Man cocks his head
thinking
No recognition
(to her mother) Goodnight mom
(to the Yellow Man) Goodnight Tom
- Goodnight, Sandy
188
- They cross the yard to the car
Jeffrey helps Sandy in, then goes around and gets in himself
They are both dressed very nicely
189
' /  - Jeffrey starts the car and pulls out
What was that all about
Nothing

It's good to see you
It's good to see you
Where to

It's okay
You look beautiful
Thank you
Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening

that's a real good idea
: 190
- Jeffrey and Sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded with kids dancing and talking
Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands
Jeffrey feels a little out of place
raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy
The music is loud, fast dancing music
You want to dance
can't dance fast
Really
Really
you want to dance with someone else
Let's wait for some slow one
Just a minute
Sandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way through the crowd to a  by the record player
Sandy confers with the girl
Sandy comes back to Jeffrey
Don't worry
took care of it
You want something to drink
Just then, the music goes slow
You want to dance
Okay
They begin to dance
At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together
They move around to another look
Then they kiss
They kiss for the entire rest of the song
Between songs and during the entire next song
They finally, as they say, come up for air
love you, Jeffrey
They kiss again
Then they dance and look at each other
Then they hug each other
As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes
(inner voice) really do love you
: 191
- Later
Jeffrey gives Sandy a little kiss while they're over by the cokes
They're having a drink
Sandy introduces Jeffrey to some of her friends
She is very proud of him
They are both very happy
They look at each other and kiss again
: 193
/
- Later
The party is breaking up
Kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars
Jeffrey and Sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm
They say goodnight to the  in the living room and leave through the front door
They can't take their eyes off one another
They are totally oblivious to the   in a car across the street
As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off
194
' /  - The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a scream
It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's car in the rear
Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror
Sandy turns around in fear
Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street
Oh my God
What's wrong
Frank
He swerves around the corner
Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a driveway
(continuing; referring to the car ahead) Come on
Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street, passing "Lincoln St
" can't outrun this guy
He floors the car and flies down another street very fast
My father has a gun at home
No
Sandy
this guy is a killer
promise you
Sandy turns back to take a look
Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs it off a curb as he rounds a corner
hub cap goes flying off rolling noisily down the street
Try to get to my house
then my father can
195
'   - He remembers Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, at Sandy's house
196
' /  - No
Jeffrey floors the car again
but the car behind him is fast and gains on him
It swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror
Now it swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car
Sandy screams
It's Mike
It's Mike
Jeffrey looks over
It is Mike
Out of enormous sense of relief he starts laughing
He slows instantly and so does Mike
197
'  - He pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing
Mike swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out
(out of the car; very drunk) Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard
'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house
Stop it Mike
(to Sandy) You shut up
nobody's talkin' to you
Hey who's that Jeffrey
Your mother
Everyone turns and looks
Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman
It is Dorothy
She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth
She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over
She is totally different, drained of her sexuality
She has been ravaged
Dorothy
Dorothy
Dorothy Vallens
Yes
He jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back
Mike comes after him
(going for Jeffrey) Hey, you ivy league shit
(pushing Mike off) Later Mike
gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed
Mike, go home
Mike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey
Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car
Jeffrey stands back up and glances at Mike
(dull, very drunk) Hey, 'm sorry
Hey
Jeffrey gets into the car
Yeah
okay, Mike
Jeffrey shuts the door
Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in the front seat
Take her to my house
My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone
Do you have anything to put around her
(starts the car) No
Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house
Probably not
no
Why
Let's get her over to your father's
(looking quickly from Dorothy to Jeffrey) Right
Watch out for Mike, there
Mike and his friends are getting in Mike's car
Mike is trying to start the engine
He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse
He screeches out and screeches to a stop
Then he guns away forward and shoots crazily down the road
Here we go
They drive off
198
' /  - (looking over) Oh God
Jeffrey is that you
Sandy looks at Jeffrey questioningly
Yeah, it's me
Oh God, Jeffrey

Dorothy is clinging to Jeffrey
Mrs
Williams goes to call

Jeffrey looks at Sandy and she returns the look

(continuing) opened myself to him
He put his disease in me
She presses herself tight to Jeffrey
(continuing) Tell me its okay

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Mrs
Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is causing Sandy
Sandy is crying now and turns away
Sandy

She leaves the room hurriedly
(crying) Jeffrey
What's going on
Shh

Dorothy starts screaming

'   - Dorothy clings to Jeffrey
Her eyes are turning a dull, milky white
The effect is horrifying
She is in shock

Dorothy is saying something, mumbling
Hold me, Don
Don
Where is he
(straining her eyes to focus on Jeffrey) Promise me you'll help him
promise, Dorothy

Hold me

She bolts up screaming directly into Jeffrey's face
Her beaten face and milky eyes are a study in horror

Mrs
Williams

The dim lights in the front entrance
Jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters
No one
: 209
'  - Sandy is trying to get her father on the police radio
(over the radio) No

210
-   - Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs
His shoes squashing the carpet make mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building
He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops
high-pitched whine can be heard faintly
It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment door
He gets his key out and inserts it
Turns it
With a loud click the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing
He sees something and jumps back
211
'  - It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room
He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again
Something is wrong with him
He is bleeding from the head
He stands almost motionless
in shock
Jeffrey peers into the room again
He enters carefully and lets the door close behind him
He very cautiously moves forward into the room
Slowly he moves closer to a hideous sight
Standing in the middle of Dorothy's apartment is
Gordon, the Yellow Man
He is in an extreme state of shock
He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head
His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see
Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears
only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head
bullet hole in the center of his forehead
The
is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine
Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall
The high whine stops instantly
Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing
Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket
Jeffrey's heart leaps and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light
Jeffrey's heart goes wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and motionless again
The radio talks again
#1 Get back and stay down
#2 It's apartment eight
Music
begins to play
Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio
#2 (continuing) 'm sending Jack and Pete to the roof
It's
#1 Hey
Sounds of shots
#1 (continuing) He's shooting
from the second window
#3 Stay in place
#2 Jack
get up there quick
can return fire
#3 think he's alone
but return fire to second window only
Many shots
We see Jeffrey's face in
: 212
- The real scene is before us
Police cars line the street along with a huge fire truck and several ambulances
Special police marksmen are crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building
Screams are heard from within and police radios blare
Shots are being fired into a black window
Once in a while a shot is returned
Two policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance
#1 He hasn't fired a shot for six minutes
maybe we got him
get on the radio
get Detective Williams
ask him if we can rush the son of a bitch
policeman runs off
more shots are fired into the building but none are returned
The policeman comes running back
#2 It's in the works already
we're in there
they're goin' down the back stairs now
It won't be long
and they'll have us rush 'em from here
one whistle and we go
Suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment
Then a loud whistle
#1 That's it
let's go
Police race across the street to Frank's building
213
'  - Police kick the door in and rush into the apartment
It's empty excpt for a large dog which has been shot
The dog growls and cowers back in a corner
Every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth
214
'  - Jeffrey hears the radio
He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place
He hears that Frank is gone
He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment
(speaking to
Gordon who doesn't hear him because he's almost dead) 'm leaving now
'll let them find you all on their own
find all this horror on their own
(whispers) Good bye
He goes out and closes the door
215
-   - The door clicks shut
He makes his way quietly down the hall to the stairway
thinking
He starts down the stairs
So
Frank escaped
He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another floor
and another
At the next landing, something out the window catches his eye
He notices a man get out of the car
He recognizes the man
It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase
Jeffrey watches the man come toward Dorothy's building
Then his eye goes back to the man's car
It is Frank's car
He notices the man is carrying a police radio
(to himself) Frank's car
Is this man a cop
He has a radio
So did Frank though and he's no cop
that's for sure
and he's driving Frank's car
who is he
The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey
Jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs
thinking faster
What happened that day
216
- : Jeffrey remembers Frank and the Yellow Man go into Frank's building
217
-   - (
) They went in together
218
- Jeffrey remembers the well-dressed man come out with the Yellow Man
219
-   - and out came
No it couldn't be
But think it is
It's Frank
Jeffrey runs like mad up to Dorothy's apartment
He looks back once and sees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs
on well-dressed man's face
It is Frank, underneath a very good disguise
Jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket
He fumbles with it and it drops to the floor
Frank climbs the stairs
Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door
He rushes into the room
220
'  - The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again
He rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket
He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he crouches down behind a double bed
(into the radio) Detective Williams
Detective Williams
(over radio) Detective Williams here
Is that you, Jeffrey
Yes it's me
Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment
(thinks; hits himself in the forehead; inner voice) Oh no
Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say
(thinks some more - fast) Detective Williams
hurry
'm in the apartment
hurry
'm hiding in the back bedroom
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can
221
- Sandy runs frantically down a dark street
We see a street sign which says "Lincoln
" 222
'  - Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room
He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and enters
Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet
Frank is smiling
(calling pleasantly in the direction of the back bedroom) Hey neighbor
shit for brains
You forgot have a police radio
know where your cute little butt is hiding
Here  come
Ready or not
He starts down the hall to the back bedroom
The police radio which Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting
Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays
Hey fuck
can hear you radio
Hey you stupid fuck
you got about a second to live
Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun
He watches Frank sneak to the back bedroom area
Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow Man
He gets an idea
He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun
It's there
He gets it but it causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm
Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath
Just then he hears Frank in the back room
(
) (helium voice) Hey pretty pretty
Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a pistol with a silencer attached
(
) Hey fuck, where are you
Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come slowly up the hall - directly toward him
Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly
Frank enters the living room
He looks around
The Yellow Man moans
Frank makes a face and blasts the remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls dead to the floor
Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air
Frank looks to the kitchen
all around the living room
He looks at the closet
He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling
Jeffrey points the pistol
His finger moves to the trigger
He squints his eyes
He doesn't want to kill a man
any man
Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream
(
) Jeffrey
Frank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger
He yells Sandy's name and Frank's head is blown off
We see Sandy's frightened face
We see policemen racing up the stairs in Dorothy's apartment
223
- We see cop cars with lights revolving, radios blaring
224
-   - The large room is crowded with policemen and members of the
Everyone is talking excitedly
Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting by Detective Williams in wooden chairs near the center of the room
We hear bits of conversation
(to Jeffrey) Because of your information  alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon
had to keep on with him as if nothing was different
He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead
Not yet
Oh my God
Is her son
We're looking for him
In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband
He became obsessed with her
She hated him
He had to have her
He kidnapped them to control her
to make her do things
Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive
'm not kidding
Frank loved blue
blue velvet
He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens
Yeah
guess  did
(He turns to Sandy with a worried look) What's going to happen to me
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams
'll tell you though
you're okay
you shot a real son of a bitch
Yeah
sure know that
Yeah, but how many more are out there
- 225
'   - huge low roaring sound comes in
We see we are rising out of an ear but still among the crevices
They look enormous
We move up and float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye
Jeffrey's eye
His face is bathed in light
All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard
We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard
Detective Williams is with Mr
Beaumont working in the garden in the distance
The sprinkler is turning
Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls
Jeffrey
Lunch is ready
Jeffrey opens his eyes
He looks around confused for a moment
He sees Sandy
Okay
'll be right in
Sandy goes back inside
Suddenly, a big red  chirps loudly above
Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree
The Robin and Jeffrey seems to exchange a special look
Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird
He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of the house
As he passes his father and Detective Williams: How ya doin' Dad
(distant voice) Hey Jeff
'm feelin' so much better
Good deal Dad
He and Detective Williams share a smile
226
'  - Jeffrey enters the kitchen and sees Sandy standing with Aunt Barbara by the kitchen window
Beyond, in the living room Mrs
Williams and Jeffrey's mother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam
large Red Robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big bug in its mouth
(Referring to the bird) Look Jeffrey
(As he joins Aunt Barbara and Sandy to look at the robin) Yeah
just saw him outside
Maybe the robins are here
don't see how they do it
could never eat a bug
(smiling) It's a strange world, isn't it
: 227
- Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze
: 228
- bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street
We   to see the happy face of a
: 229
-   - very clean uniformed, smiling  with arms outstretched allows clean happy   to cross the street safely
: 230
- songbird  in a tree
We are in a beautiful park
Slowly we move down and a little hat with a propeller comes into view
The hat is on the head of a small child who is dancing slowly toward Dorothy
She is laughing
When the boy gets within arms reach they embrace
We move close to Dorothy's smiling face
Tears of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song
"and  still can see Blue Velvet through my tears
" Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image
