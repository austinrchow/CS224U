href <b>// --> </b> "  ' " by William Goldman Based on the novel "All The President's Men" by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward Pre-rehearsal version March, 1975 Start with as few credits as possible
When they're over-- : We see it in the center of the large, dimly lit screen
As the tape is pressed around a door-- -
It's a major piece of action, running maybe five minutes and it's all as detailed and accurate as we can make it, with as many "if only's" included as possible
("If only" the tape had been attached up and down instead of around the door, Wills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; "if only" the first police car called had gone to investigate, Baldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would have seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely away
) The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men
He thought he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was surprised
The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber surgical gloves
on the hands a moment; then-- : The phone rings
fumbles for the receiver, turns on the bed light
He listens a moment
No, no trouble, Harry, be right down
(he hangs up) Son of a bitch
He lies back
The apartment is one room, a small terrace beyond
Not much of a place
lies still, staring at the ceiling
He blinks, blinks again
: It looks, early of a Saturday morning, pretty deserted
Those reporters that are around are young, bright, and presently involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and thumbing through the papers
surveys the scene from his office doorway as approaches, hangs his coat at his desk, not far from where  is standing
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should  be smiling
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly
(chomps on some Maalox tablets) Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters-- ( is surprised-- he hadn't known) --and (b) these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying-- (consults a piece of paper) --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices
(puts paper down) Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse
(nods) Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go
: hurries along, goes inside as we : comes down it, looks around, sees a door marked "Counsel's Offices" and heads toward it
Now-- : as  comes up
Behind them, two lawyers are clearly angry about something, talking and gesticulating to each other
(to the ' ) Could you give me the names of the lawyers for the men arrested in the Watergate
These two were appointed-- (indicates the angry men) --only now it turns out the burglars got their own counsel
(he starts to laugh) (to ) When you gonna stop thinking it's so funny
(To ) We wouldda done a terrific job protecting those guys
(neither lawyer, by the way, is Clarence Darrow) You think we're not as good as some hotshot fancy lawyer
-- : and business is booming
Muggers, pimp, hookers, their families and friends
In the scene that follows, a constant counterpoint is what's going on up at the front as an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous night, the aforementioned muggers, pimps, and hookers, are shuttled in, given a quick appearance before a  who sets bond, and then shuttled out
In the audience, one man stands out--
He is extremely well-dressed and obviously successful
Beside him sits another smaller man, who is unshaven and squints
moves in, sits alongside
Mr
Caddy
My name's Bob Woodward, 'm from the Post and  wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case-- --'m not here
(nods) He takes out a small notebook, writes, muttering aloud as he does
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "'m not here," Mr
Caddy said
(impatiently) Clearly,  am here, but only as an individual, 'm not the attorney of record
(indicating unshaven man) Mr
Rafferty has that position
Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him,  have nothing more to say
And as he gets up, walks off-- : There is a small line
waits at the end of it
(moving in behind him) Mr
Rafferty was very helpful
Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord
Look,  told you inside-- --you have nothing more to say, understand that
turns away;  goes right on
What  don't understand is how you got here
assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved
Probably you're right, but a little while ago,  was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars
So
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel
And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call
(looks at ) So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come
Without a word,  turns, leaves the line without getting a drink
Silently,  watches
Now-- : seated as before beside
's voice come from behind him, and as  turns,  is seated one row back
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you
(turning) There is no reason to assume other people were involved
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves
looks at , turns back
(turning back) They are not my clients
You're a lawyer and you're here-- -- met one of the defendants, Mr
Barker, at a social occasion once-- (stops himself) -- have nothing more to say
(leaning forward as turns away again) Miami social occasion
(explaining) Mr
Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami
(sighing) Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once
Are you implying you don't believe me
have nothing more to say
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you
considers this a moment
Then-- Nope
And on that word-- : as without warning, it quiets
There is suddenly a tremendous air of expectancy, you can feel it
Now we see why as five men in dark business suits are led in; they've been stripped of belts, ties, and shoelaces
McCord is taller than the others
They stand, facing the , backs to the audience
sits watching as the proceedings start, but it's hard to hear
He concentrates as the  starts speaking
Will you please state your professions
The five men do not move or reply
Then, after a long pause, Barker says-- Anti-Communists
Anti-Communists
(perplexed) That, sir, is not your average occupation
starts moving forward now, down an aisle, moving past kids and whores and all the rest, trying to hear what the hell's going on
At the front of the spectator's section is a fence-like wooden barricade about three feet high
As he approaches it-- The  indicates the bald burglar
Your name, please
James McCord
Will you step forward, sir
( obeys) at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but it's hard
And what is your occupation, Mr
McCord
(softly) Security consultant
Where
(softer) Government
Recently retired
Where in government
(we can't really make this out) Central
Intelligence
Agency
(he can't either) Where
(clearing his throat) The
And on these words, : -- leaning over the fence practically falling over it in a desperate straining effort to catch what's going on
(stunned) Holy shit
Now from the courtroom-- : We are at the end of the press run, the papers are all assembled and being cabled and sent off by machine to various places
As the papers continue to roll past-- grabs a paper, looks at the front page
The Watergate story, headlined whatever it was headlined, is visible
The byline was by Alfred
Lewis
The union type Post employee glances at the article-- (reading half-aloud) "Five men, one of whom said he is a former employee
" (stops reading, gives a shrug) Schmucks
And he turns happily to the sports section-- : It's new money and looks as if it's been recently ironed
Someone is going through the cash, making a quick count
During this-- (
) Hurry it, huh, Bachinski
You said  could look at it-- We're in a room in a police station and two men are present
One, a , is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the door
The other, , is taking hurried notes in a reporter's type notebook as he examines the evidence
-- said look, not memorize-- --almost done, give it a rest, all right
(and he looks at an address book, he stops) : Beside the name "Howard
Hunt" is the notation "
House
" Now,  hurriedly opens the other book to the letter "" and there is the same name, "Howard Hunt" and beside it, the letters, "
" (
) What'd you find
(
) Beats me
These notebooks belonged to Cuban guys
(
) 'right
(
) It's gotta mean either White House or whore house, one or the other
We  on the  name, and the address notations
Then-- : '  -
The phone rings, waking him
He fumbles for the phone and the light, finally gets them both
Bachinski
(reaches for a notebook) What
--hold it-- (gets it open, starts to write) --, go on, go on
: is opening them, we're in his office, sits across the desk, holding the notebook we saw him writing in
go on, go on
That's everything Bachinski had, think it's worth following up
Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt
(crunches tablets) It's probably nothing but check it out
Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans
sticks his head in the office
Anything
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff-- --in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking
(shrugs) Could develop
Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans
He moves on
turns quickly to
, get on this
House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord
did all right on McCord
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr
McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as
(getting it straight) The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats
What the hell does that mean
(hasn't the foggiest) Mr
John Mitchell, the head of , says it means nothing
(reads) "
This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent
These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it
" (getting up) You can't believe that
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much  trust John Mitchell
Now-- : -
: as the triangle sound echoes
leaves large Managing Editor's office, walks past another office, knocks twice on the glass wall
Inside the Executive Editor's office,   sits
As knocks, he turns, nods
He appears, for the moment, deep in thought
on the opposite end of the room hurries out of his office, following a bunch of editors, all of them heading across the huge room
As he passes 's desk pauses
What'd you get on
House
(massaging his neck) Lotsa hints-- (not happy) can't sell hints to Simons-- (stops, looks at piece of yellow paper) --you called everyone you know
( makes a nod) Call someone you don't know
continues to rub his neck as  hurries off, all the editors still moving toward the place where the moon- faced man intermittently rings the triangle
picks up the sheet of yellow paper from his desk
Lined, legal-sized, it is crammed with names and numbers and addresses
They are in no neat order; looking at them it's almost like following a path; chicken tracks in ink mutters "to hell with it" and reaches for a thick book, flips it open
: It's the Washington Phone Directory and we're in the 's
As 's finger stops, we can see he's looking at the White HOuse entry number
There it is, just like your name and mine
Listed
Now  starts to dial, visibly nervous, a fact he tries very hard to keep out of his voice tone
(
) White House
(casually) Howard Hunt, please
Throughout the following call, we stay on 's face, hear the other voices
(
) Mr
Hunt does not answer
is delighted he's even there
Thanks, anyway-- And he's about to hang up, when-- (
) 'll bet he's in Mr
Colson's office
Let me connect you
(
) Charles Colson's wire
(a little more excited) Howard Hunt, please
(
) Mr
Hunt isn't here just now
Thanks, anyway
And he's about to hang up again when-- (
) Have you tried Mullen and Company Public Relations
He works at Mullen and Company Public Relations as a writer
The number is 555-1313
'm sorry  couldn't be more helpful
Listen, forget it
He hangs up, sits there
His hands are a little twitchy
Now-- : hurrying (he always hurries) toward his office
, looking for something in his desk throughout this scene, speaks to him
Who's Charles Colson
(stops dead) would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, " understand who Lenin is and Trotsky  got too, but who's this yokel Stalin
" Who's Colson, Harry
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name
, unfazed by anything, continues to open drawers, close them, as  rolls on
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman
Just below him are a trio: Mr
Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall
Mr
Mitchell we've already discussed
Mr
Colson is the President's special counsel
(rising) Thanks, Harry
(looks at ) Know anything about Colson
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow
" nods, heads back toward the files as we : dialing the phone
He's got the Colson file spread out now, and we see pictures of the man and articles the Post had done on him
But basically what we see is  plugging away on the goddamn phone and you'd think his finger would fall off from all the dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage goes on, you can hear it grow raspy
But a lot of what a reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're compressing here
The dialing never stops, the voices are continuous
Hello, 'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and
(beat) Mullen and Company Public Relations
Could you tell me when you expect Mr
Hunt
(surprised) He is
(
) Howard Hunt here
Hi, 'm Bob Woodward of the Post and-- (
) (impatient) --yes, yes, what is it
was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate
(
) (blind panic) Good God
And he bangs the phone down sharply-- --more dialing
Now snatches of conversation-- 'm sorry to bother you, Mr
Bennett, but we're doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard Hunt
(
) Well, if you've been doing some investigating then obviously it's no secret to you that Howard was with the
(he hadn't known) No secret at all
More dialing
Then-- (tired, voice deeper) Hello,
This is
Woodward, of the Washington Post--get me Personnel-- Dialing again
's voice is showing genuine fatigue
Hi, 'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post--and--what's that
--you've never heard of me
-- can't help that--you don't believe 'm with the Post
-- what do you want me to do, Madam, shout "extra--extra"
There is the  of the phone being slammed down in his ear
Hard
Now-- : approaching  who is working at his desk
He has put in a lot of hours on this and looks it
Whaddya got, whaddya got
Hunt is Colson's man-- (to , explaining) --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- ( almost says something, decides against it) --they both went to Brown University-- (consulting his notes) --Hunt worked for the
till '70, and this is on deep background, the  thinks he's involved with the break-in
What else have you got
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson
But when called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months
Then the
guy said the weirdest thing to me
(reading) " am convinced that neither Mr
Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee
" He looks up at them
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say
Absolutely
So
(he's got something and he knows it) never asked them about Watergate
only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House
They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty
(to ) think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging
(nods) Just be careful how you write it
: , makes a mistake, corrects it, types on muttering to himself, and-- : munching a handful of Maalox tablets and-- : taking a sheet from his typewriter, hurrying off and-- : taking the sheet from -- Here's the first take-- nods, shows him out and-- : typing faster then before, makes another mistake, starts to correct it, glances around and-- : gesturing to somebody but not and-- : watching as  appears in view from behind the wide pillar by 's desk, heads toward 's office
shrugs, goes back to his typing, makes a typo immediately, glances over toward 's office, freezes as we-- : handing some papers to
They look, from this distance, suspiciously like 's story
: hurrying out of 's office, and-- : watching  until he disappears out of sight behind the pillar
hesitates, finally goes back to his typing, makes another mistake, fixes it, makes still another, his temper is shortly to make itself known-- : as  hands him another sheet of paper
This is all of it, Harry
, takes it, immediately starts to read as we-- : watching as  gestures again
There is a pause
Then  appears from behind the pillar and-- : handing  another sheet of paper nods, takes it, walks back toward his desk, disappears behind the pillar again
is starting to steam
Now-- : typing magnificently, his hands rising and falling like Rubinstein's
Behind him is the pillar and for a moment there is nothing--then, very slowly, a figure peers out from behind the pillar--it is
He watches
continues to type, then after a moment, rests, thinks, shifts around in his chair and as his glance starts toward the pillar-- : is gone
: typing madly away
is visible again, eyes very bright
now-- : finishing typing, his hands moving majestically
comes up behind him, stands looking a second
Then-- We have to talk
nods, grabs the papers both that he's been typing and that he's been copying from
And as he rises-- : walking silently out of the newsroom then turning left down a darker corridor, passing bulletin boards and wall lockers and it's all nice and quiet as they amble on, nodding to the few people they pass on their way and after a while they turn right and enter the coffee lounge which is empty; the walls are lined with Norman Rockwell reproductions and various kinds of vending machines are visible, selling coffee or milk or fruit or sandwiches and there are some plastic tables and chairs and the minute they are alone, the silence ends
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story-- -- sure couldn't hurt it, could
-- --it was fine the way it was-- --it was bullshit the way it was-- -- have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia
-- (a sore subject) --what have you been here, nine months
-- been in this business since  was sixteen-- --and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau-- --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale-- --Bradlee went to Harvard-- --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart-- --'m smart enough to know my story was solid-- --mine's better-- --no way-- (handing them over) --read 'em both and you'll see-- And as  glances at the two stories-- : watching
Now-- : He glances from one story to the other
Then, disconsolately-- crap
And he sinks down in a chair
Is mine better
nods
(handing the stories back) What is it about my writing that's so rotten
(as he exits) Mainly it has to do with your choice of words
And as he goes, leaving  just sitting there-- : , re-entering the newsroom, returning to his desk
He starts to insert some papers into his typewriter, hesitates, lights a cigarette
He inhales, as, behind him, briefly is visible going to his desk behind the pillar
Finally  inserts the paper, starts to type as (
) (from behind the pillar) Carl
(turns) Yeah
(pushing his chair briefly into view) Fuck you, Carl
And as he rolls forward again, out of sight-- : (It's the June 22 Press Conference
) He talks on about something, it doesn't matter exactly what here, the point is, it should include that strange smile of his that kept appearing when the man should not have been smiling
Hints of pressure maybe, that's all, and once it's established-- : sitting alone, gloomily staring at the set
We're in the Post Cafeteria, it's the next morning, and the place is pretty much empty
He sips the coffee, it tastes rotten
moves up behind him, carrying a cup of coffee of his own
He stands by  briefly
You heard
( glances up) They put us both on the break-in thing
Simons liked the way we worked together
( nods, sits down) Listen, 'm sorry  said your story was bullshit
It's ; 'm sorry  called you a failure
Forget it, the main thing-- (stops) --did you call me a failure
was sure trying
: , ,
The way it's shot, it's almost as if they're watching each other;  staring out from the  set, answering questions
and  sip coffee
We don't know yet--or better, they don't know it yet, but these are our adversaries
: , without  now
They sit at the table
Occasionally,  is audible in the background
All right, what do we know
Let me lay a little theory on you-- (cutting him off) --'m not interested in theory
What do we know
For example, Hunt's disappeared
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention
(to ) The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans
What, though
(points to Nixon) It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway
Right
Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb-- (stops abruptly) --listen, that was a Watergate question-- : Serious now
The White House has had no involvement whatever in this particular incident
: staring at the set thinking
: walking toward ' desk
Hey
Hmm
What do you think he meant, this particular incident
Were there others
How would we find out
You know anyone important
(sits, shakes his head) lived here all my life,  got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops
The reporter   at the next desk watches them a moment
Then-- What do you need
Someone inside the White House would be nice
(writes down phone number) Call her
She worked for Colson, if that's any help
As  grabs for the phone-- : is talking off to one side with an attractive girl
Kenny's crazy,  never worked for Colson,  worked for an assistant
Colson was big on secrets anyway
Even if  had worked for him, wouldn't have known anything
Nothing at all you can remember
(headshake) Sorry
(pause) Now if it was Hunt you were interested in-- --Howard Hunt
Sure
Him  liked, he was a very nice person
Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man
Any idea what he did
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy-- --Teddy Kennedy
Sure
remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and-- And as she goes on, quickly-- : is at his desk, telephoning
stands alongside
White House Library, please
We hear the other end of this phone call clearly
(
) One moment
(
) (elderly-sounding lady) Library
Hi
Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post
was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books that Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy
(
) think  do remember, he took out a whole bunch of material
Let me just go see
of the phone being laid down
--what do you think
-- --Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant
Maybe a political operative of some sort-- --a spy, you mean
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy
(
) Mr
Bernstein
Yes, ma'am
(
) What  said before
was wrong
The truth is,  don't have a card that Mr
Hunt took out any Kennedy material
( and listen, and now there is something in her voice that wasn't there before: fear) remember getting that material out for somebody, but it wasn't Mr
Hunt
The truth is, 've never had any requests at all from Mr
Hunt
(beat) The truth is,  don't know Mr
Hunt
There is the  of the phone being dropped into its cradle
continues to hold his
He and  just look at each other
Now-- : Now, as  and  get out of a cab, start inside-- : You want all the material requested by the White House
and  standing there
The nod
One of them maybe says "yessir," the other maybe "please
" The moves out of his office into a corridor
They go with him
No one else is around
The  looks at them, quickly-- All White House transactions are confidential
And just like that, he's back into his office, and as he shuts the door-- : walking along through the Library of Congress
You think they are confidential don't know anything about how this town works,  haven't lived here a year yet
We need a sympathetic face
On the word "face"-- : -
We're in the reading room of the library, and  and  are with him
You want every request since when
(to ) When did Hunt start at the White House
July of '71
About the past year
(starts to smile) 'm not sure you want 'em, but  got 'em
Now-- : seated at a table with from anywhere between 10 to 20 thousand slips of paper
In front of them, seated at a high desk, the bearded clerk looks down on them, shaking his head
It's a staggering amount of work to thumb through
can't believe you guys are actually doing this
(to the clerk) You do a lot of things when you're on a story
(to , quietly) Can you believe we're actually doing this
( can't) Now we have a series of shots of the two of them going through the slips; it took them hours and hours, and the afternoon darkened as they worked
And they're tired
Now-- : getting back into a cab
That was fun
(slams the door) What now
met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion
(stunned) And you haven't called him
-- As the taxi pulls off-- : reading an article by 's desk
sits on an adjacent desk
(to ) You got accurate notes on the White House librarian
( nods) , we'll leave space for the White House denial and we should be set
Suddenly he gestures and we-- : Without a nod, he moves toward
: , nervously watching  come
As soon as  is within earshot,  starts his sell
Benjy, we got a present for you
Above the fold on page one for sure
It may not change our lives one way or the other
Just a good, solid piece of American Journalism-- (beat) --that The New York Times doesn't have
by this time has taken the story, grabbed an unoccupied chair, sat down, started to read
His only response to  is an intermittent "uh-huh, uh-huh
" : , watching as the silence goes on
too
He wants the story too, but he doesn't want it like  and  do
They were, as they said, proud of their work
The silence goes on
Finally looks up
You haven't got it
(before they can reply) librarian and a secretary say Hunt looked at a book
(shakes his head) Not good enough
He begins editing the piece, slashing paragraphs out of it
was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy
How senior
(edgy) You asking me to disclose my source
Other reporters are watching now
is impatient, as always
Just tell me his title
don't know titles
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not
doesn't know
continues to hack at their piece
Done, he stands, walks away
Get some harder information next time
and  watch him go, they are embarrassed, angry, crushed
on their faces
Then-- : '  - He is in pajamas and lugging a flower pot out to the balcony, positioning it so it would be visible to anyone passing in the alley below
He takes a stick with a red flag, jams it into the flower pot
He's nervous and he makes several adjustments, making sure the red flag is secure and won't fall
: down in the alley, staring up at his apartment
The flag is clearly visible
It's early
He checks his watch, hurries out of the alley
: - Deserted except for a few older Front Page types, reporters whose legs have given out, playing cards in a corner of the room
is working at his desk until he glances up at a wall clock
It's almost one on the button and as he rises-- : racing down the stairway of the Post; as he hits the lobby, he turns and we : - appears in the side exit, walks off
When he gets out of sight of the paper, he starts to run
Now-- : turning a corner, running on
Up ahead is a cab-- : sitting forward tensely
Occasionally, various monuments are briefly visible, lit up in the b
g
takes out some money as we : stopping
pays, gets out
The cab pulls away
When it is out of sight,  starts to run again
: as  runs by
It's not the nicest area in the world
He is going faster now
: hurries to it, gets in and-- : roaring along some Washington streets
: He looks at his watch, tries not to seem nervous
But his fingers are drumming, drumming and-- : stopping, as  gets out, pays
The cab starts off, but slowly
waits
The cab doesn't turn as the first one did
still waits
Finally the cab turns and the second it does,  starts to run again and-- : turning a corner, running on and-- : as  turns it, finally stops and catches his breath as we-- : : It's an eerie place, and his heels make noise and if you wonder is he edgy, yes he's edgy
He comes to the ramp leading down to lower levels, hesitates
: It seems to descend forever
: starting down
on him as he walks
Down he goes, the shadows deepening, then disappearing, then covering him again
He continues on
He must be at least at the first underground level now but he doesn't stop, and we don't stop watching him as he continues to go down, turning, the of his shoes softer now and he's a smaller figure as we watch him circle around and around until we-- : Dimly lit
few cars parked here and there
hesitates on the ramp, looks around
Dark, dark, eerie
: quietly stepping off the ramp, continuing to glance this way, that way
Now-- : Nothing unusual about that
But then some cigarette smoke appears, trailing up and disappearing from between the cars
As  moves forward-- : , smoking
He leans with his back against the wall
saw the flag signal--what's up
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground
You thought 'd help out on specifics
(headshake) 'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all
(looks at ) Are you guys really working
( nods) How much
don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the , but it's still drying up
Then there must be something, mustn't there
Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in
(inhales) You come up with anything
John Mitchell resigned as head of to spend more time with his family
That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth
(  nods) Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag
Follow the money
Always follow the money
To where
(shakes his head "no") Go on
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what
(lights a new cigarette) You changed cabs
You're sure no one followed you
did everything you said, but it all seemed-- --melodramatic
(headshakes) Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City
What's the whole thing about--do you know
What  know, you'll have to find out on your own
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk
Talk
Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle
And he kept it there
He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared
woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick
" And he replied
"The trick is not minding
" shakes his head, walks off
stands alone now, watching
Now the shadows have the other man
Just his footsteps are audible
stands there
: It's morning and he's struggling to get his bike down the steps of his apartment building
: driving up in his two-year-old red Karmann Ghia
He roars up alongside , waving a folded-up newspaper
What's that
The fucking New York Times
: The Times spread somewhat tentatively over a mailbox
small headline is visible, with the words "Barker," "Liddy," and "Telephone" in some kind of order
and look at it the best they can
Goddamnit-- --see
-- --'m trying-- --fifteen phone calls-- ---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at -- Why didn't we get that
Christ, and  even know somebody at the phone company-- --you do
--with access to records
As  nods-- : guy shells peanuts
hurries up
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin
'Cause 'm not calling out from the phone company anymore-- (drops his voice) -- think the place is bugged
(taking some peanuts) So tell me about the Times article
What do you want to know
No games, Irwin; give
(looks at ) My big civil rights buddy-- (shakes his head) --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming
(eats) What're you onto
Something maybe big
And that makes anything you do , is that it
Just tell me about the goddamn article
(shelling away) It was accurate, but  can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed
Who by
Miami
The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis
(finishes his peanuts, starts off) Irwin
really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you
looks at  for a long time
then-- Don't give me any more of your liberal shit, , Carl
He walks off, doesn't look back
Now-- : at the water fountain on the 5th floor
He chews up a few Maalox tablets, notices  steaming up
Harry,  just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker-- --so
think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami
heads for his office,  pursuing
'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein-- (trying to head him off) --that was awhile ago-- --" think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto
" That was your spiel then
"The Lifestyles of Deserters
" (whirls on ) 'm still waiting for it
He enters his office,  follows
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can  do
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do  have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill
And he looks unsympathetically at -- : circling around the 5th floor
falls into step
They keep moving throughout
can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein
" ( gestures for to continue) want to send a reporter to Miami
Anyone but Bernstein
Howard-- --remember Toronto, Harry
That was awhile ago
don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him
know,  did, but damnit Howard-- ( looks at him) For the first time since 've known him,  think he's really humping
: '
shambles
He is busy doing two things at once, studying notebooks and packing
Music plays, lovely stuff; the Bach Brandenburgs
As the phone rings-- (answering) Yeah
(pause) Yes, this is Carl Bernstein
(stunned) You're repossessing my bicycle
(softer) Listen, 'm sure  paid this month's installment, so why don't you check your records before you go around hassling people
(pause) Oh
And as he stands there-- , -  of 's age
She has just entered the apartment
Vivaldi is playing now
Hannah,  never would have bothered you but 'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless get it straightened out fast
(glancing around the chaos) Where are your bills, Carl
Oh, they're here
(starts lifting debris from his desk) 'm keeping much better records now, Hannah
(grabbing a big manila envelope) See
(hands it to her) (looks inside) Carl, it's a jungle
(sits at his desk, takes out a mass of papers--glancing at the top bill) suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles
(studies another bill) You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for
He smiles, gently begins massaging her shoulders as she studies his finances
Hey
very tense
(nods) Lot of pressure at the Star
(looking at the bills) Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent
That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this
(sighs) How much did the damn bike cost
Five hundred; six maybe
(looking at paper) You're two months behind--you got enough to cover
think
Give me your checkbook then
It's right under that pile
He indicates a mound of papers
She pulls it out as he continues to massage her, more sensually now
She reaches back, puts her hand on his
thought you had to get to Miami
There's always a later plane
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl
Nobody's perfect
(more rubbing now) 'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and turned you into a bookkeeper
looks at  a moment; then she smiles gently, shakes her head
Aw baby, you can get it up
just wonder if you'll ever be able to get it together
And quickly from that-- : seated perspiring on a hard bench in a stifling office
Outside: palm trees; we're in Miami
And judging from the number of cigarette butts strewn around the bench, 's been there a while
Waiting
Nervous
And maybe he never will be able to get it together, who knows
At the front, a  sits filing her nails
Behind her are a number of closed doors to offices
No one passes without her
The clock hits three in the afternoon as gets up from the bench, goes to the
Hi, it's me
'm still here
(couldn't be nicer) 'm so glad
'd really like to see Mr
Dardis
And you will
(smiles) But not now
called him from Washington
He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning
told you, he had to go out on a case
: as  slumps back down
He wipes his forehead with his sleeve, smokes a fresh cigarette, is kind of interested when a   walks up to the , who is now putting red polish on her nails
Is it  to go on back
She nods
: watching as the cop walks past the , enters an office behind
: '
, approaching the  again
She is working on her right hand now
Could you reach Mr
Dardis by car radio
He is not in the car
(Smiles; she's just so understanding) Sorry
: walking by the 's desk
Hey, babe
He enters the same office the first  did
: He lights another cigarette, puts it out, then lights another
: finishing her manicure
It is almost five o'clock now
, his bench a sea of cigarette butts, slowly gets up and goes to the
Mr
Dardis does call in every so often
Well of course
(quietly) Good
Just tell him  was here, that 'm sorry  missed him-- He walks out the double doors
: He looks down the hall
At the end, opposite the 's reception room, is a big glass door with a sign reading: Office of the Dade County Clerk
goes into a phone booth in the corridor from which he can see both offices
He puts in a dime, and dials
Mr
Dardis' office, please
: The phone  and she punches the button on the phone console
Mr
Dardis' office
: in phone booth
This is Mr
Tomlinson in the clerk's office
Could you come across the hall for a moment
We've got some documents your boss probably should see
He hangs up
: watching from phone booth as the  hurries across the hallway
As we see her open the door of the clerk's office,  bolts out of the phone booth and runs into the reception room heading straight for the 's desk
: at her desk, looking at the telephone console, receiver in hand
He punches the button marked Intercom and we can hear it  somewhere
(
) Dardis
Carl Bernstein's here to see you-- don't know why, but he seems angry-- : emerging through one of the doors behind
see him
(to ) Look, you've been jerking my chain all day
If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so
Listen, 've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow
(headshake) 'm on deadline
: '
He is fiddling with a combination lock at a filing cabinet
is seated across ' desk
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff
Whatever
He hands  some papers, glances at his watch
'll never get out of here in time
(flying through what he's been handed) The telephone calls
we know about that
The rest is Barker's bank records
It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks-- --yeah, that was in The Times this morning
continues to fly through the papers
(continuing stops) What's this Dahlberg check
And as it's mentioned-- : --'
It's drawn on the First Bank and Trust Company of Boca Raton, Florida, it's dated April 10 and it's for 25 thousand dollars, payable to the order to Kenneth
Dahlberg
' That the twenty-five grand one
-- Don't know-- : starting to copy the check in a meticulous facsimile
watches
never could figure just who this Dahlberg was
(watching ) Think it might be anything
(casually) This
(shrugs) Naw
And from here quickly-- : in the lobby of the Justice Building
Wildly excited-- --Woodward--Woodward, listen,  don't know what  got-- (holding the Dahlberg facsimile) --and  think the Times has it too-- (big) --but somewhere there's a Kenneth
Dahlberg in this world and we've gotta find him-- And now comes This is a compressed montage sequence in which we  from one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying to locate a man names
is maybe in the reference room of the Post, sweating, surrounded by Who's Who and Dictionary of American Biographies and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities-- is maybe in the phone booth of the Justice Building, sweating, with a pile of dimes as he dials away
This took them hours, and that effort should be visible to us
They tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone book and dialing numbers and God knows what else
The point is, we want to get to  in a reasonably short amount of time, but we also want people to know there was effort involved
: , bleary, in the reference room, a girl comes in, a researcher librarian type
Were you after the Dahlberg articles from the files
( nods) There aren't any, sorry
And now she drops a piece of paper, a photo-- Whazzis
(shrugs) Our Dahlberg file
As she leaves-- : The photo
It is a picture of Hubert Humphrey standing next to another man
The caption identifies that other man as Now-- : The room is reasonably quiet
is visible in his office
As  picks up the phone, gets Minneapolis information-- : '
He hurries in, grabs it
'  (
) Harry-- know how to get Dahlberg-- --Woodward's talking to him know
: , drenched
There are no dimes left
He listens a moment more, then nods, hangs up, leans back against the glass, takes a deep breath, closes his eyes as we : on the phone
--this should take only a minute, Mr
Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in-- (pause) --and  was kind of curious about your check
(
) check
The twenty-five thousand dollar one
(silence) The one with your name on it
(silence) In Bernard Barker's Florida account
(still nothing) Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar-- (
) (struggling) you're definitely doing a story
Yes, sir
(
) 'm a proper citizen, 'm a decent man,  don't do anything that isn't decent or proper
( waits, pen ready; tense as hell) know  shouldn't tell you this
's lips are going "tell me, tell me
" (
) That twenty-five thousand dollars is money  collected for Nixon in this year's campaign
see
And how do you think it reached Miami
(
) don't know;  really don't
The last time  saw it was when  was in Washington
gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President
How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine
(trying to keep his voice level) That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr
Dahlberg
: '
holds it
financed the Watergate break- in, Jesus Christ
He starts off
One sec'-- takes the story, scrawls 's name in front of his on the byline
watches
As  finishes, he takes the story again, hurries off
Now-- : : "Campaign Funds Found in Watergate Burglar's Account
" Now-- that it isn't exactly a gigantic headline piece
As a matter of fact, as more and more of page one appears, we see that their story is tucked away at the bottom and as bigger and bigger headlines are visible-- --the whole first page
Plastered across the top in giant letters is the following: "
" And as you look at the whole page now, you can barely make out the tiny piddling Watergate story
The point is abundantly clear: nobody cared a whole lot
: being rung like crazy
And as it -- : --, last go-round
Foreign, anything else
The foreign editor, an enormously thoughtful-looking and respected man, indicates "no
" (to another editor) National
'll stand with the Eagleton follow- ups and McGovern not being able to get a replacement--that's your page one stuff right there, Howard-- --Metropolitan
-- --you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions-- --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions-- (to  ) --quit equivocating, say what you mean-- (to  and ) --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on 's finances-- --and we printed that, didn't we, Harry
And when the frigging audit's done, we'll print that too-- --let me tell what happened when was having lunch today at the Sans Souci-- --correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci-- --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and  said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk-- --well, 've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so
-- --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting-- --well, what if your boys get it wrong-- (after a beat) Then it's our asses, isn't it
(indicates the meeting is over) And we'll all have to go to work for a living
As the men rise and head for the door, the moves toward  and  who remain seated as before
don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story
( and look at him) don't think we should cover the story, period
Go on
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff
What then
don't believe the goddamn story, Howard, it doesn't make sense
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate
Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom
and  say nothing
They respect this guy
Look--why would the Republicans do it
--my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em
(sits on the table, talks quietly on) Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught
Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught
Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves
The  thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one
(rises, starts out) Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business
He leaves
and  stay where they are, both of them flattened by what the guy's said
Because they're not sure he's wrong
Now-- : We're back with the   from before
He pulls out a paper again, looks at a story on the front page-- : /  that said the  found that has mishandled over $500,000 in campaign funds
(to another who's reading over his shoulder) What'd'ya think
Politics as usual, someone just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, that's all
(he's not so sure) Big fuckin' cookie jar
As he turns to the sports section-- : Either they get it as it is now, or as they really did, from a Post researcher who knew someone
In ant case, we see the list, with the columns of names and numbers meaning offices and phone extensions
We also see the two of them working, first, making long attempts at figuring out who worked for whom at
Then, once they have that, they begin using the cross- reference phone books, which are not familiar to moviegoers
And from these, they begin to get the home addresses of the various small-fry people who work for
Near the end alphabetically, there is a common female name, Jane Smith or something like that
As  runs his finger down the addresses, something strikes him as familiar, and as he reaches for the phone-- : -  - -
enters, looks around, then smiles and moves to a lovely girl with a sweet face who probably weighs 200 pounds
She is sitting alone in a corner booth
She nods to , can't quite pull off a smile
(sits across) This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane-- would have sprung for a classier place
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl-- --you don't really think you're being followed
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the
to tell the things the  didn't ask her
That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done
They control everything; that's how they know it all
too
You don't believe me
Well,  was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the came to investigate, they never even asked me about it
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit
don't know what they'd do to me
(reaching over) Hey, easy
(headshake) We're a long way from high school, Carl
(she looks at him) and 'm scared
on her frightened face a moment
Then-- : riding home on his bicycle
He gets to his building, starts lugging it up when-- '  (
) They found out  saw you-- ( stops, glances around) --they wanted to know everything
(louder) Don't call me again
(moving toward her voice) can help if you'll-- (
) --stay away from me, Carl
: If she was scared earlier, it's panic- time now
She turns, hurries off
watches her
Suddenly a  comes from the darkness behind him
He whirls
It was nothing but from the way he jumped when it happened you can tell the fear is spreading
Now from Washington, in darkness-- : -
comes hurrying along, and as he enters the hotel-- : shaking his head at
We have no one by the name of Mitchell registered
My mistake, sorry
And as he goes-- : out on the street, in a phone booth near Essex House
Get me John Mitchell, it's urgent
(
) That would be room 710, 'll connect you
waits anxiously as the connection is made
'  (
) The Mitchells
Can  speak to Martha Mitchell, please
'  (
) Who is this
've met Mrs
Mitchell in Washington, 'm Bob Woodward of the Post and tell her-- And the phone clicks dead-- : , the numbers of the floors being lit as it rises
4--5--6--  stands alone in the elevator
As it reaches seven and the doors slide open, he steps out and : It's numbered 710
approaches but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls, knocks on the door nearest him
Now 710 is wide open and several maids leave, watched by a large black man
We'll be back after lunch
(it's the voice from the phone) We'll be here
waits by his door as 710 slowly closes
The maids look at him a moment
He knocks again, louder
think they went out
(shrugs) don't mind waiting
The maids nod, move out of sight
stands tense and still, watching the closed door numbered 710
Now-- : -
People are getting off the shuttle,  among them
waits
(as  reaches him) See her
( nods) Get anything
For the paper, no; for us, plenty
(The two of them head for the terminal) waited a long time and finally this big guy-- guess a bodyguard-- he left and  knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile
And
--And
-- (looks at ) --she was panicked, Carl--every time mentioned Watergate, you could tell
Were you eyebrow reading
(shakes his head "no") It was there
just don't get it; a secretary being scared, that's one thing
But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of
They look at each other, neither has a clue
Now-- : moving along a residential area in Washington
It's later that night
: -
and  driving along
Left up ahead
nods
Who's first
Alphabetically, on the  phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street
As  turns left
Now hang your second right-- (explaining) --this was my turf when  was a kid
And on those words-- : We hear  explaining-- (
) brought you over one street too many--go back and hang a left again
Now on those words-- : : and  pulled over to one side
, baffled, stares around;  looks at a map with the aid of a flashlight
don't get it
this really was my turf
(concentrating on the map) You're not a kid anymore
(shaking his head) My first day as a copy boy  was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored
At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet
If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow
" ( is getting interested in the story now) And  said, "Am  supposed to do that
" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial
" So  run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room
'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing
" And  said, "It's 2:30
'm washing the carbon paper
" ( looks at ) Just wanted you to know 've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all
goes back to his map
continues to smoke, staring around at the night
: -
sweet old lady is looking out at him
Hi
'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and  hate to bother you at home-- -- already get the Post
don't need another subscription
No, 'm a reporter
wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect
The what to what
You work there, Miss Abbott
'm not Miss Abbott
: -
This time both  and are there
Miss Abbott
Yes
We're from the Washington Post and we wanted to ask you some questions about the Committee
: - 'm sorry-- And from nowhere, suddenly she bursts into tears
: and  as her door slams in their faces
They just look at each other, bewildered
And a little bit upset; their upset increases as the rejections go on
: in quick succession--they're all in various doorways, men, women, young, old
The only thing in common is their fear
- (literally trembling) God, it's just so awful-- And as he closes the door : -- can't--'d like to but-- (that's all she'll say) And as her door starts to shut : --go--you've got to go before they see you--please-- And as he almost starts to beg : --no
good
She stands there, shaking her head back and forth, back and forth, pathetic and sad
Now-- : He is seated alone staring at his coffee cup, surrounded by junk food debris
We are in a Hot Shoppe, it's night, and as comes up with food, they're dressed differently from before
puts more junk food and coffee down
You had the Mighty Mo and the fries without gravy, right
( shrugs) passes over some food
They both look bleary and in foul moods
Silently, they start to eat, something they continue doing throughout
They're not hungry, they just eat
This is terrific work, if you like rejection
never scared anyone before
It's not us, they were scared before we got there
(looks at ) What do we know
Facts or theory
Anything you've got
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down
What else do we know
just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all
The continue to eat, bleary and numb, as we : - -- --kind of an honest, hard-working face
and  are standing in her doorway
friend at the Committee told us to contact you-- --who was it
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us
It's safe, try it, you'll see
She doesn't talk at first, but she doesn't slam the door either
We understand your problem-- --you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal
We appreciate your position--really
And now she starts, at last, to talk, and they expect it to be their first breakthrough, but when it turns out to be the most withering onslaught yet, they are stunned
You people--you think that you can come into someone's life, squeeze what you want, then get out
(to ) You don't appreciate a goddamn thing, mister
(to ) And you don't understand nothing
(voice rising) But the Committee's briefed us on you--so get the hell out of here-- (big) --do you like scaring the life out of decent people
--'cause if you don't, in the name of God--stop it
And she slams the door-- : and , slowly walking back in silence back to the car
At Yale once, they held an auction
There was this woman and her name was Lulu Landis
Her postcards came up for sale
She had 1400 postcards written to her and 'd never heard of her before but  knew  had to have those cards,  had to know why anyone would get so many messages paid sixty-five dollars for them
got all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then  found that her husband killed himself in Dayton, and once  had that, it all began to open, an evangelist had come to Dayton and his horses hit Lulu Landis at the corner of 13th and Vermillion and she was paralyzed
Permanently, and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all her friends, whenever they went anyplace, they wrote her
Those cards, they were her eyes
They continue to walk; slowly
: - -- - know who you are and 'm not afraid but that don't mean 'll talk to you either--you're just a couple Democrats out to stop Nixon getting re-elected
: and , staring at the man
Democrats
- That's right
hate both parties
And 'm a Republican
The middle-aged man looks at him
(surprised, turns to ) Republican
Sure
Who'd you vote for
When
'68
Nixon
stares at him in silence as we-- : Only they aren't slamming doors, they're sitting in various rooms of their houses and apartments
We don't see the reporters or hear their questions but the answers they receive make it self-evident
We start with the middle-aged man seen above
- Mitchell never left the Committee-- he resigned, sure, but he was there as much as before-- : --oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will be happy to take the fall for everyone because, well, it's not that Gordon's crazy, he's
(pauses, looking for the right word) weird
'll give you some Committee people who know about him--only don't tell it was me-- : --of course we were briefed on what to say--and never to volunteer anything-- : --oh, we were never alone with the , there was always someone from the Committee right there-- Smiles, talks on as we-- : '
No one in this administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident
and  in a crummy cafeteria, watching the evening news on the  set high on the wall
eats a hamburger,  smokes, sips coffee
It is night, as usual now
: --on the tube
What really hurts in matters of this sort is not the fact that they occur, because overzealous people in campaigns do things that are wrong
What really hurts is if you try to cover it up
: and  as the news commentator come on, begins introducing another story
Did he just say what  think he said
You voted for him
He gives  a big smile
eats his hamburger in silence
: ,   --
gets out of his car, walks up, and knocks on the door of a small tract house in the
suburbs
woman opens the door
Hi, 'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and-- --oh, you don't want me, you want my sister
(calls out) For you
And we-- : approaching the door
She's younger than the cliche version of a bookkeeper
As she looks at her sister-- ' This here is Carl Bernstein-- --omigod, you're from that place, you've got to go
The sister is smoking and there is a pack on the dinette table
Could  bum one of your cigarettes
-- As the sister starts for the pack-- --don't bother, 'll get it
And he crosses ten feet inside the front door
You've really got to go
Just let me get a match
He goes into the living room area, picks up a book of matches
This whole scene moves slowly, the tension building under it-- it's not like news people talking, nothing overlaps here
But  want you to know that understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid
'm really sorry for what you're being put through
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff
We don't tell anyone that
Which is why you can talk to us
And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it
That's another reason you can relax
(tense) 'm relaxed--light your cigarette
lights the cigarette
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse
never worked for Sloan or Stans
' (out of the blue; to ) Would you like some coffee or anything
As the  winces
(like a shot) Please, yes, thank you
(he looks at the ) Can  sit down for a minute
He is by a couch
One minute but then-- --right, right, 've got to go
(he sits) Why did you lie just then
The  kneads her hands together silently watches
was just curious--you don't do it well, so  wondered
Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it
No
never in so many words
(gently) It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, 'm someone
He takes out his notebook
: The
And she does want to talk
But the notebook scares her terribly and she can only stare at it
'm not even going to put your name down
It's just so  can keep things straight
(beat) Start with the money, why don't you
' (returning with coffee) How do you like it
Everything, please
' (going again) won't be a minute
(to the , quietly) The General Accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans' safe
Did you know about that from the beginning
(about to fold) There are too many people watching me--they know  know a lot-- --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it
lot of it was
just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars
(her words are coming faster) can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried
Which people
The ones who could disburse the money
Who were they
There were a group of them-- think five,  don't know their names
Sloan knew which five, didn't he
(she nods) ' (back with cream and sugar) Here we are
don't want to say anymore
(indicating coffee) It's awfully hot-- (smiles) --and you haven't finished telling me about the money-- (long pause; then--in a burst) --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it
thought it was all legal,  guess  did, til after the break-in, when  remembered Gordon got so much of it
(heart starting to pound) Gordon Liddy, you mean
(nods) It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said
You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere
(more and more moved now) It's all so rotten
and getting worse
and all  care about is Hugh Sloan
His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right
And he quit
He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell
Sometimes it looks that way
There is a pause
Then-- If you guys
if you guys could just get John Mitchell
that would be beautiful
And now, as long last, she begins to cry
on her tears, then-- : clicking away
The words "
14" are visible
There is music in the background, really blasting away, Rachmaninoff or worse
We are in 's apartment and  is dictating notes from the  interview
It's very late, and has notes on everything, matchboxes, and it's hard for him to read
They're both really excited,  from his coffee jag,  by what 's dictating
couldn't believe what she told me
Eight cups of coffee worth
Go on, go on-- --we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit
It goes very high--we've got to find out where-- --we will-- --she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper
That happens to people
(he goes over, turns the hi-fi on even louder
Shouts--) , go on
The noise blasts away as  and  hunch over the typewriter
It's a moment of genuine exhilaration
Paranoid, sure, but for the first time, they're really on to something; it's all starting to split open
: They are driving through McLean, Virginia, a development of identical imitation Tudor houses
How do you want to handle Sloan
You mean, who's going to play the mean
and who's going to be the nice one
( nods; shrugs) Whichever
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not
You want me to be the bastard
(nods) And 'll just shitkick in my usual way
As they drive on-- : standing in the doorway of one of the Tudor houses
She is very pregnant
She knows instinctively who they are, and she dominates them in a genuinely proud female way
What  mean is, it's her scene, and they're suddenly embarrassed to be bothering her
To see Mr
Sloan
He's out
(There is a pause
She studies them--) You're those two from the Post, aren't you
(they nod) 'll tell him
(as she's about to step back inside) This must be a difficult time for the both of you
This is an honest house
That's why we wanted to see your husband
She studies them still; more silence
That decision is up to him
(conspiratorially) Maybe you could put in a good word
We've got another appointment tonight in this area--we'll just stop back later, all right
It's a free country-- (beat) --in theory
They nod, start back down the walk
She watches them
(calling out) Be careful-- They turn, look back at her
: -- --you can destroy lives
: and  watching her
She seems like a terrific girl
And maybe they've upset her
Or maybe what she has said, coming from her, has more impact than otherwise
Quietly, they turn back, walk in silence toward the red Karmann Ghia
: McLEAN McDONALD'--
Lots of very noisy, happy children
and  sit surrounded by their usual array of junk food
Think Sloan's back
( seems lost in thought) What's wrong
Nothing-- just found out that Jeb Magruder from  is a bigger bike freak than  am
(sips coffee) never like it when the other guy's human
They continue to sip coffee; outside it continues to rain
Now-- : ,   answering his door
and  stand outside, their jackets over their heads, protecting themselves from the rain which is harder now
Mr
Sloan
(nods) My wife told me to expect you
(softly) As you know,  haven't talked to the press
We were hoping that maybe now you could
We know why you left the Committee
We know you're not guilty of anything
But we know you know who is-- It has begun to rain even harder
--look, come in
We'll have to be quiet--my wife's asleep
: from the Nixons, they are standing in front of the White House Christmas tree
It is signed "To Hugh and Debbie Sloan, with thanks, Richard
Nixon, Patricia Nixon
" and we're in the living room
More coffee is being drunk; endlessly stirs his
'd like to talk to you,  really would, but my lawyers say  shouldn't until after the Watergate trial
You handed out the money
Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done-- --then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written-- --they're worse
That's why  quit
and  wait as  is clearly going through a struggle with himself
Then-- Try and understand this
'm a decent Republican
believe in Richard Nixon
worked in the White House four years--so did my wife
What happened on June 17  don't think the President knew anything about
Some of his men 'm not so sure of
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial
That's another of the things 'm not so sure of
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors
We were never told flat out "Don't talk
" But the message was clear
To cover up
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth
Does "they" mean the White House
As opposed to the Committee
The Committee's not an independent operation
Everything is cleared with the White House
don't think that the  or the prosecutors understand that
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true
No
It was closer to seven hundred thousand
And as treasurer, you could release those funds
(nods) When so ordered
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five
( is silent) (ticking them off) Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're obvious-- stirs his coffee
--there had to be a White House overseer-- --Colson
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that
(to ) Haldeman
(to ) Right
won't talk about the other two
But they both worked at the White House
(softly) will not talk about the other two
(out of the blue) Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer
is shocked at the mention of Kalmbach
can't say anything, 'm sorry
(He starts to rise) One thing 'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work
Badly
(and now for the first time, he almost smiles) You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered-- gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it
Right
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and  put it in the office safe which was crammed
Go on
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds,  went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune-- happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds
If the money had been in fifties, or if 'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure
Routine--'d just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money
" and  just look at each other--they hadn't known it, not remotely
stands and as they head for the door-- : heading across the foyer
What happens when the baby comes
We're moving
(beat) 've been looking for a job but it's been
hard
My name's been in the papers too much
Sometimes  wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence
'm not thinking of myself
But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them
: and  looking very uncomfortable as goes on
wish  could put down on paper what it's like--you come to Washington because you believe in something, and then you get inside and you see how things actually work and you watch your ideals disintegrate
(beat) The people inside, the people in the White House, they start to believe they can suspend the rules because they're fulfilling a mission
That becomes the only important thing-- the mission
It's so easy to lose perspective
We want to get out before we lose ours altogether
opens the front door
and  pause, nod, almost an embarrassed pause
Then as they hurry out into the rain-- : flying toward a basket cupped to a picture window
When we we're in 's office,  and  are also there, along with  and
plays nerfball mostly; he hasn't got the worlds's longest attention span
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as --three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow
(looks at them) You're certain on Mitchell
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General-- And all this now goes fast-- --you got more than one source
-- --yes-- --has any of them got an ax
-- --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell
-- --no-- --can we use their names
-- --no-- --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story-- --who you got
-- --well, Sloan-- --and we got a guy in Justice-- --Deep Throat
-- -- saw him
He verifies
(now after the burst of talk, a pause) You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook
(throws the nerfball) Just be right, huh
As  and  leave the office-- Leave plenty of room for his denial
: He has some papers in front of him an a notepad and pencil in his free hand
He is tired and very, very nervous
It is dark outside
In what follows,  takes notes
'  (
) Essex House, can  help you
John Mitchell, please
There is a
Then-- '  (
) Yes
Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, and 'm sorry to bother you but we're running a story in tomorrow's paper that we thought you should have a chance to comment on
(
) What does it say
(starting to read) John
Mitchell, while serving as Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that-- (
) --jeeeeeeesus-- --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats-- (
) --jeeeeeeesus-- --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation
Beginning in the spring of 1971-- (
) --jeeeeeeesus-- --almost a year before he left the Justice Department-- (
) --jeeeeeeeeesus-- --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund-- (
) --all that crap, you're putting it in the paper
It's all been denied
You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published
Good Christ
That's the most sickening thing  ever heard
Sir, 'd like to ask you a few-- (
) --what time is it
11:30
(
) Morning or night
Night
(
) Oh
And he hangs up
: and  at 's desk
is going over 's notes
He really made that remark about Mrs
Graham
( nods) This is a family newspaper--cut the words "her tit" and run it
And now suddenly-- rolling the story
They're modern and gigantic and : and
They're in the lobby of the Post at night and through a thick-pane of glass they're watching their story roll and on their faces is something you don't expect to see: panic
comes up behind them, looks down at the presses, starts to talk
Once when  was reporting, Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to Edgar Hoover
wrote it and the day it appeared Johnson called a press conference and appointed Hoover head of the  for life
And when he was done, he turned to his top guy and the President said, "Call Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you
" (shakes his head) took a lot of static for that-- everyone said, "You did it, Bradlee, you screwed up--you stuck us with Hoover forever--" (looks at and ) -- screwed up but  wasn't wrong
They all watch the presses now
You guys haven't been wrong yet, is that why you're scared shitless
(as  and nod, starts away) You should be
: continuing to roll
The  is incredible
Now-- : clacking away like crazy
We can read the words, "The Senator finished by saying that although he was
" and from there-- : and while the words "although he was" are still very fresh in our minds-- Although  am a Republican,  would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that  feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the Democratic Party-- The  of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part and we see three people and it's very important that their voices are immediately recognizable and distinct
One, the is from the West and will have that twang
The next two whom we are about to meet are from  and the
The  voice is very southern, the    sounds like an  announcer
The   will be seen in a corridor of the Senate office building, talking to reporters, the
will be talking to reporters in front of the office doors and so identified
The will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to one side
As the teletype goes on-- : (in mid-sentence) --hearsay, innuendo, and character assassination
can only conclude that the so-called sources of the Washington Post are a fountain of misinformation-- : --the White House has long since stopped being surprised at this type of reporting by certain elements of the Eastern liberal press-- : ' lot of activity
is at his desk reading the teletype dispatches
and  are there,  and , too
kid comes in with more teletype stuff
The editors look at it
(reading) Same kind of crap-- (glancing through; nods) --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate
What's a real denial
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- (little pause) --it's time to start circling the wagons
: looking at a new headline: You think they know what they're doing on the fifth floor
got eight kids to support--they better
They start for the sports section, only this time, they stop, go back, stare at the headline again
From them watching-- : walking  to the elevators
What do you think Mrs
Graham wants to see me for
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent
( pushes for the elevator) And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her  licenses
'm not saying she's going on relief, but  don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you
You think she wants us to ease up on the story
(shrugs) don't know, but  don't think that's unreasonable either, do you
The elevator opens
shakes his head "no" and steps inside as we : in her office as a  lets  in
He's nervous
She's standing by the window, he crosses to her
'm so glad you could come, Mr
-- --'m Woodward
She nods
There's a pause
He waits
She's trying to say something, get something started, but it's difficult
Silence
She stares out again, quietly starts to talk
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and  was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day
The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and was frightened but  knew if  said no, 'd lose the whole fifth floor
So we published, and that night, after 'd told Ben to go ahead, woke up in the darkness and  thought, "Oh my Lord, what am  doing to this newspaper
" (She looks at ) woke up again last night with that same question
( says nothing, waits) Are we right on this story
think so
Are you sure
No
When will you be, do you think
-- when are we going to know it all
It may never come out
Never
Please don't tell me never
(beat) Ben says you've found some wonderful sources
Some Justice Department lawyers and an  man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am
And the underground garage one
(, more nervous now, nods) Would  know him
couldn't say
But it's possible
(throat very dry) It is
You've never told anyone who he is
( shakes his head) But you'd have to tell me if  asked you
( nods) Tell me
(he is dying) would, if you really ever wanted to know
really want to know
: caught between a rock and a hard place
He is silent until there is the  of light laughter and we-- : The laughter came from her
wasn't serious
have plenty of burdens to carry around,  don't need another
tries not to exhale too audibly
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we
Nobody ever had too much
: --
as abruptly she reaches out, touches on the arm
Do better
makes a nod
Then-- : in a state of anger, pacing around the tiny teletype room
hurries in
What
says nothing, just points to the  teletype looks at it, clearly is upset
thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- (to  who tears in--) --you think  like being aced out
--what
-- --The
Times has a huge interview with Baldwin-- --the lookout in the Motor Inn
-- ( nods) --he say anything we don't know
-- (headshake) --just that a lot of reports were sent to , but he doesn't name who, not here anyway-- --it would have been nice to have had this,  sure would have liked to have had this-- --there's nothing new in it-- --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story-- (starts out) --'m not going to kick ass over this, but 'd like you to know hate getting beat,  just hate it-- don't forget that  hate it-- And he stalks out
and  stand staring at the teletype which keeps on clacking and clacking as the Times story keeps getting longer
Goddamnit-- --shit-- --we gotta top the Times-- -- know,  know-- --if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again-- --shit, who do we know
-- -- know a lawyer at Justice-- --has he got an ax
-- --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat
Then he's got an ax
(beat) Call him anyway
As  nods, takes off out of the room-- : studying the front page, on which one headline indicates that they're named the guys at  who got the reports
Who is this Woodstein
(points to paper) Two stories on the front page
If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico, to hell with him
: is stirring his morning coffee as  comes in, spots him, hurries over
is maybe more excited then we've yet seen him
-- want you to shut up and listen to me-- -- haven't said anything-- --for the first time 'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward,  got a tip
guy called me up with a tip-- (carefully) --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that
The  knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through
But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing
How high up, which Republicans
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal
and so did a bunch of Nixon men-- --Haldeman  know, who else
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school
Maybe 'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense
What were the three theories
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead
But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece-- --because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then
Before he self- destructed
If he self-destructed
Now, from the two of them-- : There is the  of bad guitar music, which as we we see is  playing
We are in his apartment, it's night, and the two of them, bleary, are studying the maze of receipts
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two
(glancing up) Switch to another station, huh
You're driving me crazy with that
Segovia begged me for me secret but said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me
" He switches to another song which sounds a lot like the one he just finished playing
(pointing to the thickest stacks) California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states
(whirling) Why does everything you play sound the same
--'cause  only know four chords-- : The camera moves across the travels of Donald Segretti
There is the  of 's guitar
for a moment, then-- : , - standing in his doorway
(
) Donald Segretti
That's right
: --
We are, it will soon be clear, in California now, Marina Del Rey
'm Carl Bernstein
( nods) My paper sent me out to see if couldn't persuade you to go on the record
You can't
Mind if  try
shrugs, and as they enter his apartment-- : They walk across to a small terrace outside, where they sit
The terrace has a glorious view of the water and lots of girls in bathing costume, below
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy
've got a lot of energy
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help
They never told me anything except my own role-- had to find out the rest in the papers
By "they" you mean
He waits;  just shakes his head
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you
( makes no reply) Your buddy from , Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House
know where Dwight works
When did he hire you
shakes his head, stares out at the girls
Do you feel much about the things you did
didn't do anything wrong
Tell that to Muskie
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child
You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe-- (to ) --off the record
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians
didn't
But you know who did
When you guys print it in the paper, then 'll know
(closes his eyes) 'm a lawyer, and 'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did  do that was so awful
says nothing, waits
None of it was my idea, Carl-- didn't go looking for the job
Chapin did contact you then
Sure--off the record
On the orders of Haldeman
don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, wish 'd never gotten messed around with this--all  wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the  from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the  from the President
Can't help you
At , you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking
( half-smiles, nods) Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all
: -- staring at the girls and the blue water
What would you have done if you were just getting out of the Army, if you'd been away from the real world for four years, if you weren't sure what kind of law you wanted to practice, and then one day you got a call from an old friend asking you to go to work for the President of the United States
on the question, then-- : back in
, walking through the airport
What would you have done
You asking would  have been one of the President's men
(beat) would have been
As they continue on-- : alone in the underground garage
Tense, jumpy
He looks at his watch, paces around
It's all eerie as hell
Then, from the ramps, footsteps
: moving out of the shadows, smoking, as always
My turn to keep you waiting
(approaches) What's the topic for tonight
Ratfucking
In my day, it was simply called the double cross
believe the  refers to it as Mindfuck
In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats
know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin
And that would put us inside the White House
(nods) Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government
Who
--be specific
How high up
You'll have to find that out, won't you
The slush fund at  financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so-- He stops as suddenly   dives down behind the nearest car
dropping beside him
What
Did you change cabs
(as  nods) It didn't work, something moved there-- And as he points : You can't see a goddamn thing
But there is the , faint but distinct, of breathing
: standing, staring into the darkness
He is scared, wipes his mouth
He doesn't move for a moment
Then he walks directly into the darkness and as he's gone-- : , red eyed, unshaven, beaten--there are half-formed scabs and cuts
He is leaning against a wall, shivering
He looks, for all the world, like a perpetual drunk
: in the shadows, coming closer
: He blinks slowly, tongue lolling outside his mouth
He watches  approach
: coming still closer
: He blinks very slowly now
Maybe he isn't even certain 's there
: stopping in front of the drunk
They look at each other for a long time
Then: Who are you
: Nothing, no reaction
: studying the other man
: And he blinks again, then slowly, shivering, begins sliding down the wall
reaches for him, holds him up
: managing to get out his wallet, take out some bills
He starts up the ramp with the drunk, and as they disappear up the ramp out of sight, he gives the drunk the money
Here
(softly) Forget your troubles and just be happy
: pacing and smoking
He is visibly upset; scared maybe
He glances over as  comes back down the ramp alone
(self-mocking) hope you noticed how coolly behaved under the threat of discovery
(impatiently) Do Justice and the  know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it
Why didn't they
--who told them not to
Someone with authority 'd imagine, wouldn't you
(coughs) Don't you know what you're onto
Come on
Mitchell knew then
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens
The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman
Haldeman too
You get nothing from me about Haldeman
And from this tone, you know  scares him
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes
--what were they after
Total manipulation
suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines
Talk about Segretti-- --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too
There were more then
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere-- --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation-- (nods, bigger) --don't you miss the grand scheme too
How grand
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against
They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti
And Justice and  know all this
Yes, yes, everything
There were over fifty people employed by the White House and  to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief
(stunned) Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats
: was being cautious
(inhales) You can safely say more then fifty
in the garage
then-- : and it's noisy
Not as noisy as it's going to get, but there is more tension around just now than there has been previously
: -30s
On her desk is her name, She is watching  who is standing by the water cooler nearby
As she gets up-- : drinking water
Do you guys know about the Canuck letter
(nods, drinks) Um-hmm
(stops, looks at her) Why
just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it
As she speaks-- : working at his desk, suddenly looking up as a comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone turns to see, here comes  dragging  over to 's desk
(hysterical) Tell him what you just told me
Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be a reporter here before he went to work for Nixon-- had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter
(she looks from one of them to the other) You did want to know, didn't you
And now from her-- : and  in a corner of the room, talking low and fast
You think we're being set up
--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House
Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon
You think this was Clawsen's initiation
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal
(beat) God knows it worked
: in tears, standing on the flat-bed truck
This was in the New Hampshire primary, just after the Canuck letter was published
(
) You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken
(
) Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong-- : She's an awfully good reporter-- can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you
(
) That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen
(
) Where
(beat) What do you mean, where
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant-- (
) --'ve completely forgotten where it was, except  know it wasn't her apartment
There is a sound of him hanging up the phone
Hard hangs up quietly, rubs his eyes, calls out to  who is at her desk-- Non denial-denial, Marilyn-- is about to answer when her phone rings
She picks it up, turns to , mouths "it's him" and we : Again Clawsen on the other end
(
) For Chissakes, don't tell them came to your place
already told them
(
) Oh, that's terrific, that's just so terrific, 'm thrilled you did that
have a clear conscience
(
) Marilyn,  have a wife and a family and a cat and a dog
Now from this-- And we : and  heading toward the office
As they enter-- got Clawsen on hold-- --his dialing finger must be falling off-- --what do you think
-- --he went to her apartment and he told her-- --if he did it or just said he did it, God knows
could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts
(calling out to his ) Put him on
(picks up the phone) Ken, 'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid
(pause) Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled
(pause) wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken
(pause) Ken,  would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to
: --
He is genuinely enjoying himself
Now, he puts his hand over the receiver-- It's like they taught us at Harvard: few things are as gratifying to the soul as having another man's nuts in a vise
Now, as he goes back to talking-- : : Now we  on that headline as the three deniers are visible through it in the same places they spoke before
The story is based entirely on hearsay and-- --we at the Committee are continually amazed at the creativity shown by the Washington Post-- --although  am a Republican,  would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that  am happy that this latest onslaught against the intelligence of the American people will be wrapping fish tomorrow offer my condolences to the fish
And now, the headline fades as we : ' and  hurry in
Speak
We've just been talking to Young-- --which Young
Larry Young, a California lawyer-- --he was going to go into law practice with Segretti
And
-- --and he says Chapin hired Segretti-- --well and good, but when will he say it on the record
He just did
He'll give us a sworn statement
We're inside the White House now
and  just look at each other
They should be happy, and maybe they are
But at the moment more then anything else they look scared
Then-- It's a very fancy restaurant and  is at a corner table as  and  sit down
They are exhausted
Look,  wanted to talk because things are getting really hairy and there's a couple of things we've got to be careful of because-- waiter is nearby
--either of you want a drink or should order
-- (They don't) --because-- And suddenly he lapses into perfect French with the waiter, ordering lunch ann salad and as the waiter nods and goes --because our cocks are on the chopping block and you've got to be sure that you're not just dealing with people who hate Richard Nixon and want to get him through us
You see,  don't give a shit who's President-- really don't, it's an adversary situation between them and us and it's always gonna be
never had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy and once  printed something that pissed him off and for seven months didn't exist
wine steward appears, hands  the list
As he examines it, a man walks up to the table, stands there
You none of you know who  am, do you
(they don't) You screw me up good, you don't even know what  look like
, you've had your preamble; who the hell are you
Glenn Sedam--you wrote about me last week, you said  was one of the guys at the Committee who was sent reports
You were wrong
Baldwin told the  it was you
Baldwin told the  it was someone whose first name sounded like a last name
They showed him a list and he picked me but it wasn't me, it was Gordon Liddy
(looks at the reporters) My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my wife's hysterical, my kids think 'm mixed up with the burglary, my friends don't like me around all of a sudden
: -- You fucked around my life, you two
(starts off) just wanted to say thanks
watching  and , who are clearly upset
That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been wrong
(they nod) You had a good source
(nod) Did he have an ax
(pause
Then another nod) -- All right, you made a mistake maybe, we all have, just don't make another
And watch your personal lives, who you hang around with
Someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years
(beat) Make sure it isn't our blood
Now from -- : holding a broom and dustpan at his front door
really can't talk now-- --this'll only take one second-- --my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, 'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape
boy or a girl
girl
Melissa
: are helping with the housework
has a dust mop,  a dust cloth
We are mostly in the living room throughout, and also throughout, the three guys beaver away tidying
(holding up a cup) Where does this go
points to a shelf
moves to put the cup in its proper place
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control-- (ticking them off) --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach-- --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman
--'m not your source on that-- --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved-- --and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President
No, none of those
--that leaves Haldeman, period
'm not your source on that
He picks up a dust pan, starts sweeping it full
(taking the dust pan, helping out) --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names
Of course--everything they asked-- --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund
-- --let me put it this way: 'd have no problem if you did
and  look at each other while  empties the dust pan into the trash and from there, quickly-- : walking in the park
We can't really make them out clearly, we never do in this little sequence
But the guy is wearing a windbreaker and has a crew cut and the woman with him is dressed casually too
He has his arm around her, and they are deep in conversation
'  (
) Hey
and  sitting on a park bench swilling down a six-pack
think that's him
Who
Haldeman
: walking along
We just can't quite make them out
But it might be
: and  staring after the couple, trying to focus
Nah
(squints hard) Maybe
What if  went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me
Well, we are trying to ruin his life
It's nothing personal, though
(looks troubled) What's the matter
Same as Magruder,  don't like it when they turn out to be human
(nods) wish we were investigating Attila the Hun
Maybe we are
: -
They continue on
We still don't see them quite clearly
then-- : -
-
and  are at the adjoining table
--Goddamnit, 'm not gonna say it again--you get nothing about Haldeman outta me-- --we don't need it now, because tomorrow's story is about the -- --about how all you supposed experts really blew the whole investigation-- (stung) --we didn't miss so much-- --you never knew Haldeman had control of the slush fund-- --it's all in our files-- --not about Haldeman-- --yeah, Haldeman, John Haldeman
And he gets up quickly, goes
and  savor the moment but only briefly as it hits them-- --Jesus-- --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman-- And as they take off after the agent-- : '
, , , ,
Wild tension
The editors have a long story and they all read and pace, read and pace; the reporters look traumatized with fatigue
All this goes fast
(staring at the typed story) -- don't know,  don't know, it feels thin-- --Christ,  wish  knew if we should print this-- --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it-- (to the reporters) --go over your sources again-- --Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere-- --and the  confirms--what more do you need
-- (whirling to ) --listen,  love this country, you think  want to bring it down
--'m not some goddamn zany,  was a hawk-- --Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way
-- --maybe 'm tense-- --well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr
Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House-- (beat) --it would be nice if we were right-- (to the reporters) --you double-checked both sources
-- They nod
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story
Absolutely-- (to ) --what about you
-- --'m sure-- --'m not sure, it still feels thin-- (looks at ) (to  and , after a puse) --get another source
Now quickly : and  huddling outside 's office
How many fucking sources they think we got
-- --Deep Throat won't confirm-- never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman
know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury
(looks at ) --We got twenty minutes to deadline-- And as he speaks : talking softly from a relatively private phone in the newsroom
The voice of the lawyer is also whispered and scared to death
'  (
) (barely audible) You shouldn't ever call me like this, Carl
Will you confirm that Haldeman was mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury
'  (
) won't say anything about Haldeman
not ever
(desperate) All right--listen--it's against the law if you talk about the Grand Jury, right
But you don't have to say a thing--'ll count to ten--if the story's wrong, hang up before  get there--if it's  stay on the line till after, got it
(
) Hang up, right
Right, right--, counting: one, two-- (he inhales deeply) --three, four, five, six-- (now he's starting to get excited) --seven, eight-- (inhales deeply) --nine, ten, thank you
(
) You've got it straight now
Everything (on a note of triumph) Yeah
And on that shout : --    : "       " : On the record let me say just this: the story is totally untrue
On background, 'd like to add that Bob Haldeman is one of the greatest public servants this country has ever had and the story is a goddamned lie
: roaring out of his office doorway
Woodstein
: and  tearing into 's office--he stands scowling at the  set in a corner of the room-- outside, it is raining like hell
: is walking along toward a large office building, he is flanked by a lawyer
Reporter (it was ) is walking alongside, mike in hand
Mr
Sloan, would you care to comment on your testimony before the Grand Jury
My lawyer says-- ' --the answer is an unequivocal no
Mr
Sloan did not implicate Mr
Haldeman in that testimony at all
: and
They look sick
Desperate, tired, stunned, confused; there is nothing to say
: glaring at them
then : in the rain, and : retreats down the hall
and , soaked, chase after him
--'ll deny everything--everything-- never talked to you about Haldeman-- never talked to you about anything-- 'm not talking to you now-- --what went wrong
-- --for Chrissakes just tell that-- --fuck you fuck you fuck you-- And he tears into an office, slams the door and as we hear it lock-- : My reasons are as follows: (1) it is a complicated long scene to put down; (2) we are terribly late in our story; (3) it would mean, here, two hours into the movie, we are bringing in an entirely new character; the  agent's head to whom they go, and  think that is unnecessary and confusing; and (4) most important,  think the characters have been abused enough in this version--we have added the Sedam scene and they are berated more in this version by the  people before things turn
(5) Finally, all this can show in reality is that they are desperate, and  would rather let the actors give that to us
feel that it would be a genuine error at this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've got anything going by this point,  can't conceive of much an audience will be less interested in than the reporters misbehaving
However, if the scene is requested next time through,  shall be only too happy to oblige
What  would like to do is cut from the  saying "fuck you fuck you fuck you" and locking his door to the following: and  walking in the rain
It's pouring as they leave  Headquarters and they are in anguish
(after a while) Woodward
Hmm
What was the mistake
Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered
They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means
(nods) Only everything
They are soaked, Nearby is a garbage can, they grab papers, hold them over their heads, start to walk
Now-- The papers they grabbed were the Post front page
(This happened
) And as they walked, the Haldeman story was on their heads
on the reporters walking miserably through the rain
Now-- : tremendous pall has settled on the city room
People walk by, glancing at  and , who sit almost immobilized at their desks, wet, whipped; no energy left
: '
sits across from  as enters quietly with a bundle of teletype paper
(indicating the papers) More denunciations
(nods) One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes
has started typing something brief
When 's done, so is he
He hands it to
What's this
My non-denial denial
We're not printing a retraction
: --
He is thoughtful for a while
Then, spinning around, staring out towards the newsroom: Fuck it, let's stand by the boys
And he stands, spins out of the room as we : '
The rain has stopped
The apartment is dark
It's late at night
Inside, the phone  and : '  in the dark as he manages to knock the phone off its cradle
Hello
'  (
) What'd you find
Jesus Christ, what time is it
You overslept
Goddamnit
-- He fumbles for the lamp, as it falls with a -- : --
Hair wild, clothes half-buttoned, he runs through the dark Washington streets as we : -  in the shadows across the street, going in the same direction and : spotting them, picking up the pace and : moving faster too and now : jumps into the first and as it roars off : getting into a cab also, roaring off in the same direction and : '  taking a corner fast and as it goes on, until the second cab takes the same corner, faster, and now : jumping out of his cab, fumbling into his pockets for change as we : getting out of their cab, paying, and as their cab drives off : diving back into his cab and in a moment it is roaring again through the night and we : -  standing on the sidewalk, watching as  disappears into the night and then suddenly, : --you were doing so well and then you got stupid, you went too fast-- Christ, what a royal screw up-- and  in the underground garage
-- know,  know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post-- --you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him-- didn't think that was possible
conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck
You build from the outer edges and you go step by step
If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure
You've put the investigation back months
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong
You'll have to find that out, won't you
-- : exploding
--'m tired of your chickenshit games-- don't want hints,  want what you know
: He blinks for a moment
Then he begins to whisper
It was a Haldeman operation--the whole business--he ran the money, but he was insulated, you'll have to find out how-- takes a breath, nods
--wait-- (almost a smile) --there's more
And from his weathered face : walking up to his apartment house later that night
He sees, and then we see, , asleep at the front door
He comes awake as  approaches
We gotta go see Bradlee--'ll fill you in in the car
: It's a house with a lawn and from somewhere there is the of dogs barking
You couldn't have told me over the phone
: and  moving up the walk to
We can't trust the phones, not anymore
Deep Throat says so
As  beckons for him to move out into the lawn-- We can't talk inside either
(headshake) Electronic surveillance
: It's October now
You can see their breaths as they speak
finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question
So  guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong
Anything else from Mr
Throat
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top
The whole intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities
The extent of it is incredible
(little pause) And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours
: He nods again, starts walking the two reporters back toward 's car
He's wrong on that last, we're not in the least danger, because nobody gives a shit--what was that Gallup Poll result
Half the country's never even heard the word Watergate
: as the three approach
Look, you're both probably a little tired, right
(They nod) You should be, you've been under a lot of pressure
So go home, have a nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes if you want before you get your asses back in gear-- (louder now) --because we're under a lot of pressure, too, and you put us there-- not that  want it to worry you-- nothing's riding on you except the First Amendment of the Constitution plus the freedom of the press plus the reputation of a hundred-year-old paper plus the jobs of the two thousand people who work there-- (still building) --but none of that counts as much as this: you fuck up again, 'm gonna lose my temper
(pause; softer) promise you, you don't want me to lose my temper
(shooing them off) Move-move-move--what have you done for me tomorrow
And as they get back into the car-- : -- and it's empty pretty much, except at their desks sit and , typing away
They type on and on and as they do, voices are , the same voices we've become familiar with, the  , the
and the (
) Although 'm a Republican,  would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit tht the greatest political scandal of this campaign is the brazen manner in which, without benefit of clergy, the Washington Post has set up housekeeping with the McGovern campaign
For twenty years, the Eastern liberal press has been trying to smear Dick Nixon
Fortunately, the American public is too smart to be fooled by
have been informed reliably by John Dean that no one connected with the White House
(coming in, overlapping) It is only our pathetic Post that deliberately tries to infuse the Watergate caper with a seriousness far beyond those shenanigans that have been the stock trade of political pranksters ever since
and  work on
And now, as the voices continue condemning, we see them--all the President's men-- as their faces flash on the screen for an instant--only these aren't fashion portraits we're looking at, these are the mug shots of the men taken when they went to jail and they flash on, the mug shots and the name and across each the word There's  --, and , , and  , , and , , and  McCORD, , and , , and  , , and , , and  , , and now the denunciations are louder, shriller, briefer
An insult to the American public-- --the deplorable tactics employed by the Washington Post-- -- have been given access to evidence in possession of the White House and that evidence-- and  type on
Their machines are the only in the enormous room
And now more mug shots appear-- , ,  , ,  , ,  , ,  , ,  , , and  and and  and --all, all the President's men-- Now-- toward the pillar, the one that separates the two reporters, and the denunciations are still going on, but not so loud now, not so fierce
Well, if  was wrong,  sure the hell wasn't alone-- --the fact remains that except for Watergate, we ran one hell of a great campaign
The  is almost at the pillar now
bums a cigarette from a cleaning lady kicks his typewriter
Then they both go back to work
Now we're at the pillar
That's all we see
Just that
