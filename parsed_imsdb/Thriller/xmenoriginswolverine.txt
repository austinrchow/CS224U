- : Written by David Benioff & Skip Woods - two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering black spruce
flock of pintails skims over the treetops, heading south before the first snowfall
young  (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag strapped to his back
Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time
Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in the road behind him
After a moment we hear the thrum of a hard-charging engine
An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it hits the straightaway
The boy steps away from the road but the car comes straight at him
The boy closes his eyes
The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to spare
Laughter spills from the car's open windows
Four    pile out of the car, wearing their leather-sleeved football jackets
, the largest of the four, shakes his head and laughs
Kid didn't even move
You see that
Where's your survival instincts, boy
The boy says nothing
He readjusts his bookbag and resumes his long walk northward
(cont'd) Hey
Gilman grabs the boy's shoulder and spins him around- (cont'd) The hell you going
You hear me talking to you
One of the other football players, , walks over and inspects the boy's face
This is the kid whose old man robbed the truck stop last year
Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him
The four lettermen tower over the small boy
C_ONTTNTT f 1 2
: You the one with the convict daddy
The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking
That's him
What's the matter, you about to piss your pants
Answer me
The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully
Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring, against the
boy's cheek
(cont'd) You a tough guy like your daddy
Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards
The boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman
(cont'd) You want to play tough guy with me
Huh
Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face
The boy falls to the ground
Blood spills from a gash in his cheek where the class ring cut him
(a ringside announcer) Right cross to the face
and he's down
The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy
The boy stands
There is still no sign of emotion on his face
No fear, no anger, no evident pain
What's the matter
You want some more
The boy doesn't look away
The bully swings, cracking the boy in the side of the head, knocking him down again
(cont'd) (to his friends) Let's get out of here

: (2) Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder
You gave that little pissant something to think about
Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be sprawled and crying on the ground
Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt, and walks toward Gilman
You got to be kidding me
'm gonna knock the-- But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something impossible happening
The gash on the boy's cheek knits itself shut, leaving no sign of injury
Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing toward him, striking him in the nose
And then another punch
And then another
The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy
Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down, trying to protect his face from the blur of blows
Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite to the hand
He howls with pain and backs off
The other two football players, amazed to see their leader getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe
The boy growls as he batters the bully
He grabs Gilman's collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground, prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist
Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and razor sharp
Everything stops
Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits hollering and stares
The other two football players blink and slowly back away
Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl backwards, away from this beast on top of him
(("ONTTN11F

: (3) But the boy is more shocked than-any of them
He stares with horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed
He stands and stumbles away from Gilman
Mason runs over, lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him toward the Oldsmobile
The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road
The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see fear in his eyes
He screams, a scream that echoes over the black spruce, into the darkening northern sky

Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down
He relaxes into Kayla's arms

Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his forehead
He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm
He takes her arm and looks at the wound

He stands in front of the gawkers, head bowed, face shadowed by his hood

As advertised, he looks like an amalgam of man and bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings
His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated by a long sharp beak
He stares back at the gaping crowd
Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous
His skinny limbs don't seem very strong and he projects an air of weary resignation, not menace
But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers, the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their father's legs
'  - Sherrlene and Beak sit at a card table, playing gin and drinking bourbon

You always hold out for gin

Creed shoves Beak back into his seat, picks up the bottle of bourbon, examines the label, and guzzles it
Beak opens his mouth but no words come out

'  - An awful, prolonged shriek escapes from the trailer
- The small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine forest
Winter has come to the north country; the ground and tree branches are covered with several inches of snow
Logan chops firewood behind the cabin, splitting the logs with expert axe strikes, smoking a cheap cigar
His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air
Smells like government
Behind Logan, two approaching men in dark suits and black overcoats glance at each other
Logan, halving another block of wood, doesn't turn around
One of the newcomers, , was a colonel in the Special Forces
He still has the look
His hair is cropped short, his bearing is military, and his blue eyes are fierce

You haven't aged a day
Everyone else gets old and gray, but not you
How'd you find me
We never lost you, my friend believe you know my colleague
Logan and Agent Zero stare at each other
There is a history between these two and clearly the memories are not fond

You working with farmers
Agent Zero grins
There is nothing pleasant about his grin,

Working with exterminators
(puffing on his cigar) Still shooting first, asking questions later
In one blindingly fast motion, Agent Zero pulls a customized automatic from his shoulder holster, fires, and reholsters
Still smoking cheap cigars
Logan spits the butt of the severed cigar from his mouth and clenches his fists

Stryker holds up both hands, one palm to Logan, one to Zero

Agent Zero grins, enjoying the game
Stryker, seeing that this is going badly, tries to break the tension
We're putting together a team
Best men in the business
Men with

Men like you
Forget it
Logan walks around to the front of the cabin
Stryker and Agent Zero follow
Logan's battered old pickup truck is parked beside the newcomers' Lincoln
It's a team of hunters
We're going after some very bad people
Logan climbs into the driver's seat
(cont'd) You read the papers, Logan
They're killing mutants
Logan closes the door, turns the key and revs the engine to warm it
Stryker taps on the window
Logan grits his teeth and rolls down the window, not looking at the colonel

They have names
They have addresses

He hits the gas, forcing Stryker to jump back lest the tires run over his foot
Stryker and Agent Zero watch him go

He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building
The school day has ended

As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking around
Something's not quite right
Logan'ducks his head at the last
possible second and a snowball whizzes past, missing him by inches
Six   (four boys and two girls) charge at him, hurling snowballs and screaming
Get him
Logan jumps back around the corner, out of sight
The fourth graders chase after him, round the corner with their throwing hands cocked, ready to launch some serious ice
Logan is nowhere in sight
The fourth graders turn in confused circles, searching for their target, snowballs melting in their hands
(
) Hey, fellas
The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a second- floor window ledge
He has already formed six perfect snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders
The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan
Nice
Logan, caught with a snowball in his hand, looks sheepish
They started it

- Logan drives Kayla home over roads slick with black ice
She sings softly along with the country song on the radio
Stryker came by the house today
Stryker
Colonel Stryker
The one you told me about
(off Logan's nod) What did he want
Wants me back
And
Told him no
So why can't they get someone else
Logan thinks about it for a moment
When he speaks there is a degree of self-loathing in his tone
'm the best there is at what  do
And what  do best isn't very nice
Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment
(cont'd) Maybe he's right
Maybe it's the only thing 'm good for
Kayla watches him
Logan shakes his head as if ridding himself of an errant thought
(cont'd) Son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a minute
He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer

Logan and Kayla sit naked in front of it, wrapped in an old flannel quilt

Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight

You're Elvis with claws
The moon, swollen and red-hued, rises above the dark hills, framed in the cabin's window
coNTTNTTRn 1 15
: Full moon tomorrow
You know why the moon's so lonely
Logan shakes his head
Kayla lies back, resting her head on Logan's leg as he plays with her hair
(cont'd) She used to have a lover
Kuekuatsheu
They lived in the Spirit World and every night they'd wander the skies together
But one of the other spirits was jealous
Trickster wanted the Moon for himself
So he told Kuekuatsheu the Moon asked for flowers
He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses
Never trust a guy named Trickster
Yeah, well, you do some stupid things when you're in love
Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the Spirit World, you can never go back
Now he's trapped here
Every night the Moon searches for him and every night he sees her in the sky and howls her name
but he can never touch her again
For a moment they're both quiet, contemplating the sad myth
Koo-koo-choo got screwed
Kuekuatsheu

- Viewed from a distance, the little cabin looks warm and inviting, the firelight shining from the windows
Something watches from the edge
of the dark woods
Something monstrous, its black talons carving gashes in the trunk of a pine tree

The site is already loud with motorized activity

Logan comes around to the driver's side window, holding his orange Husqvarna chainsaw in one hand
Be careful
Logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips
He turns and walks towards a crew of  circled around a with a clipboard
Logan turns when he hears a honk
Kayla leans out the window
(cont'd) love you, by the way
Logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this scene
He clears his throat
love you, too
(thick Maine accent) We all love you, Casanova, but could we get to work here
We need to let some daylight in the swamp
The lumberjacks laugh loudly
Damage done, Kayla waves a cheerful goodbye and drives away from the camp
Logan trudges into the circle of lumberjacks, who make kissie- kissie sounds and slap his shoulder
(cont'd) All right,  need a team of choppers for 3B, that's gonna be Phelan, Marcuse, Van Mier and Logan
Two teams for 3C

Men in reflective vests stand on the flatbed, securing the load with chains
Kayla hits the brakes and checks-her watch
She's late
She taps the horn

Can't move the truck till the load's tied down
Please

The foreman thinks about it, sighs, and changes his tune

Pull this mother over

Moments later the truck rolls forward, enabling Kayla to scoot through in her pickup
She toots her horn and waves
Thanks, fellas
- Logan and three other lumberjacks-- , , and -- tramp through the woods towards their designated area, carrying their chainsaws and helmets
Phelan, whiskey-bellied and flushed from the exertion, has fallen behind
You all want to ease the pace a little bit
Trees ain't going anywhere
Logan, in the lead, stares at a crude smiley face carved into a tall pine tree
His gaze travels from the carving to something sitting on the forest floor

Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here, Lolly Lolly Lolly got some adverbs here, Come on down to Lolly's get the adverbs here
Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly collides with a man in a long black coat
She slams on the brakes and the truck shudders to a halt
The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed
His hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's been sleeping in the woods for weeks
Kayla leans out of the open truck window
Before she can speak, the man in the long black coat turns
It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is massive
It's not just the four-inch-long black talons curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her
What terrifies us most are his eyes
They are a shark's eyes, black and loveless and utterly inhuman

He scrapes his talons over the hood: screeeeee
Five parallel gashes now scar the hood, carved straight through the steel
- Logan, hearing a noise the other men can't, rises from his crouch
He looks to the west, listening carefully
What's the matter-- Logan holds up a hand: quiet
He hears a distant scream
voice he knows better than any other
He runs, leaving his astonished co-workers behind
No one can run through the woods faster than Logan and'Logan has never needed to run faster
He vaults fallen trees, ducks under branches, accelerates when he hits the access road
- Logan sees the pickup truck in the distance
Even a hundred yards away he can tell that something is
wrong
It seems impossible that he could run any faster, but now he does, reaching the truck in seconds
He sees the claw marks gouged through the steel hood
He sees
the driver's side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty yards
from the truck
And finally he sees Kayla, curled in the fetal position on the side of the access road
Blood puddles beneath her
Her skin has already begun to lose its 'color
He runs to her, kneels beside her body, hands checking for a pulse, listening for breath, trying desperately to find any sign of life in her lifeless form
Come on, you're okay
Say something
Say something, darling
Say something
Kayla, come on
He cradles her in his arms

He looks up and sees the  staring at him
The bartender doesn't approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything
Creed taps the rim of his glass
The bartender comes over with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey
He fills Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour
Creed stares at the bartender
He taps the glass again
The bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim
Creed raises the whiskey to the light
Stuff don't work on me

He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow
He looks around the bar, at the pool table in the back, the Wurlitzer jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor

Insurance

Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creed's hand
Creed knows Logan is looking at it
He lifts his hand to his mouth and licks the blood off
(cont'd) Sweet girl
Tasted like strawberry jam
The bone claws burst from Logan's hands, pale, white, and serrated
He growls and swings at Creed's head
The big man is fast
He ducks under the claws, grinning and circling like a boxer, happy that he's finally got a decent adversary
The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar fights, but not ones featuring clawed mutants
They run
(cont'd) You can scare off the civilians with those, sonny boy
But  got claws of my own
He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing first blood
Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins
-The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power stupendous
missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out the guts of the jukebox
Logan jumps at his enemy and gets swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard
Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool table
Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear
Creed's fist shatters the slate and the table collapses
Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the eight ball rolling past
He picks it up and hurls it at Creed's head
Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes his fist shut
He opens his hand and lets the powdered remains spill onto the floor

He circles just out of reach, grinning as the claws slash past his face
Creed grabs Logan's right wrist as it flies by
He grabs the left wrist
His wet fangs glisten as they plunge toward Logan's throat
With no room to dodge, Logan drives his head forward, smashing Creed's face with a glorious headbutt
As Creed staggers back, Logan kicks him in the chest, knocking the big man over the bar, where he crashes into the bottles of liquor and slides to the floor in a tumult of glass shards and alcohol
Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the tables
He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar
The cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol
Creed roars and rises to his feet, a burning man
He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan
The flames consume his overcoat, licking at his skin
Creed slaps them out with his palms, apparently oblivious to the pain

Creed snatches Logan and slings him headfirst through the plate glass window

Creed steps out the bar
As Logan struggles to his feet Creed kicks out his legs and drops him again
Creed crouches beside Logan, grabs the back of his head, and smashes his face into the concrete
The beating gets savage, creed hammering Logan again and again
Logan's healing factor cannot keep up with the violence being done to his body

Stryker turns on Hines, jabbing his finger at her
You also swore

The dismembered machines twitch like wounded beasts
Logan rises from the broken tank, drenched with water, naked save for dozens of long stainless steel needles drilled into his body and the wires and hoses trailing from the needles

Logan, smiling, holds up his hands to surrender
The smile fades when he sees the red laser dot appear on Heather's shirt

Agent Zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a sheath on his ankle

Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked grapefruits, clusters of bananas
After a thirty second rampage Dukes is exhausted, his giant chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and face splattered with remnants of crushed fruit
Logan jumps onto Dukes' back
The fat man roars and spins around, trying to buck the little rider, but Logan's got one arm wrapped around Dukes' throat and he's not letting go
The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down
Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow's face, reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights
Dukes quits, his massive shoulders slumping

Logan waves it off

But it was never fake for me
Kayla lowers her eyes
You don't know where  come from
You don't know what it was like
know exactly what is was like come from there too
didn't have a choice
Course you did
You still do
Kayla stares down at Logan
The tenderness returns to her face
She could free him right now if she wanted
The moment passes and Kayla shakes her head
'm sorry
t ()' 86
: (4) Yeah, you keep saying that
(to Cornelius) Come on
Turn on the juice
Let's get this over with
Whenever you're ready, Miss Silverfox
Kayla turns and walks out of the room
Cornelius and his aide follow, shutting the door behind them
Logan takes a deep breath
He looks like a man who is ready to forget everything
- Hines sits alone on a metal cot
The cell door slides open
Stryker and Victor step inside
Lieutenant
Victor and  were just discussing how to kill you and we thought you might have some suggestions
- Silverfox steps out of the re-education chamber
She hears voices from the holding cell and approaches
(
) When the Turks captured a traitor, they strapped a steel basket to the man's stomach
Inside the basket was a rat
- Now, even a rat can't chew through steel
But it can chew through a stomach
So it would
Right through the skin and the fat and the muscle and the intestines, right on out the other side
l CDNTTNi7ET) 87
: Hines looks like she might be sick very soon
Kayla steps into the doorway
(cont'd) Victor thinks the Turks were soft, letting the rats do the dirty work
He's looking forward to spending your last night with you
Please, Colonel-- Stryker pats Hines on the cheek and nods to Victor
Enjoy yourself
Please don't do this
Please
Victor drags the screaming Hines off of her cot
Kayla watches with growing unease but Stryker smiles and- waves goodbye as he turns the key that shuts the cell door
- ,   - Logan sits in his electric chair, staring straight ahead, preparing himself for the pain
- Cornelius stands behind the glass viewing window with his He puts his hand on a red switch
- ,   - Thousands of volts surge into Logan's skull, forcing his body to arch
After several seconds the power shuts off
Tendrils of white smoke rise from the copper halo
Logan opens his eyes and stares at Cornelius
That all you got
88
- (to his assistant) This could take a while
Raise the amperage by forty percent
'  - Stryker signs a memo and hands it to his aide, Collins
Kayla stands by the window, picking at her fingers
You're going to let Victor kill that woman
Stryker and Collins ignore her
(cont'd) When you got me out of prison, you told me we were going to help people
Stryker continues to sign papers, never looking up
We are
We're saving humanity
From the mutants
The phone rings
Stryker answers it
Yes
() Good
'm coming down
(hanging up; to Collins) The Eleven is ready
He stands and heads for the door
Collins follows
In the doorway, Stryker stops and fixes his cold blue gaze on Kayla
(cont'd) Don't worry, my sweet
You're one of the good ones
'll protect you
He and Collins exit the room, leaving Kayla alone with her misery
89
- ,   - Logan sits panting in the chair, gripping the ends of the arm rests with white fingers, waiting for the next surge of electricity
It comes and he arches again, all the muscles in his body contracting, the veins in his neck bulging
- Cornelius and his assistant watch Logan with no detectable sympathy
They turn when Kayla walks into the room
Is he clean yet
Cornelius and the assistant face front again
He's stronger than  thought
We could be here all night
Kayla watches Logan in his agony
glimmer of remorse passes over her face
He was good to me
Cornelius, fiddling with the amperage dial, curls his lips in a sardonic smile
You have a funny way of showing your gratitude
Logan thrashes in his chair
Kayla chews her lip
For a long count she watches Logan suffer
You should turn it off now
Cornelius turns and stares at her
should what
() Oh
guess that's
guess that's a good idea
He turns off the electricity
1coNTTN  1 90
: You two have always hated each other
You should fight
The assistant blinks and begins to scowl, turning toward Cornelius just in time to get punched in the mouth
The two men brawl on the floor with the lack of skill you'd expect from two scientists
-  - Kayla steps into the room
Logan sits slumped motionless in the electric chair
She detaches the copper halo
The skin beneath the metal is singed but it quickly begins to heal
Kayla stares at the man she betrayed, hesitates for a moment and exhales
She unfastens the titanium manacles
Logan is still unconscious
Kayla shakes him gently
Hey
Wake up
Logan opens his eyes
He is clearly disoriented, as if waking from a long coma
He stares up at Kayla
(cont'd) Are you okay
Logan stares at her, groggy and confused
(cont'd) Do you understand what 'm saying
() Do you remember me
In one blinding motion, Logan snatches Kayla by the throat and roughly pulls her to him
She does not resist
would have done anything for you
Please
Do you hear me
Anything
(r0NTTNTTF
)1 91
: Please
Creed's killing your friend
- Victor Creed holds Hines against the cell wall with one hand
Her feet kick in the air as she struggles
He splits her blouse down the middle with a long black talon
've always had a thing for human chicks
You're all so soft and helpless
No
Maybe it's time  did a little surgery on you, Doctor
(
) The woman said no
Creed turns his head and sees Logan and Kayla standing in the doorway
He grins and tosses Hines aside
She crashes into the wall and slides to the floor, dazed
(to Logan) Starting to think you're addicted to pain
You keep coming back for more
Snikt
This is the end
Amen to that
Kayla stands in between them, holding up her hands
Please
We shouldn't be fighting each other
Stryker's using us
(
) 92
: little late for the Mutant Power crap
We hunt freaks for the man
That's why we're free
What's he gonna do with us when the other mutants are dead
Put us in a zoo
Creed hesitates, considering the logic of her words
fanged smile splits his face
Don't try your head games on me
've gutted better telepaths than you
Creed rears back to hammer Kayla, a blow that would separate her head from her body
Logan catches Creed's fist inches from Kayla's face
Time you quit picking on girls
Oh, 'm happy picking on men
Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight begins
This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted
Every lunge would kill any other adversary
Every parried blow would shatter a normal man's arm
Kayla, bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet
She helps up Hines and pushes her toward the door
Get out of here
Hines doesn't have to be told twice
She flees
Creed sees his plaything running out the door
He snarls in frustration
You're ruining my party
He grabs hold of Logan and hurls him headfirst through the cell wall-- a concrete support wall
93
- Logan crashes to the floor, covered in rubble
Creed steps out of the cell, licking his fangs
Creed tries to stomp Logan's face, but the smaller man rolls out of the way and gets back on his feet
The mutants battle down the corridor, claws whistling through the air
team of  charge around the corner, wearing tactical armor and carrying XM8 assault rifles
They level their rifles at the battling mutants
#1 Get down
Get down
#2 Down on your knees
Logan and Creed, trying to punch holes in each other, ignore the sentries
Kayla, staring down the barrels of the big guns,
holds up her hands
She concentrates, staring into the sentries' eyes
We're here as guests of Colonel Stryker
The sentries' hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance
#1 Very sorry about that
You boys are no longer needed here
Go back to barracks
You got it
See ya later
Bye
The sentries wave cheerfully and depart
Creed and Logan are equally skilled, but Creed's superior size and strength begin to wear the smaller man down
Creed slams him into the wall, opening fissures
Holding both of Wolverine's wrists up with one hand, Creed grabs Wolverine's face with his free hand
( IRh ) 94
: His black claws slide toward Wolverine's eyes
How you gonna fight without eyes, little man
Logan brings his knee up hard, smashing his adamantium- enhanced kneecap into Creed's groin
The big man groans
Logan spins Creed around, jamming him against the wall
He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment
Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall
He strikes at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again
All six of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall
He brings his hands
together, the adamantium blades slicing through granite as if it were cheesecake
Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him
He grabs Logan in a-bear hug
large section of the wall behind them falls out, and, unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through the hole, disappearing from sight
Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice, looking out onto the gargantuan Weapon  cavern
- Logan and Creed fall seventy feet, clawing at each other in mid-air
Logan hits the floor hard, the impact blasting a small crater in the concrete
Creed manages a rolling fall, cat-quick and dexterous
: Stryker stands on the raised podium in the center of the cavern, overlooking his vast, sleeping army
He cannot believe what he's seeing
(to Lead Technician) want the Eleven combat ready
(cnNTTNIIF
)1 95
: We can't rush them,
sir
They've been in stasis for-- want them ready
The Lead Technician flinches and barks orders to his subordinates, who enter commands into their computers
The lids of ten thousand isolation tanks slide open
As the camera roams among the Eleven, needles and hoses detach from their bodies, releasing their metallic grip
The cloned Creeds begin to stir in their stainless steel coffins
: Creed pounces on Logan, who is still severely injured from the fall
Creed tears into the smaller man mercilessly, slinging him around the cavern, gouging him with his black talons
Creed batters Logan with a series of savage blows
Logan falls, his healing factor overwhelmed, barely conscious
Creed plants one heavy black boot on Logan's face and presses down hard
He leers at his defeated foe
Your pal Wraith pissed all over my boots when  crushed his spine
Smell like fear, don't they
Something changes within Logan, a fury so overwhelming it cannot be contained, a rage so vast it could only be called berserker
Logan rolls toward his tormentor, sweeping his claws straight through Creed's ankle, severing the foot
Creed screams and falls to his knees
Logan stands, grabbing a handful of Creed's dirty blonde hair
This is for the ones who couldn't fight back
((`) ) 96
: (2) The adamantium blades are a silver blur in the overhead light
: Stryker, standing on the podium, sees his chief henchman's head tumble from his shoulders
He grits his teeth and surveys his army
Ten thousand enhanced warriors begin to step out of their steel coffins, baring their fangs, eyeing their surroundings
(to the Lead Technician) Activate the  system
The Lead Technicians flips a switch
Stryker speaks into a microphone; his voice booms from speakers mounted on the pillars throughout the cavern
(c
ont'd) Soldiers
The Eleven snap to attention with machined synchronicity, all ten thousand facing Stryker
: Logan, bloodied but healing, stares down at his fallen enemy
(
) Logan
Kayla runs down one of the steel staircases that clings to the cavern wall like fire escapes
(cont'd) If we get closer to Stryker,  can work my magic
Logan stares at Stryker, his true enemy, the
man who destroyed his life
Ten thousand clones
encircle Stryker, who stands on the raised podium in the cavern's center
don't want him hypnotized
want him dead
Never taking his eyes off his enemy, Logan advances
: c_0NTTNTTF:)1
97
: (3) Stryker sees Logan walking toward him, toward the hordes of clones
Stryker shakes his head and smiles
The man's committing suicide
He leans into the microphone
The Eleven listen to their commander's voice, amplified by hundreds of speakers (cont'd) No army that ever marched could stand against you
You will never abandon your mission, and your mission is simple
Kill the mutants
Kill them wherever you find them
Stryker points at Logan
(cont'd) Ten thousand cloned murderers turn on Logan, soulless black eyes focusing on their target
Logan stops his march beside one of the massive steel pillars
that supports the cavern ceiling
(to Kayla) Get the hell out of here
What are you doing
Bringin' down the house
He sweeps his claws clean through the pillar, at an angle
The uppermost section shears off and drills into the floor with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the concrete for thirty feet around the impact site
Stryker realizes what Logan is doing
The Eleven charge
From above we can see the full-scale of the onslaught, wave upon wave of cloned murderers closing in
(CENTTN11FTl' 98
: (4) Logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it
Creaks and groans sound overhead, as the tremendous weight above exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports
Most of the ten thousand can't get close to Logan, but they all want in on the first kill
Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood of the Eleven
He reaches a third pillar and chops through it
Kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit
(cont'd) ,
Even Logan can't hold back the tide for long
Talons rake his face, his arms, his chest
But still he battles, slicing through a fourth pillar, a fifth
Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling
Dust and rocks fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen
Logan sees that the cavern's collapse is imminent
He can no longer hold off the Eleven's assault
An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree
One of the clones follows, using his black talons in the same fashion, grabbing at Logan's feet
When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing clones, he severs the pillar below his feet
The clone chasing him can climb no farther, can do nothing but roar and hiss at his escaping prey
Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla waits beside the open door
He races up the stairs
Stryker sees his dream in ruins
He runs for the nearest exit
Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety, when the cavern ceiling gives out
Thousands of tons of stone and steel come crashing down
Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before she would be crushed
99
- The compound has essentially imploded, the major structures falling into the massive pit created by the cavern's collapse
Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater into a raging fire pit
Smoke billows up from the molten core
few dazed survivors,  and , have escaped the carnage, but Alkali Lake no longer exists as a military base
Thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind
Logan and Kayla walk away from the burning crater, never looking back
They head through the woods toward the lake that glitters in the sunlight
One of them could have survived
Logan glances at her
(cont'd) The clones
They've got your healing factor
Logan looks back at the devastation
Unless someone comes along who can move a few million tons of steel, they ain't going anywhere
- They stop at the edge of the lake
Paper from the destroyed base drifts through the air, falling on the water and the shore
Almost looks peaceful from here
There's something  want you to know
He looks at her
(CONTTNt1F
fl : (cont'd) Maybe nothing  say matters anymore
But 'm going to say it anyway
blossom of blood opens up on her chest
She stares down at it in wonder before sinking to her knees
Logan turns and sees Stryker walking toward them
(cont'd) No
Stryker fires again
The adamantium bullet rips through Logan's forehead with an unholy sound
Logan falls to the ground
Stryker stands above him and fires another bullet into Logan's head
Stryker turns the gun on Kayla
(cont'd) You don't need to waste another bullet
'm already dead
Stryker blinks and hesitates
Kayla coughs, her strength beginning to fade
(cont'd) Maybe you should turn that gun on yourself, Colonel
Stryker nods, pointing the gun at his own head
(cont'd) It would be good for the mutants if made you pull the trigger
() Why do you hate us so much
Stryker's finger trembles on the trigger
(cont'd) Is it because your son is one of us
For the first time, perhaps, we see something human in the cold blue of Stryker's eyes
(cont'd) Enough killing, Colonel
Throw your gun in the lake
r (-nNTTNTTFT)1 101
: (2) Stryker does as he's told
The revolver sinks into the water
(cont'd) Leave us
Keep walking till your feet start to bleed
Stryker turns and walks away
Kayla crawls over to Logan
She lifts his head onto her lap
He's unconscious but breathing
The bullet holes in his skin have already healed
She strokes his jaw
and smiles sadly
One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her leg
She takes it and looks down at the blank page
She has no pen
She touches her chest, just above her heart, wetting her finger with her blood
She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it, folds it once and places it in Logan's hand
She kisses his lips and rests his head gently on the ground
Fighting the pain, a dying woman, Kayla manages to stand
(cont'd) If you ever remember what  did to you, try to forgive me
was a fool
And you were right always loved you
She turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back, never hesitating as the waters rise above her knees, above her waist, above her shoulders, above her head
- Logan's eyes flutter and open
For a moment he squints into the blue sky
He sits up, looking around
The woods are empty
He stands, completely disoriented, a stranger in the world
He realizes that he's holding a piece of paper in his hand
He unfolds it and reads the message written in blood
You are my Wolverine
He stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and putting it in his pocket
f  ) 102
: He takes a deep breath of cold air and walks west, toward the falling sun
He doesn't know who he is
He doesn't know where he's going
But the wind blows through his hair, the last of the sunlight feels good on his skin
He is a free man
He walks toward his destiny
