You're also the first girl 've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house
And what do you do out there
You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books
Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't
Your system's much more perfect
