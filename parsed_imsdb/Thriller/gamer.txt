We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a bold, block letter
The nano-cell approaches a normal cell next to it
there is a flash; now the cell next to it has turned into an exact copy of the nano
This continues, multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells
(cont'd) these copied cells contain remote access functionality
Therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex
