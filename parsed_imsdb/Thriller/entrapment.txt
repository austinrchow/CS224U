"Entrapment", early, by Ronald Bass Ronald Bass First Draft Screenplay December 2, 1996 Story by: Ronald Bass and Michael Herzberg ,  - Lake Shore Drive
Four o'clock in the morning
Minimal traffic, minimal life
As   , we   the face of
Hancock Tower
Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark up here, street sounds fading fast, and as   we can just make out
a dark
Like a spider
Inching its way up the steel surface of the 98th floor, and we  to see
The
All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored helmet that conceals the face
Two long, oblong backpacks, climb- ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt
Moving   the face of the skyscraper
How is it possible
still to see
the piton-like  are electromagnetic,  to the steel to support weight
button releases the magnetic charge when the bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position
The Thief is remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision, until
our summit
softly-lit, glass-walled  on the 100th floor
Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures, in a cavernous coldly-decorated space
Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted  to the steel casing above a massive window
Pulleys, metal caribiner clips, yellow Kevlar ropes
So superbly practiced, the rigging is placed in seconds, huge   pressed to the surface of the glass
The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the rigging, touches a button, a motor , the ropes  and the window
, hangs  by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly sustain its awesome weight
The huge pane shudders in the wind, and the Thief slips
the Penthouse
Nearby, an   softly  its 60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief attaches a small computerized  which runs a series of possible  at dazzling speed on its display panel, until
the right one
Illuminated in red
The beeping, the green light, go
The device is removed
Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction- mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling window pane
small remote control clicker
the outside suction cups
The window's weight now supported by the interior rigging
The outside equipment pulled the apartment in a single tug
The  of a motor, and the pane pulls , the Thief expertly  it into place
No trace of entry
Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle, the Thief
the profusion of priceless art
The paintings run to Otto Dix, Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp
One statue an obvious Rodin
The soft lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity perspective in mind
An obsidian slab dining table that seems to end at the horizon
The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin- drical  bearing a label we can't read
Knows the way, quickly through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis Bacon
The Thief has no interest in these, and as  , we enter
a powder room
lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper- plated commode, and across from these
a single
Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master
17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient bridge
The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously
the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes
Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper
Opens the cylindrical tube, pulling out
another  which we cannot see
Deftly unrolls this, fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame
Re-hangs it
Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor
Approves
Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube
Leaves
Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement canvas
cheerful acrylic portrait
Bozo the Clown
the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library
There is a  built into the wall, a brass lid with the words
The Thief pops the labeled tube  the chute
Gone
Steps
onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating, and
Disappears into the vent
Reaching back to refit the grating seamlessly into place
Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the narrow space, arriving at
an open vertical  ,  air straight up the 100 floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening
Calmly, the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from the backpack, and simply
the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an instant
the force of the updraft seems to  the Thief in place, suspended above 100 stories of nothingness
Then suddenly, the Thief
, an exhilarating moment of absolute  , until a cord is tugged and
a nylon   with a pop
We watch the Thief drifting lazily down
ride any kid would pay big money for
- Our original exterior  of the skyscraper's penthouse now to see in far distance
the dense forest of silhouetted   of downtown Chicago against the night sky, and we   them, covering miles in three seconds, to  on
the highest floor of the  , and  an unlit window to see
a
silhouetted  looking through it to
through the scope's lens
An amazingly  detail of the Hancock Tower Penthouse
The scope now   the length of the Tower, to
The street
The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta
Calm as you please
And as the scooter glides off
We  our unseen voyeur   from our telescope
door somewhere, and as  , it
Closes
Softly

Long, bare, dimly lit
Silent
We're in the bowels of somewhere

is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat Riley do
He wears Riley's Armani, too
Maybe this guy coaches
Heels  until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering
There is a dull silver rectangle below the words
He holds his hand up to it
Nothing happens
Shit
Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased slacks
One more time
Enters
- An unexpectedly  semi-circular room, the entire inner circum- ference made up of a single continuous  , separated into a seamless array of
Three-dimensional rotating  of every room in the Hancock Tower Penthouse,  of electrical, plumbing, and ventila- tion systems
See-through rotating multicolored models of every piece of security  imaginable, components  as performance simulations are run
Rapid-fire sequences of indiv- idual human , complete with photos and bio blurbs
Screens flickering with blizzards of , hurtling past at warp speed
The Pentagon and  would kill for this room
The largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a from the crime scene
The living room of the Penthouse, crawling with slow-moving cops and technicians, doing their slow-moving thing
Surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles
All live
We see the library, the mail chute
The powder room
Bozo
Cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate , each outfitted with super-tech panels to process the avalanche of information
But today, all stations are empty
Except one
Baker
You got it solved
And now we see her
From the rear
Slouched at her station
Looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled oversized workshirt, vintage jeans
(
, from the rear) Actually
Yeh
Not a kid's voice
Throaty
Music and whiskey and sex and effortless confidence
Even the voice turns us on
(glances at his watch) What took you so long, Gin called 4:30 this morn
And stops
Because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone to stone
was with someone, all right
Now we really see her
Delicate bones and features, slender body, radiating the power of a natural heart-stopping beauty is 32, ethereal and feral at once
Electric green eyes crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked with
So
This is work
He is not kidding
Stainless steel beneath the dapper
They are a matched team
Hector,  hardly know the guy
Why be impolite to strangers
And he smiles
Maybe she's lying
He likes her
Look at those assholes
He means the cops on live feed
If the Vermeer were lying on that table, they'd toss their doughnuts on it
Yeh, well, they didn't insure it, so they don't have to solve this
To them it's a crime
To us it's 24 mil, less re-insurance, which is
(grim) Only thirty percent, Gin
Ouch
Really
Which is why you're on this
Soft and straight
You're the best
need you
He came in through the window
That's not possib
What's not possible is entry through the doors or the vents
That would have triggered instant alarm
The windows are wired, too
Only for trauma
They used smart glass, where the sensors respond to violation of the panel's integrity
He's listening
He always does with her
think he scaled the wall, popped the frame
In one piece
She sounds awfully positive
Then again, she always does
Then, he only had to deal with heat and motion sensors
They were on 60-second delay, so the owner wouldn't trigger the alarm just be walking arou
The pane weighs 200 pounds, the building's 1100 feet high
This particular guy is the best
The best there ever was
Almost as if she knows who
Cruz shakes his head
Popping the frame would trigger the alarm
She smiles
First time
Even at one-tenth power, it is dazzling light
She touches the panel before her
(gently) wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo
The live feed is replaced by a red-outlined rotating three- dimensional  of the living room
The alarm box glows green
One window pane glows lavender
She touches the panel, and the window , the alarm instantly emits a
Reset
As he watches
This time the window   into thin air
No sound
stick figure appears, crawls through the opening, and the alarm begins the slow  we heard last night
Cruz just stares
Here's how  figured it out
Live feed replaces the diagram
Our camera  toward a  of lilies by the window
All the flowers are tilted in one direction
Over the lip of the vase, away from the window
No one arranges flowers like that
It was the draft from the window
He turns to her
You said
This particular guy
Now she is beaming
Excited
And just above a whisper
Andrew MacDougal
Delighted at his stupefied reaction
Why not Houdini
Or Pretty Boy Floyd
Maybe Jesus Christ
Because they couldn't do it
His slow smile
This fucking kid
He's been out of the business
For ten years Maybe not
No one ever proved, hell, even arrested him, for stealing anything But we all know he was numero ichiban for thirty years
Why not forty
She's serious
Why
Because of the Bozo switch
Guys have been copying his pack- rat signature for decades Maybe the thief wanted it to look like MacDougal
She doesn't even answer
Just touches her panel, and one of the data screens   to huge size
It is
list of his private collection
Complete to three acquisitions last Thursday
Names  up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions, estimated retail and black market values
Turner, Corot, Thomas Coles, DeKooning, Klimt, Cezannes, Odilon Redon, Braques, Mary Cassatt
No Vermeer
Nothing close
Don't be a putz
This is his legitimate collection, which he buys Presentable for any search warrant surprise party
Names keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee
Amazing
What he rips off, he fences
And the money feeds his portfolio of investments, which are daring, savvy, and obscenely succesf
Oh,  get it
He has no interest in Vermeers, so that proves he stole one
By that logic, he oughta be a suspect most of the time
She shakes her head, sadly
You love to embarrass yourself
Touches her panel
The big screen now shows a grainy of
The auction
Where our client bought the painting
We see the Great Room of an English Country estate
Perhaps a hundred attend
Genteel to the max
(
) Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire, four weeks ago
The tape  five  on the block
We recognize our , the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge
The view to include the crowd, and
One tiny section is circled
And   twenty feet
high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable
Then,  to amazing resolution
The image of
(
, murmur) Anyone we know
MacDOUGAL, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly virile a face as one can recall
Etched with character and worldly experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze
Tall, wide shoulders, massive hands
This guy would be more fun to fuck than fight
By a lot
So he was there
Staking it out
Why bid, when you can mark the buyer, and jack it within the month
She leans  back in the molded chair
Lifts her long legs up onto the console
They end in slender bare feet
The toes wriggle
At this moment, he is winging on flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the Hotel Akura, which will include a mixed media collage/oil by Georges Braques, on which he supposedly has his eye
But you know better
Bet your ass
At Vegas odds
Touches the panel
The big screen now holds three faces, three names
(
) Research reveals three known fences, still at large, who are believed to have brokered Vermeers to black market buyers
Sandrine Palmer is hospitalized in Malta with ovarian cancer
One face and name disappears
Two remain
The other two
Live in Tokyo
tiny, dry, adorable, shrug
Which says, bingo
And you did all this since 4:30 this morning
Grinning small at each other
She can't help that hers is hot
She never can
(murmur) Plus
You were polite to a stranger
One of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to ignore
Best to defuse by pretending it's a joke
(soft and playful) Sounds like you're sorry you're already a friend
Said as banter between pals
Which doesn't make her wrong
,  - Auction in progress in the huge traditional , where bonsai trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint the sleek, international, big-money crowd
Everyone milling, drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up on the raised platform
the  has a new piece on the block, a 6th Century temple scroll, from the Asuka period
It is exquisite, and bidding seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the overhead  , which reveals bidding status in thirty currencies simultaneously
As we  the hall, we see
all non-Asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid-fire auctioneer
Except one
MacDOUGAL stands alone in black tie
Tall and rugged and polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous
He is bidding on the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and the repeated finger-stabs of the auctioneer in our direction
'  (
, subtitled Japanese) Don't do it
slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder
She is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly
Breathtaking would be an insult
MacDougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her
Just raises his program to up the bid
(softly, subtitled Japanese) You're already over value
By 15 percent
And now he turns
Straight to her eyes
This is  an admiring glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the Northern Hemisphere
It is a look that says, in the most understated terms, shut up or 'll kill you
She shuts up
His glance goes to his obvious bidding , a rather butch middle-aged Chinese woman in an embroidered version of a Mao suit
She indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny Yorkshire Terrier, whom she holds in her stubby hands
MacDougal raises back
(subtitled Japanese) Will you stop being stubborn for one sec
And stops
Because he has turned
With the eyes of a lion
Being pulled from an antelope carcass
(quietly, subtitled Japanese) have a question
Rich Scottish voice
Impeccable Japanese intonation
(brightly, subtitled Japanese) Who the fuck am
(subtitled Japanese) That is of no interest
Oh
In spite of herself, she looks a little hurt
(subtitled Japanese) What, then
(subtitled Japanese) Why
Are we speaking
Japanese
Her eyes move across his formidable face
Uh
'm showing off
His eyes scan the length of her gown
Her body
Something of a habit
She is minus a comeback
You know the alleged value of this piece from some fucking computer which has no clue of the price can turn the scroll around for in 30 minutes beat
No, you can't
He blinks
No
( really sorry) It's sold
His great head  around to see Madame Mao  her pooch, flushed with victory
He stares for a long moment, a veneer of philosophical almost masking his rage
When he turns back
Are you a confederate of my adversaries
Or are you just stupid
And walks
Away
on her
Feeling like both
- Mac among the guests awaiting their cars, standing slightly apart
From behind him
a feminine throat clears
Nervously
He closes his eyes for a beat
Then, turns
(softly) How about
If  try humility
And presents a business card to him with both hands, Japanese- style
Mac looks in her eyes
Takes the card with both hands
Reads
Virginia Romay
Gin, actually, Gin Romay was named after a card game
Or a cheap cocktail
She blinks
His brows raise
(softly) As in
'll have a Gin Romay, please
With a twist
That laser, unsmiling stare
Beyond sexy
She gets lost in it for a beat
You're supposed to be charming
'm supposed to be selective
Glances back to her card
Reads
Art and Antiquities Acquisition Advisor, how alliterative
Looks up
Still no smile
And am  the antiquity
In mint condition
She sighs
Achingly lovely
Look, 've studied you,  know
pretty much
everything
Do you
Made your first millions selling scrap metal
Then, gold mining concessions, gems, art, and lately strategic metals for new technologies - platinum, zirconium, titanium
You said
Everything
Huh
Oh
The cat burglar stories
Why would anyone
with so much to lose
take those kinds of risks
Guileless smile
You'd have to be
Stupid
held beat
His glance lifts beyond her shoulder
Excuse me
And walks off toward a sleek custom   just pulling up
She goes after him
didn't know Porsche made things like this
Well, they don't
Tipping the valet
Sliding in
as a rule
Shutting the door
Through the open window, she hands something from her bag
plastic rectangle which  into a slide viewer
She presses the light
He looks at the slide
Recognize that
No reaction
My seller is in Shinjuku, we can go there tonight
She leans closer
He wants 4
6 million
can get it for three
He hands it back
Looks in her eyes
No, you can't
And
Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion
She's hailed a cab
- Graceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the '20s
Burnished
Elegant
Way cool
place to drink, to deal, to dream
down the polished surface of the bartop, til we come to
a tropical
Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the room
to see
the umbrella, something small, something mechanical woman's   the point of the umbrella ever so slightly, and we   her arm to see
Gin
Still in her gown
She is reading, with half-glasses, and one of the bows curls around her ear, which we  on to hear
static
Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional mike, and hears
(
) only it's not bloody football to Mac's table, well across the room
Drinking giant beers with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled, suit
The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if he actually gave a shit
(
) it's just that crap Americans call 'football', like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one
The guy nods seriously
Maybe he's a Sumo dude
Why you'd want to bring that foolishness to Japan , you're just pissing your investment down a bungee hole
(major accent) You got Cubano this trip
That he does
Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it over
Flat against one side is an , which Sumo Guy skillfully, slipping it seamlessly  his pocket as he withdraws a small
Takes out one long cigar, lights up
Seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution, something stable The big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac
Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small  fastened to the cardboard
Lights up
Slides the match box in his pocket
Garbage, perhaps
Or industrial plastics
Gin still engrossed in her reading
figure leans down next to her
She startles, slightly
So surprised to see
My favorite thing in life
Coincidence
She gives him the great smile
'm staying here, what's your excuse
And now he smiles
First time ever
little chilling, the way he does it
Staying here, as well
You are in room
(half a beat) One thirty-eight
In one motion, he flags the bartender
Will you send a half-bottle of Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138, please
And some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with
He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand
Turning back
Actually,  was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting Spitzweg
Until  determined the painting was apparently stolen
Oh
She's shocked
He agrees
Goes against my grain
The DeKooning in your slide, the 4
6 million you can get for 3
Can you get it for 2 and a half
She looks in his eyes
Sure
And as if he believed her
My checkbook is in my safe
You wait here
His smile evaporates
He is gone before she can say
Okay
'll wait here
,   - Mac driving in silence
Gin stealing glances at him
Suddenly and smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up
That's my purse
He opens it
One eye on the road, he begins to rummage
Just want to see if 'm with the person you say you are
Can't be too caref
She  the bag away from him, he  it back, the car , and
into a parked pure white Bentley
Metal and , both  go , a cacophony of horrific (quietly) Oh, dear
People come , but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly who were just returning to their precious Bentley
Their and  would be suitable if all their grandchildren had been crushed beneath Mac's wheels
Mac and Gin are  of the car
As he exits, Mac has palmed a small , and in a quick unseen motion,  a jagged tear in his left trouser leg
The old couple  to Mac, their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through
(subtitled Japanese) We'll go in there, and call the police
And  off toward the nearest building, a block-square 30-story skyscraper bearing the name
The couple, the crowd, all race after the limping Mac
Are you all right
No answer, he looks dark enough to rain
the public lobby of the huge industrial complex
Two night  come hurrying from their desk, as the small mob  in
Mac in the lead, a commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice
(subtitled Japanese) have damaged the car of these kind people
Please help them call the police
One guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone
Mac pulls up his trouser leg, and Gin  to see a bloody
Mac drops the trouser back over the wound
Asks the remaining guard
(subtitled Japanese) May  use a washroom, please
The guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos
Mac hands his billfold to Gin
These are my papers, passport, car registration
If the police arri
You're going to need stitches, let me get you to a hospital
Soft words, genuine concern
And his eyes flicker
As if somehow seeing her for the first time
small spark, but she feels it
Softer still
Really, this can all wait
'll handle it
The look holds
That's actually
Very sweet
His first real smile
It was worth waiting for

Mac enters  with the First Aid kit, locking the door, hitting the  on his wrist, which begins counting at He pulls  his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash, and simply

Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit, them in bogus gore, expertly  his leg, then  the prosthetic  the hole
He pulls off the   badge clipped to his lapel, and from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge into

Mac simply hooks himself up, and saunters straight  the area, toward the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed through the wall
Nearby, a  is built into the same wall, and Mac calmly  it , squeezing through into

No time to lose
up  the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he enters
the conveyer , a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in diameter, filled with billowing red gas
Mac stretches out on his belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in eerie red light
He begins to
shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube
Gas too thick to see the end
He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when suddenly
the floor beneath his tube  , and he is crawling in space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance between manufacturing and shipping structures
He goes faster, black chamber
We can scarcely make out the endless rows of shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves
Through the gasket
Mac  into view, swinging himself neatly  to the floor, and in a single motion, he is already  a neon-green pen light along the shelves of microchips
We see now the wrappers are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is definitely looking for something special, until
he's found it
single row, 35 chips, nothing special from here, but Mac
out something coiled,  it to full length, revealing a strip of shiny black
Three feet long, little more than an inch wide
Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly the row of microchips
And when he lifts it  again
the chips have  to the underside of the cloth
In one deft  of his wrist, he  the cloth again, like a yo-yo
Turns to leave, and
Oh, yeh
Tosses a small  of something where the chips used to be

No one sees, no one cares
Hooking up once again, he ambles toward a door clearly marked      - By the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall
He pretends to scan it
stack of flyers
He takes one
Exiting into
Past a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting
Mac just strolling along, reading his flyer, as

Touches his shoulder (subtitled Japanese) Excuse me
Mac turns, stares through his opaque  at a well-built Dead straight eyes
(subtitled Japanese) The company picnic
Saturday or Sunday
His eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'
Mac hands it to him, and without a trace of Scottish accent
(subtitled Japanese) Better eat first
Gin is up to her ears in grief
There are no less than five grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second wind and are  in top form
The bystander gallery has grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in
As Gin struggles to cope
she keeps looking at the clock
Darting glances toward the corridor
She is freaking out
Finally
She can't stand it
Hands Mac's billfold to one of the cops, pushes her way through the mob, and
down the corridor, a security guard in belated pursuit, we go
her  the hallway,  around a corner, flat-out ,  to a stop at the right doorway and
' An empty washroom
She listens
Nothing

, from the stall) Just 'Mac'
And whatever became of a gentleman's privacy

Hands them to the guy

Awkward silence
He smiles at that, much amused
Slips on his jacket
You should see me without my teeth

Remembers
Ah
Mustn't forget to zip up
That's not what he forgot
He pulls  the coiled black satin cloth strip,  it free, microchips snug to the underside
And fits it neatly

To meet her gaze
Odd place, this
He goes to her
Offers his arm
What do you suppose they make here
Video recorders
She takes it, wrapping both hers through

Ushers her through

Looking straight ahead
Contemplative
She stares at his profile
Mind telling me why
You can't get it for me at 2
5, can you
Well, we can tr
You were setting me up
The correct price is 2
8
You conspire with the seller to start at 4
6, so 'll be grateful when you 'bargain' him down to three
Close enough to fool some people
unfortunately
He sighs
Never looks at her
'm old
know what everything is worth
She keeps staring
So where are we g
am going to the airport
You are going on to the rest of your life
Which
He thinks
Admits
should be interesting
Her turn to think
You forgot your lugg
The hotels deal with that
The things  need are always waiting at the next one
(afterthought) don't carry
Baggage
Little twist on that
Sensible
And you're off to
Oh, that's highly personal
He still stares straight ahead
The taxi pulls onto a freeway
Toward Narita Airport
Time running out
And in her dearest, most vulnerable, voice
did so hope to impress you
She puts the fingertips of her left hand
On his chest silence
No reaction
(hopeful) 'm still hoping
And he smiles
Turns to her eyes
Young lady
am old enough to be your grandfather
She shakes her head
Uh-uh
(soft) My father
Leans her mouth in for the kill
(whisper) That's part of the rush
And softly
Fits her mouth to his
The green eyes close, as she tastes him
Nothing predatory in this kiss
It is tender, exquisite
kiss of deep longing
Of true love
His arms slip around her
And in less than five seconds
(
, racist accent) Still on fo' airport
Nobody
Says
Nothin'
'  - small bottle
An ornate label
Chateau d'Yquem '67
Gin lifts it from the table, studies the label
She wears only a man's oversized t-shirt
Our rotating  reveals the empty bed, tangled sheets
Gin looks pretty rumpled herself
She lifts the bottle, two glasses, a plateful of chocolates and strawberries, and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking
the
Mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing, overlooking downtown Tokyo
He wears a thin Japanese robe called a yukata, and is wrapped in half of a huge down  from the bed
The other half obviously waiting for
Here
reward
She curls down into the billowing coverlet, just against his body
Sets her things beside him
reward for what
For not being old
After all
It is a lovely smile
He studies it for a beat
You mean
Not as old as  look
She traces her finger along his cheek
(a whisper) Yeh
And kisses him
It takes awhile
She seems to enjoy it
With him, it's harder to tell
When she pulls back
he picks up a chocolate
Tears it in half
Offers her the larger piece
Do  deserve a reward
No answer
He puts the chocolate into her mouth
With great tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip
As she swallows
It's so hard to find good casual sex, anymore
'm probably out of practice
But he just looks at her
What's hard to find
Is someone you truly want to be with
And leans closer
Just above a whisper
Even for awhile
He kisses her
Beautiful and deep, the way he does it
And when he pulls back, she is staring at him
As if at a loss for something to say
It's lucky we stopped by my room, for the wine
She swallows
Because his gaze is unrelenting
As if not forgetting that she's changed the subject
Otherwise, we'd never have found my bag was stolen
Until tomorrow
Would that make it more stolen
She smiles
His face looks kind now, not formidable at all
Maybe she's wondering if she actually likes him
They even got my prescriptions
Something you need
There are all-night chemists
He does look concerned
And therefore sweet
She kisses his nose
take Prilosec
For stomach acid
And an inhaler
For asthma
She gets her old smile
The soft, wicked tease
But since  didn't have to work all that hard tonight
He stares at her
Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her eyes
Pantomimes pulling the trigger
(softly) Ouch
had that coming
She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest
He wraps strong arms around her
Pulling her close
Why would someone steal my luggage
Every guest in this place must have more than a wannabe art dealer
Ah
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there
Something in the tone
Such as
Well
Wannabe dealers make excellent fences
flicker
In her eyes
And she cuddles back
As if enjoying the humor
He thought  had a stolen painting
In my bag
'm joking, of course
Kisses the top of her head
The Vermeer wouldn't fit
Her eyes widen
Just a little
Excuse me
Why, did you do something wrong
She turns all the way around
Their faces are inches apart
Each reading the other's eyes
You said
Vermeer
The most famous painting stolen this week
His turn
To kiss her nose
If you don't keep up on your craft
You'll miss all the jokes
And lowers her gently onto her back
Still staring in her eyes, he winds her legs around him
Her mouth parts, but
he fills it with his own
This conversation
Is over
'  - of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet
Maybe they spent all night
the shower running full blast in a distant bathroom
to see
Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every goddam thing in the room
She comes to
Mac's tux
The jacket, rifles the pockets, pats the lining
The pants now
something peculiar
The right leg has no stripe
Touches the cloth
Slightly sticky where the stripe should be
Odd
the bathroom
Shower running full
But there's no one in it
a storage closet
Mac crouching in the smallspace
We see the travel bag
The luggage tag,  , a Darien, Connecticut address
The embossed initials
But there is something else in Mac's hand
a prescription bottle
Prilosec
And a name,
Chicago address
Mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe
exits the closet
Locks the door
Mac ambling into the bedroom, toweling his hair with one hand
Holding his billfold in the other
Gin is starting a room service breakfast
Eggs, sausage, Belgian waffles
The girl can eat
'm so glad  didn't leave Tokyo
She looks up
Trademark dry grin
love a guy who knows how to sweet talk
He stands over her
Smiling
What he meant was
There was a call
While you were sleeping
call
An art dealer  know
He has a Monet
Minor, but it is Giverny
He'll let me have it for 5
3 million
She stares at him
(cautiously) We can maybe beat that
(pulling plastic from his billfold) agree
This is a bank debit card
It gives the bearer access to an account containing 4
6 and change
dislike round numbers
And hand
the card to her
As her eyes move over it
'd like you to go down there, and pick up the painting
If that's all right
Without looking up
Me
If 'm there, he'll haggle
You just hand him the debit card, with that
luminous smile
And say, take it or leave it
Now her eyes come up
She says nothing
Hesitant
Oh, dear
thought you so wanted to make a good impression
Thought  already did th
And along with making an excellent impression
You will also make 2 percent of the purchase price
She blinks
That's $92,000
And change
For two hours work
The look holds
He goes to the desk
Lifts a cellular phone
it to her
Any problems
Just give me a ring
Stolen painting is it
Of course not
And on his way out the door
If it was
wouldn't pay more than three
,  - Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund
Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle counters, all built along a tall rickety  nearly thirty feet above the pounding surf
The harbor is gigantic
Every type and size of vessel imaginable
Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and a lightweight bright orange foam cover
She looks at her slip of paper
Then across at the place
, a schlock kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front
This can't be right
Pulls out the cellular phone
Dials
'   (
) You have reached the voice-mail of  Investments
And, yes, you are at the right place
Fucking great
(into phone, pissed) like men with a sense of humor
This does not qualify
the phone shut
Checks the slip again
Walks firmly across the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into
- The place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist crap imaginable
The only paintings on display are renderings of big cats on black velvet
She winds her way through, to a counter at the back
One guy there
(subtitled Japanese) May  please speak with Mr
Okati
You doin' it
The best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the Hawaiian shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to be the guy who is selling you a Monet
Even a minor one
think there's some mista
You from Mac
She stops
Jesus
The guy  horribly
'm from Mac
Lemme see card
She hesitates
Four million, six hundred thirteen thousand, five hundred
Wow
He slaps his hand on the table
Lay it down, toots
You first
He shrugs
Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter
a brown paper-wrapped rectangle
Not much larger than two feet square
She can't even believe she's here, doing this
Gestures to him
Open it up
He obliges,  grossly all the while
Unwrapped, the painting does look like a Monet
From here
She stares at it
Now bring me the real one
He doesn't blink
This as real as it gets, lady
And from within her pocket
The cellular
She takes it out
Puts it to her ear
(
) You got it
(into phone) Is this an audition, a joke, or a rip-off
'm staring at an obvious forgery, here
(
) Turn it over
This gives her pause
Then, cradling the phone against her shoulder, she does as she's told
To see
(
) Is there an envelope
Taped to the back
In a Ziploc bag
Sure is
(into phone) Uh-huh
(
) Detach the bag
Read what's in it
Aloud
She does
Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps
(reading into phone) Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it says, Yokohama to Jakarta
dates, statistics
specs on some kind of machine, diag
(
) Papers back in the envelope, envelope back in the Ziploc, very quickly, without seeming to hurry
Her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told, cradling the phone with her shoulder
(
) Now take the debit card from your purse, slipping the Ziploc into the purse as you do it, shielding the move from everyone in the room but Okati
And she does
More deftly than we could ever have imagined
Like a pro
(
, quietly) Give him the card
beat
(into phone) Mac, the painting's a forg
(
, even quieter) This is a test
Of whether you'll still be alive four minutes from now
Do you hear me
Her face freezes
In a pleasant smile
(into phone) Yes, Mac,  do
(0
5
) Now
Hand him the card, and tell him in Japanese to pretend he is checking it by phone
Tell him to take awhile, as if he's on hold
She turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati
Hands him the card
(subtitled Japanese) Mac says, pretend you're checking this by phone, and take your ti
(subtitled Japanese) like 'm on hold, sure
And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some schmuck in baggy pants
He takes the card, stares at it comically, picks up the phone
(
) While he's checking, look around the room casually, as if searching for the cheesy handbags
She begins to
(
) All the while laughing, as if you are chatting with someone you actually like (into phone) 'm not that good
But she is
And she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy handbags
(
) As you're looking around, do you notice any m
(into phone) Three guys, two together, one alone
Cheap suits, not looking at me in a cop-casual way

) Call out cheerily to Okati, in English, 'Where's the toilet

beat
(
) Wing it
(calls out, cheerily) '
Okati, absorbed by his make-believe phone call, points around the back
(
) Get going
Now
(into phone, as she saunters) Mac, the painting isn't
(
) You've got what we bought, are you out of their sight
She turns the corner
Filthy corridor
Restrooms at opposite ends
(
) Run into the men's toilet
know you know how
beat of uncertainty
She looks both ways
(
, ominous) Are you running And she
down the garbage-strewn hallway, throws the men's room door,   on
a wispy   taking a leak through a  in the floor
(subtitled Japanese) The panicked little man
Bolts  the door
(
) Jump
Jump
now, from the corridor, footfalls
She looks down through the piss hole
The surf  thirty feet below
(into phone) It's too small
(
) The window , twit
Oh
She hops  the disgusting hole, boosts herself  to the small window, footfalls racing ,  herself through,  the phone a scary 30 feet to the surf below, as behind her, the door
and she   the window
her in -, kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder bag, and she
the ocean like a ton of bricks
Disappears
Comes up, sputtering in the swirling water, as from out of the shadows of the pilings
an engine  to life, the  of a custom , Mac reaching to scoop the startled girl  of the water, and they
, as bullets  helplessly after them
The shouting into their cellulars, racing in frustration down the pier, which rapidly vanishes behind us, as
Gin hangs onto Mac for dear life
This baby is  hauling
He wears an orange waterproof slicker with matching trousers
Shouts back, against the noise
She thinks
Admits, shouting in his ear
'
He is heading into deep water, a major shipping channel, points to one side, and she sees
a huge   vessel   in near distance
The chase is
They speed toward the  of a luxury liner, and as she realizes
They   the wake  , and are  for an amazing distance,  back to the surface,  toward
two gigantic  which approach each other from opposite directions
The Harbor Patrol in hot pursuit,  its

'
As we near the outbound freighter, Mac  his speed
Now the Harbor Patrol is really gaining
,  , Cruising   the part side of the outbound freighter, as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side
As the Harbor Patrol is nearly  them, Mac  suddenly the stern of the outbound freighter, the Harbor patrol madly to pursue, only to find we are both  straight
the starboard side of the inbound freighter, Mac  his wheel in an adroit nearly right-angle , and hears the  as the Harbor patrol

Wasting no time, he  into maximum ,  toward the immensely crowded harbor and its thousand vessels
Gin can't help but look back at the impressive crash site, mouthing a silent
Nearing the harbor, Mac  speed completely, drifting between two huge ships and
vanishing from sight
- The tiny Jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all larger than we are
Gin clings close to Mac, although it is no necessary
More like romantic
She is still flushed with the rush
guess you're gonna explain all this, huh
But he says nothing
Pulls out a water-tight duffle
Hands it back to her, without looking
Dry clothes, you'll need them
In five minutes
She takes the bag, confused
'm supposed to change
Here won't look
Gentleman's word of hon
There are a million sailors 've seen you naked
Give the boys a thrill
He means it
You probably won't be dating any of them, so what the hell
Gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft
No one seems to be paying much attention
What the hell
She unzips the bag, pulling out
(astonished) These
these are mine
He never looks around
Found 'em in your room
Perhaps the thief wasn't your size
She stares at the back of his head
wondering
He is stripping off his slickers
neatly-tailored  beneath
We have a business appointment
In four minutes
Okay
She pulls her dress off  her head
Business, huh
She ignores some nearby  and
Begins drying herself with a fluffy towel from the bag
(never turns) Time has come to tell you
What business
'm actually in
Uh-oh
Paydirt
Uh
Am  gonna like th
(quietly) 'm a thief
She can scarcely believe he's admitting this
And now that 've told you
'll have to kill you
He chuckles a Scottish chuckle
Cold and warm, at once
Or
She slips the dry dress  her head
you can spend the most interesting three weeks of your life
Training
Training for wha
followed by the most exciting night of your life
After which, you can walk away with 20 million untraceable dollars
She blinks
He means this
which will come in handy
Things being what they are
He shrugs
From now on
You can valet park
She begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress
We suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty
And if  refuse
(very quietly) Don't
Please
mean, you won't really kill me, 'm far too adorable
He looks around at her
As if deciding on that
Last night, at Fujitsu,  did some business
While you thought was in the toilet
Jesus
What could you possibly steal in 18 min
Thirty-five super -microchips
Each worth one million dollars
And change
Staring dead at her eyes
You hate round num
stole your suitcase when left you at the bar
have since sent it on to the States, with three chips, well hidden
Are you following
Since you aren't there to claim it, the bag will sit at Customs
Safe
Unless
No smile
No smile at all
They receive
An anonymous
Tip
Holy
Fucking
Christ
That's entrapment
No, entrapment is what cops do to robbers
We can feel her heart pounding from here
Blackmail
Is what robbers do to schmucks
And leans
To kiss her mouth
(softly) Even adorable ones
They have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic
It is at water level, the steps they use for their tender
He points up to the name
Pop quiz
She nods, slowly
Pulls the Ziploc bag from her purse
Hands it over
He removes the sheets of paper
Begins to peruse them
Admit it's a rush
The best day of your heretofore drab life
Fuck you
He glances up
accompanied by related foreplay
And gives him the smile
What a gal
He offers his hand
She rises, hops lightly to the steps of the gangway in her bare feet
He pulls dry shoes from the duffle
And as she slips them on
he  a switch, and the Jetski begins to  with water, Mac stepping to the gangway beside her
They watch
the Jetski rapidly  out of sight
No evidence
thorough guy
- Mac and Gin stand inside a gigantic  , watching massive being loaded by crane from a dock, through the gaping The chamber is a vaulted cathedral of steel, painted hospital green, and Mac's eye moves over all of it, seeming to inspect every plate, every pan head rivet
(
, British cheer) Hullo, there
They turn to see a round little man with watering eyes and a very wide necktie, skipping-down the iron steps
Bursting with a salesman's bonhomie, he extends a plump hand
Nickerson Carlsby, Mr
MacDuff, yes
Banquo MacDuff
This is my associate-fiancee, Ms
Duncan
The little man pauses
tic in the well-oiled smile
That is
fiancee and assoc
(cheery herself) 'm a hyphenate
Ah
Like that makes complete sense
Fingers the gardenia in his lapel
Well, it's a pleasure, in this alien place, to do business with a countryman
'm a Scot
It's a different country
Culturally and historically
see
(looking around) Well
They've brought you to quite the wrong place,  see
(looking around) Thank God
Carlsby leads the way along a narrow catwalk, which ends at a steel door
He presses his thumb to the
panel, and speaks into the voice box
(confidential code-voice) In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
The door  open
They go through it, as a gangway leads toward an open five-foot-thick  , where two rise from their seats
Carlsby ignores them as if they were furniture
the door
Five feet thick with hidden rein- forcements, no way to drill through
(authoritative) Impressive
Only the tip of our security iceberg
See these two Brinks locks
They do
The Captain keeps one key
The other is continually forwarded: to the Chief of Security at next port
There is no way to enter during voyage
like this
Carisby glances to Mac
He is stone
The best armed guard, rotated every six hours
redundancy, of course, but we would rather be safe three times over than merely two
Sound mathematics
(very quiet) What if there's a fire
In the chamber
Ah
Carlsby leads them through the open door, into
the maximum-security
Primo
The steel coated with sleek, matte, black all-grip paint
Tubby points up
Sprinklers
New design
Incredible power
The entire chamber is water- proof, fireproof, airtight
If the ship sinks , God forfend, your cargo is secure for salvage
No reaction
Mac does not look convinced
And your cargo is
Wine
Wine
The bloody Japs bought up half the premium clarets in the universe
You may have heard
Actually
He has
'm in charge of shipping some 14,000 bottles, most quite rare, to a number of premium hotels in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, Phuket, and Penang
Carlsby gets the romance of it all
All of which are destinations on your October voyage
Five months from now
However
And turns to the man
With laser, disapproving eyes
Wine
Doesn't prefer
To be jostled
The man beams
Gestures to a series of , each  at different heights, in different directions
Our 'delicate treasure' platforms, suspended on gimbals
Your cargo remains unruffled by roiling seas
Then, on arrival, is plucked
Pointing once more
By that forklift, and gently deposited on dock through the cargo hatch
a huge circular hatch cut into the hull
Mac's eyes stare blankly at it
long beat
He pronounces it all
Adequate
suppose
And then turns once more
Did we see
a bathing pool
On deck
Oh, yes, sir
The Shikoku Maru carries sixteen luxury suite pas- senger cabins
The finest cuisine
For valued clients who prefer to cruise in privacy
Mac
Thinks this over
Mildly
Interesting
- Carlsby ushering the couple along a plushly-appointed hallway secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter
He opens a burnished door, into
an elegant
Cherrywood panels, spacious windows with views of the harbor
The finest furnishings
It is breathtaking
Even
Adequate
suppose
But dearest, in five months, we'll be in Cape Town
Mac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been taped to the back of Okati's Monet
Peruses them casually
Anything sooner
That goes perhaps from
say, Sri Lanka
To Jakarta
And looks up
To a man dumbstruck
By coincidence
Why, yes
In three weeks
- Looking  on California's San Joaquin Valley from 12,000 feet, as air  past our open door
(
) You seem depressed
to see them both in jumping suits
He's checking her gear
She's eyeing the expansive grid of fields below
At your insistence, 'm leaping to my death, and  don't know why He clips a tether from his harness to hers
Because
You're a greedy girl
'm not jumping until you talk about this, it's been two days She folds her arms across her chest
Rebellious
He smiles at her tenderly
Nods, okay
Why are we going in three weeks if the wine is on a different route months lat
There is no wine
That just bought us a look at their security
She stares at him
knew that
What we want is on the boat in three weeks
Now can we jump
The machine in those diagrams
on the back of the painting
Maybe
He's still smiling
What does it do, make gold
We're nearing the targ
Why won't you trust me
How do  know who you are, hmmn
Stares in her eyes
For all  know, your name isn't Virginia Romay
Maybe you're a cop
She stares back
Dead straight
Why would a cop do all th
(softly) Entrapment, remember
What cops do to robbers
(just as softly) Oh
That
His smile is light, affectionate
Gently, he backs her to the edge of the doorway
One
two
She  her arms around his neck
Holds him close
Mac, 'm afraid
Vulnerable and touchingly real
His arms slide around her
Of you
(a murmur) Smart girl
And , Gin  in his arms, as we
them,  in  , until he releases her, and bot their arms and legs, as if flying, as if gliding face down, her shriek
He floats at the end of their tether, a few feet above her
And at last
her
We see the pure adrenaline rush
Shouts back
, '
,   - Woods, rolling hills, a dirt path
Mac stands by a sign at a crossroads, names, arrows,  , ,
, There is a phone booth nearby
He holds a stopwatch, looking down the path, as
Gin runs into view, steady stride, breathing hard, sheened with sweat
Approaching him, she slows to a stop
Hands on her knees, catching her wind
He  the watch
Consistent
And rather impressive
She sends a nasty smile, thanks a bunch
But maybe she likes the compliment, after all
' ,  - Rustic cabin in moonlight
Ringed by woods
Middle of nowhere, which is where Mac likes it
As we approach the lit window, we hear two oddly-matched sounds
splashing water
And the  of a violent
We   the window, into
- Two figures stand in the shower, spray  their shorts and tank tops
Gin is operating a sleek , trying to perform micro-surgery on a  which Mac waves in all directions at the end of a short pole
All right, six and seven
She blinks the spray from her eyes, and deftly  the wire dividing those two numbers on the board
As Mac keeps waving it, she goes off line
Concentrates
Gets it right
The wire away
Three and four
- on Gin operating a small steamshovel with a loading attachment on the front
It is mounted with two 2 x 4's, set close together, protruding from the loader
She maneuvers the wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks
But as she positions to scoop one up, her vehicle  , and we   to see it is
dangling from a , operated by Mac
Gin stays with it, concentrates, and on the next pass she glides her boards  a huge rock,  it awkwardly
Ignoring the bumpy ride, she pivots, and deposits her prize in place atop what has become
a  of stones
What the hell are we building
He gives this some reflection
chalet,  think
Or an outhouse
- Mac and Gin paddle , side by side
full moon slams off the rolling surface of the sea
Light chop, enough to bob pretty strong once they stop paddling
His stopwatch
He says only
Forty seconds
And she  , submerging her head and torso, and we go
her underwater, upside-down in the kayak, she  to a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit
Fumbling to  the seal on a slender , which , sending a of yellow-green  in all directions
She fits the flexible tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out
a small   with side  of black metal
Buffeted by the current, Gin manages to flip a small switch on the housing of the fan, and
nothing happens
Again
Nothing
And again
With a supreme effort, she tries to  herself upright, but
can't quite make it
Blind  now, blowing bubbles, at the kayak, which suddenly
upright, manipulated by Mac
She sputters and tries to the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and  her across the shoulder
She is furious
Get your fucking equipment together, man, this is a professional operation
- Gin in a clearing, arms at her sides, a determined look
Mac is somewhere just behind us
(
) This time, when you raise your arm
Don't breathe
She nods, got it
Focused
suddenly, in the clearing before her, a    pops up, the outline of a terrorist shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a and
, ,
The paper terrorist is  in the head
Two out of three
She lets out a thin stream of air
Proud of herself, but too cool to gloat
Very, very nice
Had a tour with the Mosad, did you
She turns slowly
Where does this fit in the game plan
His enigmatic, yet fond, smile
Oh, it doesn't
But one never knows
quiet wink
You might need it with me
- on Gin leaning back at a 45 degree angle
She is sweating
This is hard
a -
And
to reveal
She is climbing  the inside of the angled -frame , using hand rods with powerful  cups, and similar suction devices on the balls of her feet
human spider, inching up the wall with everything she's got
She  the next hand rod down, and it
slips
Shit
as she  eighteen feet to
in an ocean of  packing bubbles, which in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator
She has totally
Buried alive
(
) Mac is wading into the sea of plastic bits,  her body out with his bare hands
Once more, she comes up sputtering
This one,  will not get
He's holding her in his arms
Leans close
But you will, you'll get it all
You are actually
He kisses her
Quite remarkable
Something in the way he looks at her
Her return gaze is naked
It looks like love
Take the rest of the evening off
And kisses her again
Her eyes close
- Mac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's short-wave radio is playing  World Service
Leaning against an open laptop, is
Mac's stopwatch
He glances up at it
What he sees makes him reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw
a rectangular gun-metal gray
Looks like a cross between a remote control clicker and a large cell phone
Turns it
The power display  green

Down the alleyway comes a young man walking his bicycle through shadow
Nearing us, he raises his right hand, and

Of course, the others were saved by a safety net

Unclips one last time
This won't be easy
Throws her rope the railing, and to her surprise, Mac braces himself with his legs
lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily to the platform
Grateful, she hates to confess it
One act of fucking human kindness
Call it a lapse
And he swings lightly up beside her
The fog has rolled past
There are several million stars
Transcendent beauty
She slows her breath
And how does this fit into the game pl
Oh, it doesn't
We came for the view
And from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal
Flutes, wrapped in velvet
He  the cork in one motion, and it to its watery doom
She can't help but watch
One more motion to pour both glasses
Hands one to her
Toasts
To Ginger Baker
He clicks her glass
She stares straight in his eye
Shows no surprise, no fear
'm partial to drummers
If they played with Clapton and Winwood
And takes a sip
Cool as a goose
Licks her lips
The prescription bottle
When you stole my suitcase
But he's not drinking
Only staring
The wind has picked up
Armand Baker was my husband, May 13 to October 27, 1982, he played alto sax,  was 17 years old
She takes another sip
Good wine
He named me Ginger
He likes drummers, too
And you get sentimental for him
Every time you order drugs

in that name
use it for various things  don't want traced
When credit unions turn their computers my way
could listen to you lie all night
She toasts him
(softly) Same here, fella
Slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she flinches
Her eyes do flicker
And follow
He withdraws not a pistol, but a handful of
Do you like diamonds
Nine , so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes from bugging
Wow
You asked
Does the machine
Make gold
Holy
Christ
Gold is shit
It's six thousand dollars a pound
Worth your weight in gold
His eyes travel her body
That would put you at seven hundred thousand
Would you pay it
And he leans
Looks in her eyes
When the light hits you just right
'd pay more
She liked that
Maybe a lot
The machine
That we are stealing

Real ones
Gem quality

) All right, then
All set
to see Mac and Gin dressed as tropical tourists
She hangs on his arm
We will keep your passports in our safe until Jakarta
Of course
You are Suite 16
and never been kissed
The steward doesn't get it
Gin shrugs, sorry
We had booked Suite 9

Mac consents

Can't we stroll around the port
Just a little
The steward checks his watch

Just to be safe
(sweet smile) Better safe
Than sorry

At the bottom of the gangway
a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests
Each stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to  or
Mac moves the peg for 16
to the  position
And off they go
- Mac in his jump suit piloting the Dehaviland -53 across the endless black of the Indian Ocean
For the moment, he seems alone
Then

Goes back to
Gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear just beside the window of the jump door
Next to her, a pack that is even larger
No fear in her eyes tonight
Pure adrenaline
Are you dumping fuel
Changed my mind
There's nothing on the instruments downrange
The longer she flies before she ditches, the less chance they notice on the Bridge
As she stands, he begins to strap the huge pack  her body
Jesus
With her chute, and the other gear attached, the load makes us uneasy
Not her
You should lose the oxygen tank at 8000 feet
And how do  judge that
Babe's intuition
He points to an altimeter device on his wrist
It says 12,000 feet
She cuts him a look
So  just ask you on the way down
Or were you planning to e-mail me
He pulls out an identical device
Strapping it to her wrist
hate a crybaby
He straps the even-larger gear pack to himself
Checks the path of the tiny lights far below
Then, looks in her eyes
(simply) You can do this
Not merely reassurance
Affection
Something connective between them
You are my partner
Her eyes send back that personal bond, and she nods
can do this
Good girl
He pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles
She does the same

Counts them down, nine

Back up to Mac, as he

nothing
It doesn't open
She is  down, looking back up to see Mac make an exaggerated  sign across his body, and she closes her eyes,  her secondary chute, which
open,  her violently, and she  with the shock
He is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the freighter  in distance, she looks down and suddenly
the sea is  at her, she  her braking mechanism, at herself

and   the water,  down, twisting, disoriented her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic to  her light tube, which

Hang on for the wake
She sees the  now, a black mountain  the sea, a huge  pluming from its bow
She grabs his waist with all she's got
And he  the propeller to , they  off, straight  the towering wake and burst  it,  to the freighter's looming hull, speeding alongside, Mac looking up to find
a series of metal , which begin twelve feet above the water line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far above
Mac has a Kevlar rope with a  , and as he reaches the rungs, he

And he   of the propeller,  both of them, laden with gear,  of the water with sheer brute strength

He attaches them both with metal carabiner clips

Boy, 'll bet you were in shape before you got old
Too long ago to remember
And pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an the first
Offers her his hand

Suit yourself
They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go
If you'd packed my primary chute right,  wouldn't ha
Yes, you would
You're a girl
Up, up
And stop
They are nearly halfway to the top
Looking across the curved hull to
a large circular
Thirty feet away
The goal
Mac pulls from his pack
their   gear
With practiced speed, they fasten cups to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to
move  across the hull's surface toward the hatch
Mac is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull
Gin is deter- mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal solid one
Dark water  by beneath her
,  By the time she looks up at the hatch
He is gone
(
) Anytime you're ready
She looks  sharply
He is  the hatch, attached to the hull by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat
Noting her astonishment
Better angle
That it is
He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack
It's a battery-operated  , and with a menacing , only partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly  all the rivets around the hatch
Gin has pulled out the slender   we saw in the shower, and begins  through the metal seals around the hatch's rim
At thecrucial moment
You might want to move aside
Which she  does, as the hatch door  past her to the sea
splash
Gone
When she turns back, Mac is already the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps partially revealing
the maximum-security
We've seen this with Carlsby
The fork lift
The shadowy multitude of  on their gimbals, all , in different directions with the plunging of the ship
Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort Knox
The  of the engines is louder here, and he moves close to her to speak beneath it
May  trouble you for the torch
Or would you rather just dance
Oh
Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency, she tries to find the thing in her gear
After watching her fumble for a bit
know  packed it
he just reaches in and pulls it out
small  which he on, brilliantly  the entire hold
Scans the platforms
polnts to a  wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic membrane
Coal into diamonds
wealth machine
How do you know that's it
(as if stating the obvious) It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet
And it's the only thing worth waterproofing, in case the ship sinks
(softly) you twit
Hmmn
'm just finishing your sentence
Can't you answer a question with- out making me feel stupid
He's heading toward the swaying platforms
Why would  bother
He is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the magic crate
She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it look
She has to scramble, almost falling
He's already pulled from his gear
six rubber
She hands him her welding tool, and he begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate
The plunging ship has the platform really rocking
(concerned) They don't look like flotation bags
(working fast) Shit
Well then, let's forget the whole thing
She stares at him
Okay, it was a dumb ques
His eyes come
So fast that her breath stops
He looks plenty angry
Let's get one thing straight don't work with partners much, because basically,  find most people to be idiots
She swallows
Hard
You, in contrast, are first-rate
He watches the effect of that play across her eyes
And if think so
Maybe you should start thinking the same
Now move your ass
And goes back to work
She pauses a beat
Then pulls out two lengths of Kevlar rope
Begins securing their platform to the one above, to minimize the amount of sway
As she struggles with this, she sees him finish by welding a very small gray  to the top of the crate
When he glances up, he sees her staring at the box
transponder
Sends a scrambled signal by satellite
He touches the device
It
light glows
Precise coordinates
You could find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert
He rises
down to the floor
Where you g
(walking away) Fork lift
That's my assignm
(turning back) Unless you've got the keys, someone has to hot wire it
Oh
Finish up on the floaters
And heads off toward the fork lift
Finish up
She looks at the rubber pouches
They seem finished to her
Tugs at a couple
On pretty firmly
Across the way, we  the fork lift turn its engine
Won't they hear it
(
) Over these engines
Through five feet of steel
She hurriedly secures the last of her Kevlar lines
(
) Hell, if they do, they don't have the second key to get in
He is driving up in the rickety fork lift
Weaving around crates and equipment
Thank God for redundant security
He hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down his arms
Quickly, the switch places, Gin climbing into the idling fork lift, as Mac clambers up to  the crate's pallet with his air wrench
Gin moves the fork lift into position
Mac bracing his legs against neighboring cargo, using all his strength to hold our crate steady
He is really straining
How many tries do  get
(with effort) One, before  beat you senseless, dump you over the side, and donate your share to charity
She brings the fork
The crate sways slightly
She lines up her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes
You gotta work on that impatient streak
and slips them straight
First try
(amazed) How professional
She  the crate, but the boat , and she nearly  it off the fork
But she doesn't
her load around now
Heading for the open hatchway, the roiling sea racing by
Picking up , slightly
Uh
Thing on the left is the brakes
(laconic) Or the thing on the right
By now she is really  toward the wide open spaces

at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding  the prongs, our forklift   the hatch to the sea, just as Mac
Gin by her , pulling her  of the falling forklift,  the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, Gin in fright and pain,  grabbing his arm to be
jerked  to safety
Clutching Mac, she watches the sea behind them
Where the crate and the forklift disappeared
You did activate the floaters
Her head  around
Aghast
Activa
did say, 'Finish up on the floaters'
Surely, you heard me
Her life
Flashes before her eyes
As behind the ship
the crate  to the surface
We can see the tiny red light on the transponder from here
(softly) Oh
Guess  did it m'self
She  back, and starts  at him with her fists
He is laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can  her wrists
She  in his face
He strikes back by
kissing her hard
She struggles for a beat
And then she lets him
When they finish, he reaches to  her jumping suit
All the way
Pulls it down gently, revealing
her evening gown
wrinkle-free material which slips down across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips
He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his own
He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only
her evening bag and shoes
Then lifting both packs, he
Um
them into the black ocean
Gone
wouldn't do that
So he turns
She looks really stunned
And scared
Excuse me
Well
saw our suction things
Lying
over
there
She points
To where no suction things are lying
(a mouse) so  put 'em in my pack
His eyes
Or maybe
put 'em there
And points
To where they are
She tilts her head
Gives him a great smile
Is he enraged
His dry grin says, not hardly
like a quick study
Then again
You can never tell
- Expansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars
silver-haired couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge
She clings to his arm, it is romantic
Until they reach the railing where he turns, and says something quietly in German
She stiffens
Pulls her arm away from his
She sneers coldly, calls him a name in German, and he  on her, a barrage of German-language  that would melt a tank
She absorbs the abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail,  and
over the side
Strides away from him
He watches her go
Then
over the side himself
And follows her
Half a beat
Mac's head  above the rail
Just where they spit
Not a mark on him
- Our old German couple are  wonderfully in each other's arms Inspiring
a dozen really old couples dancing to the three- piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to
Gin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the surrounding geezers that they are very much in love
We  to hear their sweet murmurings
no matter how many stones we make, the diamonds are just an appetizer
(dreamily) And the meal
My contract
With DeBeers
She blinks
Hit by a ton of bricks
Oh my
Sensible folks, DeBeers
world monopoly in diamonds based on one simple principle
something's only priceless if it's scarce
He  her in a tight spin
The geriatic Germans can only watch and envy
These guys dig up all the diamonds on the planet, just to keep them out of circulation
Otherwise, you could buy 'em at the Five and Dime
Watch the old guy stuff, they don't have dimestores anym
Imagine the chaos we could cause
She is imagining
You said 'contract'
We're sort of bounty hunters
Gin likes the ring of that
Green eyes dance with delight
Our machine is worth far more dead
Than alive
(
) Glad to see you're both alive
They look over
The officious  from this afternoon
Now in black tie
When you missed cocktails
And supper
thought of knocking on your door
Mac turns Gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile
Oh, wish you had
We love having strangers join us
Maybe later Mac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward across her bare shoulder
Promise you an interesting time
Trademark smile
Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff
You twit
- Our couple moving down the softly-lit hallway, past the burnished doors of luxury suites
Her arms wrapped around one of his, their bodies close together
well, would ask what you're doing with the rest of your life
But that's your own bloody affair, isn't it
She sighs
Yeh
Anyway, before you get too choked up on the farewell
feel owe you a confession
He glances down
Really
Really
Time has come to tell you
What business
'm actually in
He thinks about this
And then
Not here
- Mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to
the , a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail, it juts far out above a churning sea
The whipping of the wind makes it seem all the more precarious
It only looks dangerous
Holds out his hand
She hesitates
You couldn't fall off
Unless someone threw you over
Gives her the smile
She puts her hand in his, and they hop to the platform
Walk its length to the very end
He turns now, leans casually against the fragile railing
They are inches apart
More intimate
For a confession
Gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow
What business
You are actually
In
She looks up
To his eyes
Into them
Yeh
'm not an art dealer
Of course not
You're a cop
And tilts his head
Just to one side
An insurance investigator for Webber Assurance, your boss is an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've been there four years and ten months, you're quite the rising star
(evenly) Nope
His head tilts
Just a little farther
(very softly) Nope
'm a thief, Mac
Holds the look
For five years, 've used the database of every client Webber has to plan my jobs
Museums, banks, jewelers, rich people, have floor plans, alarm codes, passwords, the works
His face absolutely neutral
Unreadable
've made a fortune
It's not enough
Why n
Why wasn't it enough for you
He falls silent
The Vermeer that was stolen from Hancock Tower
That was my job
scaled the building with electromagnets, and parachuted down an air vent
No smile at her lips
Strictly business
after mailing the painting
To where we're going next, actua
(quietly) We
She looks him up and down
Yeh, we
You passed the audition
Now he smiles
First time
(a murmur) Imagine my relief
need a partner
For the biggest, smartest, job
Ever
The one you retire off of, because nothing else could ever compare with the rush
Ever
Is such a long time
This is a job that can only be done in one place, in one split-second in human history
If we miss that instant
We lose
And it's worth
Eight billion dollars
That's eight thousand million How much in shillings
You're not a real trusting guy
And  tried so hard to hide that
It's two jobs
The first steals something priceless from the National Palace Museum in Taipei
We don't keep that
We trade it in for our ticket to the show
One moment in time, you s
Midnight, July 1, 1997
Eight days from now
The moment that Hong Kong is annexed by china
And now
She has his interest
She can see that
80-20 split
Don't be so hard on yourself
It's your plan, you should take at least thirty perc
My 80, your 20
Asshole
He thinks this over
50-50
Or you can swim to Taipei
She is not impressed
Or afraid
He grins
What are you gonna do with six billion dollars that you can't do with four
Hold the record
Alone
This
He likes
So much that he leans to kiss her, with surprising tenderness
Your share is 50%
And one dollar
Her hard stare
And then, she smiles
Just barely
Still in his arms
like what you left
In the hold
You didn't even see wha
lump of coal
pair of pliers
note that said, 'Squeeze hard'
This is the most taken with her that he has ever looked
She leans up and kisses him
Whispers
Squeeze hard
,  ,  - Ugly section of an ugly town
Unmarked warehouses, alleyways teeming with food stalls
a motorcycle approach, and see
Gin driving, Mac sits behind her
Going real fast, maybe she's showing off, we  them  a blind alley, as she smoothly them into
an open
She climbs off, he doesn't
As Gin goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner, mewing softly
That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's my bud
An evil streak a mile wide
The elevator  to life
No surprise
They  upward
Mac seems utterly relaxed
Gin paces a little, hugging herself
Her features tense
(gently) Tired
She blinks up
He is straddling the bike
Smiling at her
have a lot on my mind
Ah
Well
You look beautiful doing it
He seems to mean that
And it seems to melt her a little
She sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as
they  to a stop
She  the heavy , and the door noisily open, to reveal
a gigantic
She flicks on a dim light, but we see only part of the cavernous space
She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting along behind
Mac follows, looking around, then down to see
a pile of , cables, packages
The unopened   we saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse
He crouches, lifts the tube in his hands
(
) You wanna buy a Vermeer
Rather steal it
(
) Been there, done that
He nods to himself
Guess so
He rises to see her framed against the gaping starlit opening of a huge
The twinkling island lies below
But here, Gin stares down at
an elaborate architectural
Fifteen feet across, it features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed , built into the side of a model
Formal gardens, fountains, tiny Kuomintang flags
Stretching away from the building, a large portion of the , with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed
As Mac joins her
National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan
Repository of four thousand years of Chinese culture
He bends to lift  the detachable roof
All the rooms are detailed within, down to exhibit cases
Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx, pots and scrolls, paintings and porcelains and lacquer work
Every treasure the Kuomintang could loot before the Reds took over
(beat) Ever rob the place
No
If memory serves
She takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway, walking straight toward it
You need to eat something, or are you ready for sex
And just at the edge of it
(torn) The options seem so limited
They jump  the opening
And
Our  closes on the doorway, to see  now, sitting like a jewel against the hillside
the   , looking exactly like the model
The town spread out beyond
Just as in the model
And now we sharply  to see
a loading , suspended above the island, only a few feet below our opening
Like a balcony without a railing
Mac and Gin already sinking down onto a waiting futon
Looks like he's made his pick
Among limited options
- on the   in early light
Propped against it, the unrolled Vermeer
Pinned to the painting, a note we can't read
In the
,  what sounds like the rattling of a  , which runs a short distance and
We   now, to see
through the sunlit opening of the loading door
Mac's head , peeking up over the lip
Ginny
in another brief subway rumble
He lightly  up through the doorway
Looks around, no Gin
Goes to the model
Lifts the note pinned to the Vermeer
(reads) This lovely parting gift can be yours
If the price is right
Stumped
Not in his cultural database
He looks at the model, to see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been lifted away, revealing
an underground   between the two
Mac examines the tiny train, the tracks, the winding route
From the side walls, well above the tracks, huge   open onto the tunnel
Starting at the museum end, they are labeled  #1, and so on
There are five
The last one shortly before
the mountain
Where a cavernous opening is labeled
Tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot at the oncoming train
And as Mac studies this curiously
the nearby   the walls once more
Sounds like it's in the room, somehow
Mac rises
Saunters across the loft, and we see for the first time the enormity of this space
Suddenly, the floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto
a spacious , outfitted with 150 feet of  , at the far end of which sits a full-sited  , exactly like the one in the model
And just below us
Gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen feet above the track
She holds a remote control device, which she uses to  the train's engine, far down the line
She looks really tense
Good morning
She startles slightly
Shuts  the train's engine
As she looks up to him now, the silence is noticeable
He crouches down, only a foot or so above her
Quite a parting gift
would have settled for roses
It's a joke
You know, a joke
People who have a sense of humor make them
He's clueless
But smiling
You're rich, go buy an American, have him fill you in on the culture
Ah
American culture
Well, that is a joke
He leans down
Strokes her hair very gently
(murmurs) Relax
It's only eight billion dollars
She looks up into his eyes
But she can't smile
(softly) Your Vermeer
like this View Of Delft better than the larger one
The sky is more emotionally rendered
Staring in his eyes
And just as softly back
Nice
When a sky is that
He holds the look
Very strong and very gentle
Is it easier now
Not pretending
Is it
Not pretending you're an innocent
Not pretending you
like me
No answer
Effortlessly, he hops down to join her
Never losing eye contact
Here's a tip from an old-timer
Never forget who you are
Settles next to her
Bodies touching
It gives you someone to be
When you stop pretending
Okay
She nods, slowly
Her eyes moving over his face
Maybe more feelings going through her than she can sort out
(still soft) So
Our train runs from the museum, through an underground tunnel
To a mountain
Because the museum displays 10,000 relics at any given moment
But there are 60 times that many, stored in the mountain
This overwhelms
Even Mac
Which is why it's guarded
By an army
She is unfastening the small pack at her feet
The train shuttles relics to and from storage
It looks exactly like that
So Mac looks down the line
At the train car
've been down the air ducts four times
The train always has two armed guards
Always travels between 32 and 36 miles per hour
Relics don't like to be jostled too much
(all business now) Your model has five vents
We go down the first
Back up the third, if you're lucky
If not, we have to get out by the fourth
(simply) Then we will
She pulls from the pack four thick , each about eight inches in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop
She starts to put two of them on
Electromagnets, incredibly powerful
This switch is on-off
He gestures at the train, the track, the hangar
Seems like overkill
For one simple jump
Well, it's an eight billion dollar jump
You miss the train
you've missed the train
Flicks  her remote
Down the track the engine
Like crazy
We've got five days to grab the Bones, trade them for the Scan, and pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong
Once midnight passes on July 1st
we've missed the train, yeh
The Bones
The Scan
Oh
Have  neglected to fill in the details
An oversight
Which  learned from the master
Hey
Wish me luck
the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36  never seemed so fast
She has a split-second to  down, the train  beneath her, Gin's feet  the back end of the platform at the rear of the car, she   with the magnets, can't connect, and is  into a  along the side of the tracks
She's  on her knees, watching the train  into the massive blue  at the end of the track
She is bruised, shaken, but most of all, really worried and really pissed
(quietly) Jump sooner
She pulls out the remote
Be my fucking guest
The train  backward, straight  where she kneels, to at the start of the track once more
She nods up to Mac, who is strapping on his magnets
He crouches, nods, ready
And the train
toward him, he counts, , and   the  of the train, which  into the heavy padding,  him twenty feet like a rag doll to land in a
He lies still
Then blinks, surprised he's alive
a rich whiskey  down the track
'm too old for this shit
And as he pulls himself up
She is staring at him, from her knees
Know a dude named Wiley Coyote
with what can only be described as love
(softly) Forget it
,  - down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the , the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges
She is first
Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing endless legs
She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction
She takes his arm for support
Murmurs in his ear
Isn't it easier now
Not pretending
Gives him a full-tongue  in the ear, which has bystanders noticing
Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering close
Five years, you won't need make-up
In answer he  her ass, and she  with delight, attract- ing attention all around
His turn to whisper, as he massages her backside
We agreed
No underwear
Overkill
can do it with legs
He stops
Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over
'd lose the underwear
- Mac leaning on her arm, as they pass case after case
Bronzes, jades, lacquer work
Every object exquisite, priceless
The Oracle Bones date back to the Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago
They are writings
carved into ox bones, tortoise shells
She cuddles close to him
They approach a tour group, the female guide speaking in four European languages
Really loud
The oldest Chinese writing any- where, the first proof of Chinese civilization
What makes this one so valuable
He stops, drowned out by the tour guide, rhapsodizing over an urn
Butts into her rap
(subtitled Italian) Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking Sung Period
The color is far too delicate
The woman gets real insulted
Apparently, he's right
(subtitled German) It's all right, you have a nice body
And walks on
Confides to Gin
When you're old, you can do anything her bottom once more, altering her voice slightly on
There we are
separate display room
single steel pedestal
Under the smart-glass security case, one single object
It is a fragile, yellowed fragment of bone
The shoulder blade of an ox
Covered with tiny script
Last year, ancient artifacts were discovered in the Gulf of Mexico
An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old
No tourists in the display room
velvet rope is up
Three mill at the entrance
This exhibit is off-limits
Amazingly, markings on these Olmec figures were identified as Shang Dynasty writing
sign explains, This particular Bone is price- less, because it is the one that establishes the link Proves that American civilizations descend from Chinese ancestors
She is pulling out her coin purse, as they stand by the rope
Unzipping it slowly
Exactly the kind of propaganda shit they eat up in Beijing
The mainland would pay anything to get its paws on th
As her shaking 'elderly' companion , knocking the purse of her hand, it  to the floor, sending a hundred coins in all directions
Some under the rope
(old guy voice) And collapses to the hardwood floor in search of the coins, as he  his knees
Some bystanders hurry to help
And one of the guards
As Mac tries to crawl under the rope to pursue coins
the guard  him with a firm hand, pointing at the pidgen- English sign
Meanwhile, calmly, very slowly
Gin crouches down to retrieve coins, the short skirt riding recklessly high on her upper thighs
The two remaining guards hurry to help her
Mac's guard, bystanders, all transfixed by the marginal preservation of her modesty
Noticing the eye-lines all around, she confides to the nearest guard
(in Mandarin, helpful) Those are the coins
These are my legs
Unnoticed, Mac is  his wristwatch, which seems to have broken
on him now, manipulating a glide point  on the side of the watch, and we   to see
one coin
Inside the rope
Move
As Mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere, he guides the coin's slide slowly, inexorably, to
itself magnetically
To the steel pedestal
Beneath the Bone's case
As it does, Mac's watch  slightly, as we on it to see
flickering across its face
(old guy voice) Amanda
Time for my pills
,  - Gin and Mac at a long communal table, ignored, by Taiwanese couples, families, businessmen, chattering loudly all around them
Gin looking down at her bowl, she's barely touched her meal
no,  don't think that way
Glances up
Mac is eating heartily, happily
and  suppose you do
Get lonely
Sure, all the time
It's healthy
Stuffs his mouth full
Talking around it
What's unhealthy
Is denial
She's studying him as he eats
Since he's not looking at her, Gin's eyes are thoughtful, appraising
Be real
you could never see yourself
you know, quitting the game
Settling
down
And he looks up
Direct to her eyes
dead straight, heart- stopping look
Before the wonderful smile
Why, Ginger
This is so sudden
She cuts him a hard look
Not funny
- Late afternoon, the place has closed
Four armed , accompanied by a museum , push a large  across the hardwood floor, heels clicking, wheels rumbling softly, into
the room we've seen
The dolly stops by the display case of the priceless oracle Bone
The four guards position themselves around the triple-paned bulletproof case
It will be a bitch to lift
The official has a key
He inserts this into the lock of the titanium frame which holds the case to the steel pedestal
And as it , we

train car stands, pulled up to a loading dock
Two  with assault rifles on the train's rear platform, waiting
Along one side of the tracks, a gravel roadway
An open air Jeep-type military vehicle stands empty
One of our soldiers speaks into a walkie-talkie, watching a huge steel  at the entrance to the loading dock, which

Through it come the four armed museum guards, surrounding the dolly which carries the Bone's massive bulletproof display case
The official is with them, and hands paperwork to one of the waiting soldiers, as the museum guards  the case, and carry it onto the train

Touches her face
Try to adjust to that for three more days
After July 1
Stares in her eyes
you'll never have to trust again
And smiles
One more whisper
Something
To look forward to
The museum guards are back on the landing with the official
Our two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train car, as
The train  to life
Ready to go
Two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case
One tilts the top of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to lift the base, and
stops
He sees the coin
Oddly flat against the pedestal's shaft
He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet  it fast
He looks up to his companion

Climbing from the car, Mac has the Halliburton case

His voice is strong, calm
No hint of a smile

Colonel Col
Qiu glances up from his meal
Green  uniform, absurdly decorated, wraparound Gautier sunglasses
We recognize him as the man who took Gin's call in his Mercedes in Tienanmen Square
The man who accompanied the poor Minister of Finance to the ophthal- mologist
You look lovely, Ginger
Is the rose for me
Of course
And leans prettily
To fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel
Col
Qiu Lai Chuen, this is Andrew MacDougal
Hearing his real name, Mac cuts her a look
Real names here, darling
The Colonel and  have every incentive to keep each other's secrets
And she sits
Close to Qiu
Mac looks around at the property, the view
Like the place, Andy
Please
Mr
MacDougal will do
The Colonel smiles
First time
Like an alligator
Mac notices that the tablecloth is actually
a Union Jack
He fingers the flag
This way
Doesn't matter if we spill
My sentiments exactly
He sits
This place was a gift
From its former owner
Brit whose business will now happily continue to function
Perhaps
even expand
(spreading his napkin) Planning to spend much time here
Tho it has required many sacrifices
The Colonel has divorced his wife
To facilitate the necessary entertaining of Western women
Tho some are more entertaining than others
And runs the back of his knuckles up the length of Gin's bare arm
Colonel
You are touching the woman love
Which brings Qiu's eyes over
Really
From time to time
And pulls up the Halliburton case
Handing it across the table
As Qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it
You're a Scot
Would you like some 25-year-old Macallan
Sure, 'll take a case
Qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the bar trolley
As the drinks are prepared, the Colonel studies the Bone
The Colonel told his Minister of Culture that he could mount a surgical raid to liberate this treasure from Taiwan
Ah
How much was the Minister told the raid would cost

All in
Which you can now keep

He would have paid twice that

Unlike
The woman you love
From time to time
Drops it into Gin's lap
She opens the pouch to reveal
goggles
Like one would wear in a tanning salon
Only these are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens
Slightly larger than the size of a pupil
She slips them on
bright smile
How do  look, honey
And Mac smiles
In return
Like a woman
Of mystery
,   - Glass doors open  to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond
More lights than stars in heaven
And speaking of heaven
the  of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm, part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us lovemaking in silhouette
This is the lovemaking of tigers, mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and somehow
tender enough
To suggest real love
Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace
There is wine and food and abandoned clothing all around them
She has her pack drawn near
And Qiu's leather pouch
She removes the goggles
This is the moment
In the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building
Is a room with two computers
One for you
And one for me
Glad  have a function, here
The room is a vault on the 14th floor
Access codes to that room are changed daily, computer pass- words on the hour, but But
She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her
Four men in the world Don't need codes
Their retinas will scan to unlock everything
One of these is China's Minister of Finance
She lifts the goggles
And his retinal plate is in there
Yep
Our trade for the great train robbery
All right, let's say we're in the door
Now what
From her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle
Opens it to reveal a shiny metallic
Hong Kong has a huge portion of its holdings invested in foreign banks
In hundreds of separate accounts
Holds up the metallic disc
This   is programmed to send, instantaneously, thousands of instruc- tions, with all necessary confirmation codes, to transfer reasonably modest sums out of those accounts
Modest
Two or three million at a crack, in odd numbers
Total, eight billion
And change
And you've set up a laundry
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches, Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel Islands, the Caymans
(quietly) Seychelles
(beat) left that out
You're forgiven
Thank you
As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else, til the Mafia couldn't find it
But those first instructions, transferring the 8 billion dollars
They're recorded in the main computer
She waggles the disc
Nope
The  instructs the computer to erase the real transactions
And replace them in its memory with an innocuous loan coded XJ6
Little homage to Limeyland, there
Dearest
The accounts won't reconcile
She waggles the disc
Again
Wrong
The  instructs the computer to over-report all account totals forever, in the exact amounts we've lifted
So the Chinese think the money's still there
On this one
He has to smile
The money
Is still
Missing
Sure, the foreign banks know they sent out some money
But they think Hong Kong knows it, too
And since we're leaving plenty in every account
The shit doesn't splatter
Until the first account runs dry
Exactly
And then Comes the really brilliant part of the whole thing
was hoping there'd be one
He settles back
Looks at her
Admit it, so far you're blown away
Well
It does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship
And his fingers reach out
Pity it will be over
In 21 hours
Touch her hair
Her face
She swallows
raw moment hoarse
Bet you say that
To all the one-night-stands
But he's just staring in her eyes
The look pins her
She can't wriggle off
murmured
No, ma'am
He leans to her
Only the best of them
They kiss

The square is beyond
Times Square looks deserted New Year's Eve compared to this carnival  of humanity, rock and rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise
Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere, firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless, going absolutely nuts
Who knows
Could be the last party
Ever

Mac presents an invitation to a soldier, who admits them into
, a  party going full blast in the lobby of this truly breathtaking structure
central  rises 47 floors, creating a soaring clear core, around which the offices and working spaces are ringed
The view straight up is interrupted only at three well-spaced levels, where thick  of glass, stitched together with spidery skeletons of steel,  the open core
Mac looks up
at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium, the revelers have been granted access to the lower five floors
Above these, all is empty
Nice of the Colonel to provide an invitation
She is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors d'oeuvre stations
Half the celebrants seem to be armed  soldiers, many with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders
Well,  promised him a bonus
Five million
Comes out of your share
long as  don't have to have sex with him
Mac loads up on six hors d'oeuvres, piling them on a napkin, as she takes two flutes of champagne
They step away from the mob toward a potted plant near the wall, and Mac
drops his snacks with a
Shit
Bending to clean the mess, he slips from his waistband a flat   with a bank logo and a three-pronged plug
In a single motion, he plugs it  a socket concealed by the pot, scoops up his canapes, and we
Three   blink, as   monitor screens go at once
The images compressed to a blur of lines between a series of diagonal   that slash across the screens
The way your  acts when the horizontal hold goes out
They can't believe it
Stumped, they start slamming buttons, flipping switches, jabbering to each other
Now the images begin to  vertically, as if in response to their attempts at adjustment
Welcome to the world of high tech
Mac and Gin wait with a party of older Brits, who've had plenty to drink and are carrying more
Two armed soldiers flank the elevators
car arrives
As the Brits enter
(politely) We'll take the next one
Waiting, calmly
Mac smiles at a soldier
(subtitled Mandarin) What time tomorrow do the tanks roll in
The guy
An elevator arrives
Gin sipping champagne as they enter
The doors
They are alone
The panel has floors 1 through 5 lit
The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark
There are numbers 11-15
Mac pulls from his pocket a small flat , not much thicker than a credit card, with a window and a series of  lights on its face
He fits it into a  beside a black glass on the elevator panel
Immediately, the LEDs scramble, all , numbers  across the card's window, as the device begins to lock on the elevator code
In sequence, the LEDs turn , and
the glass plate , announcing in Kanji and English 11, 12, 14, 15
Mac presses the lit number 14
The elevator
He looks over at her
She is tight enough to snap
We can feel her heart racing from here
So all that time, sitting at your computers
All the research, the access codes your job allowed you to steal, floor plans, schematics
setting up all your bank accounts
She looks irritated
He is smiling, gently
Years of work, comes down to
(checks his watch) six minutes
Don't be nervous
Easy come, easy go
She looks away
The elevator stops
Your share prob'ly works out to, what
Dollar and a quarter an hour
Me laughs
The door opens
She is pissed off
What's your point
(very real) That  like you, Ginger
Now they're staring at each other
An open elevator door
An empty dim hallway
They see only each other
The dedication, the skill, the guts
He holds out the crook of his arm
As a gentleman escorts a lady
'm going to see you get everything you deserve
Her eyes flicker on that
So he grins
Woman
If you can't have fun, right now
You're in the wrong business
She looks in his eyes
Her body seems to relax, just a little
She takes his arm
14TH on a
Next to it, a mirrored  with two , set apart the distance of human eyes
Gin's goggled face  into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface
She fits her eyes to the apertures

Tracks vertically
Tracks horizontally
And from somewhere
a soft
now, to see
They stand at what seems the door to a
Round, gigantic, heavy steel
Bolts eyerywhere
Mac reaches to the handle, and
The door swings
They stare at the inner sanctum
a windowless
Dim, eerie fluorescence
blast of white noise from the elaborate air-cooling system
Two large face each other from opposite walls, desks and work stations with  monitors filling the space between
As Mac closes the vault door behind them
Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe
Pulls the high- resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm
The screensaver displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish
She hits a key
The screen saver replaced by, Two boxes for  and
She hits plastic shield , revealing
the mirrored , the tiny
Gin leans to fit her goggled eyes in place
The red scanning light
Vertical track
Horizontal track
And the monitor announces Gin takes off the goggles, and
them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe
As he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious - into her mainframe's driver
Watches the screen
Uploading
And you've got
two minutes, fifty seconds
Mac now
Typing the words
The screen now shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a in the center of the screen, labeled  , and reading 11:57:19, changing with each second that passes
So let's see
Across town at the British Consulate
frenzied activity in a large war room filled with computers, wall screens, every worker functioning at top speed
to hear Mac over this
(
) everyone is working frantically to complete transactions before they go off-line at midnight
to Mac in the vault
He clicks his mouse to create a clock at the  of the screen, labeled
It is, of course, showing the same time as the local clock
then, deep in the high-tech bowels of the Bank of China Building, just across the square
an even larger war room, even better staffed and equipped
Everyone
doing
nothing
Staring at blank monitors and wall screens
(
) the Chinese are sitting on their thumbs, waiting to come on-line at midnight
to Mac in the vault
He clicks his mouse to create another clock at the  of the screen, labeled Shows the same time as the other clocks
11:58:22
feel for these boys
Let's give them a breather, hmmn
the mouse, and the    begins
We'll let the Brits go off-line 4 seconds early
As the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and Mac  the key four times, advancing the British clock to 34 seconds, four seconds later than the others
And we'll give our new Chinese overlords 4 extra seconds of rest before they have to go on-line
As the local and Chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, Mac  the key four times, regressing the Chinese clock back to 36 seconds
We watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of British rule
The British clock is 4 seconds , the Chinese clock 4 seconds
Playing God here, Ginger
We've created 8 seconds that do not exist, anywhere but in this room
11:59:00
One minute to midnight
8 seconds, where no one is on-line but your little -Rom
He turns around
Her eyes are waiting
Across the room
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about
China will think it happened before midnight
Britain will swear it happened after midnight
They'll each be positive
The other guy
Did it
Mac sighs
This is a sad thing
Liable to be an ugly international incident
She squints across at his clock
Britain off-line in 18 seconds
We're bulletproof
His smile returns
Bittersweet and real
Baby girl
Nothing
Is bulletproof
Ever
The look holds
He turns back to his screen
She lingers on him for an instant
Then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above her  key
Britain goes bye-bye in 6

The British Consulate
All screens go

Except at China Bank

Her screen flashes  XJ6 , hear her  of ecstasy, as we
Bank of China where dark screens suddenly  with the same stupid
Only nobody cheers
They just get to work
the vault
Feel like a nightcap
But across the way, Gin is  a button
Again
Again
The  won't come out of the driver
Houston
We have a problem
Relax, don't jam it
(jamming it) He crosses the room
She's rummaging on a nearby desk, finds a Don't panic, now, there's no rush
We can't leave it  , it's got all our accounts , everything that can  us to a goddam She's fitting the letter opener  the narrow slot above the lid of the driver
Easy with that, there's no ru
Every  in the skyscraper is , lights are  , Gin's screen says in a selection of languages
Gin just staring at it
There's a rush
The sirens are -
We know that elsewhere in this building, all hell must be breaking loose
Gin is  Mac's arm out of the socket
'  , The disc
Is still in there
Yeh
She stares at it
Really scared
We can't help it, we
we've gotta
He stares at her
In one motion, he  a stapler from the desk and  the driver with all his strength
It pops open
Calmly, he plucks her  from the tray
She mouths a barely audible
What a guy
But just as she's about to bolt
he holds up one hand
Slips another  from his pocket
We see the words
Was wondering where to leave this
Pops it  the drive
it shut
(quietly) Time to go
Mac and Gin  full tilt through the siren , turning a corner to see ahead
the balcony railing, the building's empty central
Mac straight  it, Gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding, they reach the railing, looking  to see
Hysteria, unimaginable chaos
Soldiers, black-tie partygoers, in all directions, looking to his left Mac sees
the bank of , soldiers  in, some cars already , fourth floor, fifth
Now he looks directly , where
soldiers are  up the metal service staircase, the front rank almost at the third floor
In the lobby, some faces look up to see us, but no one is shooting
They don't know we're the bad guys
He  his hand into her shoulder bag
Time they find out
Pulls  two  , and  one toward the elevator cables three floors down and it
in a horrifying , causing  in the lobby below, the elevator cables  , cars , the yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below, and Mac  the second grenade
and the fireball   the staircase, a huge section of ninth floor landing  down on the lobby
Okay
How do we get down
Down
never liked down
Grabs her hand and they  to the staircase, as smoke everywhere below
they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest glass-and-spiderweb-steel  is three floors above us, the cacophany of  below is like an amplified insane asylum
He is dragging her now, up, up,  are flying blind through the smoke,  up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and as the smoke at last clears, they have reached
the canopy floor
They can see the army down below
Clutching her hand, Mac leads her  the railing,  the canopy itself, and together they
straight  the heavy glass toward the far side of the building, like space-walking above the throng 150 feet below, now  their path from beneath,   the underside of the bulletproof canopy, Gin  with fright as they go
We see ahead
three   beginning to climb the far wall
These are glass-enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car in the lead already at the tenth floor
Mac keeps running straight them
(out of breath) '
(not) They make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two floors below them
We can see the soldiers through the glass
Mac her hand, and as the car nears our level
You can do this
They  across five feet of open air to
squarely on the car's metal roof, Mac  his free arm the cable, and  we go
The ant colony below us receding fast
Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified
Mac is looking up toward the roof
Okay, now what
(absently) Shut up
You're on a 'need-to- know' basis
Mac, 'm sorry
He looks at her
Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid
Turns out, 'm a screw-up
He doesn't smile
Passing the third canopy
Well
Something to be said for being self-aware
Looks back up
Forty-first floor
Six to go
May  have the last grenade, dear
It's about to rain
She blinks
Huh
So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the grenade, and  it
up
The roof above them  in a , and her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge of roof comes  down
We watch as it
through the upper canopy,  of roof and glass to
through the middle canopy, everyone below  for shelter, as the whole shebang
through the lowest canopy
Gin can only  at the incredible display
Mouthing a silent
They've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor
Still climbing
The other two elevators maybe five floors below us
You see, banking will be more democratic under China
She looks to him
Well
No more glass ceiling
The elevator car has
We are at the roof
The soldiers are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out
Above our heads
the last few feet of elevator cable
And starry sky, where our patch of roof used to be
How refreshing
The night air
He begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable
At the top, he reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof, it,  with his free hand, and
47 floors, he pulls himself , swings  the roof
Reaches back down
She is only twelve feet below him
Frozen with fear
can't do this
You can
If  say so
She stares up at his eyes
He smiles
If you stay
You'll have to pay for the damage
She looks down at the mess below
And starts to climb the cable
Not so easy in a ball gown, but the adrenaline is pumping
Gets to the top
Here's the hard part
One hand reaches out
his
She lets
And she is  in space
Now that split
Did we say 60-40
And with all his strength, hauls her up onto
the roof
Two-thirds of it remain
At the far edge, a gigantic , itself two stories high
But between here and the crane
a
Big and beautifUl and empty
She looks like she's seen God
Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow but sees him go
straight  the chopper
He turns back
She points to the copter
It's over here
Got the keys
Oh
thought you could
hot-wire stuff
Guess not
They fix those things so you can't steal them
And keeps walking
Toward the monster
These, they're not so worried
Moving fast, he points off to his right
Her eyes follow a long , leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof, attaching by a huge  to a massive
Go grab that hook
He reaches the crane's cab
Turns back to see she hasn't moved
Let me rephrase that
Run and grab that hook
Or die Got it
She takes off running
He hops  the cab
the start button
It rumbles to life
Tests some levers
(
) ' He turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six feet in the
She clings to the hook with a true death grip
He lowers her ball to the roof
Getting the hang of it
This only works if you shut your eyes
Which makes her eyes
You're not gonna lower me over the side
Of course not
Now close baby eyes
(she won't) Suit yourself
He  a lever and the crane's arm begins to  in a circle, finally taking the ball  it, and as she , Mac
out of the cab,  along the edge of the roof, toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical Gin in a widening , but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the edge, and  as it does, he
aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around her, and they go
the side,   in a gigantic, every-increasing , as the endless steel cable  from its huge drum like a fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale
The ride no theme park could insure,  out  the skyline,  like an anvil, as the cable  hundreds of feet, nothing but  for miles below them, Gin grabbing a breath to  her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless instant
Let go
He  her loose, and they drop
four feet
The ball   lnto space to some unknown mayhem
Clutching Mac, Gin looks  down to the street, and realizes they are standing on
a rooftop
Quiet, safe
Alone
Planning
She  around,  death at his eyes
And dumb luck
She  in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm, sobbing
God,  hate you
He holds her tenderly
Kisses the top of her head
(softly) Good
hate you, too
- Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all across her shoulder
Very early, even the busiest street in the world is less than that at this hour
Up ahead
Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag, leaning casually against a pole
Talking into a cellular
As she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear his conversation
(into phone) if  can't have my usual suite, 'll take my business to the Bristol, simple as that
He sees her now
Smiles small
(into phone) why indeed should  be more loyal to you than you've been to me
Think it over
the phone shut
You ran your calls
She did
She is frankly exhilarated
All the transactions, all the transfers
It's a miracle
Why
The  erased the trans- actions, all accounts seem in order
It looks like the thieves were stopped in time
She sighs
It is a miracle
The Colonel says police have nothing
man in black-tie, a blonde in a gown
The elevator guards saw faces, but no mug shots to
think it's over
Mac's smile
Bittersweet affection
Except it never is, really
Quite
Over
She smiles
It is easy, but dazzling
Atypically soft
Well, one hopes not
The Bristol, huh
In
Paris
Ah
You're not going back to Mr
Cruz, and the nine-to-five
Not hardly
've arranged to be killed in a car crash
On Taipei
Amazing how little it costs
Well
You want to watch those pennies
She takes a breath
Scared, in an excited way
could arrange for two
In that crash
His smile back
He looks at his watch
Takes her hand
Leads her to the subway steps
You know, for a bitch
You can be awfully sweet
Woman of mystery
What do you say
like the Bristol, just fine
mean, it's not the Ritz
You know, all night 've been wrestling with something
Not the most flattering way to put it
He takes his big tourist shopping bag
Puts it in her hand
've changed your travel plans
They are descending now
Into the vast underground train station
Mine
Instead of taking the subway to the airport, you change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong
Got that
Got that
Jordan is only 90 seconds up the line
Like a wire transfer, you're gone
Vanished
He holds up a silencing finger
Listen to me
In this bag are passports, tickets, papers
An amber wig, a good one
dress you can slip on in five seconds
Her eyes moving over his face
What is this
You're on a tight connection to the Trans-Siberian Express, be in Europe in a week
Mac, wh
Shhh
You always talk too much
They're at the booth
He pays their fare
Through the turnstiles, now
Time has come to return the favor
One last time
Smiles at her
As they enter a tunnel
Tell you
What business
'm actually in
And in an instant of blind panicked clarity
She gets the whole thing
(hushed) My God
You're a cop
(very softly) That's my girl
Keep walking
People are everywhere
But they are alone in the world
See, my profession was cover, too
notorious thief has access to colleagues, their plans
He sighs
've turned in
well, couple hundred
over forty years
Scotland Yard, Interpol,
Looking around the tunnel
Thought  might retire
After you
And all the
microchips, the diamond machine
Well, the chips were returned
The machine was just a box, did you actually think it was real
Glances at her
thought
everything was real
Stupid girl
End of the tunnel in sight now
It leads to a massive, endless quai
Trains in transit
Those were your jobs, so  could have claimed entrapment
You had to wait
For mine
Nearly there
He says nothing
Looks pretty grim
The Oracle Bone
Well, the State Department liked that one
They have more fish to fry with Beijing than Taiwan
He sighs
So they're taking credit for letting it go through
Tho 'm afraid your Colonel may be in for a career disappointment
She stops walking
She has to know
And the 5 billion
Ah
That
haven't told them
Gently, takes her arm
Leads her onto the endless train platform
Walking slower now
said you hadn't revealed the job
That it wouldn't take place until after the changeover
Down the platform they stroll
As her eyes wander
Don't look, they're there
Her breath catches
Her eyes go down
And my tickets
In the shopping bag
Well
Kept my options open
If give you up, they don't matter, do they
Her heart pounding through her chest
If
Had lots of crazy thoughts
One was retirement
With four billion dollars
After all,  know some places where life could be private
But you couldn't do that, huh
They've stopped
Just two travellers in a strange land
waiting for a train
Otherwise
They wouldn't be here
He nods
Smiling pleasantly
Creature of habit
suppose
We feel her adrenaline racing
Lots
Of thoughts, you s
Keep smiling
They won't move, until  raise my left arm
And so she smiles
As prettily as she can manage
thought
Well, 've got the
could contact the banks, reverse all the transactions

We  it
except maybe
Leave you with
oh, a hundred million, say
To tide you over
the train
Slowing
Pulling in
Then,  thought, nah
Not my style
With a  of metal
The train  toward us
figured
What the hell
What the hell
Let her keep the lot
The train
The doors
People come out, people go in
Pouring around them
They are alone again
The subway doors stand open
Two feet away
She looks at them
No rush
The doors won't close for 60 seconds
Sixty seconds
And still smiling
There's a pistol in the bag
Reach in slowly
Take it out fast
Point it at my temple
She freezes to stone
You can do it
If  say you can
And she
blinding , the gun straight at his head, Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we
to see
Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close
They , pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off
Two people
Alone in the universe
Step onto the car, keep the pistol trained on my face
She hesitates
Does as he says
Passengers are screaming, cringing, bolting for other cars
Our world is
His hands raised
Seems  was wrong
Gentle smile
Entrapment
Is what robbers
Do to cops, huh
Her eyes are flooding
The gun is trembling
Twenty seconds
Shoot me in the shoulder, it'll slow them down
Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy
Tears are on her cheeks
Oughta shoot you in the face
Come on, you can do it, if  sa
No way
Not anymore
She sobs
She can't stand this
Ten seconds, hold on
When do  see you
There is no answer
There are no words
The doors
She stares, training her pistol on him through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents, and the train
away
An instant to pick up speed, and it  into a tunnel
Gone
Mac stands motionless as   breaks loose around him, rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly
Still staring after the train
Airport
Changing at Mongkok Station, we can cut her off
Walkie-talkies  out
These guys are the same the world over
We begin to
She might lose the wig, be looking brunette or blonde, navy pants suit
think Yaumatei changes for the airport, and it's closer
Keep  , an   now, too high to see their faces
(
) think you're wrong, but cover it
You got maybe four minutes
still, the mob below an ant colony
(
, calmly) No problem
She's trapped
But as the crowd parts
We can make out one lone man
Staring after
What has gone
