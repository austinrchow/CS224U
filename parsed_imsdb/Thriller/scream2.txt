, whizzing by them as a chases after her
The crowd
Everyone is having fun
Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the screen just as the lights
People   in terror

Credits roll as the movie begins
The studio logo appears followed by

Phil gets in her face, playing with her
She swats him
Take it off
But
Now
He obliges
More credits
"    "  " " Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the audience
sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre
The publicity masks actually glow in the dark chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked
The movie begins
house in the middle of nowhere
Lights burn from within
Inside the house, a  , Alicia Silverstonish is taking a shower
The water cascades over her nubile body
Suddenly, a  is glimpsed through the curtain
It's all very
Now why does she have to be naked
How does that serve the plot
Sssshhh
The phone
The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook
She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone
Hello
menacing  responds
Hello
Who is this
You tell me
Maureen is not having a good time
She's already spooked

The phone rings again
Why did you hang up on me
Who is this
Maureen shifts in her seat
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police
Stupid
Shush
'm gonna pee
You want anything
He nods
Maureen stands and moves up the aisle
- Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small lobby
It is dark and shadowed
She moves down a long hallway to a staircase
"" sign with an arrow points downstairs
Maureen hits the stairs to
- small lounge leads to two bathroom doors
Very low lighting
Maureen descends the stairs, heading for the
'  - large bathroom
Five stalls line one wall
The door open
Maureen enters and shoots for a stall
- Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants
Suddenly, the bathroom door  open
Maureen listens are heard
Loud and heavy
Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door
Not much is visible
Suddenly, a  sweeps by
The footsteps stop
Maureen finishes up quickly
She flushes, throws the stall door open and rushes out to find
The stall doors are all closed
Maureen shoots for the door
She rips the door open as a  rushes her
followed by her , both perky and loud
They hurl past Maureen,  and carrying on
#l got so scared my bladder rolled
#2 You chicken shit
It's just a movie
# l No, it really happened
It's a true story
Maureen is out the door
Now thoroughly spooked
- Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a emerges from the shadows appearing behind her
, grabbing her, spinning her around
She as the Ghost starts
The mask comes off
It's Phil
You ass
'm sorry, 'm sorry but  had to
It was too easy
You are so not funny
Phil takes her in his arms
Come on, baby
Lighten up a little, will ya
get scared really easy, okay
You gotta go with it
Scary movies are great foreplay
He's sincere
He leans down and plants a kiss on her
She caves, kissing him back
Sweet and sensual
just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence
(nibbling her neck) We can still Sandra Bullock it
(nibbling back) Sandra started without us
We can stay
He kisses her again, then breaks away
Yeah
Okay
gotta whizz
Meet me upstairs
Want some popcorn
Butter
Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight
Phil turns, reaching for the bathroom door just as a
appears in his path
Phil steps back, surprised
Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife
Quick and silent
He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape strikes again
Phil goes down without a scream
: - Maureen is at the concession
at the counter hands her change and Maureen is off with soda and a tub of popcorn
- and  from the audience as the movie plays on
patio chair comes flying through a glass door
The young girl in the movie tears off running, , flying through the room
The crowd is really with the movie
Some even talk to the screen
"You dumb bitch
Get out of the house
" etc
Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat
She sits down next to
Who sits with the mask on
The reflection from the movie bouncing against it in the darkness
Give it up
She sits down, with the popcorn
How many stabs did  miss
The young girl slips out a side door, completely terrified
In her hand, she holds a portable phone
Maureen offers Phil popcorn
Why doesn't she run
Phil turns to her, bringing his finger to his masked lips,  her
The young girl runs by a window
She looks in stares back
The Figure  through the window attacking her
She fights him off, getting away, running
Everyone in the theater is
Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie
She eats her popcorn
This is so tired
She turns her attention to Phil
Hey, you
pasty face
Phil ignores her
She reaches over in the darkness putting her hand on his knee
She inches it up
The Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead
Whatsa the matter
Can't  get your ghost
The young girl is running through the yard
The Ghost Killer is right behind her, chasing her
she Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand continues to move between Phil's legs
She stares ahead,  at what's about to happen to the girl on screen
She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting knife from inside his coat jacket
Maureen's hand moves up Phil's jacket
something stops her
She feels something on her fingers
something wet
She pulls her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody fingers
Maureen stares at her hand
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife
The young girl is helpless
Maureen looks at Phil, confused
as if seeing for the first time
'
She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife
Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a that is matched by the entire audience as they at the screen
The young girl is stabbed in the heart
Maureen is helpless
The knife comes fast and furious, striking her in the stomach
She falls forward, into the aisle as
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest
drags herself, crawling across wet grass
the killer behind her
raising his knife again
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach
She's speechless, unable to
She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help
She stumbles down the aisle
Someone  "Sit down
" Maureen turns to several who begin to react
She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again
knife raised
The young girl is slashed again
The knife slices into Maureen again
then again
The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife horrifying, sickening sight
Maureen stumbles forward, her bloody body moving down to the front of the theater
Suddenly, the entire audience begins
Maureen, swaying from side to side, turns to the crowd and emits a     as
The young girl lets out an enormous that mirrors Maureen's as the killer attacks one last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever
The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce
Maureen falls back against the movie screen
very much dead
Her arms flail across the screen
smearing blood over the wide screen image of the
" 2" : - typical college dorm room
Industrial strength furniture
There's two of everything
phone stirs a   in bed, asleep under a mound of blankets and pillows
The girl starts to rise as the phone is answered
is heard
Brass and sassy
(
) Hello
uh-huh
Who is this
Well, we identify ourselves around here
No, you can't
Uh-huh
yeah, right
The girl rolls out of bed, her hair falls away to reveal her face - It's
Two years older has brought a maturity to this beautiful young woman
Her face posses a survivor's edge
Stronger and more determined, she appears to have weathered the storm
got it
She stands and moves to
Her roommate and friend
An attractive young black woman
Twenty at most
Brazen
Fun
Full of life
She hands the phone to Sidney
Knock yourself out
Hello
(silence) Hello
Hello Sidney
spits out of the phone
Deep and haunting
Sidney doesn't flinch
Yes
What's your favorite scary movie
Who is this
You tell me
Sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone
She takes a look at its display
Cory Gillis
442-8730
Silence
(') Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code 653M
The phone goes dead
(') Enjoy the movie
She hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie
Time to change numbers again
Nah
think it'll die off
It's opening weekend
Let's see how it goes
Sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie channel surfs
Various morning news programs are on their small
Snippets are heard
(from ) "
The two victims, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens
" The channel switches
is being interviewed
Attractive, sullen
Sad
(from ) Please,  just wanna be left alone
His voice stops Sidney cold
She turns to the television
He sure gives a lot of interviews for someone who wants to be left alone
Hallie hits the remote
The man's image disappears as the  goes off
Hallie turns, all smiles
Get your ass in gear
You're late
Don't forget we've got rush at the Deltas tonight
Don't wear anything you don't want trashed
Sid
Sid
Sidney turns from the television
Momentarily lost
Recovery is immediate
can't believe  let you talk me into going Greek
Sid moves to the door and throws it open at her
She  but then stops herself
It's just a costume hung from her doorframe
Preset, to scare
Another prank
Sidney rips it down, turns to Hallie, throwing the costume at her
Pumps
Nice handbag
Whaddya think
Sid is surprisingly cool
She exits out the door, leaving Hallie staring at the Ghost Mask in her hands
: -  - Sid steps outside of her dorm
The morning sun shines down as Sid breathes in, taking in the day just as #2 Sidney, did you know the victims
#1 Do you feel responsible for the murders
What murders
Microphones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged upon by journalists and  cameras
She starts to panic
#3 Do you think there will be more murders
Sidney is mortified
She pushes and shoves but there is no escape
The questions come at her like lightning
She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a , a flashy woman - all hair and teeth, thick sunglasses, moves in her way
Did you kill them last night, Sid
Has it gotten to you
Have you finally snapped
Sidney's eyes flare
Her fist starts to clench when
Someone beats her to it
fist flies out from the crowd, connecting with the flashy woman's face
She drops
Sid spins around to find
Standing, tight-fisted
Their eyes meet
quick moment
Sidney is happy to see her
The onslaught continues
Cameras flash, reporters shove
Gale moves in front of Sid, holding the crowd at bay
The reporters begin to throw questions at Gale
(to Sid) Quick, get outta here
What's going on
Just go
l'll find you later
Sid wastes no time
She takes off, running around the side of the building
She stops, takes a breath, but the reporters are on her tail
She looks up to see a
Appear, moving towards her
It slows down
' (from the vehicle) Hop on, Sid
Sid goes for it as two hands reach out to help her
One smooth move and Sidney is in the arms of
She looks at him
Her face a book of questions
What's going on, Dewey
He smiles at her
safe, warm smile
His face as cute as ever
It'll be alright
: - The security cart trots along, passing  coming and going
Dressed smartly in a campus security outfit, Dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds
Sidney rides beside him, horrified as she listens to him
Three hundred people watched
Nobody did anything
They thought it was a publicity stunt
Oh my God
How could it happen
They don't know
It was carefully planned
Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie
It's a copycat killer  knew this would happen
That fucking movie
The cart comes to a stop in front of a building
As of now, they don't see any relation
But they're checking it out
The state, Special Task Force, - they're all here
They'll find the guy
Yeah, right
Look, Sid, why don't you take off
Disappear for a few days
'll come with you
No
will not crawl under a rock
This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time
'll just get used to it
Dewey steps down off the security cart and helps Sid off
Nothing will happen to you promise
Sid's tough demeanor is cracking
She takes a deep breath
That's why 'm here, right
We take care of each other
'mon, 'll walk you to class
He starts off, for the first time, a severe limp is visible as his left leg drags behind him
You go, it's all stairs,  can take it from here
Don't worry
Dewey, 'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat
Just in case
No
This is nothing, Dewey
'll be okay
Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence
Sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo-brother a kiss, then takes off for the building
Dewey watches until she disappears inside, then limps back to his security cart
: - newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other newsvans and
Some are doing live remotes, others ready themselves for the next onslaught
Gale gets out of the newsvan, her cellular affixed to her ear
don't know
no one's talking
What's the studio's position
Never happen
They'd be stupid to pull the movie
With all this free press - they're gonna have huge numbers this weekend
It'll break box office records
Of course  have bumps
Gale's  can be seen behind her, in the van fussing with equipment
(') need two minutes at six o'clock
wanna do a piece on the slain kids - no sympathy shit - let's stick with the movie angle
wanna pull a clip from an old film
Gale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers
(') Hey, what was the name of that movie
The guy looks up at her
It's
Two years older but still the charming jokester
'
/
1980
Tom Hanks' first film
(') (into phone) '
Yeah, find it
Don't worry, 've got it covered
have a plan
Yeah, 'll get it
Give it a rest - said 'll get it
Later
She hangs up, turning to Randy
(') Pressure's on
You ready for this
'm there, man
No worries
got ya covered
'm so there
That's why 'm here - because 'm there
Randy holds up his camera - stoked
: - Sidney moves down a hallway
Not your typical school building
Through open doorways, film equipment is glimpsed
Editing bays and the like
She's in the Film Department
She comes upon an open door and peers in
large room, a class is in progress
She slips in quietly
- Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room
handful of   sit around on torn couches heavy in discussion
Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a whirlwind debate
is pontificating a point
Sequels are too handicapped
By definition alone, they're inferior films
Hallie sits on a couch next to , 20's, atheletic, cool and rowdy
Arms enwrapped
Bullshit generalization
Many sequels have surpassed their original
Name one
Far better than the original
Subjective
Life's subjective
much prefer Ridley Scott
The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing
making their point about
No way
rocked
"Stay away from her - you bitch
" 'll give you that one
Name another
T2
You've got a hard-on for Cameron
bigger budget does not make a better movie
one is historical
Someone screams out, "You Sarah Connor
" as the , a young artsy type, speaks up
How about
Ooooohhh
The whole room goes worship silent
All in agreement
The almighty exception
Name another
, handsome and smooth, jumps into the conversation
His name is Derek
Smarter story
Improved effects
From the back of the room, Sidney watches him
Fixated
liked
With the furry things
Everyone '
"Ewoks blow
" Lucas and his Romper Room stage
got
got it
13TH, 20
Case in point
The entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels
Really
And why do you think that is
Sequels suck
Hello
It becomes about: money and no one's interested in quality
It's more than that
Horror films are only as good as their villains
How can Freddie and Jason possibly be scary after they've been diluted through five or six sequels
What's the solution
If you were making a sequel today what would you do differently
The class stews on this
Derek turns, spotting Sidney in the back of the room
She gives a half wave
He starts for her, excusing himself
The point is -  made my point
Sequels suck
- Derek and Sidney move out into the hallway
Derek throws his arms around her protectively
How are you
You weren't in class
called as soon as  heard
skipped
Too many "That's her" looks
'm sorry, baby
What can  do'
Don't ask what you can do
No coddling
Life rolls on status quo
He looks at her with bedroom eyes
can do that
And  can also do this
He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing her passionately
She breaks away, laughing
No
But it's a failed objection
He kisses her again and they're soon devouring each other like two people in love
Right in the middle of the hallway
: - The place is a circus
The front steps of the student center have been roped off to form a platform
podium and mike have been placed center
have gathered for the press conference that is being held by the university
Reporters and cameras have been roped off to the side
On stage,  , a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to spectators
(reading from a prepared statement) "
and we feel this unfortunate isolated tragedy in no way reflects upon our fine school and we should trust that the authorities and are acting quickly to bring us answers
" Beside her stand uniformed , the local , She continues on
Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean
(
) Gale
Can  have a second
Gale spins around to find  , the flashy reporter who she decked earlier, standing in front of her
Look, 'm sorry about the face
Job hazard
Debbie Salt, stringer - Answer a few questions
Fair enough
What are you doing here
thought you had retired from field reporting
The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive
have taken notice
Suddenly, are on Gale
Well, you know 'm dear to the subject matter
And much richer as a result
Do  know you
You look familiar
took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year
Good for you
And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale Weathers is beseiged by
The questions spew forth
"Why are you here
" "Is this the work of a copycat killer
" "Have you talked to Sidney
" etc
(ever smooth) Guys, you're missing the show
And with that Gale wanders off into the crowd
The  , a smart looking guy in his 50's is fielding questions
No, we have no evidence of a serial killer
We think the killer acted deliberately and not at random
Students and concerned faculty stand
Among them are Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey
Next to them stand , 20's, black, sensible and friendly
very intelligent face
But what are they doing
He's talking but he's not saying anything
Sounds like they don't know anything
Do you think they'll cancel Hell Week
You're getting nailed - you're not getting out of it
From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls, and  stand with their All looks and attitude
Their eyes are on Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance
Have they questioned you yet, Sid
This has nothing to do with me, Joel
There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the  at any given time
can't control that
Who's hungry
have rehearsal
have to watch rehearsal
Hallie kicks him
Joel moves to Sid
gotta hit the library
Anatomy
Some of us have real majors
You gonna be okay, Sid
You're not allowed to ask that
'll stop by the Deltas tonight
Thanks, Joel
Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls, Lois and Murphy saunter over
Hello, pledges
Enjoying yourselves
Instantly, Hallie stands at attention
Sidney joins begrudgingly
Yes, sister Lois
Very much so
Thank you for asking
Good
We need your help, pledges
Are you familiar with the Deltas fundraiser
The pledges shake their heads
Suspicious
Lois withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag and passes them out
(') In our efforts to raise money for our favorite cause
this week's  kegger
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece
We've set you each at a five dollar quota
Come on, guys
Uncool
Am  getting fraternity interference, Mickey
It's okay
can peddle toilet paper
Sid, you don't have to
Sidney takes her toilet paper
No special treatment
can do this
'mon Hallie
She throws him a comforting glance
She's okay with this
She heads off with Hallie
Derek watches
How do you put up with this Greek shit
Hey, it's cool
Hallie's into it, 'm into Hallie
Gale moves through the crowd as the press conference/rally continues
She runs dead smack into
Their eyes meet
long moment
The silence between them is revealing
Hello, Dwight
Miss Weathers
've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned
'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me
He tips his hat curtly, then starts off
She stops him
The name's Gale, remember'
He turns on her
His eyes on fire
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears
see you read the book
Yes,  do retain reading skills
Shock
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question
Page 32
"Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence
"  think you've explained yourself
Oh Dewey, 'm sorry
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and - forgive me for saying - mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be
This stings Gale
You have every right to be upset
Page 41
"Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience
" never meant to imply
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation
Gale is at a loss
'm sorry
don't know what else to say except 'm sorry
No, 'm the one who's sorry misjudged you
Now if you'll excuse me,  have some oozing to do
Dewey turns and limps away, leaving Gale staring after him
Her face smashed fiat
The sheriff continues fielding questions from reporters
No, there has been no evidence that more than one killer is responsible
Sidney and Hallie have split up
They move through the crowd selling toilet paper
Several  make their purchase
Sidney pockets her change, looks up to see Gale, standing alone
She goes to her
Hello, Gale
Sidney
Hello
How are you
'm okay
magazine won't stop calling but other than that
'm sorry
Yeah, well
you are the definition of mixed emotions really should hate you
see your movie's getting good reviews
It seems to be causing a stir
What's with the toilet paper
It's hell week
'm pledging the Deltas
It's good to see you involved
My morn was a Delta
Beat
People have begun to notice the two of them talking
Reporters and spectators have slowly circled them
Gale looks around
She spots Randy, who appears behind Sid, with his camera
Gale gives him the nod
He throws the camera up, hits the light
Sid spins around, surprised to see him
(') Randy
What are you doing here
But then she sees someone else, standing off to the side
man she recognizes immediately
He looks at; her, his face sullen, broken
Sidney loses her breath
(') Cotton
He moves to her
Hello, Sidney
Gale motions to Randy
He maneuvers, getting the two of them in frame
long moment, Sidney just stares at him
Completely off guard
She looks to Randy who aims the camera directly at her
filming her
What are you doing
She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her, realizing she's been set up
She looks back to Cotton
She doesn't know what to say
She turns back to Gale
Eyes aflame
(') You
Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd
Cotton turns to Gale
His face pained
This was a mistake
shouldn't be here
He takes off, pushing through the crowd
Randy stops filming
Can you say backfire
Did you get it
Yeah,  got it
Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this
It's in his voice
You need to check your conscience at the door
We're not here to be loved
Randy's face reveals otherwise
The sheriff continues
No, we don't anticipate another murder but we are taking every precaution possible
: - small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac
Large old homes populate it
Greek signs adorn the place
Welcome to Sorority Row
/   - huge living room
Divided sensibly in several sections
Nicely done
Et is empty except for one girl who lies on the couch watching television
This is , pretty with a lively energy about her
She channel surfs while talking on the phone

Floorboards  above her
Cici freaks

She flies to the door, unlocking it, throwing it open
She moves out onto the

She stands on the porch steps, looking back, through the open door, into the house
The phone starts to
You're breaking up

The phone goes dead
Shit
Cici redials
The same static
Hello
'm calling

Cici peers through the front door, into the house
It's completely empty
Cici steps back inside the house
The connection becomes much clearer
'm calling from the Chi Omega house
Someone is harassing me
Hello
There's no one on the line
(') Shit
, Cici spins around,
' Did the phone ring
Standing before her is , a young girl, sweet, pre- occupied
Jesus, you scared me
What are you doing here

Did anyone call
Just some asshole trying to scare me
The front door remains wide open
The phone
Cici stares at it in her hand
She doesn't answer it
Are you okay
Cici nods, answering the phone
from the receiver
Hello

Taxi
Taxi
Where are you
(from phone) We're at Grogs and need a ride to Acid Rain
Who is it
Is it Tina
They're at Grogs
Dawnie grabs the phone, moving into the living room
She moves to a mirror and fusses with her hair
Tina, it's Dawnie
'm on my way
Cici follows her back into the living room
'll go
don't mind
Really
Dawnie hangs up the phone, turning to Cici
Take the next one
You should set the alarm
There's a killer on the loose
Reflected through the mirror is the foyer
Neither see as a   appears through the front door
Dawnie turns back to the mirror just as the Figure sweeps into the dark dining room and out of sight
Dawnie starts back for the front door
The phone
Dawnie grabs it
(') Hello
' Is Cici there
Who's calling
' Ted
Dawnie throws her the phone and races out the door
(') It's your ill-concieved boyfriend
Seeya later

She  the door shut behind her
second later we hear it lock
Dawnie brings the phone up to her ear
Hello
Ted
' No, it's me
Cici nearly collapses
She's starting to lose it
' Don't forget to set the alarm
Cici hangs up, throwing the phone across the room
She moves back to the foyer where an alarm panel is positioned in the wail
She hits a coupla digits and a is heard as she activates the alarm
She checks the door, making sure it's locked, then she turns and moves into the
Cici finds the light switch
The room is illuminated
Two long dining tables run the length of the room
It's empty
Void of the Figure
- large, dark kitchen
Cici moves to the frig and opens it, She gives it the once over
The frig light reflects against her face
She closes the refrigerator, not seeing the Shadow that bounces across her back
Cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the backyard
She checks the lock
Secure
Then, the phone She turns to the phone that's attached to a nearby wall
It
She reaches for it, answering it
Hello
, One finds her neck, the other grabs her by the hair, wrenching her head backwards and spinning her around, shoving her, pushing her into the
Glass explodes everywhere, shattering to bits as Cici's body crashes through it, setting off the
loud, shrill  resonants through the house as Cici's body lands on the deck outside
Still
(: ) : - Two doors down from Chi Omega
big, old Gothic home serves as the Delta Zeta sorority
from inside
It sounds like a party
- The room is filled with fifteen to twenty people
and   who  and  as they watch four girls who sit on their knees, hands behind their back, in front of a coffee table devouring plates of macaroni and cheese topped with whipped cream
Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls,  and  tear into the macaroni with all their might
Gobbling it up, making a mess of themselves
Mickey is next to Hallie, coaching her on
On Sid as she finishes her plate

(') Looks like we have a winner
Sid sits up
Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her face
She smiles the victor
Everyone
(') Sidney gets to skip the next round of Bulimia bingo
Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid
You bitch
They crack up
Someone passes her a towel
She stands wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek enters through the front door
She waves at, him
He hurries over
Where have you been'
You missed my shining moment
won the macaroni sundae binge
'm sorry honey
got behind
Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face
don't want you to choke or anything but you're trailing
You need to pick the pace up
She swats him
Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round
(complete throw away) Any news
About what
The forbidden subject
He shakes his head
Suddenly, a   pops into the room
Yo, guys, outside
Something's up at the Chi Omega
Police are everywhere
People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front door
Sidney looks to Derek
- Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into the yard as
Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with police, ambulances, reporters
"Yo - let's check it out
" "'mon
" The entire crowd takes off in droves down the street
All except for
They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes a circus
' She knows
- Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police,
the house is crawling
Dewey sifts around on his own, checking things out
Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered glass door
Lots of blood
But no body
Have you checked the
Attic, garage, basement, nothing
Take the neighborhood
The Sheriff turns to his men
Alright men, listen up
Dewey is all ears
- Derek and Sid stand on the porch, his arms around her
Her face is numb
It's starting all over again
Lemme take you home
'll get my jacket
Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door, back inside the house
Her face and mind detached from what's going on
Derek remains on the porch, watching the spectacle
Slowly, the door behind him closes
- Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat when the phone
She looks at it suspiciously
knowingly
she reaches for it
Hello
' Hello Sidney
The
Low and haunting
Sidney closes her eyes
When she opens them tears are immediate But still, she refuses to crack
Who are you
' Soon, Sidney, soon
What do you want
' To see every ounce of blood drain from your body
The Voice has never sounded more evil
more seductive
Sidney doesn't flinch
She holds steady
Then come and get me
And with that Sidney hangs up the phone,  it down
Silence
And then
' My pleasure
The Voice comes from inside the room
behind her
Sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the
But not the one from the movie theater
The one from Sidney's nightmare long ago
It stands in the foyer archway, staring at her

stand off
Sidney doesn't move
But then the killer withdraws his trademark
long, steel hunting knife
blood stained
As the   at her
She , dodging him, Derek hears her
He turns to the front door
He finds it locked
He starts to  on it
Sid
Sid
Sid just dodges the Ghost, just missing the knife's blade
She bolts through the living room, to the front door
Derek beats on it from outside
Derek
He's in the house
Help
me
She struggles with the door, there are too many locks, the Ghost is already upon her
She looks to the stairs, thinks better of it
flies through the dining room
- Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house
He moves along the porch to the windows, looking through
He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the kitchen
Derek looks about the porch
He rears his foot back and kicks in the window
- Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door
She struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind her
She barely makes it out the back door
- large, fenced in yard
Lots of big oak trees
Sid flies down the back porch and into the yard
She moves across it, passed trees and shrubs
She spots a closed fence door in the back of the yard
She looks behind her to find
She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely disappeared
She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind it
Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind the tree
The yard is completely empty
She goes for the fence door, slowly moving around the tree
noise in the darkness
She spins around, still making her way around the tree, moving backwards, walking right into a
She , spinning around, finding herself face to face with
' Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a ripped, bloody mess
Sidney She steps back, falling right into the arms of
She turns,
It's okay
It's okay
It's just me
He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she holds on for dear life
- The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly comes to life
- The local campus security office has been converted into a media event
News trucks, cameras and stand guard outside while inside
- The place is packed
No longer just a campus security office
The place has been converted to the local police station as well as  headquarters and  swarm the place
In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean Fisher
Tempers are heated
Its been a sleepless night for all
We don't know if it's random
We haven't been able to connect the victims
The first two were stabbed without thought
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision
Christ
Just do something
will not have a repeat of Gainesville
Not on my campus
Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping forward
Sidney Prescott, sir
They both turn to him
(') She's the connection
We know that, son
The killer was trying to get to her
That sorority girl was a distraction
We're aware of that
Sheriff Hartley steps forward
The killer is obviously repeating Woodsboro
can fill you in on what  know
Dewey is not a welcome participant
Eyes roll
Captain Tyler pulls Dewey aside
Look, son
know you've lived through this, but we got it under control
Why don't you have some coffee
Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The and local police fawn over her
Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming in
Of course, what can  do
Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the back, sending him off
We were hoping you could help with the killer's profile
Dewey's face couldn't be more burned
-  - chalk board in front of them
Three names are written on it under the label "Victims" - " , ,  " Gale is at the chalk board Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott
Sidney Prescott's mother
The first victim in the Woodsboro Murders
Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the first kid to be murdered
Ten to one - Cici is not the third victim's real name
It's Cassandra
Nickname Cassie or - Casey
The third victim in Woodsboro
She was hung from a tree and gutted
The room goes quiet
Dewey watches from the back of the room
His eyes burning holes into Gale
Jesus
This is a complete copycat
Your killer is even going in sequence
Captain Tyler sits up
Who was the next victim in Woodsboro
In the book or in the movie
Let's try reality
Mr
Himbry - the principal was the next victim
However, in the movie version, Tatum Riley was killed next
Dramatic license
Jesus Christ
Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action
(to his men) Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name
Tatum Riley
Dewey speaks up
His voice soft but heard
The entire room stares at him, knowingly
Gale's eyes find his
He looks away
Both on campus and the surrounding community
want names
'll get you full access
The room breaks into a fury as they jump into action
Gale stops Captain Tyler
What about Sidney
Is she safe
She's completely insulated
've got my top men on her
: '    - Sid, Derek, Hallie, Mickey, and Joel lounge among pillows and blankets
The remains of a sleepover
Joel parts the blinds
Two plains clothed policemen are in view, milling about outside - standing guard
How many guys they have on you
counted four
Hallie reads from a notebook in her hand
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas
Please,  have the perfect excuse
What about rehearsal
Gotta
'll cover you through rehearsal
Derek when do you get outta docu- drama
Two
So you'll relieve me at 2:30
And watch her til 8:00 - 've got to edit
Perfect
'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite
Guys, guys, 'm sorry but, no way
Shut up
Mickey, you and  can take her late evening
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight
Too bad
This is exactly what  don't want
think it's out of your control
Derek puts his arms around her, pulling her close
Mickey and Hallie argue about this evening
Joel moves out the door
Sid, 'll seeya tonight
But
Derek kisses her sweetly
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends
Let us decide that
What about your film
Isn't it due next week
Have you even started it
It's under control
He kisses her again
: - huge one-stop for students
Comprised of several open floors, it looks like a mini-mall
cafeteria, book store, movie theatre, arcade, etc
fill the place
Gale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie Salt heading her off
She tries to bolt but she's not fast enough
Hi, Gale, any leads
Tons and tons
Where is Sidney's father
Home - where he lives
And are the police sure about that
Why don't you ask them
Already did
He's the perfect suspect, don't you think
No,  don't
Parents are always responsible
It all starts in the home
Look,  know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win
Okay
'm not interested in the scoop anymore
Excuse me
Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand
The tabloid papers exploit what's going on
Crazy headlines about the murders dominate the newsrack
Gale is clearly bothered by this
Just then, a phone She pulls it from her pocket
(') Hello
' Hello, Gale
It's the Killer
His voice is unmistakable
Who is this
' 'll give you one guess
Gale knows immediately
She looks around for help is across the lobby
Who are you
' That's not the way we play the game
don't play games
' What if your life depended on it
Gale gets testy with him
What do you want
' You're pretty when you're angry
Gale stops cold
She looks around
The place is alive with people
He could be anywhere
Where are you
' 'm everywhere
She continues moving to the Campus Cop
Oh - a God complex ' Stay away from the cop
deadly warning
Gale stops
She plays it cool
She looks above her to the upper floor
hang over a balcony
What do you want from me
' It's what you want from me
Silence
What do you mean
' You are writing another book, aren't you
That's why you're here
The story's not over
You're getting obvious
' No, Gale, 'm just getting started
Seeya soon
No, wait
' Watch your back
The phone goes dead
Gale spins around, doing quick circle to make sure no one's around her
She turns and heads off, right into
They both
: - large tiered theatre
Seats five-hundred
Old but preserved and updated
rehearsal is in progress
stand stage center running lines as stagehands work on the set around them
Sidney is one of them
She moves around the stage, very animated
More alive than ever
She dons a Russian accent
Convincing
promising actress
(in character) "Pain, yah, such pain
Pain
" An awkward silence
Everyone looks at each other
Finally, Lois, the bitchy sorority girl speaks up
That's not the line
You jumped
Shit
Did
About a page
(off stage) Let's take five
The actors break up as Sidney, frustrated, walks across a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra pit and down the stairs into the house where Hallie sits watching
Sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting scattered about
That was good
Yeah, right
The , mid-30's, intelligent, friendly
Sid, why don't you get outta here
We'll pick this up tomorrow
Sid nods in agreement
The Director smiles at her
(') Work on the accent
She grabs her things and heads off with Hallie when
Sid
Sid turns to find Randy moving through an aisle
He had been watching rehearsal
Sid's face tenses
Who is that guy
It's okay
Look, Hallie, 'll meet you outside
No, girletta,  don't leave your side
've got my entourage
Take a break
Please
Sid is definite
Hallie backs off, heading up the aisle, against her better wishes
What do you want
'm sorry, Sid, please
never should have gone along with Gale know 'm stupid
wish  had some good reason to give you but 'm just stupid
Please, Sid, don't be mad at me
Do you work for her now
Well, yeah
she gave me a job
Freelance
It got me outta Woodsboro
'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday
It was a bad idea knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea
Ah, shit, Sid, 'm fucked up
Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing
Me, too
Randy
Me too
He nods, knowingly
(') Wanna get outta here
: - Gale and Dewey are with Captain Tyler and Sheriff Evans
If he calls again - find help
Don't engage him in conversation
'm gonna put a man on you - to cover you
can do it, Captain
Thanks, Dewey, but  was thinking 'd pull Jesse off
'd prefer Dewey, Captain
Tyler doesn't argue
He's too crazed
Dewey avoids Gale's stare
How's the name search going
37 usages of Himbry located in the registar's office
9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's
And that's just on campus
It's hopeless
: - movie is in progress
young girl, looking a lot like Tori Spelling, runs down a school corridor
She runs smack into a young, handsome boy
He could very well be Johnny Depp
(in movie) Oh, God, Billy, you scared me
What are you doing here
(in movie) They let me go, Sid,  didn't do it
'm innocent
Sid and Randy sit in the small cineplex mall type theatre
Behind them sit Sid's trusting police guards
Sidney shifts in her seat
You okay, Sid
Yeah
Tori Spelling and Johnny Depp continue their dramatic discussion
When my mom left my dad,  accepted it
That's just the way the cookie crumbles
Moms leave
Yeah, but your mom left town
She's not dead
My mom's dead
Do you hear me
She's dead
Dead
And she's never coming back
Ever, Ever
Sidney grows increasingly uneasy
: - Mickey, Joel, and Derek are crowded around a table in the Student Union Cafeteria
My documentary is due on Tuesday
What's your subject
You should of done it on Sidney
That would have been a cool
She wouldn't let me
Not with Primetime Live and 20/20 coming at her
'd save my shit too
Hallie comes waltzing up
Where's Sid
Damned if  know
She ditched me
You weren't supposed to leave her alone
didn't say she was alone
That guy - from her home town showed up
They went off together
Hallie plops down, giving Mickey a big kiss
've been waiting for you, baby
Is that cool
Just to leave her like that
She's got guards with her
What guy
Randy somebody
Randy Meeks
He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro
Her old boyfriend
No, she killed her boyfriend
Randy was a friend
Watch out, Derek
He tried to kill her first
Is Sid in therapy
She was for a while
Gave it up
How do you know so much about her
read the book
could use some therapy
Should we be worried about this guy
Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying
He seemed harmless
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless
And white
Easy black boy
It's documented
Most serial killers are attractive - slightly off white males in their twenties
That's you, honey
Hallie kisses Mickey again
got a surprise for you
What
Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins to sing at the top of his lungs
"If  should stay
would only be in your way
So 'll go
And yet, know, 'll think of you each step of the way
Don't do this
"And  will always love you  will always love you
" Everyone has taken notice
They begin to cheer and sing with him
(to Derek) Whitney
think he's doing Dolly
"And  hope life treats you kind and  hope you have all you dreamed of offffff
wish you
" Definitely Whitney
Hallie can't help but be touched
He finishes up, ending on a last, final note
As he does, he pulls a necklace from around his neck
His Greek letters dangle from it
He places them around her neck, kissing her
Isn't that a big no-no
think so
Hallie breaks away
She swats him
You're going to get it
You know what happens
But  love you
And  want the whole world to know it
Hallie smiles, her eyes misty
Derek and Joel eye each other
: - Sid and Randy continue watching the movie
The guards behind them are way engrossed
It's the end of the movie
Tori Spelling is running for her life from two killers - Johnny Depp and his sidekick
She finds herself trapped in the kitchen
Johnny Depp holds the knife up to Tori's face
Why did you kill my mother
Because she was sleeping with my dad
She's the reason my mom left
She was a whore just like you
These words sting Sid
Randy notices her flinching
My mom was no whore
Don't you say that
Whore
Whore
Whore
Whore
Tori starts to cry
Tears find their way down Sidney's cheeks
Johnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing each other
(') It's the perfect alibi, Sidney
Just like in the movies
Sidney can't take it anymore
She gets up and races out of the theatre
- Sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby
She moves into a curtained section where the water fountain is
She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the theatre
He exits outside looking for her
The cops are right behind him
Hello Sidney
Sidney spins around
Cotton Weary stands before her
shoulders slumped, his face pained
Cotton
Can we talk
don't think that's a good idea
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea
That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings
What do you want from me, Cotton
You could start with an apology
did that
You wrote me a letter
Very cordial
Very appropriate
How
What could  say that would make a difference
took away a year of your life - how do apologize for that
wish it was just a year
lost everything because of you
have nothing now
Look at me, this is what 've become
long silence
Sidney is hanging on by threads
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when 'm not reminded of what 've done
have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what  feel in every vein of my being
And  wish had in me what you need to hear but  don't think the words exist
More silence
just thought if  saw you face to face, maybe it would help
Did it
It helped me realize one thing
What
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother
And with that, Cotton flips on a dime
His face turns evil
Sidney races by him as he throws out his arm, stopping her just as
Appear, grabbing him from behind
They throw him against the wall, retaining him
Randy appears at Sid's side
You okay
Sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him
They do a body search, pulling from his coat a large revolver
Cotton just smiles
: - Sid and Randy walk up the steps to the school library
The ever helping guards behind them
don't know
don't think Cotton did it
It's too predictable
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi
guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive
'll relay it
You sure you don't wanna go home
have this button  press
See
It insulates me
She mimes an air lock valve
gotta coupla of those buttons myself
There's something sad about this exchange
These two people understand each other Thanks for the movie, Randy
Anytime
Sorry it sucked
It just had that been there done that feeling
Sidney watches as Randy shoves off, disappearing across campus
Sid turns to find Derek leaning against a pole
had the four o'clock shift
You weren't there
You had us worried
Is everything okay
No, it's not
don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid
But  know you don't trust me
It's not you, Derek
don't trust myself
tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men
Then 'll make this easy for you like you
'm crazy about you, Sid
But 'm gonna stay away
Until you say otherwise
long moment
He looks at her, hoping she'll say otherwise
'm sorry, Derek
Derek nods
So that's how it's going to be
He turns and wanders off, not looking back once
: -  - The newsvan is parked at a curb
It sits out of the way overlooking the student commons area
grassy area where students sit and conjugate
Gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to her ear
Dewey sits leans against the van, watching her
He still has a crush but hides it as best he can
(on phone) The interview's not going to happen
1 changed my mind
've harassed the girl enough
It's in poor taste and a bad idea
Your entire career is in poor taste
Gotta go, call me when you have something nice to say
Gale hangs up, she looks to Dewey
Smiles
So what made you change your mind about Sidney
Mood swing
'm manic depressive
You're a hard one to figure out
It's that complex yet shallow quality
It's deliberate
think you're all an act
And deep down 'm a good person
Make no mistake, Dewey, 'm a shit
know that
Yeah
also know that you're an aging reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner
coupla failed relationships with - 'm guessing balding, older men - have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone
But  bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled
Gale stares at him, stunned
moment as the tension swirls about them
And where did you gain all of your Gale Weather's insight
Dewey approaches her
Gale has never been more taken with him
They stand incredibly close
After my spinal cord was damaged was laid up for over a year
lot can happen when you're on your back
They're nearly touching now
Just then, Randy approaches
What'd  miss
Gale backs away from Dewey, breathless
Her cellular phone
She eyes Dewey, then hands it to Randy
'm not here
Randy takes the phone
Hello
' Gale
She's not here right now
' But she's standing right next to you
Shit
Randy motions to Gale and Dewey
It's him
He points around campus, mouthing "He's watching
" Gale grabs Dewey
'mon
(to Randy) Keep him talking
Gale and Dewey race off, across the grassy area where come and go
He holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say
So
what's your favorite scary movie
No response
Silence
' They'll never find me
Randy eyes Dewey and Gale, they move through Students, searching
What do you care
Let 'em have their fun
So, what's up
' What's your favorite scary movie
Absolutely frightening
What's yours
Wait, let me guess
Am  close
' Closer than you think
They move through passing
He has to be nearby
He likes the game
Dewey is on the his walkie
" need back-up
" He has a hard time keeping up with Gale
He hobbles along
He goes on a tirade pacing back and forth
So what's your deal
Can we talk openly for a second
How does one become a serial killer
Huh
Are you psychopathic or merely psychotic
And what is the distinguishing feature'
Were you slapped around as a child
Is it hereditary
Did your Mom take test drugs
You know, have you tried getting laid
It's done wonders for my homicidal tendencies
' Do you want to die
Gee, let me think
"Do you want to
" Is that the best you can do
Some tired hand me down rehash
Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you
No movie rights
Nothing
've been through this before and much better  might add
Gale spots a  , sitting with some other
He's talking on a cellular phone
She races to him and rips it from his hands
He leaps up ready to pounce on her
Dewey appears
It's okay
'mon, Gale
Randy won't let up
He continues dissing
And if you're such a brilliant smart killer - why copycat
Why not be original
Where's the innovation
Let's pioneer some new ground
Make a statement
Go down in history
Now you'll always be the Woodsboro copycat killer
That's lame
It's like a bad sequel
And why Woodsboro
What about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam
Why imitate two high school loser- ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys
Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking homo-repressed, mama's boy
Suddenly the newsvan door  , a lunges out grabbing Randy by the neck
The move is quick and precise
hard yank and Randy is wrenched back into the newsvan
The door  shut
As they run back to the newsvan
are heard in the distant
Gale races up to find Randy nowhere
Randy
Randy
Where did he go
Dewey circles the van as Gale moves to the sliding side door
She tears it open as
'
Blood everywhere
His throat slit
Gale's  is heard all over campus
: -  - Yellow tape has been placed around the newsvan
People have gathered as Randy's body is taken out on a stretcher
Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley share frustrated faces
He's broken his pattern
They've broken their pattern
You're sure about this two person thing
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre
This is too much fun for one person
Different  whirl by
would say we are now officially baffled
On national television
Sheriff Hartley looks up as  flock them, surrounding them in questions
: -    - room of the library sectioned off exclusively for computer use
It consists of thirty to forty cubicles that house computer terminals
Every cubicle is full
The place is packed
Sid sits at a terminal busy at work
Her two police guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye out
Her face appears concentrated, focused
She scans the computer screen in front of her
Sid is typing feverishly
Suddenly, her screen starts flashing and , freezing her words
Confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't
She leans back, turning to the  next to her
handsome young man
Excuse me
Did your computer just freeze
The guy leans over and takes a look at Sid's monitor
(') You have an instant message, that's all
Just hit
'm not signed on
Someone here in the room
All the terminals are connected
The guy returns to his own computer
Sidney eyes the screen suspiciously
She hits  +
message pops up on the screen
"'
" Sidney freaks
muffled
She shoots up, looking about the crowded room
He could be anywhere
The two guards take notice, rushing over to her
He's here
He's in the room right now
She points to the screen
The men instantly break up and cover the room
They start pulling people from their terminals to check their screens
Sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing
Suddenly, it starts flashing and  again
She looks around
She slowly moves toward it, drawn uncontrollably
She hits  +
Another message pops up: "  '

She takes a deep breath and begins to type
The words " " appear
Sid hits ""
-   - Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley are drilling a very subdued and cool Cotton
What better alibi could  have was here in custody
Maybe you don't work alone
Yeah, that's it
Why did you attack Sidney Prescott
There was no attack, we were talking
Very heatedly
Miss Prescott and  have a very complicated past
That's no crime
And the gun
have a permit
It's registered have a legal right to carry it
Why do you need a gun
Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is not reason enough to hold me here
've been down this road before
And unless you're going to charge me with a crime 'd like to walk outta here
have an interview at 6:00
: - Gale sits at a table
Dewey approaches
He places a hand on her shoulder
They're both at a loss
Where's Sidney'
She's safe
Silence
(') How you doin
Not good
How you doin
Not good
Just then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their office
Cotton is escorted out behind them
Gale moves to him
Can't we hold him
No, we got pressure from California State
The man practically has clemency
We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him
He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move
What now
He stands at a counter, signing forms
Gale approaches
What's going on, Cotton
You know the story, Gale
Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again
Want the exclusive
Did you do it
She looks him dead in the eyes
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom
You're not having character doubts now, are you
You have a right to be angry
No, Gale,  don't have any rights
You made sure of that
Cotton, 've done nothing but help you
You've done nothing but get rich off of me
How many books have you sold, Gale
You think  don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights
Just then, the  behind the counter brings him his gun in a plastic bag
Cotton takes it out and checks it over
Gale is surprised to see the gun
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton
You've come to far
Gale,  don't know what 'm doing from one moment to the next
'm just taking it as it comes
Cotton pockets the gun and heads out
Gale rejoins Dewey and the others
Night's coming
think its time to beef up security on the Prescott girl
Where is she
She was just escorted to her dorm room
Is she safe there
We're going to bring her in
Hide her out for a coupla days
And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening
No one is allowed out after dark
That doesn't work, sir
You're just isolating people
You're giving the killer a blank canvas
: - Day turns to night and college life comes to a deadly stand still as everyone observes the imposed campus restrictions
- The fraternity house sits dark and quiet walks up the walk to the front door
He  on it three times and it quietly opens as he's ushered in
-  - The young man makes his way down a long hallway, down a spiral staircase, through a thick basement door and into
Music peels paint as    rock to deafening tunes
row of kegs line one wall as a the party gears up for a drunken night ahead
Derek is seen with his video camera
He's filming Lois and Murphy
They talk into the camera
Both tipsy chatty
It's all about sisterhood
Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but
we only promote safe rubbered sex
it's really about family and tradition
harmonica style is okay
just love being a sister
Mickey approaches as Derek finishes up
Thanks, ladies
They take off to the kegs
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life
Not one bit
Where's Sid
She dumped me
No way
Yeah
You freakin
Derek shrugs
He's clearly upset by it when from out of nowhere,    appear, picking Mickey up, lifting him over their heads
Everyone starts and
He lavaliered
He's dead
They carry him around the room,
The frat boys abduct Mickey, taking him up the stairs and out sight
Others lookie loo's follow
Derek grabs his camera and bolts
: '   - Sidney is trying to focus on homework while Hallie channel surfs
She finds a channel
On screen, Siskel a Ebert are reviewing a movie
(from ) enjoyed its clever execution
We're missing the Sig Ep party
No, Hallie, not tonight
Parties and mass murderers don't go together
Trust me
No, no,  hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed
Hallie clearly wishes she were there
(from ) It was just an excuse to kill young, big breasted girls
didn't like it
They're reviewing
Hallie switches channels
There's a  on the door
Sid answers - it's Dewey and Gale
From the look on their faces
Someone else has been killed
: -  - Gobs of gooey food goes flying through the air exploding perfectly all over
Who stands buck naked, tied
chained to a tree in the back yard
The yard is crowded with   and who delight in torching him
Mounds of syrup, eggs, and other wet and slimy food is plunged upon him
Who do you love
Hallie
Did you say "My  brothers"
No,  said Hallie
More food and slime come barreling at him
drunk Lois and Murphy pull the police tape down from the previous night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him
The crowd goes crazy
'   - Hallie consoles Sidney
Dewey and Gale nearby
Sidney is a stone rock
It's frightening to watch her hold it together
'm fine
wish people would stop treating me like glass
'm not gonna break
It's okay to break, girl
You shatter if you have to
'd really just like to be alone
The police are waiting outside
They're going to take you somewhere safe
Dewey, there's no such place
Humor me, Sid
Sidney starts packing an overnight bag
Can  come with her
No, Hallie, 'm not gonna take you down too
'll be alright
Sid, 'll come with you
But who would operate your camera
burn
It comes out of nowhere
Gale goes silent at the door
Dewey opens to find a Police guard standing with Joel
(') He's cool, Remy
Joel is ushered in
He says his hello's, moving to Hallie
Gale and Dewey move out into the hall with the guards
Sid continues to pack
Her face rigid
They got Mickey
He's being toasted at the Deltas
knew it
Shit
gotta get over there
We're under quarantine
He points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway
'm the only one who can cut him down
It's not a good idea, Hallie
'll go with her
Be safe, girl
She gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she and Joel race out into the hallway as Dewey sticks his head in
Sid, you should get going
He looks at Joel and Hallie
(') Where are you two headed
(instant cover) Hallie forgot her footage at the film dept
'm gonna walk her over before it's gets too late You really
gotta have it, Dewey
Gale steps in
Hey, Dewey
Seeya, Dewey
Hallie and Joel race outta there before any more objections
Dewey turns to Gale
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could
Meaning
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life
What do you know about this Derek
Solid alibis
He was with Sidney when she was attacked
Billy had alibis too
Dewey turns to Sid who now stands ready in the doorway
Hey,  got stuff to do
But 'll find you later, okay
Whatever
Sidney's exterior keeps hardening
: -  - Mickey is still tied to the tree
He's so completely covered in hardened gook it looks like he's wearing clothes
The last of the crowd has left
They've gone back to the party
He stands shivering in the cold
He checks the chain that holds him secure
It's composed of several bike locks and steel twine
He's not going anywhere
He hears a noise
He looks to the nearby shrubs and beyond
Nothing
Just a noise of the night
(whispering) Come on, Hallie, baby
: '   - dark room
slight disturbance at the door and it comes popping open
Light from the hall floods the room as Dewey and Gale slip in and close the door behind them
(checking door) You broke the lock
You broke my heart
What are we looking for
bloody knife
ghost mask
Something like that
Can we turn the light on
That's not the way it's done
Dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the room
He sifts through drawers and a closet
And it's sexier in the dark
Dewey, you and  would never make it
Maybe not
But think about the sex
As frustrated as  am
and as lonely as  am
We'd break some furniture
Gale  at this
She reaches over and pats his buttock
Tell you what
We get through this one
And we'll take out a hotel room
Over here with the light
Dewey points the light to a framed picture
It's of Joel and Derek - a buddy pose
She sifts through some text books on the desk
They're roomates
And Joel's pre-med
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision
Shit
It's both of them
The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro
But they've moved on - they're getting closer to Sidney
They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill
They're looking for the new Tatum
Hallie
moment
Then in a splash, they're outta there
: - squad car makes it's way down the quiet campus street
- Sidney sits in the backseat
The two police officers ride in front
Where are you taking me
#1 Actually,  don't know
#2 We're meeting another car that will transport you the rest of the way
#1 Safety precautions
feel like Eddie Murphy
The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light
#1 We feel like Kevin Costner
Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on the passenger's side
Two hands reach in and yank Police Guard #2 from the car
He starts to   but it's cut short
Sid  as the Police Guard behind the wheel struggles with his seat belt
He looks up to see a Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car towards his door
He reaches for his gun but it's too late
The Ghost has the door open
flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is slit
Sidney  and ,  on the door of the car
It won't open
She's trapped like a caged animal
The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then gets in, behind the driver's seat
The Ghost puts the car in drive and takes off down the road
Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay sprawled in the middle of the road
She turns to the door,  and  at it
She leans back, manic, and  at the window with her feet
No use
- The car makes its way down the deserted street Sidney is beyond frantic
She eyes the Ghost through the gate
She turns and twists looking for an escape
Through the window, she sees approaching headlights
She  through the closed window as a car passes by
Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another campus street
Big, stone school buildings line each side of a thin, road
She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window
The white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her
The Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed
Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her
She rips it open, rustling through it frantically
She pulls books, pencils, paper
Sid grabs a long, yellow No
2 pencil
She grips it hard, looking to the metal grate just behind the driver's seat
The Ghost's neck is right up against it
Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the Ghost's head, ready to attack
Without pause, Sid  the pencil through the grate, into the Ghost's neck
It lodges there as the Ghost falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for a moment
The car jumps the curb and  against a building
The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting
He tries to bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post that stands directly in the car's path
The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post, into it, bringing the car to a  , lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior
Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling
All is still
In the backseat, Sidney rises from the floorboards
She looks up to see the Ghost Masked figure slumped over the steering wheel
Out
Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about, sizing up her options
She tugs on the door handle
It won't budge
She looks to the passenger's side of the car
It's flush against the building
Then she notices the metal grate
The edge has been pried apart in the crash
Sidney reaches for it, pulling on it, bending it backwards
Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious
She creates an opening large enough for her to crawl through
She lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the
Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving the Ghost
She lay crumpled up against the smashed passenger's door, the only sound is her own She watches the Ghost Masked Figure
His body doesn't move
She contemplates her next move
The only way out is through the driver's door
After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over with her foot and nudges the Ghost
No movement
Nothing
She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to his side
She reaches with her hand and pushes on the Ghost's shoulder
His body moves, slumping back against the back of the seat
It clears space for her to pass through
She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost
With her leg, she reaches over him, straddling him
She leans against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching for the door knob
Her back brushes against the horn
Sid , her face a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask
He doesn't move
He's completely out cold
Sid pushes the car door open and starts to slide completely over the Ghost when she stops
She looks to the Ghost
As she fights with a decision
Then, with a fierce determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask
She finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away when
Lunging forward
Sidney , leaping, falling out the car door
Sid hits the pavement hard
She lifts herself up when her entire body is
The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into the car
Sidney  and  breaking free
She hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car
Sidney  the car door shut
It catches the Ghost, knocking him backwards
Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the pavement
: - The film school sits in the still darkness
- Dewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway
They stop cold
Ssshh
What was that
Let's find out
Dewey keeps moving
This is all too familiar
Over here
Dewey has lead her to a door marked " "
- The same room seen earlier
large, rounded room with three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the ceiling
podium stands center
Video monitors hang from the ceiling in different places around the room
Dewey and Gale enter
If not for the red that hang over the exit doors, the room would be completely dark
They move down the first level of chairs to the lecturn
Maybe they never got here
He could have taken her anywhere
'mon
Let's go
noise from above takes their attention
They looks up as a video monitor comes to life
Images appear
Home-made video footage fills the screen
movie theatre, people standing in line
The home camera in to a
Maureen and Phil come into view
Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room, searching for it's source
Another monitor comes to life
More home shot video footage
This time of a big house
closer look reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House
young girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable phone
It's Cici
Jesus Christ
He filmed his victims
It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the cellular phone to his ear
Another monitor turns on
It's of a man and woman back to the camera
The couple move in frame
It becomes apparent quick
It's Gale and Dewey
As they stand in the room - live
They're being taped
Shit
Dewey spins around
He reaches for the gun he no longer carries
Dammit
He looks around the room, up to the two levels above them
He spots a small light on the second level
He squints his eyes and sees a  standing behind it
Let's go
No, wait here
Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the stair rise that leads to the upper level
No, Dewey, let's call for backup
But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone
She turns to the monitor to see her face in fear-stricken
Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge
He approaches the railing and makes his way around to the shining light
He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod
It sits alone against the railing
Dewey surveys the second level
Empty seats everywhere
Completely bare
Dewey looks down to the main floor
to Gale who looks up to him
Dewey
There's nothing
'm coming down
Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that hangs level with the railing
On the monitor, Gale is in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained
She takes a step forward, moving out of frame, revealing Who stands right behind her
Dewey looks down to see the Ghost standing directly behind Gale
(') Watch out
Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's knife as it darts out of the darkness
Gale catapults, just dodging it
She moves like lightning up the aisle of seats
Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his handicapped leg will allow
Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind her
Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale
(') Gale
He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes
He moves for it
- Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door
She tears it open, disappearing into
- Gale finds herself in the student studios
She stands in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage
Lots of glass walls and doors
It has a maze quality
Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room
Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening as she main door  open
And then  are heard, making their way towards her
Gale proceeds deeper into the studio
She moves into a sound proof room and closes the door
Not seeing the
That stands behind her
She turns around and
She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the control booth
She's protected by a clear, large, plexiglass window that wraps around the room
The ghost moves out the side door, heading her way
He disappears out of view
Gale freaks
She races to the door, trying to secure it
There's no lock
Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be quick on his toes
Through the control booth window, he immediately spots Gale
Gale looks for objects to block the door with
She drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door
Dewey moves to the window
Gale
Gale
She doesn't hear him
The room is sound proof
He against the glass
Still, she doesn't turn to him
Gale shoves everything she can find against the door, not seeing or hearing Dewey as he  against the sound proof barrier behind her
She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind Dewey
He moves on him swift and focused
Gale can't take her eyes off the door
Her face is terrified
If she'd only turn around, she would see Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled into him repeatedely
With each thrust, blood is splattered against the glass
Dewey  for his life, caught completely off guard
He falls forward onto the control panels
Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios as Dewey's  are heard throughout the stage
Dewey's   rips through the room
Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed against it, blood smeared across the glass
She moves to the window, her face only inches from his
moment as their eyes meet
Dewey's life is near gone
His eyes reveal it
Gale  against the glass window
(through tears) Dewey's body slides down, out of view
Gale is mortified
She looks to the Killer who has already made his way through the control booth
He's coming for her
She races to the door, throws the things away
She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide through
And she's off and running
Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only long enough to lock it
The Ghost  it from the other side but it holds
Gale surveys her surroundings
She's in a storage room
She eyes another door
She moves through it and out into
Gale shoots down it
: - Sidney races down the deserted street
Not a soul in sight
She reaches a corner, moves off the road and passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out onto
- The houses have long since gone to sleep
The Delta Zeta House stares at Sidney
Lights burn from within
Sid goes for it
- Sid makes her way up the front porch
She  on the front door,  her lungs out
Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound porch, beating at the windows
But nothing
Everybody is off partying
Suddenly, Sid hears something She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying, strewn across the end of the porch
Passed out
Sid runs to them
(') Oh God, help me
We have to call the police
Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her
Murphy's eyes open and she
The girl is completely wasted
She has no comprehension skills at all
(') Do you have keys
need to get inside
Sid looks to Lois
She's in worse shape
(') Shit
Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do
She leaves them, moving down off the porch and around to the back of the house
She gets to the back door, tries it
It's locked too
Sidney checks out the yard
Off to the side, she spots a big tree with a
, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She moves toward it
As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey
He lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still chained to the tree
(') Mickey
Mickey
look of dread creeps across her face
He lay there very much dead
(') Oh God, no, Mickey
She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up, rising
Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried funk, his eyes wide
Sid
Jesus, where's Hallie
've been here all night
Listen to me
We've got to get help
The Killer's here
What are you talking about
He's after me
Mickey pulls on his chained arm
Shit
You've got to cut me down, Sid
Sid inspects the chain
It's meant to hold
'll be right back
Where you going
Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage
Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools
Sid settles on a shovel
Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet
He's pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him
Watch out
Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on the lock
It bends somewhat but stays in tact
Do it again
noise behind them
They both spin around peering into the night
(') What was that
Don't panic
Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings it down with great force
It  the lock, loosening it
Mickey pulls on it
It won't quite give
(') Watch out
Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering
She doesn't see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the tree branch behind her
The Figure moves quickly and gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid
Mickey looks up, just in time
Sid turns just as the Killer strikes
But Sid is ready
Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost, catching his mid-section, sending him flying
Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree
He pulls, twists, squirms
anything to free himself
The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey
Sidney sees this
Hey
Sidney distracts the Ghost
She takes off, the Ghost following her
She moves around the tree, sprinting across the yard, running smack into
But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each side of her
She stands  as the two Killers descend on her
She dives between the two but they counter, keeping her surrounded
Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife
She turns to the other
His knife is already poised
They close in on her, ready to strike
She looks for an escape
There's not one
Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the Ghosts
They go sprawling across the grass
Run, Sid
Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards the front of the yard
Mickey leaps to his feat
The Killer right behind him
He now finds himself in Sid's predicament
He doesn't know where to run
The two Killer's close in on him
Sidney gets to the corner of the house
She stops
she doesn't want to leave Mickey
She turns back around just in time to see
Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts
They're knives strike at the same time
One through the stomach, the other through the back
They withdraw their knives
Mickey's body suspends, momentarily hanging in the air
Then collapses to a heap on the ground
Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time
She takes off running, along the side of the house, through a row of shrub that take her to
- Sid is back on the campus street, running down the middle of it
She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up
are inside, rock music
Sid  and but they don't hear her
She runs, feet pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the car takes off
It's taillights fading in the night
She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot
The theatre sits in the distance
She spots someone entering the theatre
It looks like Hallie
Hallie
But Hallie doesn't hear her
Sid races forward
: Gale races down the empty campus street
She eyes an emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp
She goes for it
Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the button
(from phone) What is your emergency please
Someone's trying to kill me
need the police
Are you in danger now
Yes, goddammit
Where is your attacker
don't know
Stay under the safety light
Help is on its way
The safety what
Fuck that
Just then, Gale hears a
door opening
She looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side theatre door
But Sidney has already disappeared inside
Gale yells into the phone
(') Fuckin' hurry
Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney
The theatre is big and old
Plush chairs, balcony, huge proscenium stage
Sidney enters through a side house door
She pulls on it, releasing the emeregency lock
She makes her way down the aisle toward the orchestra section
Hello
The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the furniture from the  set
noise from the stage wings
(') Hallie
Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that extends out over the orchestra pit
She crosses it and moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either side of her
Complete darkness
Something drips down from above and onto Sidney
She wipes it from her face when
spot light turns on from the back of the house, illuminating Sid center stage
She jumps at this, unnerved
She looks to her hand, covered in crimson
Then out to the house
the light is blinding
from above
ropes, pulleys moving
Sid looks up as a set wall comes  down at her
She leaps out of the way, falling to the floor
The wall falls into place on the stage
It is the back wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and antique weapons and
Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified
His body a bloody mess
Sidney stops, stunned
She stands frozen in unspeakable horror
Her entire being ripped apart
She breaks into tears
And then
Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off, trapping her
She looks in shock at
Strung up, her body hanging lifeless
Sid , turning, running to the other side of the stage when a third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled set of
Attached to it, is the body of Joel
Dead
Blood everywhere
And then, Sid hears
single pair of hands from somewhere in the house
applauding
She turns around and spots a  moving down the aisle
She can't make out who it is
Sid bolts
She spots the set door up center, near Dewey's body
She goes for it, ripping it open to find
Sid
But then sees his face, he looks scared
And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his arms and legs bound by electric tape
Sid turns back to the front of the stage
The Figure is now walking across the bridge, holding something
a light attached to a video camera
She's being filmed
Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with pleading eyes
Quick, untie me
Sid is paniced
She doesn't know what to do
She leans down to untie him but stops
(from behind video camera) You've seen this movie before, haven't you
Sidney looks to the voice
The camera is pulled away to reveal
He smiles at her
Smile for the camera
Sidney remains silent
Sid, c'mon
Side backs away from Cotton
She doesn't trust either one of them
Derek watches her, amused
Go on, untie him
No
This is a set up
That's quick
Please, Sidney, he's going to kill us
Derek begins filming again
You must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about now
Sidney says nothing
She egdes away, moving to the wall where Hallie hangs
(') Sidney, you can't keep your back to the audience like that
Could you cheat a little forward for me
Please, Sidney
You're really stumped, aren't you
You know there's two killers but you don't know who they are
'm a given
The boyfriend
Way obvious
But now you're torn
Everyone else appears to be dead
Except for Cotton
Hmmm
Hmmm
Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching out, grabbing her
Sid
She spins around to find Hallie breaking out in a torrent of
Very much alive
Paaaaiiin
yah, such pain
The story of your life, Sid
Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself down from the wall with a big hunting knife
Need some help, honey
got it
Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two
You should really see your face right now, Sid
It's doing some freaky shit
Derek's right
Sid's face appears completely tortured
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive
Yeah, how can we help
Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life
Sidney stares them down
She's been here before
Why
Good question
You took the bait
Ever see
Well, Derek and  have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on
really don't like that comparison, honey
(to Sid) He hates Oliver Stone
find his work overwrought
Sid is waning
'mon, Sid, don't fade on us
We've been planning this baby for a year
Humor us
Sid turns to Cotton
She kneels down and begins to untie him
Nope
You had your chance
Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife
Sid backs off
: Gale approaches the side theatre door
She pulls on it
It's locked
Shit
She moves down along the theatre to another door
: Hallie and Derek move around Sid, taking turns filming her with the camera
We met on the internet
He sent me the cutest e-mail
read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly
Hook, line
We have our own website now
We dedicated a whole page to you
You'd me amazed at how many of us there are out there
It's a whole world, Sid
You're really popular amongst the demented
You're the one who got away
Until now
You guys are fucked
Actually Cotton, and  think critics would agree, it's the other way around
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel
You're not going to get away with this
Of course not
Who wants to
What's the point if we don't get caught
Where's the glamour in that
The way  see it
We'll be arrested
Go to prison
Cash in on the home footage
Secure a book deal
If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of
verdict and premiere all on the same day
love it
We're hoping for the death penalty
have this whole swan song exit planned
And now, drum roll please
Hope you're ready, Sid
We got one last surprise for you
Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists
Sid had loosened them somewhat
He tries to finish undoing them
twist ending if you will
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us
It really is the curse of the sequel
The Billy/Stu thing's been done
so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience
And we didn't want to do that, Sid
We wanted to give you your money's worth
So we found a compromise
Or it found us
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings
Just for you, Sid
Wait a sec, Derek
We forgot to flip
Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin
Oh yeah
(to Sid) We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press
It's been an ongoing discussion
(to Hallie) Heads or tails
Tails
He flips the coin
Shit
You win
Gale emerges from the lobby
She found a way in
She eyes the proceedings on stage
She sees Sidney standing over Cotton
And then Hallie and Derek on either side
knives in hand
She races down the aisle
Sidney
They all turn, spotting Gale
Sid moves forward, happy to see her
Gale
Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on
Sidney moves down center
Derek cuts her off just as
Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the curtain separates them
Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her throat
It's about time she showed up
Gale moves to the exit door and into the
Gale eyes a door that's marked " "
She opens it and steps in coming face to face with a
Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find
standing, lips pursed
Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for you
Gale's face is a mass of confusion
Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her knees, next to Cotton
' Okay, look, you guys -  applaud your methodical expertise but have a question
What's going to happen after  die
thought the heroine is supposed to live
Not this time
Hallie moves in on her
Yeah, we're trying to send a message to Hollywood
'm really getting tired of all the happy endings
It's just not reality
In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth
But nobody wants to see that
It'll never go
They'll rewrite you
You don't want that
Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate
guess fearing death makes one anxious
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos
(off camera) Don't blame the movies, Sid
Movies don't create pyschos
Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her very soul
The Voice comes from the wings
They all turn as Gale Weathers appears
Behind her, with gun in hand, is Debbie Salt
Derek grabs the camera
He doesn't want to miss a second
Don't you know that by now
It's about family
It all starts at home
It starts with the father
and the mother
Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to Debbie Salt
She recognizes her immediately
Mrs
Loomis
Gale stops cold
What
Oh my God
Gale turns to Debbie Salt
Jesus
It can't be
Told you we had a guest star
Didn't see that coming, did you
Everything's taken on a hyper- reality, hasn't it
You're Billy's mother
couldn't believe you didn't recognize me
You even interviewed me for your book
You're all in this together
We had to have financing
Tuition's expensive
Why Mrs
Loomis
Where should we start
Your mother ruined my marriage by sleeping with my husband
You ruined my family by killing my son
Gale aired it to the world
Should  go on
isn't that enough
Jesus, you're just as whacked as your son
Where do you think he got it
Mental illness is heriditary
Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother
He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance
Sidney is completely horror stricken
She stands in total disbelief
Yeah, she's been great, Sid
We never would have been able to it without her
Debbie Salt/Mrs
Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie, smiling
And  couldn't have done it without you two
Now who won the coin toss
Hallie raises her hand
did
Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply
and Sid and Gale  as a bullet through the forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat wall
Her body drops to the floor
Dead
Derek drops the camera, completely taken back
He looks to Debbie
What are you
Debbie turns the gun on him
Derek moves, the bullet catches him in the stomach
He drops to his knees
Debbie  again
Derek takes another bullet
This time dropping
Very dead
His body falls near Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this ordeal
He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his wrists
Turn to Debbie in complete horror
Nice kids but a little out there
What are you going to do
Finish what my son started
But you'll never get away with it
Enter Cotton Weary
Cotton looks up
(') Think about it
An innocent man wrongly accused
Spends time in prison where he justs sits with his righteous anger, waiting, planning his revenge
His life so incomprehensively ruined he's forced to take revenge on the people responsible
It's perfect
No
not again
Sorry, Cotton
guess you were just meant to be a killer
You'll never get away with this
Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging
Who would you like to shoot first, Cotton
Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings
With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt
It strikes her, lodging into her chest
She goes back
Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again
She goes down
Dead
Thank God
Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet
She helps him with the last of his bindings
Sid looks about at the body count on stage
It's mounting
She takes a deep breath
Relieved
(') God, Cotton, what a nightmare
'm so sorry
Yeah
Gale gives him a hug
' Thank you
He hugs her back
She doesn't see as he rises the knife behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal move
Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she goes limp as the knife lodges in her back
Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's body down into the orchestra pit
He turns, facing Sidney
The bloody knife in hand
Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera lay, he pulls the tape from it
It's perfect, Sidney
No one will ever suspect me
have proof
'm the victim
Please, Cotton, don't do this
He holds up the video cassette
Murder in his eye
get my revenge and make some fast cash
It's over, Cotton
Not until you're dead
Cotton lunges for her
Sid tears off, slipping through the set door to
Sid runs to the rear of the stage
She moves in the narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back wail
She races down it
She almost reaches the end when Sidney ducks, bypassing him
She comes to the stage door
It's locked
She turns, seeing the metal ladder that's attached to the wall
It leads to the catwalk above
Sid goes for it
She climbs up the ladder with lightning speed
Cotton, up and running, is close behind
The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats and a large chandelier are stored in the air
Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the ending
'    '
