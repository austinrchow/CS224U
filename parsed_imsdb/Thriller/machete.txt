Stand down
Do not attempt to take the safehouse alone
Officer Cruz
You hear me
Torrez sounds mad
You going to answer him
Machete glares
Erhman nervously picks up the radio
(') On route to target, no need for assistance
( ) Machete, you son of a bitch
told you to wait
Set up a perimeter and wait for further orders
You hear me, Pendejo
Machete slowly takes the radio from Erhman
He hangs up
- Fleapit motel sits derelict at end of the street
Dead cars on the lawn, chickens scratching in the dirt
,  - Machete guns the engine
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 2
What are you doing
We're going to set up a perimeter right
You heard the boss
Machete pulls his Machete, sticks it up to Erhman's face
This is the boss
Ehrman crosses himself
phalanx of   emerge from the dead cars
They narrow their weapons at 's barrelling patrolcar
Hijo de puta
Machete  it directly through the   and right through the   of the fleapit

The car stops in front of the check-in desk
Machete steps out
The dust clears
More   stream from the office
sideswipes the first  with his , swinging him around to face the fire of the others
ragdolls around like a marionette long enough for Machete to slash one of the men's wrists, sending his aim wild and taking out the others
, Machete kicks open a door
, Naked girl on the bed
As if she was expecting him
Get dressed
He checks the windows
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 3
It's too hot for clothes
Checks her eyes
She's been drugged
He lifts her, ass over his shoulder
(') Hey
what's your name
She tries to read the nametag on his uniform, upside-down
, with an  runs out spraying bullets
Machete spins and impales his face into the wall
's Uzi falls into the girl's hands
emerge from the end of the hallway
She absently pulls the trigger, ripping into the pursuing men
Blood sprays the walls like Jackson Pollock
New  emerge from the front of the hallway
Machete spins around and the girl unloads another spray
Oh
wow
, The Uzi's out of ammo
The girl frowns and drops it
The fucked-up patrolcar blocks the way out, for now
Machete resheathes his weapon into a slit in his pants
Girl arches her back, her crotch in Machete's face, then slides down his front, her breasts brushing his eyes, nose, mouth
We need to go
Now
In what
That
The patrolcar isn't going anywhere
She rips open his shirt and rubs his tattoo
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 4
(') That looks like me
She reaches into his pants
(') What's this long, hard thing
My machete
Is it sharp
Machete looks into her eyes
She smiles drunkenly
(') Good
She yanks it, drawing it into his femoral artery
Hard
He falls to the ground
He didn't see this coming
She kicks him backwards
He feels life escaping him
His point of view as: She reaches down
Fumbles with her
Pulls out a small cell phone from her snatch

More life escapes him
Double crossed
He's ready to give up

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 5
(') You had to stick your neck where it didn't belong, amigo
Torrez
Torrez's boot connects with Machete's face and he goes backwards onto the floor

Quemalo todo
(Sub: Burn it
Burn it all

Through Machete's blurred vision we see Torrez and other officers lighting rags dipped in bottles of tequila and throwing them into the corners of the room
The place goes up as they run out
Machete crawls and collapses as the flames rise around him : - : group of  hunker down in the brush, creeping in the moonlight
One of them coughs and seizes, obviously sick
Another points at a   up ahead, pulling the sick man along

She stretches, revealing tantalizing glimpses of her bod
She's having her "private time," caressing every inch of her body with a phallic loofah
She oohs and ahhs with the joys of pleasuring herself in the tub
Headlights appear through the venetian blinds
She stops
Sounds of people getting out of a car, laughing, shushing each other
Then a key in a lock, struggling to open it door forcibly opens
More sounds of fumbling and shushing

Benz points Machete to sit behind the desk
He flips open a manila folder, inside is an 8  10 of a well- dressed 40-something man
(') Do you know this man
Machete shakes his head no
(') State Senator John McLaughlin, Independent from Cocksucker County
As you know, illegal immigrants such as yourself are being forced out of our country at an alarming rate
If he had his druthers, he'd ship you back to old Meh-Hee-Co
That's his platform: Ship `em back
() RNewman / Endeavor Draft 15
(') But first, he'd make you build a wall along the border for no pay
Not so much as a thank you then get the fuck out
Benz sees this doesn't impress Machete
(') What
That doesn't sound like your problem
That's where you're wrong, friend
What our senator fails to realize is that this country runs on illegal labor
Thrives on it
Keeps costs down, keeps the wheels moving
Bust that, and the world stops turning
You've chaos and shit
What do you want me to do
For the good of both our peoples, our new senator must die
And for that  will pay you $150,000 cash
Benz flicks the lights
Tables are laid out with weaponry
Machete walks past the automatics and blades
He stops at a machete
You like the machete, huh
Strictly low-tech, but good close-up, or if you're trying to make a particularly brutal point
But it's entirely unsuited to our purposes
Here
Have a look at this
He shows him an unassembled sniper rifle
As he lists the specs, he snaps it together perfect
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 16
(') (specific dialogue about the weapon, the laser-sight on it, the ammo it uses, then) Cheer up, Charlie
This is your golden ticket
Benz drops a hollow point sniper shell into Machete's hand
- Machete walks past, the briefcase in one hand, rifle case in the other
Families have gathered on the front steps after a baptism
shakes hands with the parishioners
Seems to recognize Machete, but when he looks again, Machete's gone
- Machete steps up to the taco truck and sets the locked briefcase on the counter
() You still owe me, amigo
Two tacos y cafe
What's this
Collateral
Machete walks away
Senator   sits while a foppish Italian cuts his hair
sits across from him
But isn't this anti-immigration platform a hard sell in this part of the country, where so many voters have strong ethnic backgrounds
Not at all
Those voters are here legally
() RNewman / Endeavor Draft 17
(') It cheapens their experience, their hard work, to have people jumping the border, taking advantage of loopholes in our system
It makes a mockery of everything they've worked for and turns it into a big steaming pile of-- hand covers the reporter's recorder
It's Benz
Thank you, that'll be all
The reporter half-smiles
Benz ushers her out and turns to the hairdresser
(') Who the fuck is this
It's Mario
He's my goddamn hairdresser
Get out
Get the fuck out
Mario leaves
've got to look good for my constituency
You're in here with a reporter and a fucking shampoo queen, for Christ sake
Mario's the best
People want to know you're one of them
From now on, No manicures, no massages, no English tailored suits
Who died up your ass, Benz
'm elected, you sonofabitch
The people have spoken, by a slim margin maybe, but they picked me
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 18
And they'll be picking through your trash looking for a reason to fuck you up
'm doing everything  can to make your Von problem go away
Don't add more fuel to the fire
Von
that fat sonofabitch
What does he say
don't give a damn
As long as he lays low and doesn't take a step out of his little tree fort, he and his boys can play soldier till Hell freezes over

Shades and a cigar
riding shotgun looks uncomfortable
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this, Von
Not with the heat we're under

The Constitution

Luz's   is there
We're at a crossroads in this great land, and one man has the vision to see us into the future
() Our man's up next
It's a great day in America, Amen
Benz stands among the crowd, the brim of a cowboy hat shading his eyes
Please join me in welcoming our great State Senator John McLaughlin
McLaughlin stands at the podium
Behind him hangs a banner: ,
The crowds punctuate his speech with cheers
Make no mistake, my friends: We are at

The fuck was that
'd say it was a fucking gift from the Gods
What are you talking about
Get ready for your numbers to rise like Lazarus
thousand bucks says it was some bean-eating wetback just took a potshot at you
It will put the fear of God into the ethics commission
Now we get you to the hospital, you make your bedside speech and you're set
McLaughlin looks at Benz, taking it all in
Fix me a goddamn drink

Machete flies into garbage cans
Shotguns pump

Two cops have shotguns pointed at his head
Go ahead Jorge, 'll grease your chips all over this fucking alley
One of the cops cuffs him and shoves him into the backseat of a patrol car

did  wake the neighbors
They get up
She pulls the ski mask off a dead gunman
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 71
(') This is one of ours
He works for the agency
Come on
They grab guns and run out
- Machete and Elektra run outside
Sniper and his men are waiting for them; guns drawn
He waves for his men to lower their guns
Machete you can come quietly and we won't hurt the girl
Machete contemplates this
(') You can trust me
've brought one of your old friends to vouch for me
Erhman waves with his  hand
Hola Machete amigo, long time
Erhman beams a big cheese eating smile
Machete draws his gun
Not long enough
Erhman's smile fades
Machete  him in the face
Machete and Elektra open fire with machine guns and speed off in a Volkswagon bug
: , Elektra enters
She's slowly surrounded by rough-looking Mexicans
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 72
My friend and  need a little help
They see Machete behind her
It's him
: Machete sharpens blades, makes all kinds of razor-sharp metal weaponry in the chop shop, using all kinds of scrap metal
Machete lays down sketches and blueprints
The men and Machete build out a tricked-out arsenal on tricked-out vehicles, like something out of a south of the border Road Warrior
Machete sharpens his blade as sparks fly
, Sniper cruises by, hunting for Machete
The chop shop boys spot Sniper snooping
They bring out a huge blowtorch and carve up his hood
You punk kids
That's it
Sniper climbs out of his car, gun in hand
steak  flies in from off screen and skewers his wrist
He stumbles back gushing blood,and sees
Luz; alive and well, a red eye patch on
She's wrapped in white bandages crossing and covering her chest and her arm
She's a mess but a beautiful one, like a female road warrior
Band aids on her forehead
The white bandages cover her dark skin
Cabron,  told you it wouldn't end pretty
(to the guys) Bring him inside
They drag Sniper out of the car and into the chop shop
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 73
You,  got you, what
It pays to have friends, Pendejo
They got your ass when you need it
- Back to the moment Luz has passed out in the truck
Pancho barks;  Luz on the  and pulls her out of the Taco Truck seconds before it explodes
: Sniper struggles as they drag him toward a circular saw
No
No
Looking for someone
Oh my God
Please
No
Please
They bring Sniper up to the saw and grind away at him
Luz and Pancho look on
- News crews gather outside
Booth walks towards McLaughlin's room, cellphone in hand, trying to reach Sniper
Only gets a gurgling, buzzing sound
Goddamn   &
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 74
' Booth enters McLaughlin's hospital room
McLaughlin is dressed in a suit and a girl is brushing his hair while another brightens his cheeks with a little makeup
Where the fuck have you been
Taking care of business
My business is here
Did you see those crews out there
They expect a statement
(noticing Booth's ragged ) Jesus, what happened to you
Nothing
Just had a little talk with a priest
Well, what am  going to tell `em
Whatever you tell them, 'm sure it'll be golden
(off McLaughlin's blank ) Just feed them the line about standing steadfast in the face of terrorism, continuing the fight
You know it by heart
McLaughlin looks relieved
do
All right
Once this is done, you need to take a vacation
You need some air
Maybe
No doubt about it
You're losing your marbles, Booth
The girl finishes the makeup and hair job, and smiles at McLaughlin
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 75
(') It's showtime
McLaughlin stands and exits, Booth right behind them
As they leave, we focus on the  set in McLaughlin's room, showing the front of the hospital and the news crews outside
Suddenly the ticker shows - Yellow police tape around the perimeter
Torrez watches from a distance, looking around
Torrez sees Elektra's car drive by
He hops into his rental and follows her
- McLaughlin and Booth exit the hospital to face the throng of reporters
McLaughlin approaches a makeshift lectern of microphones
'd just like to thank the all of you for your support during this difficult time
McLaughlin's supporters cheer and hold up pro-McLaughlin, anti-immigration signs
(') My will to fight has only just begun
We must not let the terrorists win this battle for our land, our America
Thank you
More cheers
One of the reporters steps up
Congressman, there are reports implicating your advisors as having orchestrated the shooting
Would you care to comment
The cheers fizzle
McLaughlin looks stunned
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 76
Do what now
: Webcam footage plays of Booth in the church
You want to be a martyr
'm good at making martyrs
Like McLaughlin
That's right
He slams another nail into Padre's other hand
You're so drunk with power, you ordered the hit on your own boss
McLaughlin looks to Booth, but Booth is
No further comment
Thank you
McLaughlin ducks back inside
McLaughlin stumbling
Could somebody fucking help me think 'm having a heart attack
Booth takes hold of him and ushers him out the back door
- Outside McLaughlin's supporters are dazed and confused
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 77
, Booth drives
McLaughlin pops vicodins with a bottle of Maker's Mark
What did you do, Booth
You jeopardized my career with that wetback
He could have fucking killed me
Not with that scope
You stupid sonofabitch
You pull something like this, without consulting me
You fucked me
You are a stupid sonofabitch
The press is going to demand answers
You got another brilliant solution for that
They stop
Suddenly,  is standing on top of the limo
He's throwing knives into the open sunroof
McLaughlin is pinned to the seat
Booth exits the vehicle and hightails it
Machete pursues
Booth and Machete on the run, after each other
Fistfight in the street
Booth scrambles up a fire escape
group of men are standing around a pitbull pit where two pit bulls are going at it
The men place bets excitedly on which dog will be the victor
Machete and Booth fight on the roof
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 78
Machete and Booth roll off a roof and tumble into the pitbull pit, fighting each other as the dogs fight
The men around them start placing bets on Machete and Booth
Booth cuts one of the men and the pitbulls go after him
Booth escapes from the circle and carjacks a woman
He kicks her out of the car and speeds towards the Armory
( ) Von
Von
Machete comes out of the alleyway
His buddies in their Road Warrior rides swing by and pick him up
Follow him
,  /
, Von's phone rings
Von sits on a couch watching the news
Booth's mug fills the screen
Von makes no sudden move to answer
Shouldn't you--
Let him stew awhile
Von mutes the , answers the phone
(') Von here
Benz drives
Where are you, goddamnit
'm bringing him up
Up
Up where
Up your fat, fishbelly ass
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 79
Fine
Bring him here
Papa Von's got a big surprise a-waiting
' Elektra enters
Place looks deserted again
Shit
don't even want to know who she's fucking now
' Sis is being savagely attacked by Torrez
' Elektra hears it, but thinks it's Sis fucking
Fucking shit, bitch
Make him pay for a goddamn hotel
Thuds get louder, then stop
Elektra looks up
(') Sis
Bedroom door opens slowly
Elektra sees the horror inside
Puts a hand to her mouth to staunch the flow of projectile vomit
Then she's taken from behind by Torrez's henchmen
She was just a warmup
Now 'm ready for dessert
He edges in
- Militiamen guard the gate
Booth barrels towards the gate
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 80
He spins out and gets out of the car
Shut the gate quick
He's after me
Some of the men shut the gate
Booth approaches Von
(') He killed McLaughlin
He's coming after me
And you led him right to Papa Von
That's some kind of thank you
saw to it that McLaughlin gave you the keys to this fortress
You owe us
The senator, maybe
But what exactly do  owe you, turncoat
What are you talkin-- You held the hand that held the gun, Booth
Just as good as you killed him
Booth lunges for him but the other militia men hold him back
(') Put the traitor in the brig
They lead Booth away, kicking and spitting
You can't do this to me, Von
You need me
Booth is secured in the brig
Booth flings hot coffee in the guard's face, jerks his belt and smashes the guy's face into the bars
Snags the keys and escapes from the brig
He pulls a few bucks out of his pocket and flings them down Sonny-style on the prone guard
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 81
Booth and Von showdown
Booth slaughters Von with an American flag through the throat, coming out his spine at the back of the neck
Glory, glory, hallelujah
vehicles barrel towards the armory
They're driving a semitruck -- It crashes through the front gate, then spins as -- The backdoor of the semi trailer rolls up revealing --as Machete rides it out
Machete's army of workers stream out from their road warrior chop shop rides
Machete dismounts
His army behind him
He raises his  against the sun and his army all raise theirs
Big battle sequence as they storm the armory
Knives and guns
a ballet of bullets and blood
arrives in one of the   from the chop shop
She has a   that shoots out Machete blades like a Machine gun
minuteman grabs her from behind, but
He is  in the  by Pancho
onhis back holds a sharp  that he stabs with
The minuteman falls, Pancho stabs him in the face
Luz leads a gang of her customers into the battle
Minutemen and Mexicanos of all walks of life--janitors, gardeners, laborers, gangbangers, etc
--fight it out at the armory
Fighting it out with the implements of their trade-- knives hidden in mops, a weedwhacker attack, etc
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 82
wailing   through a gate running down minutemen
and his sexy  get out and help a wounded Mexican
Doc flicks a  at an approaching Goon
Machete unveils a Gatling Gun with a special mount that affixes to the front of the chopper
Booth scrambles to arm himself, but he's cornered
He tries to take cover behind thugs, but-- Machete on the motorcycle with the Gatling Gun mows down Booth, machine gunning him in half
Booth looks down at his own white shirt, now stained crimson and ripped to shreds as he falls to the ground in
While the battle between chopshoppers and militia rages on-- appears with -- Machete
Machete stops, turns to see Elektra, bound and gagged in Torrez's control
(') You never learned to stay down, pendejo
killed you once
can do it again
Machete skids into the warehouse
Fuel barrels line a far wall
Torrez is ready for him
All roads lead to Hell, eh, Machete
Machete squints
Flashes back to the earlier scene
The two images blur into one
(') Most people die in the fire, but you survived, you unlucky bastard
was born in the fire
It wasn't luck
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 83
Faith
Yeah, faith got you a good job picking melons
While  bought the world
What good is it
for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul
Mark 8:36
know it better than you Machete
Your father taught it to me, too
Torrez  Machete The two  with sword and machete
Elektra rolls on the ground, dodging Torrez's rain of blows from the samurai swords
One sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety
The distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand and slash Torrez across the front
On the edge of death Torrez seems to soften
( ) Machete, we were friends
We stood for something
Machete impales  between the eyes
Blood shoots out his mouth
'm still standing
Puta
Machete pulls out the blade, Torrez falls dead
and black smoke light up the sky behind Machete
- Machete drives his Gun Bike south
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 84
appear behind him
He pulls over
The Officer walks up
His flashlight blinds him
What's the problem officer
The Officer just stands there, silent, his flashlight blinding in Machete's eyes
(') Let me give you my
Machete reaches for his knife: then he sees the cops shoes; ; It's
What's your name
Machete
called in some favors
Look at this
All the right papers; a real identity
You could start over, be a real person
She puts the green card in his hand
Machete looks at it, then crumbles it and drops it
Why do  want to be a real person
when 'm already a myth
Where will you go
Torrez was just an errand boy
'm going to find the man who sent the message
Elektra steps into the headlights
She's dressed in hot 'll ride with you
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 85
They kiss
Machete and Elektra drive away on the gun bike
The cop car abandoned on the side of the road; lights still flashing

family of illegals crossing the border in the desert, see a up ahead
They make for it, opening it up and drinking heavily from the water supply
brings one of them down and the others scramble for safety but there's someone out there, shooting at them
hushes the younger ones
Say a prayer to El Machete to protect you
The younger ones start to pray
patrols the area and we see it's  taking potshots at the illegals
Did you get `em
2ND don't know
They're like brown jackrabbits
Let's see if they'll show their little white tails
Flicks on a highpowered light by the side mirrors on the The light is on long enough to illuminate a coming straight for them
Holy shit
His words gurgle in his throat as his head is severed from his body
2nd  freaks and makes a run for it
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 86
Stumbles in the dark, in the dust
Scrambles but can't get to his feet as he sees the outline of a   above him
Young illegals' prayers continue as the  comes down on 2nd
Sounds of struggle, slaughter
then silence
Light a candle
Say a prayer
Young illegal opens eyes
There's a glass candle in his hands, but no one else around
Instead of Christ or a Virgin on the candle is a silhouette of
