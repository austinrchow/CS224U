Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but sleek form of an Ohio-class  ballistic missile submarine
--                                               4 In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat in the glow of their instruments
The  and his  crowd around , the sonarman
Sixty knots
No way, Barnes
the reds don't have anything that fast
Checked it twice, skipper
It's a real unique signature
No cavitation, no reactor noise
doesn't even sound like screws
He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange
The captain studies the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an amorphous trace, representing the bogey
What the hell is it
'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of ours
Sir
Contact changing heading to two-one-four, diving
Speed eighty knots
Eighty knots
Eighty knots
Still diving, depth nine hundred feet
Port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet
(simultaneously) Still diving, depth nine hundred feet
Port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet
Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the intruder
The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side- scan sonar array
The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls
(low, to Captain) It's getting tight in here
We can still give him a haircut
Helm, come right to oh six niner, down five degrees
Coming right to oh six niner, sir
Down five degrees
Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet narrowing to seventy-five
Sir, we have a proximity warning light
That's too damn close
We've gotta back off
Range to contact, two hundred
Contact junked to bearing two six oh and accelerated to
one hundred thirty knots, sir
(really freaked now) Nothing goes one thirty
Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness
5 We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes rapidly under the sub's hull
Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways
6 The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted
Turbulence
We're in its wake
Everyone shouting at once
The power flickers low
Helm, all stop
Full right rudder
All stop
Full right rudder
Hydraulic failure
Planes are not responding, sir
Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan display
Hydraulics restored, sir
7 The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with nightmarish slow-motion
The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping along and bouncing off
One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw prangs the wall with an earsplitting --
8 With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner hatches
Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods, blast into the room
Everything vanishes instantly in white spray
/                                            9 Everyone is hurled off his feet
The planesman flights to recover control of the yoke
Collision alarm
Collision alarm
Lighten her up, Charlie
The torpedo room is flooded, sir
Blow all tanks
Blow everything
Passing twelve hundred feet
Blowing main tanks
Twelve hundred fifty feet
10 The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section, its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell
11 The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified
Main forward tanks ruptured
Passing thirteen hundred feet
Too deep to pump auxiliaries
All back full
All back full
Answering all back full
Passing thirteen hundred fifty feet
fourteen hundred
fourteen fifty
The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din
We're losing her
Launch the buoy
The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button
red light comes on
The Captains takes a deep breath
12 tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent to the surface
second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a ledge, tearing open its pressure hull
13 , just flashes and impressions, as
Seawater blasts down the corridors -- Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls -- Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds -- Bursts through hatches into the reactor room -- Blasts men    in a micro-second
/                                                   14 In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur
Descending in an avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below
a blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of the Cayman Trough
The abyss
--                                                15 Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky
The Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting

submersible oil-drilling platform,  , an island of light in the vast blackness
Its main framework connects two "tri- modules" consisting of three cylinders each
These contain living and work areas in a pressurized environment
An umbilical cable, thick as a man's thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer at the surface
In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or "toolpusher,"
He's talking (via headset) with two divers working outside
''  ,   '-'
Hey, you guys are milking that job
(Kentucky drawl) That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss
19 20 Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor
The working heart of the rig
The drill crew, in hardhats and mud- plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the chamber
The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate
The others are  ,  ,  , and Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest
(yelling) Bud
Hippy's on the bitch-box
It's a call from topside
That new company man
Kirkhill
That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole
Hey, Perry
One of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him
Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and those cable slings
This place is starting to look like my apartment
Perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully

(' ) ,
'm coming
Keep your pantyhose on
He enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust- gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs
He picks up the phone
punches down a line
Brigman here
Kirkhill
What's going on
(pause) am calm
'm a calm person
Is there some reason why  shouldn't be calm
Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens
/                                             22 The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago, packed with instrumentation
At the end is a small bay with multiple viewports
Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver can be seen welding
He is accompanied by a large submersible, , and by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or , call
Little Geek is an underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little machine
The rig's  pilots is  '' , who stands by the window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee
His pet white rat, , crawls contentedly around his shoulders
The door
Hippy jumps, slops his coffee
Bud strides in
Not calm
Son of a bitch
He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked , blasting through the water from a big hydrophone loudspeaker
All divers
Drop what you're doing
Everybody out of the pool
/                                             A22 Flatbed's pilot,  ' ' , can be clearly seen behind a bubble canopy
She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the business
She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver, '' , in his work
Little Geek hovers around them like a tiny helicopter
One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the pipe
Here you go, hon'
Just in time, sugar
They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module
Dammit, we just got out here
There was a time when  would have asked why
One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he narrowly avoids
: / -                                             23 Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny riding on its top deck
It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the surface of the water in the chamber above
Little Geek follows like an obedient dog
-/                                                   24 The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched through it
From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it
The chamber also contains  , a similar submersible
Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys are helping the divers out of the water
The water at this depth is only about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune- fingered
Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish face
What's goin' on
How come we got recalled
Hell is  know
One Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them
Catfish is unzipping his bulky dry-suit
Just follow standard procedure, will ya
flog the dog till somebody tells us what's happening
Hey, Catfish, 'll sell you my October Penthouse for twenty bucks
Save you money, darlin'
the pages are all stuck together by now
Bud enters, approaching the group
What's goin' on, Boss
Folks, 've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig
She-hit
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security
Now you know exactly as much as  do
So just get your gear off and get up to control
There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes
: /                                             25 The whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing
DeMarco is on the main monitor, with his aides and Kirkhill visible b
g
At 09:22 local time this morning, an American nuclear submarine, the  Montana, with 156 men aboard, went down 22 miles from here
There has been no contact with the sub since then
The cause of the incident is not known
the reactions of the various drill crew members
shocked, hushed, curious
Your company has authorized the Navy's use of this facility for a rescue operation
The code name is Operation Salvor
You want us to search for the sub
No
We know where it is
But she's in 2000 feet of water and we can't reach her
We need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors, if any
Bud's scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to talk
Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type of thing
By the time we get our rescue submersible here the storm front will be right on us
But you can get your rig in under the storm and be on- site in fifteen hours
That makes you our best option right now
Hippy, born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid, leans forward
Why should we risk our butts on a job like this
have been authorized to offer you all special- duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal dive pay
Hell, for triple time 'd crawl through razor blades and shower off with lime juice
'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire and call me names
Look,  don't know what kind of a deal you guys worked out with the company, but my people are not qualified for this
they're oil workers
four-man  team will transfer down to you to supervise the operation
You can send down whoever you like, but 'm the toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the safety of these people, there's me
then there's God
Understand
If things get dicey, 'm pulling the plug
think we're all on the same wavelength, Brigman
Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled, shall we
: /                                  26 Bud stands beside the hatchway as the others file out toward their tasks
They comment gravely as they pass
When Lindsey finds out about this, it's not gonna be a pretty sight
They're going to have to shoot her with a tranquilizer gun
: --                                                        27 single Navy Sea King churns through the rain under massive thunderheads
The sea below is whipped by the storm
/
28 , four pairs of black military size twelves line up, onto
a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles
, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs
And a slender woman in her early thirties
She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed conservatively in a skirt and jacket
Meet
Project Engineer for Deepcore
She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her
Eventually
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of gear, getting tossed around by the storm
The SEALs are dressed alike in black fatigues
They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous special-forces types
The leader of the  team,  , makes his way forward to the cockpit
The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a helicopter in position
Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea
No way 'm putting her down
shouldn't even be flying in this shit
(cool) Just hold it over the deck
Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft
He nods to the others SEALs, , , and
In the open side door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the coil
One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping to the deck
One, two, three
Coffey looks at her
You want to be on that ship, there's only one way it's going to happen
He's sure she won't go for it
It's his certainty that gets her
She sets her jaw
Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth
Then grabs the rope and slides down
/                                           29 Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty feet to the deck
She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides
Her nylons are ruined
An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases using the rescue sling
The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across the deck
They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the mounting storm
: 30 Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables
Behind it, the mass of Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern thrusters
/                                             31 Bud, his feet propped up, uses joystick controls to 'fly' Deepcore, maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles
He is guided by the side-scan sonar display, with Hippy assisting in the sonar shack
Through the front viewport, Flatbed can be seen out ahead
McBride appears on the bridge monitor, holding a sheet of weather-fax
(on screen) Well, it's official, sportsfans
They're calling it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be making our lives real interesting in a few hours
--                                              32 Bud responds via video
Fred, huh
don't know
Hurricanes should be named after women
McBride looks up as the bridge door opens
Lindsey enters in a blast of wind, wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off
Maybe Bud is right
: /                                             33 Bud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen
can't believe you let them do this
(unpreturbed, almost cheerful) Hi, Lins
thought you were in Houston
was, but  managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here
Only here isn't where  left it, is it, Bud
Wasn't up to me
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work
We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake can't believe you let them grab my rig
Your rig
My rig
designed the damn thing
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it
So as long as they're hold the pink slip,  go where they tell me
You wimp
had a lot riding on this
They bought you
more like least rented you cheap-- 'm switching off now
Virgil, you wiener
You never could stand up to fight
You-- Bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead
Bye
Hippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up
Virgil
God,  hate that bitch
Yeah, well you never should have married her then
Bud nods fatalistically
: /                                           34 Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to  , eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible
It slams violently in its steel cradle as the drill-ship rolls
Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible
Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall
She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs, lying on the deck
Stenciled on it are the words:
/ /
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up
Let's go, gentlemen
We either launch now or we don't launch
Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man
Take her up, Byron
Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches
The submersible is then swung out to the center of the launch well
It sways and gyrates above the furious water below
Lindsey drops into the upper hatch
/
35 Kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window
What the hell is she doing out there
Son of a bitch
(into microphone) Lindsey
get out of Cab Three
Bates is taking her down
36 Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the hatch
Bates is sick
Besides 've got more hours in this thing than he does
(to Coffey) little change of plan
The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs, jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into the walls
Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks
Lady, we better fish or cut bait
Just hold your water, okay
(to Kirkhill) So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it
/
37 The plug is pulled on DeMarco's patience
don't care who drives the damn thing
Just get my team in the water
Alright, alright
Christ Almighty
He gestured dismissively to McBride
Cab Three, you are clear to launch
/
38 Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever
Roger
(to Coffey) There's only one way it's going to happen
She pulls the lever hard
-
The shackle-release drops the sub
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks
Coffey et al have been slammed hard
Touchdown
The crowd goes wild
Explorer
Cab Three
We are styling
(filtered) Roger, Cab Three
Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port
Moving up through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig
Cab Three free-falls into increasing darkness
Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo
/
39 One Night is driving the tug one-handed, pouring coffee from a thermos and rocking out to the great truck-driving song "Willing" on the beat-box she's got propped up on the sonar rig
Fighting white-line fever in the best tradition
40 Bud and Hippy come in for a rousing chorus
/ 've been driving every kinda rig that's ever been maaaaade
41 Lit up like a proud Peterbilt, the rig crossed the trackless wastes
We hear them singing, carried
/                                              42 In total blackness, the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the umbilical cable
Two hundred feet below it, the lights of Deepcore resolve out of the darkness
Now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom like some monster lawnmower
(
) Deepcore, Deepcore
this is Cab Three on final approach
(
) Gotcha, Cab Three
Who is that
That You, Lindsey
/                                             43 Bud stop singing and snaps around at the mention of her name
(
) None other
Bud's expression is nothing less than stricken
Oh no
you gotta be kidding me
/ /                                                 44 Lindsey executes a 180 degree turn and cruises over the control module, back through the -frame toward the docking hatch
The flange of Cab Three's lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rig's back
There is a  as it mates up
/ /                     45 Lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber
The SEALs drop down behind her, passing their gear through hand-over-hand
The chamber is spartan, with steel benches, a folding card table, breathing masks, and medical supplies
Catfish greets them through the tiny porthole at one end
Howdy, y'all
Hey, Lindsey
'll be damned
You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings
Couldn't stay away
You running mixture for us
Good
Couldn't ask for better
Okay, here we go
Start equalizing, y'all
of inrushing compressed gas
The pressure in the chamber rises
The breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen
Catfish monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the gauges with a practiced eye
Lindsey and the SEALs all grab their noses and start making funny faces
popping their ears with the familiar diver's 'equalization' technique
They continue as: Get comfortable
The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down
The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later
We've been fully briefed, Mrs
Brigman
Don't call me that, okay
hate that
Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of
(as if by rote) High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first
Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation
Very good
About one person in twenty just can't handle it
They go buggo
They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth
We're checked out
Oh
chamber runs
Uh huh, that's good
(Coffey turn away) Well, hey
you guys know any songs
They ignore her
Start going over some diagrams of the Montana's interior
It's going to be a long six hours
--                                   46 Catfish checks his watch, then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri- mix manifold, watching the gauges
Satisfied, he leans over to the pressure window in the door, checking out the SEALs
Hippy has come down from the control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers
Jammer is in a chair, reading a Louis 'Amour paperback
Those guys ain't so tough
fought plenty of guys tougher'n them
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender
Catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of Hippy's face
You see this
They used to call this the Hammer
Hippy wasn't born then
47 It looks like the end of a long bus trip
Everyone silent
leafing through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring
Lindsey has her feet propped up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases
She casually toes open one of the latches, then the other
Glances at Coffey
He's reading
She begins to lift the lid with her toe
Gets a  , of packing foam, and what looks like a
Then
Coffey's foot comes down on the lid, slamming it shut
Startled, she looks up into his cool gaze
Curiosity killed the cat

closing values
spinning the wheel on the chamber hatch
as it cracks open with a virgin's sigh and swings aside
'all'er done to a turn and ready to serve
Everybody okay
The SEALs nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear
Lindsey exists first, followed by Monk, Wilhite, and Schoenick
Coffey bends to relatch the small equipment case
He is alone for one moment in the chamber
He raises his hand and stares at it
The fingertips are trembling the slightest bit
He clenches them into a fist and walks out
49 As Lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig, she bumps into a large, dark mass
Hey, was there a wall here before
don't remember a wall here
Oh, Jammer
Hi
The 'wall' grins down to her
Howdy, there, little lady
Coffey emerges behind them and, ignoring Lindsey, faces Jammer
(to Jammer) Show us the dive prep area
We need to check out your gear
Jammer scowls, turns and leads the SEALs in the sub-bay
Catfish and Lindsey exchange a look
Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit
: 50 , bathed in the light of the sonar display
He is making kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's lips
Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease
, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway
She and Bud size each other up
He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary
Well, well
Mrs
Brigman
Not for long
Lindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost unconsciously checking, checking
getting the pulse of her big iron baby
You never did like being called that, did you
Not even when it meant something
(looking through the front port) Is that One Night up in Flatbed
Who else
Lindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console
Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey
51 One Night mimes a puking motion, finger down her throat
Then she replies with sickening sweetness
Oh, hi, Lindsey
52 Lindsey fives the sonar shack the once-over
She tweaks some knobs
can't believe you were dumb enough to come down
Now you're stuck here for the storm
dumb, hot-rod
dumb
Look,  didn't come down here to fight
She crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor
Bud bolts out of the chair to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to take over
/-/                               53 Bud catches up with Lindsey in the corridor, and through the following keeps pace with here as she make here inspection
Then why'd you come down
She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe
He almost slams into her
She moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level
You need me
Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than  do
What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off
What would have you done
Wow, you're right
Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves
Coulda been a disaster
On the lower level landing, Lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine rooms
54 Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and roaring machinery
Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit panels
(yelling) You wanna know what  think
Not particularly
Jeez, look where this is set
Morons
She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely
think you were worried about me
That must be it
Lindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up
No,  think you were
Come on, admit it
was worried about the rig
've got over four years invested in this project
Oh, yeah, right
and you only had three years with me
She looks up at him
You've got to have priorities
: '                                                          55 Darkness
The door opens and Bud snaps on the light
My bunk's the only one  can guarantee won't be occupied
You can grab a couple hours before we get there
Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the rig
Rank had its privileges
His hand on the door is just level with her eyes
She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium (something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from )
What are you still wearing that for
don't know
Divorce ain't final
Forgot to take it off
Bud stays in the doorway
Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the narrow bunk
Start unconsciously straightening the room
haven't worn mine in months
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it
The Suit
Do you always have to call him that
The Suit
It makes you sound like such a hick
His name is Michael
Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks
Bud eyes her, sounding too causal
So what about "Michael" then
Mr
Brooks Brothers
Mr
You still seeing him
No,  haven't seen him in a few weeks
What happened
Bud, why are you doing this
It's not part of you life any more
'll tell you what happened
you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh
You're right, Bud
It was just that simple
Aren't you clever
You should get your own show
Ask Dr
Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms
She closes the watertight door, forcing him out
Locks it
She turns and throws her shoe hard against the far wall
She flops down on the bed, sitting
staring at the wall
Her armor is gone
She looks small and vulnerable
long beat
She reaches over to the tiny sink
Amid the clutter is a bottle of Bud's aftershave
She unscrews it and takes a sniff
Catches herself
Tosses it
Shit
/                                                      56 Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger
He pulls the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet
He reaches forward to flush
Can't do it
Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring
He puts it on and washes his hands
The right hand stays faintly blue no matter how hard he scrubs
Shit
: 57 The platform is stopped, hovering in place
Like a great spacecraft setting down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze
Flatbed releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside
: -                                                            58 , actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from a towed  (laser imaging sonar) rig
It shows a faint, blurry outline of the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall
There is no detail
finger points to a flat ledge nearby
An "" has been put on with a grease pencil
(
) This is us
We're just on the edge of the Cayman Trough
The Montana is here, on its side, 300 meters away and 70 meters below us
We think she slid down the wall, and lodged against this outcropping
, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub-bay
The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have their dry-suits on
The pre-dive briefing
Lindsey, One Night, and Hippy will crew the submersibles
Wilhite is going around clipping on everybody
This tells us how much radiation we get
Hey, whoah
can't handle no radiation, man
Forget it
Include me out
Hippy, you pussy
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months
We'll take reading as we go
If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away
Simple
Okay
Hippy's not going
McWhirter, you can run Little Geek
Bud pats the top of a small , sitting next to its larger brother, Big Geek
No way
No way
He can't fly an  worth shit
'll go
Shit
(to all) On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me, and you will follow my instructions without discussion
Is this clear
Alright,  want everyone finished prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes
The rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear
Some are studying the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout
Bud takes Coffey aside as the others prepare
Look, it's three
These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep
You better start cutting them some slack
can't afford slack, Brigman
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around
It won't work
You gotta know how to handle these people
we have a certain way of doing things here
'm not interested in your way of doing things
Just get your team ready to dive
End of discussion
Coffey is walking away
Burning, Bud crosses to his gear locker
Picks up his helmet
Finler is suiting out next to him
Hey, you know your hand is blue
Shut up and get your gear on
, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable
Hippy points to the heavy equipment case that says
/
've been meaning to ask you what this thing is
Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like a space helmet, and a large backpack
Fluid breathing system
We just got them
We use it if we need to go really deep
How deep
Deep
(shrugs) It's classified
you know
Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed
Pressure doesn't get to you
Catfish is grappling with the concept
You're saying you get liquid in your lungs
Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion
Monk take a clear plastic box full of -rings off the shelf and dumps them out
He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside it to drain into the box
Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's shoulder
Hey
Check this out
He drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid
Beany is forced under the surface
He struggled for a second, and bubbles come out of his mouth
Then he casually swims around in there, completely submerged
breathing liquid
Catfish and the others stare into the box, amazed
See
He's diggin' it
Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his lungs
Then hands him back to Hippy
The rat is annoyed, but otherwise alright
This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest thing  ever saw
: /                                                   59 Three sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore
Cab One and Three, with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the Flatbed
Lindsey is in the lead
She approaches the cliff-like drop-off and starts to descend
Com-check, everybody
Flatbed, you on line
Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and clear
Cab Three
Cab Three, check
Right behind you
(
) What's you depth, Cab Three
1840

60
70
Going over the wall
Coming to bearing 065
Everybody stay tight and in sight
Starting out descent
Divers, how're you doing
60 Eight divers ride the back of Flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to the fields
Bud and his civilian crew, Catfish, Finler, and Jammer
sit across from the SEALs
They are in their gear and breathing from umbilical hooked in Flatbed's low-pressure manifold
Okay so far
How deep's the drop-off here
This here's the bottomless pit, baby
Two and a half miles straight down
Knock off the chatter
Cab One, you getting anything
/
61 Lindsey consults her array of instruments
Cab One, do you see it yet
The magnetometer is pegged
Side-scan is showing a big return, but  don't see anything yet
Are you sure you got the depth right on this
(
, filtered) You should be almost to it, ace
She turns the submersible and
The spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the Montana
It dwarfs Cab One,
Uh, yeah, roger that
uh, found it
/                                               62 Cab One maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab Three move above it
Wilhite take readings with a hand-held neutron counter
Cab One, radiation readings
Neutron counter's not showing very much
Wilhite, anything
Negative
Nominal
Just continue forward along the hull
Copy that, continuing forward
You just want me to get shots of everything, right
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving
We're on a tight timeline
Copy that
The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the puny beams of their lights
It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as eerie in its final resting place
On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving
Ahead, in the lights, is a white painted circle
That's the midship hatch
You see it, Cab Three
Roger,  see it
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch
Check
Then  just hang with these guys, right
Right
How do you want me
Just hold above it
Alright,  team
Wilhite, Schoenick, and Monk unhook their short whip-umbilicals from the central manifold and roll off the side of Flatbed
They maneuver down toward the sub's hatch
Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area
63 Hippy turns to Perry back in the lockout chamber, ready to launch Little Geek
The  has a handheld neutron-counter gripped in its manipulator arm
(
) Stand by on the
Perry, stand by on the
(to Little Geek) Sorry about this, little buddy
Better you than me, know what  mean
Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and feed out a length of tether
Hippy picks up the control box and watches the video screen, guiding the  toward the Montana's hatch
64 The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch
They open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk
He bangs on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed against it
It's flooded
Alright, 'm opening her up
Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims backs out immediately
He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and Hippy flies the  into the hatch
/
/                                            65 Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull
Beyond Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll toward us in procession
Several of the hatch covers have been forced partway open by the warping of the hull
(
) Radiation is nominal
The warheads must still be intact
How many are there
(
) 24 Trident missiles
Eight MIRVs per missile
That's 192 warheads
And how powerful are they
Your  is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons nominal yield
Say times time Hiroshima

) Jesus Christ
this is World War Three in a can

) Let's knock off the chatter, please
66 --  '
Passing through a hatch, into a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery
The engine room
(
) Getting a reading
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe
67 Monk moves into the opening
Alright
Let's get in there
Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark corridor beyond
/                                                 68 Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a five-story building
Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the ledge which supports the vast sub
Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail
The torn and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down
Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away from the rest of the hull
We'll go in through that large breach
Let's go, guys
Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward
The opening is a black mouth in their lights
Coffey moves inside
Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him
Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in sight
Watch for hatches that could close on you, or any loose equipment that could fall
Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside
/                                     69 They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of bunks
The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs
Papers float in gentle eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends
Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward
As they pass sealed doors, Coffey pounds with a tool, listening
All flooded
70 Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether
Through a hatch into the engine room
Their lights play over flooded machinery
/                            71 From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack center
He pulls at a buckled watertight door
It's jammed
Give me a hand
Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey
Together they wrench the door open on its squealing hinges
It give way suddenly, flying open
The suction pulls
It slams Bud's shoulder
He turns
He jerks back, gasping
Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman
The ensign seems unmarked, merely dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth
Coffey reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way
Alright, let's keep moving
We knew we were going to see this
They enter the control room
Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage
Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl in the currents
languid, weightless waltz
They move through the carnage
Their lights pick out tableaux
the planesman still strapped in his chair, someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down
Dead faces, pale in the lights
Still
We see only glimpses
Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over
Removes the missile arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck
Moves on
All business
Bud turns back to his guys
Checking them
He notices Jammer is breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet
Catfish, Finler, and Sonny aren't much better
wave a panic seems imminent
How you guys doing
'm alright, 'm dealing
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud
It ain't
'm sorry
We're here now
Let's get her done
We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it
He's sweating rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady
His projection of calm to the others is his own salvation
Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room
This part  do alone
Brigman, take you men and continue aft
Split up into two teams of two
Let's get moving
we head back in fourteen minutes
Bud leads his team into a narrow corridor
/                                                     72 They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to a vertical hatch, open
a pit of darkness below
Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny
You guys stay on this deck
Hook you line onto mine
Any problem, you tug my line
Two pulls
Jammer, you're with me
Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who barely fits through
Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a carabiner and move along the corridor with the others
/
73 Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing
Her strobes sear the darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible circles it like a bee
74 Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens it
He removes several plastic binders
the code books
He also grabs handfuls of classified documents and orders, and a set of missile arming keys, all which he places in a pouch at his waist
75 Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping on the walls and hatches periodically
After he taps, he waits a few moments
There are no answering taps
They open doors and shine their lights into the rooms
The are bodies, but they seem anonymous
Crumpled shapes in khaki or blue
They undog and open a hatch
Beyond it is the largest chamber of the sub, the
76 The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all
The chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork
Where are we
Missile compartment
Those are the launch tubes
They sweep their lights around the chamber
Jammer turns
his beam illuminating a body just beyond the door
coveralled seaman turning slowly in the eddying current
Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the man's face
One scuttles out of his gaping mouth
Lord Almighty
Hey, you okay
Bud goes to him
Gets up close to his face
Sees that he's not
That he's hyperventilating
Fighting nausea
Bud grabs him by the shoulders
Deep and slow, big guy
Deep and slow
Just breathe easy
they're all dead, Bud
They're all dead
thought
some of them
you know
'm taking you back out
No
'm okay now
just don't
can't go any further in
Bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized
He looks at his watch
Checker Jammer's pressure gauges
Okay, Jammer
No problem
You stay right here
have to go there to the end
you'll see my lights
We'll stay in voice contact
Just hold onto the rope
Five more minutes
Okay
Yeah, okay
Okay
He moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge cylinders
He pays out the lifeline as he goes

As the thermite ignites, it generates an intense arc-bright light and tremendous heat
The circuit chasses melt
Coffey works calmly in the infernal glare
78 Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the missile compartment
He goes down a stairwell to the lower level , Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights
He starts to get nervous
Suddenly his own lights begin to , flickering lower and lower
They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing
The darkness closes in
Bud
You readin' me
, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet lights, which are dimming and flickering
He hears nothing from his helmet transceiver
, smacks the side of his helmet
Shakes the transceiver on his belt
Nothing
just static
Then even the static dies
Panic time
He grabs the safety line and pulls twice
Hard
It is snagged on a sharp metal edge ten feet from him
He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the thing
The line severs
Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward him
His eyes bug
He looks all around in the darkness
Can't see Bud
Can't decide what to do
We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a flywheel
Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls
It is a cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights
It grows brighter
He turns slowly toward it
The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him
Bud
Is that you
, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source
Guess what, Jammer
It's not Bud
In the brightest center of the glow, is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls
Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright astonishment melting into terror
The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically
The shifting shadow falls across Jammer
He finally snaps out of his fixity
Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand through the treacherous wreckage
His harness catches on a twisted pipe
He struggles, totally out of control
the big man reduced to a blind panic
Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength
He tears free of the entangling debris
Launches like a torpedo
slamming his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway
His tri-mix regulator takes the full brunt of the impact
, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position
The strange radiance is gone
His dive light flare back to full brightness
Jammer
Answer me, buddy,
He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place
seizure
Bud grapples with him
Hang on, big guy
Hand on
Catfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later
They leap into the fray
He's convulsing
It's his mixture
Too much oxygen
Then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with the valves on his breathing gear
Crank it down, man
We're gonna losing him
, it's stuck
goddamnit
You got it
You got it
Yeah, yeah
yeah
It's turning
Jammer's convulsion ends
He goes limp
We gotta get him out of here
Come on
(to Jammer) Hang on, buddy
They drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly back along the lifeline

Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose power
Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of hell right at her
It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get a glimpse
What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid, open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside
like some hallucinatory jet engine
And it's hauling ass
Lindsey jinks left
The object jogs right
She fights the control as her sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail
-
Her power comes back up
Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in time to see the object racing away in a broad arc
It pulls a high- turn and dives straight down
We see the object zip behind Flatbed
One Night can't see it
The thing spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the wall into the abyss until it is lost to view
Lindsey excited, amazed
dazed
Her hands are shaking
Suddenly Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency
(
) Meet me at Flatbed
This is a diver emergency

She has a hard time focusing on what he's saying
Finally
Copy you, Bud

Bud and the  are in the room, the others hovering outside
Whattya think

This type of thing
there's not much can do
The coma could last hours or days

Negative
But there was definitely a Russian bogey

Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked within fifty miles of here
and now we don't know what the hell they are
Okay,  don't have any choice
'm confirming you to go to Phase Two
Wilhite and Schoenick glance uneasily at each other
Coffey is silent
He is vibrating with tension
his fists clenched to prevent the shaking
He is wrestling with the moment, knowing it is, in a way, a point of no return
Is there any problem
Yes
mean no
Negative, sir

Lets it out
Phase Two is clearly a big deal

Did you get anything on the cameras
Video or anything
No
Look, forget it
don't want to talk about it
Fine
Be that way
don't know what  saw
Okay
Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine
It's a Russian submersible
No problem
But you think it's something else
What
One of ours
No
Whose then
Lindsey
Talk to me
Lindsey is wrestling with a feeling which is somehow also certain knowledge

He panicked and pranged his regulator
But what did he see that made him panic
What do you think he saw
don't know

Using large lift bags and Flatbed's big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident -4 missiles partway out of its launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing several of the  warheads within

The rig crew are all waiting
Like a crack pit-crew Bud's people leap onto Flatbed while its deck is still awash and start to work on to Navy divers, unsealing their helmets and uncoupling their umbilicals
Hippy and Bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped in one of the 's gear bags
Coffey emerges from the hatch
Don't touch that
Just step away

Excusez moi
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time

He half-crawls to the ladder going up to the winch-house

It's dropping straight to us
She puts the signal over the speakers and the room fills with eerie
Bud shouts over the intercom

The crane topples slowly over the back
It rolls down the slope of the drop- off, gathering speed
Then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon
The coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon
And they're still attached
Oh shit
An agonizing few seconds
Then
the cable pulls taut

The rig is slammed by the shock
Everyone is knocked off his feet, into walls and equipment

In rolls at him, crushing his legs against machinery
The fire roars into the room

The place is going nuts
Water floods from the moonpool as the rig tilts
Wilhite is dancing across the deck, leaping over compressed- gas cylinders which are rolling around loose
Cab One jumps clear off its cradle and slides  across the deck
Wilhite, running before the 12-tom juggernaut, had no place to go
The  dives into the churning moonpool
Cab One slams into the end wall, then spins and rolls toward Hippy
He starts to run
Drop something

Beany, in his zip-loc bag, is lying in the path of the slide submersible
Hippy runs back
Scoops up the baggie

He makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him, buckling the steel doorframe
Wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool
He gets his fingers over the top
Pulls himself up
steel helium tank slams against his fingers, crushing them, and he falls back
More tanks bounce over the lip of the pool, hammering Wilhite down into the foaming water
He doesn't surface

He is slammed against the ceiling by the force of the water
A116 B116 Lew Finler, Tommy Ray Dietz, and Lupton McWhirter fight their way toward the door as the drill room floods rapidly
Ahead, the big automated watertight door is closing like a motorized bank-vault
They reach it just as it is closing, but can't prevail against the strength of the motors , we can see them screaming soundlessly at the tiny pressure window in the door
We can hear the dull  of their pounding

Smoke and steam choke the dark chambers
Nearby, Lindsey grabs Hippy's arm as he is running past and drags him into the blazing compressor room
Hands him her seawater hose
Wide-eyes, he starts blasting everything in sight with water
No
Hold it on me
She rushed into the teeth of the fire as Hippy blasts her with a spray of water, following her into the intense heat
She grabs Monk, who is semiconscious, and drags him out of the blazing room
Hippy dancing back with the hose, tripping, blasting her in the face
But it works
They get Monk clear
118 Bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the trapped men
He claws futility at the door
The motors and the fail-safe latching mechanism are on the opposite side
Through the pressure window he watches helplessly as they drown
We don't see what he sees, but we know what he sees
Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing torrent thunders in
Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor
He scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably
He's not going to make it
He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through
Grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with the strength of this arms
It doesn't work
The steel door closes on the fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe
But something amazing happens
His wedding ring lodges between the door and frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from sealing and locking
It resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing
The freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear
Heeyy

They see his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door
Sonny wedges a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry
Catfish whips open his jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator
He is sprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood
Together they force open the door
Bud is blown through in a torture of water
Sonny is thrown back into some pipes
Breaks his arm
Together they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow

as if carrying a great weight
The air is still thick with smoke
The power off

Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the storage room across the hall
Jammer is still unconscious
Coffey and Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table
He is conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted
Did you find Wilhite
No
He and Bud lock eyes
Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze blames Coffey
He turns away

had no choice
Coffey's manner is subdued, contrite
marked contrast to his previous brusque arrogance
He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the tight brotherhood of a  unit

've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down
Rather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected her in a different way
She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done, and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic
Need some help
Thanks
No,  can handle it

there won't be enough to run the heaters
In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker
What about -2

It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck
It comes right up behind her
She doesn't know it's there
It hovers sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look
She becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her
She turns slowly
We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in her faceplate
more powerful glow washes up onto her from below
Her eyes go down
She gasps, absolutely stunned
Above the edge of the wall, Over sixty feet across
It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow
Lindsey stand before it, unable to move
Absolutely rapt
Captivated by its ethereal beauty
It begins to turn, majestically, one rounded wing passing only a few feet above her
She reaches up
Touches it as it passes over her
Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized
The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall
She is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water
About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos
She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful machine glides into the depths
Gets all set for a shot and
The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'
She pivots, trying to get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a meteor

'm sorry
God, you are the most stubborn woman  ever knew
need you to believe me, Bud

Do seem stressed out
Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech
No
Bud, this is me, Lindsey
Okay
You know me better than anybody in the world
Now watch my lips
saw these things
touched one of them
And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build
it glided
It was the most beautiful thing 've ever seen

She moves close to him
Eyes alive and luminous
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive
Like a

Bud, you have to trust me
please
don't think they mean us harm
don't know how  know that, it's just a feeling
How can  go on a feeling
You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'
We all see what we want to see
Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear
Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that

can't, Lindsey

Keeps his hands clenched in fists so they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten
Get something straight
You people are under my authority-- Look, podner
we don't work for you, we don't take orders from you, and we don't much like you
In addition to which your momma dresses you funny
Coffey's eyes are straight razors
He slashes them from face to face
You can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation in front of his own men
Bud defuses it
'Fish'
Yuh
Take the first watch in sonar
Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance
One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay
Gimme a couple of hours
as everyone leaves
Winding tighter
: --                                         132 Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead
They have a small port removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an
The black box Lindsey glimpsed earlier
As the two SEALs work like surgeons, we see past Coffey's shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him, which looks out into the perpetual blackness
Something appears
a goofy shark face
Big Geek rises silently in front of the port
It moves a little, trying to get a peek over Coffey's shoulder
/                                            133 Hippy is twiddling his joysticks, watching the screen like a ferret
Come on
move to the left
just a little more
come on,
Squared Away
that's it-- , Geek's
Coffey is blocking Hippy's view of whatever it is they're working on
Abruptly, be moves
The warhead is lying there in plain sight, detonator wires hooked up
Hippy's eyes bug out
He knows exactly what it is
Pretty radical, guys
Pretty radical
He hurries to the  and puts it into
/  --                            134 Video image of the SEALs working
It  on a clear view of the warhead
(
) Say hello to
Bud has his face right up to screen
He frowns, skeptical
Come on, man
What else could it be
Why bring it here
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians
Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot
Oh, uh
hi, Lins
Bud whips around
Lindsey, standing quietly in the doorway
It's apparent from expression she's been watching them for some time
She looks ready to kill somebody
Then she's gone
135 Bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it,  will
Lindsey
Wait a second-- She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room
It's locked
Before Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-extinguisher off the wall and pounds on the steel door like a big gong
Needless to say, it opens
She pushes past Schoenick, see the bomb lying there naked
You've got some huevos bringing this
thing
into my rig
With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here
Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me
You don't need to know the details of this mission
you're better off if you don't
You're right
don't
just need to know that this thing is out of here
You hear me, Roger Ramjet
Mrs
Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission
believe the stress is affecting you
(to Schoenick) Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer
Schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip
Bullshit, you can't do that
Oww
goddamnit
Lindsey goes bananas, trying to get Schoenick's big hands off her arms
Bud slams his hand down on the intercom button
Emergency
Maintenance room
Emergency
He pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on Coffey
warning him with a look that is not to be messed with
Coffey is braced back against the worktable
an odd stance, with one arm behind his back
Suddenly there's a crowd outside the door as Catfish, Hippy, One Night, and Sonny come running up
Confrontation time
Sirens going
About a million volts of electricity in the air
Bud braces Schoenick
Let her go
Do it
right now
He does
Lindsey jerks away
Rubs her arms
You dumb jarhead motherf-- Chill out, Lindsey
What's the problem
Everyone is frozen in place
Bud a Coffey
snake and mongoose, glaring
Bud pulls Lindsey back into the corridor
Nothing
We were just leaving
(to her) Weren't we
, as Bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor
Hands behind his back
In his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the 45
He turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind
he seems to sag
When he looks at Schoenick, his eyes are wounds
hunted animal
Voice shaky
They can't be trusted
They're turning against us
We may have to take
steps
136 Lindsey, Bud, Hippy
Bud slows, letting them trail behind the others
Lins, stay away from that guy
mean it
Yeah
The dude's in bad shape
you see his hands
He's got the shakes
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command
He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis
And he's got a nuclear weapon
So, as a personal favor to me
will you put your tongue in neutral for a while
Man,  give this a sphincter-factor of about nine point five
137 Coffey goes to the dome port
Looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection into the void
Eternal night
Coffey's face in the window
Stuck to the acrylic bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws
Coffey stares out
Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on, spreadeagle and screaming
: -/-                                              138 Under a single worklight, a couple of conspirators
Lindsey and Hippy hunch over Big Geek
The  grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy
When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit
Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada
Let's go for it
We could get lucky
139 Lindsey and Hippy next to Big Geek
Their voices are tinny but intelligible
(
) don't know
really oughta talk to Bud about this
Watching them in the dark
Alone
(
) No
Just you and me
We get some proof, then tell them
Hippy, look
if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little
(
) gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there
Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot
Okay, gimme a couple hours on this
Coffey watches, his jaw clenched
/                                                  140 The lights are down
Those who can are grabbing some sleep
Snoring comes from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes
In the mess hall, Catfish and Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets
The cold has gotten intense
Water drips
The walls sweat with condensation
Lindsey can see her breath as she makes coffee
She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a face in a pile of blankets
hand comes out, takes the coffee
Thanks
Lindsey sips hers, staring
Her thoughts are far away
in the bottomless pit
She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping
His soft snoring downshifts into a loud rasp
Lindsey touches him gently on the shoulder
Virgil, turn on your side
Bud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response
The snoring stops
It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two have logged together
: 141 Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens
Too comfortable
He's asleep, chin on his chest
On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost imperceptibly faint trace appears
, which is by now familiar, becomes audible
Sonny shifts in his seat
Doesn't wake
142 Hippy puts his tools away, finished with the modifications to Big Geek
All set, big guy
Hey,  told you to wipe that grin off your face
He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door
Switches off the lights
Goes out
Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool
beat
Then
cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending shadows shifting across the top of the chamber
The surface begins to pulsate
Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering pseudopod as big around as a man's body
The transparent form pulses
an amoebic mass shivering in the air
It stretches, becoming a more refined form
Like a blindly probing glass python, it elongates and weaves across the room
It extends and extends, stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle
The 'head' or tip, a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward, as if it can see where it's going
143 Hippy trudges along the dark corridor
He reaches the men's head and goes in
As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor It 'looks' left and right
Then extends the length of the corridor, holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake
///                           144 three levels through the central ladderwell between the cylinders
The pseudopod enters and undulates upward
, we see its tip extend inside
Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious
Jammer is still unconscious
The pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on
, it's dark and quiet
Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her chair, her head buried in her arms on the table
The shimmering tentacle enters the room in total silence
It sways gracefully in to air, searching
It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying everything
It moves past Lindsey
Sensing something, she lifts her head, turning
sees the apparition next to her
Her eyes go wide
Amazement, but not fear
The tentacle is moving on, still searching
Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth
Bud blinks twice, then freezes
When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging open like a total goon
Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table
Catfish cracks one eye open
Turns away
Turns right back
both eyes open now
Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them
It seems to recognize Lindsey
It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her
She holds her ground, fascinated
The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face
her face
It is water, still clear and undulating
but definitely Lindsey
She gasps in surprise
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly
a perfect mimic of her expression
Lindsey laughs involuntarily
It laughs
without sound
Lindsey makes a face, sticking out her tongue
testing it
The liquid-Lindsey does the same
Bud has just had the rug jerked out from under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty will, considering
(whispering) think it likes you
It's trying to communicate
Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's
She reaches out her hand slowly
Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface
Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features
Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways
She draws her wet fingers out and studies them, amazed
Touches one fingertip to her tongue
Seawater
The pseudopod pulls back from her
It loops in the air dramatically, full circle
and ties itself into a knot
As the knot tightens down, it melts back into the body
The 'disappearing knot' trick
Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a magic show
She is transported
Show off
She looks at Bud
He grins broadly
He's with her now
The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room
Out to the corridor -                                                            145 Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area
They see the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk
Coffey's mind is blown
We can smell the insulation burning
He just stares
/                                          146 The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead
It studies the device for a few seconds
Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the warhead
They begin to lift it off its cart
147 Coffey finally jump-starts his brain
In a flash of insight, he runs to the big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor
He and Schoenick heave on the door
Like a guillotine blade it slices effortlessly through it
-- ,  , ,
as the body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor
It reverts to nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater
As the tendrils dissolve, the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed
' , however, the "stump" rears back like a cobra
It withdraws rapidly into the moonpool
The glow fades away
148 Sonny wakes up with a start as the  revs up into a   and then fades away
He scrambles to track it
Too late
149 Hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the length of the corridor
He missed the whole thing
150 Light on
Everybody there
Lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now that she's been proven right
Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a Russian water-tentacle
Lieutenant
No
Well, a breakthrough
Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in "The Shining"
Bud give her a warning look
Don't poke at the rattler
You done impressing yourself, ace
No way that could just be seawater
They must've learned how to control water mean at a molecular level
They can plasticize it, polymerize it
whatever
Put it under intelligent control
Maybe their whole technology is based on that
Controlling water
Coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees
His hands are out of sight
His arm is moving in a slow rhythm
We can't see what he's doing
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek
like an
Just checking is out, huh
How come
, showing what Coffey is doing
He has his - gripped white-knuckle in one hand
He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly across the skin of the other forearm
Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to elbow
-- He doesn't flinch
His eyes are hard and bright as diamond drills
No one notices
He's keeping the edge
They're curious, maybe
We could be the first people they've seen up close
Hope they don't judge the whole race offa us
Maybe  oughta shave
Coffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking through the group as if they were smoke
This cold behavior brings the mood down a notch
/                                          151 Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume
Bright speculation, a few jokes
Coffey is visible shaking
Breathing hard
Pupils dilated
Schoenick looks at him with concern
It went straight for the warhead
And they think it's cute
You need to get some sleep
Coffey walks away without hearing him
Schoenick catches up
152 The door opens in the dark room
Coffey enters, moving with purpose
He pulls his gear bag out from under the work table
Unzips it
Pulls out a short-barreled -15 assault rifle
We have no way of warning the surface
Do you know what that means
Schoenick doesn't know
He hopes Coffey knows
Because he's a fearless man who's discovering what it is to be afraid
Coffey inserts the magazine with a
Snaps the bolt
Tosses the rifle to Schoenick
It means
whatever happens is up to us
: / --                                       153 Hippy passes the maintenance room
Looks in
The warhead and its cart are missing
He looks around
Heads toward the sub-bay
154 The discussion, still in progress
You think they're from down there originally
Or from
you know
She jerks her thumb toward the ceiling
think they're from 'you know'
Some place that has similar conditions
cold, intense pressure
No light
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly
/                                                    155 Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from the sub-bay
He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the steel floor
Slides up along the wall next to the door
Inches his eye around the doorframe
Across the room
Schoenick is working with a chainfall, lowering Big Geek onto the  warhead, which is still on its cart
He begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps
Hippy lets his breath out slowly
His expression is Holy Shit
He slides back along the corridor wall, silently
Away from the door
Then turn turns quickly to go
Coffey slams him up against the wall
45 pressed to Hippy's temple
Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the hammer
Sniff something did you, rat boy
156 The meeting is breaking up as the door  open and Hippy is thrusted inside
His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face
Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the
45
Schoenick flanks him with the assault rifle aimed at the group
Don't move
That's it
(to Monk) Here, hold this a second
We're going to phase three
He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team member
Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol
We can't tell what he's thinking
Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair
They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the NTIs
We set it up to go right to them
Lindsey looks stricken
Her plan is betraying them all
Oh my God
Oh no
(steps toward Coffey) Please, you can't
Coffey, think about what you're doing
for God's sake-- Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering
Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke machine, pinning her there with one hand
Bud leaps forward
Bud freezes
The rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot
Coffey moves up close to Lindsey
This is something 've wanted to do since first met you
His hand reaches down,
We hear something
His hand comes back up
holding a piece of gaffer's tape
He slaps it over her mouth
Then pushes her down into a chair
Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick
You boss is having a full-on meltdown
Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside
What's the timer set for
Three hours
Shut up
Don't talk
We can't get to minimum-safe-distance in three hours
The shockwave will kill us
It'll crush this rig like a semi driving over a beer can
Shut up
What's the matter with you
Everybody is twitching a hyper
Schoenick is white-knuckling his assault rifle
looking from Monk to Coffey to the group
Just stay calm
The situation is under control
Coffey backs out quickly with Schoenick
157 Coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into the mechanism so it can't be opened
Stay here
Schoenick take a position in front of the door
Coffey turns and runs through the corridor like demons are chasing him
158 Their only hope is to sway Schoenick
But the 's fear is making him the perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders
And his orders are clear
They can see him through the tiny window in the door
Lindsey rips the tape painfully off her mouth
Schoenick
your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat
We have to stop him
Schoenick
They pound on the door
Schoenick turns and hangs his cap over the tiny window
159 Using the chainfall, Coffey maneuvers the completed Geek/ package over the back of Flatbed, obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it out and launch it
160 Lindsey is up next to the door, with Bud
he's about to declare war on an alien species, Schoenick, just when they're trying to make contact with us
(to Bud) think 'm reaching him
There is a - and the door unlatches
See
The door opens
Jammer is standing there
Schoenick is in a heap against the far wall, moaning
Jammer hands the rifle to Hippy as he walks in
Hippy turns to cover the other
Monk puts his hands up, passively
'm the least of your problems
Bud appraises Jammer, who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay
Thanks
How you feeling, big guy
Figured  was dead, there, when  seen that angel comin' toward me
They all look at him for a second
What
Uh, okay, right
You can tell us about it later
Let's go
: /                                             161 Bud drops down the ladder,  , followed by the others
He tries the door into the main corridor
The wheel won't turn
The others get on it
Won't budge
He's jammed the mechanism
Now what
They're locked in trimodule-
No other doors give access to the sub-bay corridor
Bud's mind is racing
He drops down the ladder to Level One, into about two feet of water
He reaches down and open the emergency lockout hatch
Takes off his boots
Okay, 'm gonna free-swim to hatch six
get inside, get the door open from the other side
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing
Then  guess you better wish me luck, huh
Catfish is pulling his boots off as well
Wish us luck
(hands his wallet to Hippy) 'Case  don't die
Okay, Bud
let's go, podner,  ain't got all day
Bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating
He drops into the water
/                                                162 Bed shoots down through the hatch
The cold hits him list a fist, becoming instantly paralyzing
He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell
They reach hatch six
Together they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it
/                                              163 Bud surges up into the lock
Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him
They try the upper hatch
Jammed
They're both panting with the exertion and intense cold
Hafta
go on to
the moonpool
Only way
can't
make it
podner
Bud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed
Okay, Cat
You head back
Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch
164 Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit
He sees the lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead
165 In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of Flatbed
His wracked breathing is masked by the  of  as Coffey uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking the Geek/ in its gripper
Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the water onto the deck of the pool
He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle
His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold
His fingers are completely numb
He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits
Scans the situation
He can't get to the door, which is across the room, without Coffey seeing him
166 Lindsey watching the whole thing going down,   , a high angle of the sub bay
Bud moving up on Coffey
He can't get to the door
think he's going to try and take him himself
He couldn't be that dumb
The guy's a trained killer
Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty
, Bud picks up a piece of pipe
Hefts it
Moves forward, crouched
stalking
Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration
167 Bud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees, taking him down
Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor kick that topples him
Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water
Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself out, hoping to make it to the door
Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs
He pulls himself up as Bud kick out
Claws his way viciously over Bud's body until he has him pinned to the deck
Then he pulls out the
45
Put it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead
168 169 Coffey pulls the trigger
Bud flinches, then opens his eyes, staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the
45
Coffey cocks it and tries again
Nothing
Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against a rack of equipment
They face off, panting
170 The rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monk's voice
tool the liberty of removing this before gave it back to him
Monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from the
45
171 Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked
Coffey's really trying to put him out of business
It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part
Throw a few things
When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard
Give him credit, though
He manages to scramble back up
The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear
Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor
Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks
Slams the 's head in an equipment locker door
But the Navy man is just too massive
Bud is hammered back into a wall
Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace
Spins around at the sound of a
Hey
Catfish is right behind him
Dripping wet
trail of water goes back to the moonpool a few feet away
Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is knocked right on his ass
He doesn't get up
Just sort of flops around
Catfish helps Bud to his feet
They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles sideways, his eyes rabid
He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them
As they duck he sprints to Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down
(to Catfish) Get the door
Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed
The hatch is already sealed
He grapples with Geek/, trying to free it from the steel claw
172 Coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilot's compartment
He claws his way into the control seat and starts rapidly flipping switches
173 Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut doing a rumba
He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins the wheel
Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach
Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle
John Wayne
-                                                            174 Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water
Bud is being dragged down, still trying to free the
He gives up when he sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo
Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool
Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his viewing bubble beneath the swirling water
Coffey looks up, stares at the gun
doesn't seem to care
Hippy's squeezing the trigger and nothing's happening
Flatbed's hatch tower goes under
Safety's on
On the side
the lever
Up, push it up
Hippy fumble with the selective-fire lever, --
He put three quick rounds into the ceiling
Give me that
He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub
He racks the water with a long burst
, the rounds nip nasty contrails through the water
They barely scar the front port
Forget that
go for Big Geek
Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the shimmering shape of the  on its back
we see the rounds arcing wild, a few hitting the  but causing little damage
Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor
, Catfish empties the weapon
Gimme a hand
They all turn
Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman
The others rush over to help him
Get the rest of my gear
Grab that hat there
let's go guys
Come on, come on
Catfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and hose connections
Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and buckling all over him
This is a world-record suit-up time
Bud pulls the rubber neck-dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face
Helmet
helmet
Work fast
175 Beneath the habitat, Coffey is maneuvering Flatbed through the twisted pipe and debris left by Deepcore's slide to the edge
Bloodied, his fatigues ripped half-off, he looks like a feral animal
His eyes burn with the determination of his mission
176 Jammer expertly works the crane controls, moving Cab One out over the moonpool from its drydock cradle
Lindsey and One Night are scrambling like monkeys over the port side crash bars of the swinging sub, clambering up to the hatch tower
'll unhook
(Lindsey hesitates) You're better in these than  am
Lindsey recognizes this for what it is
a sign of respect, a reconciliation
She nods and drops through the hatch
177 Coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes a tight turn beneath the drill-floor module
Flatbed scrapes through between twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal
178 Bud has his 'hat' locked down and his air cut on
He take two quick strides to the edge of the pool and just drops in
179 Bud rockets    in a column of bubbles
He looks around
Through the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from its exit point under the stern
Bud see a shortcut under the platform
He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over- hand stokes
He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes
Misses the last hand-hold
but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing behind it
He is jerked along behind the sub
Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful thrusters
Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal wall
The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure
He pulls himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform
, look up the wall
Flatbed appears over the edge and stops
Hovering
Bud has the break he needs
He scrambles up onto the deck and opens and equipment locker
Nothing in it but one of the yellow nylon safety lines
The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/

His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a face streaked with blood
He brings the  into view with the boom arm

Brigman
The diver is holding Geek's skid with one hand, doing something with the other
He turns to look at Coffey
/                                                   181 Coffey releases the  with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the steel claw
Bud dives
The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow
Bud kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out
We see he has managed to tie one end to Geek's skids
Coffey hits the button to activate the , sending an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder
The little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void
Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud
Bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage
He loops the rope around a twisted pipe
Big Geek is hauling ass away from him
The line snap taut an instant later
The strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash
trying to go
The rope is slipping as Bud fights to make a knot
Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining
As it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face
Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls
The big arm extends menacingly
The smaller from manipulators open
An enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring
The big machine roars forward
Straight at Bud
Bud gets his knot partly done
See Flatbed looming
Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet
One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside rakes across his legs as it passes over
Flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework
-
182 Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port
He gets back in the seat
Strains to free his machine
/ /                                          183 Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in Coffey's blind area
Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris
It pivots toward Bud
Moves after him
Nearby, the  is whining mindlessly, trying to please
Trying to
attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip
The nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly
has gotten himself into a bad position
Along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck
Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic
There's no cover, side to side, up or down
Coffey has him head in his lights
Suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding Coffey
He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full throttle
At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab
Coffey is smashed sideways by the shock
He fights to control his vehicle
Lindsey looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight
She cruises up over Bud
(
) Get in
Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly
/
184 Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut
He ditches his helmet
Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall
Through the front port there is not sign of Coffey
You owe me one, Virgil
Can we negotiate later
There's Big Geek
He points
Through the front port, they can see the  still straining at its leash
Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to open her own small manipulator claws
/,
185 The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot
Big Geek happily surges forward
It dives gracefully down into the void, trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail
, Bud and Lindsey through the front port
Go after it
We gotta catch it
, dwarfing little Cab One
They are slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them
She hits full throttle
Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his more powerful vehicle
With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim
She arcs back toward the rig
Flatbed slams her again, for the side
She fights for control
/
186 Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls
Lindsey flies with her jaw set
Fighting hard for control
The -frame of the rig looms before her
She shoots through at full throttle
187 Now the fight is really on
The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure hulls
Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways
It screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules
They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run
Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash
Lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side
Lindsey snarls
He's pissing her off
He shouldn't do that
Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping
Lindsey rises, cuts right
Smashes down into Coffey's craft
Timing it just right
He skids catch in the rocks
Flatbed slews violently, nosing down
Crushing into the rocky bottom
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind
It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control
Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall
With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds her crippled sub
Flatbed tumbles over the edge
as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below
188 Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control
He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge
As the pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with the enormous load
tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble
Grows
Coffey gives up fighting
Just stares, wide eyed, at his death
damned soul dropping into the bottomless pit
The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port
Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes into him
moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards
189 Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall
Soon its lights vanish
190 They're both going to have a lot of bruises
Lindsey is surveying the damage
Water is spraying down on them like a shower, and lights are flickering
You did okay, back there
was fairly impressed
Not good enough
We still gotta catch Big Geek
Not in this thing
Lindsey is flipping switches
Nothing works
You totaled it, huh
Yeah
So sue me
Bud looks down
There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the floor at their feet
It's flooding like a son of the bitch
You noticed
She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over
She waits
No response
Try again
Deepcore, this is Cab One
We need assistance, over
Deepcore, this-- With a   or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything goes black
Well, that's that
Wonderful
(looking around) There's some light from somewhere
faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port
Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness
Over there
It's the rig
glow, beyond a rock promontory
like the lights of a town just over the hill in the desert
Good hundred yards, 'd say
They'll come out after us
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us
We better get this flooding stopped
He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light
Using the thing like a bulky flashlight
The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower
almost two feet deep already
You see where it's coming in
Somewhere behind this panel
Hold this
She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit
Can't get to it
Have to pull this panel off
You go any tools
don't know, look around
Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water
It's past his knees
Nothing
Son of a bitch
All  need's a goddamn crescent wrench
He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench it off the wall
Heaves on it repeatedly
Finally stops, panting
He's breathing hard now, and it's not just effort
Son of a bitch
Calm down, Bud
nervous edge in her voice now
Bud's turning all around, looking around for anything, trying to think fast
Water up to their waists
The sea closing in
Okay
okay
We gotta get you out of here
How
don't know how
We've only got one suit
know
know
But we better come up with something
Aaargh
'm freezing
She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling, keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water
She's shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water pouring in
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit
Seven, eight minute swim each way
not enough time
Look at this
(the rate of flooding) Time  get back you'll be-- That stops the conversation for a second
About two feet of airspace left
Bud can't believe what this is coming down to
They both stare at each other for a long moment
He makes a decision
Starts pulling off his backpack
Alright, put this on
What, you growing gills all of a sudden
You got it on, keep it on
Don't argue, goddamnit, just-- No way
Forget it
Not an option
Bud has his pack off uncoupling it
She keeps fighting his hands, stopping him, hooking it back up
The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up-- Now be logical, Bud, you're-- They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests
Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold
Listen
will you listen to me for a second
You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me
Right
So  got a plan
What's the plan
drown, you tow me back to the rig-- Lindsey's gut-scared
shaking violently, her eyes wide
But she's keeping it together
Thinking it out
Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her and he can barely think
Look, this water is only a couple degrees above freezing
drown
go into deep hypothermia
my blood like icewater
can maybe be revived after ten, fifteen minutes
You got all the stuff to do it on the rig
Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him
The water is up to their necks
He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right
It is insane
It's the only way, Bud
Now trust me
She takes a deep breath
Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his suit, rehooking everything
Jesus,  don't believe this is happening
She raise his helmet
Water up to their chins
They lock eyes, inches apart
He can feel her breath on his face
maybe for the last time
Oh God, Lins
-- Tell me later
He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his
They lock together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror
the naked realization of love hanging over the abyss of death
She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet over his head
Seats is down over the neck ring
Lock the bail-out handle, sealing it
Even with her head press up into the highest point of the ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water
She give a scared little laugh
This is maybe not such a great plan, is it
She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically
Puts her face to the glass of his helmet
Seconds to go
Hold me
Hold me, Bud
'm so scared
He can't hear her, but he read her lips
They clutch each other desperately
The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose
She starts to choke
Her hands grip his shoulders like claws
She bucks and thrashes
Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul
The freezing seawater races into her lungs
Her finger go slack, and her hands float lifelessly
Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open mouth
He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of the lockout hatch
: /                                             191 , one of the outside cameras
ghostly figure swims out of the darkness, towing something
It's Bud
Oh my God
that's Lindsey
(
/faint) Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read
Read you, Bud
We're here
192 Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey
Her arms and legs float as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current
Bud's voice comes in short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control
Go to the infirmary
get the cart
oxygen
de-fib kit
adrenaline in a
ten cc syringe
and some
heating blankets
You got all that
(
) Got it
Over
Meet me in the moonpool
Move fast
193 The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in
He picks up the  cart, meant to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment
They ransack the place in about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything else
/                                          194 Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving platform
Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge, looking down
-                                                            195 Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things, making mistakes
One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a bottle of adrenaline
Here he comes
Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged diving platform
Bud bursts to the surface
Together they haul Lindsey across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck
Her skin is blue- white, her chest still
Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a mission
The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see Lindsey as dead, a corpse
cold and inert
Water flows from her mouth and nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp
Hippy peels back one eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated
But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move
Turn her over
They flip his wife's body over
He straddles her, pushing down with both hands in the middle of her back
Seawater gushes from her slack lips
He does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back
Come on, hurry
Gimme the de-fib
One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment
They've all been trained in  and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a friend they're working on
They're all thumbs
Catfish drops the electrodes, picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud
Here, here, here
no, you got to have bare skin, or it won't
Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her -shirt, revealing her bare chest
bony and still
Jesus
Gimme those, come on
Catfish, move it, man
Come on
come on
He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on the side of the rib cage
Is that it
Is this right
Yeah
mean,  don't know
it looks right
All right
Do it
One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses
It is a pure muscle reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life
Hippy pushes him back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth
He opens the valve on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag
They start packing electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia Do it again, One Night
Zap her again
The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches
Bud doesn't wait for a result
he's in his own reality now, driven
He's doing it all at once, somehow, in a senseless frenzy
pumping on her chest with his hands, squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes
Aw
Christ
come on, baby
Again
Do it again
Lindsey's back arches
Her body relaxes, inert
Come on, One Night
what are you waiting for
hush seems to have fallen over the group
They know instinctively that it's over
But Bud can't accept it
He looks at them, beseechingly, like they are somehow intentionally holding out on him
One Night starts to cry, quietly
(gently) Bud, it's over, man
It's over
There is a beat of silence
Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open, motionless eyes
' , moving in until the pupil  , a black void
,
distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down
It is like the circular top of a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water
It is as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing smaller as we drop away
smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a turned-off
, rigid, staring
Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder
Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman, renewing his efforts in spades
totally manic
No
She's not
her heart is strong, she wants to live
can't you see that
Come on, Lins
Come on, baby
Zap her again
Do it
They do
And Bud works, feverishly
He lock his lips over hers and starts mouth-to-mouth
It is frantic, passionate
the kiss of life
Come on, breath
Goddamn it, you bitch, you never backed down from anything in life
now fight
He slaps her face, hard
Her head lolls
He smacks her the other way
Fight, Goddamnit
's , from the bottom of the great well
The circles of faces and light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit
We see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike
, still
Then something incredible happens
Something they will never forget as long as they live
Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her hands clench in a spasm
Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific
Come on, Lins
You can do it
fight your way back, baby
The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back
She starts to cough, weakly at first
then more violently as she draws air into her lungs
Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs
trying to re- establish circulation
It is like a difficult birth
Lindsey comes hacking and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath
Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized breath
He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands, and watches her breathe
Color is returning to her skin as she lies there, gasping weakly
Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others
they're all grinning, crying, beaming
gazing at the miracle of her rebirth
tears are streaming down his face
(a whisper, fierce and harsh) You did it, ace

shows Bud hovering over her, attentive
They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle
Perhaps twenty minutes have passed
She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face, and looks like a waif
Lindsey's eyes flutter and open
The first thing she sees is Bud, bending over her
He can't help himself
The tears break again and roll down his cheeks
She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware
She smiles, faintly
touches his cheek
Hey
big boys don't cry, remember
Hi, lady
Hi, tough guy
guess it worked, huh
'Course is worked
You're never wrong, are you
How d'you feel
've been better
Next time it's your turn, okay
Bud's expression turn inexplicably grim
Well, you got that right

reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit
Everybody is grouped around, buckling and zipping
He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask, part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing
Monk, on his stretcher, is presiding
The resident expert
Lindsey is wrapped in a blanket, still looking wan and frail
She doesn't have the strength to resist Bud's will, but she's trying
No, Bud, no
not you
Who then
She looks around at the others
Sees their eyes
The fear
Has her answer
He lowers the helmet over his head
Catfish clamps it down
We see what's driving him
his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being able to prevent this situation
He touches her cheek, one last time
She sees his fingers are trembling
Then he puts on the gloves
Catifsh is strapping a   onto Bud's forearm
Lindsey wants to scream
to stop this madness
(muffled) So 'll hear you, but  can't talk
The fluid prevents your larynx from making sound
It'll feel a little strange
(muffled) Warning you now, folks, 'm a lousy typist
(a beat) The moment of truth, huh
His breathing is shallow and tense
He looks at Lindsey
The eyes of a condemned man
She squeezes his hand
He takes a deep breath
Okay
Let's rock and roll
Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line
The breathing fluid (3M fluorocarbon emulsion -80) swirls into the helmet
Bud reflexively raises his chin
The liquid fills toward his mouth
Relax now, Bud
Just keep breathing as it fills
don't fight it
Take it in
Just let yourself take it in
Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid
His eyes go wide, instant panic
He starts to thrash
Chest heaving
Hold him
Hold him
This is normal
it'll pass in a second
You're gonna be okay
We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud
Your body will remember
Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him
He finds her eyes, the look calming him
He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned
His spasms subside
He begins to "breathe" normally
He gets a goofy look of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing
He is alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the  helmet
He grins
Gives a big thumbs up
Lindsey picks up a microphone
Can you hear me okay
(another thumbs up) Try your keypad
Bud taps out a brief message
-     prints out on their portable monitor
already have, moron
They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform
Jammer and Hippy lower Little Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it
Hippy yells right up next to his helmet
redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek
He should take you right to it
All you gotta do is hang on
Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge
He looks up at her as he drops away
In a few seconds, she can't see him
Her chin quivers, minutely

single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts down
It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall
He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down
Bud looks down
Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness
The wall unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery
He looks up
The lights of Deepcore are gone
He feels  more alone than he has ever felt
He types out: (
) We're right here with you, Bud
Your depth is 3800 feet
You're doing fine
Bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical
199 Everyone is grouped around the monitor screen, watching Bud's telemetry
Bud types out:
They watch the depth meter counting down
4800 feet
It's official
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning
The screen print out:
They laugh
So far so good
Seconds later
One mile down and still grinnin'
200 Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little pool of light
The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth
, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness yawning below
201 Lindsey has the microphone gripped tightly, and the lightness in her voice is a bit brittle
8500 feet, Bud
Everything okay
Ask him a pressure effects
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel
, printing out:
Big baby
Then:
It's starting
It hits the nervous system first
Keep talking, Lindsey
Just let him hear your voice
It doesn't matter what about
Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling as well as sentence structure, so concentrate, okay
(long pause) Bud,
uh, there's some things  want to say
It's hard for me
'm not of those softy, gooey- center-type people
It's not easy, you know, being a cast-iron bitch
It takes discipline and years of training
lot of people don't appreciate that
Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room
In her mind she is with Bud, out in the darkness
But is wasn't all bad
know that
You remember that bike trip
we rode the Honda up through Oregon
It took me a week to get my hair untangled, but 've never been happier
It was the most
free
've ever felt
'm sorry  can't tell you these things to your face
202 Bud is visibly trembling, gritting his teeth
holding on as the vise-grip of pressure takes him
(
/filtered) It's pitiful
have to wait until you're freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand feet of water between us
guess 'm babbling
'm sorry
Bud struggles with his keyboard
203 : Somehow's she's smiling and on the verge of tears at the same time
Two miles down and still grinnin'  Comin' up on the big ten thou'
Bottom's still a mile and a half down
204 Bud jerks as his dive light implodes
He still has Geek's floodlights
He falls on
205 12000 feet
Jesus,  don't believe he's doing this
Shut up, Hippy
Bud, how you doing
He types: Everyone snaps suddenly alert
Uh, oh
What kind of luminous things, Bud
Maybe it's
you know
them
The screen prints out:
206 Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated creatures less than a foot long
Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see
He stares at them in wonder
Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go
Are they really here
He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions
207 Another message from Bud:
He's losing it
Talk to him
Keep him with us
Bud, it's the pressure
Try to concentrate
Concentrate on my voice
Just listen to my voice
208 Bud emerges from the school of squid
As he falls, they form a luminous plane of swirling colors above him
He stares upwards, transfixed
' , the ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him
spectral form takes shape in the patternless glow
resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide
Gazing down at him, her expression sad
Her image receded away from him into the darkness above as he falls
, reaching up in anguish
209 Lindsey watches as Bud haltingly types out: 'm not going away, Bud
'm right here, right here with you
This is Lindsey, Bud
'm right here
Signal's fading
We're losing juice
kill everything we don't need
Catfish, knock out those lights
Everyone hustles to comply
The room is plunged into darkness, the faces of the group lit only by the ghostly  screen
Run it through the digital processor, cook it as much as you can
Seventeen thousand feet
Good Christ Almighty, this is insane
210 Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy
His eyes keep rolling back, and he's having a hard time staying conscious
He tries to type a message and he can't
The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous system
Suddenly -
Little Geek's pressure hull implodes
Its lights go out
211 Little Geek just folded
Bye, little buddy
He can still make it
know how alone you feel
alone in all that cold blackness
but 'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone
Lindsey seems not to be in the room, but to be with him, seeing what he sees
She is oblivious to the others
212 Blackness
Then a bright light appears
he's lit a
It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge
Bud discards the stalwart little  and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute
Out of control, he hits a ledge and rolls off
Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris
He hits another outcropping, limp as a rag doll
Rocks and sand rain down with him as he continues his descent
Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor
He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position
In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of air and light
Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet
(
) You remember that time, you were pretty drunk, you probably don't remember
the power went out at the old apartment, the one on Orange Street
and we were staring at that one little candle, and  said something really dumb like that candle is me, like every one of us is out there alone in the dark in this life
213 as she grips the microphone
Her voice has become a hoarse whisper
Her eyes are intense, focused on a point far beyond the walls of the room
and you lit another candle and put it beside mine and said "that's me"
and we stared at the two candles, and then we
well, if you remember any of it, 'm sure you remember the next part
Bud, there are two candles in the dark
'm with you
'll always be with you
214 tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall
Bud falls on in dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark
215 Catfish gently takes the microphone from Lindsey's hands and leans close
How you doin', podner
Still with us, come-back
Talk to us, Buddy boy
They watch the screen, expectantly
Nothing
Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment
Lindsey tried unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice
Bud
You hangin' in there
Talk to me, Bud
Are you okay
There is an agonizing pause, then the letters appear slowly:
What kind of light
He's hallucinating badly
216 Bud is no longer in pain
His expression is rapt
, past his to a ghostly landscape
His last flare sputters out, but there is light
Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon below him
And he's right
it is beautiful
The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels
Barren as the moon but exquisite, serene
Changeless
place unseen by human eyes
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible
Bud descends toward the , which has grounded on a narrow shelf
Below the shelf, the wall slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it
/, sitting there like a dumbshit
Bud's feet thump into the sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles
Touchdown
three and half miles of water over his head
Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of fireflies
217 prints out
Monk takes the headset gently from Lindsey
Okay, Bud, we'll go step by step
Take the cover plate off the firing box
long pause
Then All right, Bud, you have to cut the ground wire, not the lead wire
218 Bud is peering into the detonator unit
How bad is he
We can't tell
(
) It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not
repeat
the black wire with the yellow stripe
Bud is staring
Blinking
The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're miles away
way down there where his hands are
The only light he has left is a
He pulls out the little plastic tube
Breaks and shakes
It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green light
He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters
he types to them
He reaches into the detonator
,
in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical
The cutters go over on wire
long beat
They withdraw, then go over the other wire
He cuts-- 219 Everyone is frozen
Waiting
It's very quiet
Would we see the flash
Through three miles of water
don't know
They're holding their breaths
Then cheer goes up
Rebel yells
Quiet, quiet
Save you air, goddamnit
Bud, give me a reading off you liquid oxygen gauge
Lindsey does white
It took him over an hour to get down there-- It's hopeless
Lindsey grabs the headset from Monk
Drop you weights and start back now
The gauge could be wrong
220 Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead
His expression is enigmatic
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon
Starts to type
221 The message comes in: No
You can make it
You hear me
Drop your weights
you
can breathe shallow
you
it could be wrong-- Lindsey's voice has twisted into a sob
She begins to weep, quietly
Oh God, Virgil, please
pause
Then the words
Lindsey sobs at the mike
The others look away
The signal is weakening
One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly
She stares at the printout
Love you
There is no reply
: 222 tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert , an Indian dying with his horse in the desert
Bud's eyelids close
His chest barely moving
strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open
He blinks
Weakly, he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance
'
glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision
It seems to be an angel
Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish
Its body and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer
The head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a cold, dispassionate wisdom
It is stunningly beautiful
The creature settles toward him
Unafraid, Bud extends his hand
Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove
It pulls him up from the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the abyss
At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below
They resolve into  ships
Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey nearly collided with at the Montana wreck
The larger manta-ships
And others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish
Suddenly the darkness explodes with light
vast, reticulated pattern of brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench
It sweeps outward from the center, as if the light were surging through channels
The NTIs are revealing their home to Bud
The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a major city
223 Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark surface of inhuman design
The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface
It dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon yawns like a vast mouth
They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth- like opening
224 Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him
It is a curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system, where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional space
Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur
225 Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the  moves back a few feet
shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the chamber
The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls
They move apart
Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway
Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free
Drops to his knees
Doubles over as spasms wrack him
Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs
He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what he can only hope is air
It is
Bud slowly recovers, sitting up
His head is clearing
This really is happening
Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven is gathered watching him
Howdy, Uuuh
how you guys doin'
His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber
Soft laps of water from the 'walls'
In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be circuit diagrams
Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in mid-air
The image is about twenty feet across
There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into
the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news
, then another newscast
And another
Fragments of the same story
The world on the brink of war
You watch out
That what you're trying to say
That you know what's been going on up there
The NTIs are impassive
Static
then another newscast
This time, we're allowed to focus on the story
An on-the-scene interview outside a high-tech seismology lab
There is an air of hysteria about the scene
technicians running across the background of the shot, people shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist
a Caltech scientist who is among those reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the world's oceans
Dr
Breg, can you give us a clearer explanation then we're getting
Berg is edgy and distracted
People keeps handing him pieces of paper, computer hardcopy
The biggest thing in his life is happening
They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but with no seismological source
The waves are propagating toward the shorelines of every continent-- An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning
We see that Berg is running scared
The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational mind
Yeah
'll be right there
have to go
Look, we don't know what it is
Okay
Not the slightest goddamn idea
The image dissolves into static, fades out
Bud turns to the NTIs
You're doing it
Right
That's what you're telling me
Yeah, you can control water
that's your technology
But why
Static again, then a brilliant flash
Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific
The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an unbroken white glare
Bud gets the message
Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it
Where do you get off passing judgment on us, when you can't be sure
How do you know
The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments from recent history
soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old contra with an -47
Just glimpses, strobing
a few frames of each
But enough
The images continue
, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of humanity
: ,  ,  --                   226 video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean
Pandemonium reigns around them, people running, driving, evacuating inland
On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared
It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing
--                                                     227 , looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the Verazzano Narrows
Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of water impossibly high, still miles out
,  ,
--                  228 The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia, where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave
wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base
Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion
,   --                                    229 The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg disaster
The horizon has gone dark
the crowd is starting to run
some are just staring, unable to move
the wave
the wave is
it's
don't know
maybe a thousand feet high already
getting bigger as 'm watching
still miles out
oh my God, Jesus
can hear it
roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard
They leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward and upward as the ground begins to shake
--                                                     230 The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall
--                                                231 -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the buildings downtown
Beyond,   is the wall of sea green which defies our comprehension
The image shakes with the
--                                                       232 diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which transcends his worst nightmare
He lies paralyzed on his board
--                                                        233 Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith
In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him, blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over, about to break upon the teeming city
And then
The wave slows as it crests
And stops
2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its surface in the bright sun
There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of confused gulls
Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover, only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation
news helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly
234 The surfer just blinks, starting
--                                                     235 On the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a shimmering blue wall which stands
waiting
,
--                         236 Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the moonlight
It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable devastation
but it doesn't
,                                       237 When all have seen
The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface of the sea is normal again
, , of a crowd of people watching the sea
Moving from face to face
Various reactions as people respond to what they can only understand as a miracle
The faces
awed, stunned, tear-streaked
laughing
The cameraman is just walking
Some people turn to him and smile, or laugh, or whoop
woman is collapsed on a bench, crying
man is on his knees, shaking
Total strangers hug each other
black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific grin
Somebody just laid it down to us, man
Things ain't never gonna be the same
to reveal that we are in the
238 Bud sits, shaken, watching the screen, as people react to their deliverance
He turns to the NTIs
Why
You could've done it
Why didn't you
The screen darkens
Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if someone was clumsily typing them
And we've seen this before so we know the rest
pause, then: The last message expands to fill the entire screen
Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the aliens
They bow their heads, just for a moment
sign of respect
as he begins to realize what has happened
: /                                             239 Lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring
Withdrawn
The others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark
The air is looking pretty thick
The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver crackles to life
(
) Deepcore, do you read
This is Benthic Explorer, over
Hell yes, we read
Good of you to join us
How's that storm doin'
Well, it's strange
it just kind've blew itself out all of the sudden
We're up here in a flat sea with no wind
But then a lot of weird things've been happening
Well, hell, son
You better get us a line down here, we're in moderately poor shape
, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring
on how to get a new umbilical hooked on
One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone
They figure is was over a half mile high
wish  could have seen it-- She glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement
Hey
Hey
Look
it's Bud
That's impossible
Lindsey bolts to the screen
Stares at the message printing out
huge grin wraps around her face
No it's not
(
) What's it say
Lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen
During the message, her voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a childlike joy
: It says
"     / /     / /    " Lindsey grins as she reads the next part
"   /   " 'd say that's a big 10-4, jack
" /
" --                                      240 Beyond the windows the ocean is calm
The sky steel-gray put placid
McBride turns to Commodore DeMarco and the Navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked
Looks like you boys might by out of business
Something's going on down there
'm getting some big readings
Bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a Wurlitzer
241 In Deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling
The sonar is going crazy
One Night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to her ear, then jerks it away
Whew
Whatever this is, it's major
The rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water
The glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance
last message appears on the screen: / The radiance intensifies
Everyone covers their eyes
It flares to -
: /
--                                         242 Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts
All their instruments are pegged
Active is pinging back something big
it's enormous
Coming up right under us
Where
Where
(looks out the window) Over there
Port bow
243 depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down
It gets wider
Deeper
Rapidly becomes a yawning pit
The ocean is
Now the surface is churned by turbulence
Slow massive roils of tremendous power boil up from the depths
McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better
The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across
The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom
massive spire
Smoothly curving and iridescent
Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another spire rises
Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a  , the energy of Niagara
Off the port bow
another spire
And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it
Six towers
plus one larger, in the center
Rising
One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out the sun
The air, the sea, the deck
all vibrate with the And now for the payoff shot:  ' , ,    , It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad back
We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic being, which we assumed was a city
The Explorer rocks gently on its flat hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles
The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of the vast, slightly curved hull
The missile cruiser rocks back and forth nearby, high and dry
its prop whining futility
' , McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy contingent
they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze
Touched by the hand of God
Look
-- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore Two
It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the glistening plain of the  Ark's hull
,   , as the hatch at the bottom opens
Catfish's feet appear, bicycling
He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like
Jammer plonks down behind him
He turns, lifts Lindsey down
Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into the light of the sun
deliverance from the blackest night they will ever know
We should be dead
We didn't decompress
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke
They must've done something to us
Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks
for the sun, for life, for their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for the whole human race
Oh, yes
think you could say that
She blinks
Seeing something not far away
She gives a little laugh, or something between laughing and crying
, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like enterances to the  structure
His suit is casually unzipped and the helmet dangles from one hand jauntily
She starts toward him
Breaks into a run
Then stops a few feet from him
Watching him come to her
His smile, his eyes illuminating her
He stops and she touches him, lightly
Is this real
The look at each other, wonderingly a moment
Then laugh
She sniffs loudly
Hello, Brigman
Hello, Mrs
Brigman
Their lips meet
