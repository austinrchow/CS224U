"Dark City", early, by Alex Proyas by Alex Proyas November 29th, 1992 increases in volume
: -  wraps around a bulky electrical lever, thrusts
-  Electricity arcs through darkness
sound of  turning
starting  -  various
Second hands turn  - gets louder
- bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing: clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor
in and out of darkness
The eyes open
Confusion
-  a man in his early thirties, dark featured
He sits up
Water splashes
He's in a tub of long cold water
His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever
He looks down into the murky water around him
feint movement beneath the surface, something swimming  - Startled, he leaps from the bath
-
The man's hand reaches up, stops the light-bulb mid swing
He steps to a circular window
The glass is cracked, covered in grime
He wipes it, this only smears the dirt
It's dark out there
- -  from outside the window, through blurry glass
in silence
The window is a on the side of a vast grey tower
White shivers, cold
He stares down at the puddle he drips on the floor
He looks at his feet and legs, covered with numerous
He dries the bloody wounds with a towel
He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on
Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with in both soles
In his trouser pocket he finds a key  - a room number on a plastic tag
He hears splashing in the bath-tub
He steps over, looks into the murky water
Suddenly a    leaps from the water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about
He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the water
Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the shadows
He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand inches from the doorknob
He leans down
Blinking through the key-hole
-   glimpse of motion  -  the door across the room (leading to a corridor
) is shutting
- pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room
No sign of life
Cheap decorations
He walks around cautiously
Turns lights on
Then reconsiders
Turns them off again
Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror
-  the fish has jumped from the tub again and is flapping on the floor
White steps back into the bathroom
He picks up the fish again, doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket
He searches through things
grey overcoat in the closet
He goes through the pockets, finds a
No
, just a laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town
on the bed-side table
He picks it up, his grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the trigger and
The gun goes off
wildly around the room, bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself in the wall
Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off again
He examines it carefully now
Opens the chamber
-  Five bullets left
He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the inside pocket of the coat
He moves to the bed
on the rug fragment of a woman's face, her left eye
He lifts the fragment up
There's handwriting on the back, part of a note: -
The rest is missing
He sits on the edge of the bed
As he does this, he notices something else on the floor
-  follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a woman's bare foot behind the bed
He stands abruptly, fumbles across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room
In the shadows he can make out a woman's naked  lying in a pool of blood
Her eyes stare lifeless
White stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his mouth
- White stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support
Lights flicker
At the end of the corridor, elevator doors open
Light and musak flood out
- White staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front desk
from the back room: Hey, you
You gotta message
White stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain
What
Message in d'box
You deaf
White sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him
Reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain into the manager's office
Hard to see  -  the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of the
set
White grabs the note, looks at it , also his room number, and what appears to be his name: That's all
White thrusts the message in his pocket
Got my money
What
How long have  been here
Jeez, too damn long if you ask me
What about the two weeks y'owe me
Totally confused, White turns to leave, sees something
Stops
-   painting on a wall (cheap print variety)  - waves on a beach
breeze rustles the pages of a calender, pinned beside the picture
-    on his ear
-  surf crashes on shore
'  : What is your name
What is your name
He backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic -  sees a sign:
painted hand points the way
Hey
(without turning) 'll be back later
Yeah
Well, y'better be
-  watching from a shadowy corner of the lobby
As White runs out, the   picks up a pay-phone, dials
Whispers into the receiver in a foreign language
- White pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor
Pipes steam and drip water
He rounds a corner, slips, nearly falls
'   - Puddles on the floor, stains on the walls
White bursts through the door and into a cubicle
He bends over a toilet bowl and
He looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve
breeze tugs at his stringy hair
tiny ventilation grill above the cistern looks out at the street
- Sheets of newspaper blow past
full moon, surrounded by blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets
- -  on a hairy wrist
Seconds tick past
Soft flickering light
-  police inspector
He looks down at the watch
Time to leave
He , heads for an illuminated exit sign
Images flicker on a
The inspector rushes to the door, runs into an , who gasps
(to usher) Gesundheit
Bumstead quickly moves off
The  makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil, scribbles in a notebook
Behind thick glass, he argues soundlessly into a phone
-  a popcorn machine rattles noisily
The inspector is upset, face strained
chatters quickly through the receiver
(cuts in) but you told me the meeting was ten-thirty burst of chatter
know, sir, but  can't make it at nine-thirty It's  -  um  -  well, inconvenient
stream of chatter stops him
Yes, sir
understand
Yes
But, 've done fine so far without an assistant
The inspector tries to interject as the  cuts in again
But
But
(defeated) Nine-thirty
Yes
' We are underwater
's  swims into view
Bubbles spew from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror
' White washes his face in a sink
He looks up, wipes his face dry with his coat
He turns towards the door to leave
There are   -  identical
He cannot remember which he came through
Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness
He realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but the door  behind him:  locked
Pitch black
Trickling water
distant voice over a
system recites names, followed by numbers
, far away
White walks towards it
He steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a blank wall
He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the slot, dials the number on his message
Ringing  -  no answer
Suddenly White feels cold
There you are
Startled, White drops the phone and turns
figure moves forward out of darkness: from the hotel lobby
The stranger wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale skin
He is completely bald
He studies White carefully
White glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor, his eyes pinned to the man
You are lost, yes
White retreats faster
-  a dagger appears by the stranger's side, gripped in a black leather glove
He moves forward, a grin on his pale face
White stops, backs against the wall
Co-operate
Do not make this difficult
White panics  -  he's cornered
He remembers the revolver
He pulls it from his coat and  it at the stranger, his hand shakes terribly
continuing to advance
Something about his eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly
You will not shoot, yes
There is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness
again and again
Red splashes appear on the man
His shoulder
His leg
His neck
He walks forward, with spastic jerks as bullets  into him
final shot   into the stranger's forehead stream of black liquid spouts from the hole
Blue smoke clears
The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs open
Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground
- of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles
strides down a silent corridor
He reaches into his pocket, removes a  , places it over his nose and mouth
Bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at the end of the corridor
The man, who is dressed identically to the inspector, is his superior:  -
Good evening, sir
Yes
This way
leads the inspector into a tiled room containing several
The two men are greeted by a cheerful- looking
Welcome, gentlemen
Youire early
Here for the examination, right
Stromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the row of corpses
Bumstead follows
The handiwork of an extremely sick individual
He throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations
Youive read the reports
Not much to go on
We know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them
Always the same type of blade
Forensics match in each case
Anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself
shakes his head, turns away from the final body, looks at the inspector
Why are you wearing that thing on your face
Germs, sir
These places are full of them
see
(continues) One thingis for sure, heis ambitious
Youill be a busy man from now on
You can say that again
Stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man
The Mortician becomes serious and goes back to his work
What about Thompson, sir
Wasnit this his case
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing
Anyway he isnit with us any longer
The case is yours
Go through his files
Take what you need
(less business-like) By the way, howis your mother
Sheis getting better, thanks
She
(cuts in) Very good
The chief-inspector turns, paces to the door briskly
Letis go, Bumstead
So much to do and so little time
- large faded  advertisement on a building facade portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "- "  -  a cereal box carton
, rises upwards,  on the womanis face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her - raftered room on the other side of the billboard a convoluted staircase  -  at the base, the runs
pace rapidly
-
as he tries to lose himself from possible pursuers
He steps through a low archway into a back alley, rounds a corner
-
White stops, looks around, then up
Heis breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath
He starts to shake
, the walls stretch into darkness
An  way up there  -  he can see stars
Something dark crosses the gap of sky
in the distance
Wind starts to pick up
Trash is being kicked up
sheet of  wraps around Whiteis leg
He tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonit come off
He bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but something grabs his eye
He stares at the page for a moment  -  then his   from under him and he falls to the ground
He holds his head like itis going to explode
whimper deep in his throat
His body is trembling violently
on the paper on the ground
front-page headline:  -
White looks up  -  terrified
The
again
facing him, a  has appeared where moments before there was nothing
The door creaks open to reveal This one extends outwards on the end of a lengthening wooden shaft
White, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket
Tries to side-step the   but itis too late, he can only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the wall
- -
the swaying beads hanging in the back- room doorway
peer into the room
1 We are looking for Jonathan White
looks up, moves forward into light:  a squat, hunch-backed man with glasses
He steps through the beads, glares at the intruders
What for
-  an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to kill White
Black coats, glasses, pale skin
Creepy
flashes forward, grips the manageris face and doesnit let go
The manager struggles, gulps for air
Heis pushed back heavily against the wall
1 Which room is he in
The leather glove , blood trickles from the manageris ears, through the fingers
43 ( )  is searching the room
He hears in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against the wall
-    -  a stunted body, an oversized head, thick limbs
The rest of his features lost in shadow
The door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room
as they step in and look around
They search the room, knock stuff over
One of the men kicks at the womanis corpse in the corner
Behind him, Fredrick, still hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed
- past buildings
An - Way down , in a canyon of silent buildings, a walks
breeze pulls at WHITEis hair and coat
He takes out the wallet  -  a few dollars
The city is
Empty
Desolate
Buildings hang down out of black
Day-time was never invented
As he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a   he hadnit noticed, flutters to the ground
He stops, picks it up
In simple print:
, a phone number
Scribbled handwriting on the back says:  Thursday 0930
-  he glances across the street
-   cafe
broken   buzzes above the doorway
He walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six tables
Empty
Dirty
He sits and waits
ticks on the wall  -  midnight
White coughs, for attention
from a doorway
moves towards him, dragging one foot as it walks
appears and limps to his table
She speaks very quickly
He does not understand
She points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one
At the bottom
In small print
""
(nods) The noodles
Iill have some noodles
The old woman rips a   from a pad, gives it to White
number on it
She points her crooked finger again at a   above a small serving window in the wall greenish fluoro pulses from the room within
We call
She leaves again
White looks about the empty room
Insects are zapped on an illuminated  hanging on the wall
An old air-conditioner noisily
from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby cries
Then
White removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the table
He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article
Leans forward, hands trembling
Without realising, he holds the paper    burning on the table
The paper , is engulfed
He drops the flaming page on the table
Now the table-cloth starts to burn
White is frantic
On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of water, and dumps this on the flames
It kills the fire but leaves a black hole in the table-cloth
The paper is ash
He moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the smoke away
- is moving quickly
He suddenly trips and falls to the floor
He curses under his breath, then looks up
door  -  :  / on the frosted glass
Bumstead stands, pushes into the office
total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags
Bumstead shakes his head
real shame
He starts to look around
-  a drawer is pulled open
Thompsonis files are also a mess
Bumstead continues to shake his head
He reaches for a file
loud
(screams) He recoils
mousetrap has snapped over his fingers
He pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing
White is still waiting for his food
He leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed
He uses a napkin to wipe at the pus
-  circling the room, looking down on White
-  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on another table
The creature is some kind of -  half insect/half machine
Itis spying on him as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head
It shits on the food behind it
White is oblivious to this
Heis finished examining his leg, is sitting quietly
He yawns
His head nods forward briefly
White looks up
- has opened in the ceiling
Two feet in black leather shoes descend from the hole
sea breeze blows through the room
The   ,
Whiteis nose twitching
He can smell the ocean
The     -  like a seething tangle of worms
One by one,   in black coats lower into the room, floating on air
They pull out knifes, step forward
rigid with terror
-  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the gloom, they too resemble the  who confronted White earlier
They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads
Ready to attack
They lean over him, pause dramatically
1 Donit fall asleep
(chuckles softly) Might never wake, yes
This Man turns to the others
They all smile, then turn back to White
(in unison) Fifty-six
has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder
Repeating: Fifty-six
Fifty-six
-  a chair falls to the floor
White leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented
Just a -  he had dozed
-  The place is still empty
White glances to the serving window
waits for him, framed in the glowing fluoro square
He gets it
bowl of soupy liquid with noodles
He sits down
He is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead of a spoon
Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the kitchen
He takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds himself in another corridor
He looks about, unsure which direction to go in
- White is lost, still holding the soup
He moves through a number of    that open and shut automatically
Each reveals another room or corridor
Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling
He feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and looks at it
White holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup in the other
Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl
White stops
Looks up
large clock suspended from the rafters
tug at his coat
Standing beside him is   -  the little man from Whiteis hotel room
(stutters) Where have you been
The doctoris been worried about you
What
Who are you
Fredrick looks nervously down the corridor
Cimon, letis go
We donit have any time
The little man grabs Whiteis sleeve, starts to pull him along
Hold it a minute
Letis start at the beginning, huh
-  the top of a set of stairs in front of them
Two dark figures appear
Fredrick looks up at them in horror
Shit
(looks at White) Quick
Run
Both men run like crazy, White awkwardly holding the bowl of soup
They come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor
Fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time
White climbs  , looks around, finds another corridor
The little man is nowhere to be seen
White reaches another junction  -  several corridors branch off
Each passageway completely deserted
Shit
He keeps running
-  illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager, slumped in his own blood
Bumstead leans  , examines the corpse
He notices several stab wounds in the manis abdomen
Various cops search the room
One cop walks up to the Inspector
We got another one upstairs (deadpan) Great
- with arched windows that look over the city
Fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned table
He scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then puts it into a   he finds beneath the table also
He glances out a window, notices   standing beneath a street-lamp below, looking up at him
Startled, Fredrick darts back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen vertical  running up into the ceiling
-  he opens a small hatch and puts the metal cylinder in it
The cylinder is snatched from his hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air
Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief
shadow falls across his back
He turns
He screams
/ -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding speed
The cylinder races around corners
It clanks and grinds
up the side of a building underground
Rushes through darkness
- along a bridge-like structure
An enclosed corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons
Under the bridge, pipes spew sewage into stagnant water
-  seen through a series of illuminated, dirty, windows
He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds before him
the fish swimming weakly in the soup
-  He stops, looks up at
of clattering metal
pipe runs the length of the corridor  - the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness
Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of somewhere in the building
White hurriedly moves towards the source
White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular in a wall
, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole in the wall and looks through
small, very ordered
fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow
White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the hole
He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson
The man looks up  -  itis Fredrick  -  just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers
He doesnit scream this time, just gags on blood running from his mouth
Suddenly a sliding door  onto the back of Whiteis neck, traps his head in the hole
He struggles, tries to free himself
Drops the bowl of soup
It shatters on the hard floor, makes a mess
-  The killers look up at the smashing noise
-  White pulls with all his strength
The door gives and he stumbles backwards
He is about to run away but glances at the floor
The fish is flapping about  -  still alive
White darts from a doorway, trips and falls
He sprawls at the base of sweeping stone steps
He looks at a building towering above him
Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance: series of ply-wood  race through frame
Stop suddenly, mechanically
Chunks of ply-wood blast away violently
is practising his marksmanship
-  on his shoulder
He whips around, startled
-  a young, stiff-looking woman
Dammit
Sorry, sir
Donit ever sneak up on me like that
Who are you
Patricia Crenshaw
She puts out her hand
Iim your new assistant
didnit requisition a secretary
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand
(uncertain) Oh
He takes her hand tentatively
They shake
Iive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonis office searched, as  believe you instructed
All clear now, sir
They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories
Poor man
Good
You wonit regret this, sir
Fine
Bumstead moves off
White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign saying,  in formal letters
The place seems abandoned, then he notices a hint of movement
Cigarette smoke snakes into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor
He walks up to an elderly female  sitting behind a desk, smoking, reading
White looks somewhat distraught still
Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing
The librarian looks up from her book
Which would you like first Okay
Newspapers
She takes her glasses off
Her eyes are , like pin-heads
She studies White
Are you alright
He looks around  -  restrained panic
(looks at the woman) Sure
Iim fine
(nods) Mmm-hmm
Stairs at the end of the hall
Third floor
Turn left
Section -7
Row 35, near the toilets
She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away
Donit mention it
She blows her nose into a handkerchief
The snort White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues
He finds section  then walks between towering rows stacked with old volumes
Comes to number 7
He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34 but then it skips straight to letters again, , , , etc
No Row 35
He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a small sign:
White is sweating profusely
He now sits on a chair, takes off his shoes, rubs his feet
He pulls a book from a shelf behind him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out, folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes
He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate diagram of the library interior
An arrow points to a section near a wing labelled:
Near the arrow it says: He keeps walking
He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a sign is nailed to it: White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in
Puts his shoulder to the door, pushes several times
It  under his weight  -  rotten
He finds himself in a
narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of old newspapers
-  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper off the shelf
The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust in his hands
He picks up another, and another, each in turn breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness
- face each other across a polished black table
They speak in a foreign language
phone rings
Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively
Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to lock together
complex puzzle
He gets impatient with the puzzle, dashes it to the floor
Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something
Hands the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into
The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in shadow yet again)
He reads from the note over a silver microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue
-  his distorted voice
final mysterious person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement
He takes a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs
The board resembles a planning table in a war-room
as the    on the grouping of cut out figures
More and more of them
Ten
Twenty
hundred
sinister army
- White is in a phone booth
He removes the note from his pocket, dials
No answer again
He dials the muffled voice over the line
Iim trying to reach nine zero eight triple two
canit get through
(beat) What
(angry) Shit
He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a coin, puts it into the slot
Heis sweating again
He wipes his brow with a trembling hand
It is
Which area is that number listed in
Is that near the ocean
The ocean Never mind
Have a Jonathan White listed
Seventeen
All Johns see
Never mind
He hangs up, then removes the business card he found in his wallet
He is about to dial but decides otherwise
He steps into the street
White walks between tall buildings, towards a narrow street that branches off into two separate routes
He stops
He canit decide which branch to take  -  he steps to the left, then steps back, takes a few steps to the right, reconsiders again
/BUMSTEADiS   - -  piles of towering files bursting at the seams with paperwork  -    Bumstead hunched over notes, photographs and files
His eyes are rimmed with red
He doesnit seem to be getting anywhere
Coffee
He looks up
The secretary stands in the doorway with another big pile of paperwork
What
donit drink coffee
cup of tea would be good
Milk and no sugar
Crenshaw puts the paperwork down on Bumsteadis already overcrowded desk
Making progress
He looks at her like she just slapped him
These are the investigations of a madman
He has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever
(without looking up) This is a mess
horrible mess
(looks at her now) Itis the second time now
Miss Crenshaw looks concerned
Look at this
He holds up a sheet of white paper  -  a report
The woman steps over and looks at it
You typed this report
Yes, sir
Anything wrong
Wrong
Look at this
The woman bends down, adjusts her glasses, examines it
It seems fine
Fine Look here
His finger points at the bottom of the page  -  a tiny, ink smudge
How can  submit this
Iim sorry
Do you wash your hands before you type things
Why, yes
Well be more careful, please
An embarrassed beat, then: ---
Bumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first
Inspector Bumsteadis office
Yes
Yes
She cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead
Yes, sir
The Chief-Inspector said he would see you now
- towards a door:  - on the frosted glass
hand reaches  , knocks twice
Enter
Bumstead steps into the office  -  finds  wandering about the room, distracted, searching for something
What is it
He pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his desk, sorts through it
formality
need to speak with Thompson
Officially  need your written permission
Stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now
Why do you want to speak to him
hunch
He might be able to
(from under desk) Bumstead, donit be so paranoid
Leave him alone  -  heis a sad case
Itis extremely important to my investigation
Iill be the judge of that
Anything else
Actually,  was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me
(pokes head above desk) Absolutely not
Up to my ears in cases right now  -  canit spare anyone
Stromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind pictures hanging off the walls
big sign suspended above his desk says,          -  his motto
Lost something
What makes you think that
If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead
The door clicks shut
Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has gone
- White walks under stone archways
Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:     24 and in smaller print, recently added beneath:    & $5
00
- White walks between bare, dusty shelves
Only one shelf carries products  -      "-"
He moves up to a small counter
man with thick glasses, dressed like a , is seated there
need something to keep me awake
Looks like you need a haircut to me
Thanks
Just some pills
Only two bucks
Shave as well
(annoyed now) Your sign says you sell drugs  - well, Iim here to buy some
Okay
Relax
Sure
He waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules
Tell you what  -  let me cut yer hair, give ya watcha need half price
Canit argue at that
(evenly) donit want a haircut
a clock on a wall  -    in a barber chair
The  gleefully works on WHITEis hair thin   in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain, smiles, playing a violin
Heis passionate but bad
(talks fast) Cut hair when  was in the navy, yiknow  -  havenit lost the touch
Bet youire happy ebout that
Huh
Sell maps
What of
The city
need to get to the ocean
Nope
No maps
Ocean, huh
On vacation
White doesnit answer
The old guy with the violin moves back and forth behind White, smiling as he plays
Grandpa thought customers might like some mood music
(unconvinced) Nice
You still look familiar
Itis driving me nuts
Sure  donit know ya from somewhere
(nervous now) Not me
Barber looks out the front window as his hands busily trim hair
Mnunn
Cold lately
(lathers up Whiteis face) That night, couple weeks ago
That was real cold
Remember that
Not really
Yeah, Iim like that
Senility says the wife
But she sure canit complain
Heh
The erector set still works good
(points to head) And this ainit no fucking rug
Gihead
Feel it
All mine
Grandpa laughs and plays louder
Yes
Feeeeel it
-  he smiles weakly
- scrawls cryptic diagrams into a notebook
at his desk
Heis bearded, with thick lensed glasses
He puts the phone down, sits quietly at his desk, staring into space, lost in thought
Schreber looks up
rusted pipe runs across the ceiling and down one wall
He steps across to the pipe on the wall, leans down, looks into an open hatch at its base
Without warning, out of the hatch pops the metal cylinder and bounces off the doctor's head
He curses, picks it up, opens it
He plucks out the note and reads FREDRICKis  : , DONiT
-
Schreber looks up  -  then    into the desk angrily
halls made of wood slatting  -  the floors, walls and ceilings are bare boards
-  a manis shadow as it descends a wooden staircase
-  He rummages in a paper bag as he walks
Pulls out two capsules, swallows them
Now he pulls out a pack of "-", rips it open, eats ravenously
- White steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty packet of cereal
Now he sees
He hides behind a wall before he is seen
Suddenly a deafening startles him
He looks across a plaza
-
bell-tower, black against the sky
White stares up into the night
- White walks in, sits on  , towards the back of the room, glances over his shoulder
He tries to blend in with the sitting silently around him
-  appears at the altar, cloaked in a blood-red robe, followed by two altar boys also in red
They move past a statue of an insect-like creature, walk in circles chanting softly, stop and stare at the congregation through eye-slits in their hoods
The priest begins his sermon
Beware
The night is deadly
There is a criminal among us
White looks forward
the priestis hand  -  It rises, points, moves over the heads of the congregation, accusingly
Suddenly the red finger jabs towards an   in the front row
It could be she
The innocent across the street
All the congregation turn and stare at the woman
Sheis terrified
The hand moves slowly now, across to a several rows back
Or the temptress next door
The priest pauses dramatically then: Or mister nervy stranger at the back
Suddenly the finger is pointing at White
All the faces turn, stare suspiciously at White
-  frozen with fright
Fortunately his face is obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand, continues the sermon
The people look away
You are thinking it could be anyone
And youire right
Why, it could even be Mother
White goes to leave
As he stands he notices the  of the church open  -  two figures step in and move into the candle- light
-  Whiteis bizarre pursuers
They look around
White ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the congregation
He motions to them to keep quiet
He runs into the legs of the   the priest pointed out
She is startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles
(continues sermon) Evil stalks our streets
It seeks to hide in our hearts
Have you not evil within you now
White sees a nearby
Staying low, he runs, almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts inside
The girl watches him
-  stands
Hysterical
She looks at the priest
He took my little boy
Iill rip out his eyes
-  White breaths relief
-  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him is a crucified insect
voice surprises him
Another , You have sinned
Ah
White watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate wooden grill in front of his face
am listening
(lying) Thereis a
woman
don't know but  think , ahh
You fornicated
The Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards White, but keep walking
No
, ah
You seem restless
The Mystery Men seem to have gone
White takes out the gun, keeping it hidden from the priest
Opens the chamber
-  Only   left
Someoneis after me
Then we must call the police
No
mean
that isnit necessary
The silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward
see
Then who is after you
What sins have you committed
Just let me sit here for a moment
Iill go soon, and stop bothering you
The priest suddenly stares incredulously at White
His eyes widen in horror
Youire the murderer
(starts to yell) Yes
That must be it
Donit kill me
White lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other over his mouth
The old man stares at him, trembling uncontrollably
Shut up
Listen
Walk out quietly
(holds up gun) Understand
The priest nods stupidly
White pushes him out of the confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his back
Together they head for the doors
Still no sign of the Mystery Men
Donit kill me
Shut up
Please
White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently
(not so quietly) Iim not going to kill you, okay
Faces turn
The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand
While White is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away
(shouting/pointing) People start to scream and run
The   points at White
(screams insanely) Itis him
Rip out his eyes
Frightened, White holds the gun out
Everyone panics, scatters
People run for the exit
Religious statues topple and smash
The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor, trampled by the crowd
Amidst the chaos, the two   appear across the room, see White, head towards him
He turns and runs
White climbs narrow stairs rapidly
White stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street through a series of arched windows
low, raftered room, three huge black
Suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to swing, build momentum
---
cacophony of noise
White puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the stairs
Through the swinging bells  -  the   climb the last few steps on the other end of the dark room
They advance slowly, clutching daggers
White raises his gun
Aims
Difficult to find his target  - the approaching  are obscured by the bells
White steps sideways, never taking his eyes off the Men
They follow him slowly, pivoting about the bells in the centre of the tower, pursuers and pursued remaining a semi-circle apart
(shouts) What do you want
Tell me
The Men stop
So does White
They separate, now approaching him from  sides, moving around the bells
White doesnit know who to point the gun at  -  he swings back and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the Men approach
He lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right, thrusts the gun to one Manis forehead
The Man steps back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing, into the shaft at the centre of the tower
The second Man  his dagger at White
White falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily
The Man advances, smiling  -  kicks the gun across the wooden floor
White, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on a loose floorboard
The board flies up, pivoting against Whiteis heel, catches the Mystery Man with a  under the chin
White runs at the off-balance Man, head-butts him in the stomach
The Man recoils, canit stop, steps off backwards into space,    towards the street below
White relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun
Looks down at the floor
Broken glass and capsules everywhere  -  he dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle
Starts to pick them up
Behind him  is rising
The shadowy Mystery Man is   back up to the bell-tower
He lands behind White, approaches, lifting his dagger, closer and closer
White glances around
The Man lunges, pushing White towards the shaft beneath the swinging bells
White , dangles over dark space, the Man stands above him
(shouts) Do not make us hurt you
The bells are swinging very close to the Man
It will be inconvenient, yes
Suddenly, to Whiteis amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell clips the Manis head
it against a low wooden beam in the ceiling
splash of black liquid
The Man slumps to the ground, his head crushed beyond recognition
White pulls himself up  -  stands over the Manis body, trying to decide what to do
catches his eye
the collapsed Manis ear  -  something moves inside , half-dead, crawls out of his crushed head
White revolted,  the insect under his shoe
/
- screaming
Faces contort with pain
: Electricity  between electrodes
building against the sky
The windows
Glass blows out, raining down on the street
concrete wall
Slime oozes through the crack
An old man, walks on a deserted street, looks up at the sky
One of the lenses of his spectacles  without warning
chair falls over in a dark room
woman under a hair-dryer gossips on a phone
Suddenly the phone emits a high-pitched shriek
Her ear spouts blood and she screams
small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short circuits with a spark
-  a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly  - completely haywire
stands on a street corner staring blankly at his watch
Taps it several times, annoyed, then looks up at a He holds a piece of paper in his other hand  -  on it a number rapidly scrawled:  23
The dilapidated building  -  arched windows only on the topmost floor
faded number on the facade  -  also 23
The windows light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light
The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room
move about
Bumstead glances at a  , standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival
To the side,    flashes something swinging back and forth, hanging from the ceiling
It looks like
Fredrick
Dead
His arms and legs missing
pool of blood beneath the mutilated torso
Bumstead looks at the cop
How long have you been here
Maybe ten minutes
(looks at his watch) Thatis strange
Spinning backwards
The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger
He looks up
Bumstead indicates his own watch
Yours too
Bumstead nods
He removes a notebook from his pocket, walks about the room, glances at objects, makes notes
Bumstead steps over to a small   in the wall
He examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head through
On the other side is a corridor snaking off into darkness
Just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a puddle
Lying half in the puddle is the business card of Doctor
Schreber
Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby cop
want prints over here
Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadis head in it
He struggles
The cop and the photographer run over to help
- a doorway
Above it a small illuminated red sign: He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnit have anymore
white room, bare
Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents
is typing behind her desk
fills the room
The nurse stands, removes her shoe and hits a pipe running along the wall several times
The noise stops
The front door creaks open and White enters
She watches him step into the room
want to see the doctor
It's important
What time was your appointment
(angry) Look
Tell him 'm here
Now He's leaning across her desk threateningly
(scared/standing) Yes, certainly
Who should  say
No idea
Just get him
Suddenly a door opens and  , clutching a file of papers, steps out
He freezes, stares at White
The papers fall from his hands to the floor
- group of   file into a concrete room
The   have gathered
Like the Men who pursue White, they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near white skin
One  points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the peculiar foreign tongue
-  a path through the city
circle marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral
The Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent
1 It has failed
stands at the rear of the room
2 This is becoming dangerous, yes
starts to tremble violently, seized with some kind of convulsion
He froths at the mouth and throws his head about
standing beside him opens a silver box, removes a small
He places this on the tip of the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down
3 Let's get this over with
rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of the group
5 What about the dance-steps
This is my responsibility, we must resolve this issue, yes
turn to face him
He is out of line
He becomes irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself short, sits down
5 Sorry
3 The situation has changed
(pacing the room) This one is in possession of knowledge
1 (cuts in) to avoid influence, yes
4 freak
1 Impossible
attracts everyone's attention
They all look to a round portal high on a wall
The noise is louder
several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then the noise subsides
The   go back to more important things
3 It gets interesting, yes
2 Stop this
It has gone too far
Tell Mister Black
Man 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards
' down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign says,  :
White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden desk
paces up and down in front of glass jars containing preserved specimens
He stops, looks at White
You remember nothing
Who you are
What you've done
You know something about me
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it
(smiles) Is there nothing you remember
Not even a detail
You must try
You think  haven't been trying
(calms himself) It's like there was never anything there
(pauses) Just water
Water
Waves
beach
woman whispering
That's all
(looks up, yawns) need to stay awake
Do you have any pills
The doctor walks to a glass cabinet and removes a bottle, takes out two green capsules
Hands them to White
Sits behind the desk again
What does she say
The woman
Asks my name
Over and over
Just like a broken record
Only thing is, can't answer
've no idea what my name is Your name is John White
That's what people keep telling me
Te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner, returns, hands White a glass of water
White swallows the pills
(indicates pills) And what's this about
Why
White stands up, starts to pace nervously
Bad dreams
Yes
Tell me about them
(interrupts) Yeah well, why don't  ask some questions for a change
If you like
You're supposed to be my doctor, right
That's right am your doctor
White is very agitated now, his voice is getting edgy
Known me for long
Well
(cuts in) Am  a killer
cannot say
You don't know the answer to that
told you,  can't remember a thing
White reaches across abruptly,  the doctor
(angry now  -  shouting) Look, you know something about me, out with it
Let's end this bullshit
want answers
The doctor is obviously scared
We won't get anywhere like this
Please
Let's take things in easy steps
' /  - -  Being pushed into a map
seeming random pattern across the terrain of the city
Each pin is labelled:   1,  2,
etc
He's tired, like he hasn't slept
He's looking at the map stuck to a wall
There's several neat piles of folders on the kitchen table in front of him
The kitchen itself is incredibly neat  -  everything completely organized
Bumstead shakes his head slowly, turns away from the board
Picks up a cup of hot tea, pours milk into it from a small jar
-  Cream  into a rapidly dissolving spiral
Bumstead looks up
Puts down the cup hurriedly, turns back to the map
With a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking the location of the victims
He steps back to examine his handiwork
-  moving outwards
Beyond the last victim it becomes a dotted line, following the same trajectory but with a big question mark beside it
Bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and addresses on it
He holds up the doctor's card and stares at it
He turns it over, notices an address on the back
'   - is showing  a series of
The doctor seems nervous about White's potential for further violence
Put simply
a penetration of the left parieto-occipital area of the cranium
complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges
Without going into detail
the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles, producing incipient atrophy of the medulla
(cuts in) Look
It was a simple question
Can someone kill and not remember it
(smiles) 'm sorry
get carried away sometimes
Possible
'm
ah, afraid so
Did she drown
The woman you told me about
Not exactly
She was found in a canal, disembowelled
Throat cut
Blood drained
The body wrapped in a bed-sheet
White shakes his head, looking blankly at the doctor
Horrible
You remember nothing, eh
(shakes his head) Let me show you something
Schreber turns, points to -
He walks towards these
White follows
Formation of memories is the most important of brain functions
They step into a room of living animal experiments
We are little more than a sum of memories
From them we reference who we are, where we're going
Without a past we are nothing
This is why you are so interesting
'm nothing then
Anything but , my friend
The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its movements
It feels no pain
White turns and starts to pace away
Schreber reluctantly follows
Can  get my life back
Maybe
Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing two rats
We know of two kinds of memory
Firstly, declarative memory
The rats perform various activities involving mazes and geometric symbols
Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow raised
And then there is procedural memory
-  pointing to a machine also run by rats
The object is to make it through a guillotine device
One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two
Follow
White nods
Research on simple animals can be
useful
To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example
am building an experiment with hamsters next
(looks at nearby cage of hamsters) Cute little things
Schreber puts a hand on White's shoulder
Listen to me talk
You must be hungry
White nods again, extremely troubled
- (' ) Schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a maze-like series of rooms and halls
White is led down a dark hall by Schreber, clutching a candle
Whole damn wing lost power
Wiring's old
Keep meaning to get it fixed
Here we are
They've stopped outside a flaking door
small eat-in kitchen
Dirty and run-down
White, sits at a bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator
The doctor holds up a large  fish
Ah
Beautiful
Head and all
Just how  like 'em
-  The fish lands in it and starts to sizzle furiously
'm sorry
About before
don't blame you for getting angry
You are in a frustrating situation
You must be patient though
Trust me completely
'm here to help
set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open slightly and   looks in
(to Schreber) have to talk to you
It can't wait
She shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out again
(to White) Excuse me
Ah, make yourself at home
He leaves
Alone, White looks around the bleak room
He takes off his coat and sits down again
He removes the
The eye opens
The creature looks up at him
It breaths painfully
Still kicking, huh
He puts it back in his pocket
The  fish is spattering oil everywhere
Smoke starts to fill the room
White, steps over and looks at the frying pan
The fish is turning black
He turns the heat down
He notices a   in the wall
At eye height
He steps across, looks through
' eye through the hole
dark room
Shadows on the wall
Something wet, some kind of , moving in the darkness
He can hear breathing and whispering voices
White's eyes start to blur, he rubs them
How are things in here
White spins, like he's caught doing something wrong
The Doctor walks across to the stove, prods the frying fish with a fork
Ah, nearly done
So tell me about your dreams
'm very interested
White is having a hard time focusing
Just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind
You know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing
'
-    Schreber with his back turned, at the stove
is blurring
Ah, our friends in black
they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real
Smoke rises thickly around the doctor
know everything about you
You have no choice but to trust me
Flames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan
His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire, his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull
Scarey, isn't it
White startles awake
Schreber stands at the stove looking at White
Everything is normal
Are you feeling alright
White stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on
What are you doing
have to go
You can't go yet
We've got so much to talk about
Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady himself
You're tired
You need to lie down
-  swaying
Those pills
The scene is distorted  -  like looking through water
Things start
(echoic) Yes
little something to help you relax
Harmless
tile floor  rapidly
: Objects float underwater
They rise upwards amidst bubbles, break the surface
storm at sea  -  dismembered float all the way to the horizon
in separate jars are talking to each other through the glass
1 This is madness
If we're caught
2 Shut-up
Help me with these straps
wakes strapped to an exantination table
and the loom above him
The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome The doctor moves towards White
(holds syringe up) Now you must relax, Anton
-
The nurse makes for the door
Leave it
He's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air bubbles
-  again  -  very insistent
Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed
Damn
Whoever it is  -  get rid of them
She heads to the door  -  turns back
Keys
Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a huge collection of  on a ring, walks to the nurse, hands them to her
White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap holding him
The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door, locks it
He steps over to White
'm sorry  had to put you through this, Anton
(lowers syringe to White's forehead) There will be some pain, but things will be easier this way
White lashes out,  the doctor in the face
His glasses go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for the spectacles
convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds
He undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe '
The struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe on the other
White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards
Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical instruments
loud  on the examination room door
White is grabbed from behind, pinned down with the syringe  from his face
Splintering wood
The door bursts open
-  is revealed, clutching a police special, flashing a badge
squeaky, over-excited, voice: Hold it
Schreber and White  in mid-struggle, look at the inspector
Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway
Police
Nobody move
He tried to kill me
Shut up
Everybody stay calm
Bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face, handcuffs him
Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver, takes this
Also takes his wallet
He glances at the doctor, who hides the syringe behind his back
(to Doctor) You Schreber
Schreber nods blankly
Bumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels something
What's that
White says nothing
The inspector opens the pocket and looks in
(disgusted) fish, huh
- An old-fashioned   drives over a rusty suspension bridge
Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle
It's been raining
Streets are empty
and the  drive silently
Bumstead has appointed his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home
Hot thermos
Note pad holder, complete with light
Coat hanger
Gun rack
system for everything
Dammit
(glances at his watch) 'm curious
How many so far
He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear
(confused) What
(counts on fingers) Let's see, there's the little guy with no arms or legs
And the young boy
(disturbed) Young boy
-  frightened now
The six year old
Sure, you remember
Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard
, carefully wrapped and prepared
After glancing at his watch again, he bites into it
(chewing) 'know, the kid you left in the meat packing plant, cut into pieces
Packed into brown paper parcels, wrapped in twine, that kind of thing
No answer
You sure have demonstrated a great deal of
imagination
The baby was the best though
Several cops lost their lunch over that one
Head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech
(cuts in) Stop it
You're making me sick
We count seven so far
Anyone we missed
-   tinny voice cuts in
Inspector Bumstead
Inspector
Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it
What is it, Crenshaw
Just reminding you
your eight pee em
Dammit
(looks at watch) Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw
Remind me to give you my watch
It needs fixing
Yes sir
Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a as he finishes off the sandwich
Where are we going
Shut-up
Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel
White is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him
He leans down to scratch through his trousers
(quietly) Shit
Gesundheit
(looks up) didn't sneeze
- The 's car pulls up and stops
What are we doing here
Bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat
Get out
- pushes the handcuffed  through a swinging metal door
They enter a sterile air-conditioned room
An effeminate   sits behind a glassed-in counter
Directly opposite is a small   through a glass panelled door
Bumstead pushes White into this room
Wait here
The inspector shuts the door behind him
White looks about the blank room, takes a seat
He can see Bumstead, through the glass panel in the door, walk up to the male nurse opposite
The inspector talks to the male nurse through a tiny opening in the window
Bumstead
'm here to see my mother
He cannot hear anything of what Bumstead is saying
He sees him take out his wallet and show his badge
The male nurse is concerned, looks over towards White, then opens a drawer, hands Bumstead a
The inspector steps back to the waiting room door and   from the outside
He looks at White for a moment, then walks away, along the corridor
Bumstead enters darkness  -  pneumatic   fills the gloom
He walks quietly to his mother, encased in a metallic contraption, something like an iron lung
(whisper) Brought you these
He places flowers on the bedside table
His mother just stares expressionless into space, in a coma
He sits on a metal chair, looks at the woman
Her life-sustaining machines hiss and breathe
presses down on the sticky surface of a page
It pulls away revealing an inky finger-print
White is standing in a bare room, in front of a finger-printing machine
He's alone
blast of electrical -
White looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall
(through speaker) Move  -  forward
White follows a painted line on the floor, stands against a wall, in front of an old-fashioned camera
slot opens in the wall behind him, mechanical arms spring forward, restrain him, one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him
flash goes off, the click of a shutter
Left  -  profile
claw lowers from the ceiling, grips White's head, turns it abruptly  -  the camera fires
Right  -  profile
The claw turns his head the other way
The camera fires again
Move  -  forward
Across the room   , a red light flashes above a door
White is released by the mechanical hands, walks over, opens the door and steps into darkness
-  extremely bright
room for line-ups  - markings on the white wall behind White indicate varying heights, a darkened window faces him
He is obviously to be identified by an unseen person
buzzer sounds again, a light indicates another door
Move  -  forward
White moves into another room
chair faces a large wheel painted in a black and white spiral
He sits down  -  the wheel turns, faster and faster
Watch  -  the  - wheel
The wheel stops after several seconds
Move  -  forward
The next room is full of scientific equipment
Stand  -  behind  -  the  -  screen
White sees a metal-frame -ray machine  -  he steps across to it
The screen lights up, filling the room with a green glow
We can see the shape of his skeleton
Where his pocket would be, is the tiny skeleton of the fish
Move  -  forward
The next room is empty
Face  -  the  - wall
White turns
As soon as he has done this hears a door open behind him
approach
Blows rain down on him, fists, boots, clubs
He slides to the floor
The lights go out
come on again
White is dazed  -  in a chair, a bright light in his face blinds him
What's your name
(squints into light) don't remember
Oh, no
White shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor
The light is angled away, pointed down towards
White can see now
featureless room
stands over him, behind him is and two shadowy guards
Bumstead picks up an envelope, removes a   , hands these to Stromboli
John
He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White
black and white police photo of a murder victim
Murderer
Another photo goes down
Another victim
Another and another
Each more grisly than the last
You'll sign a confession
White nods
He's looks utterly lost
Bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near the only door, presses a button
(into speaker) Okay
immediately step through the door,  White by his arms
They carry him off
White is woken by a   shining a light in his eyes
Visitor
White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier down the middle
The guard tells him to sit and wait
The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  - steps in, looking frightened
(to guard) Keep him away:  He's insane
The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly
Please, stay calm
(to guard) This man wants to kill me
The guard remains indifferent
(to guard) Just one of his many delusions  - it's nothing
(a whisper to White) Shut up
Listen, damn you
This is a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't get another chance like this
Listen to me
(turns to Doctor) What do you want
You're innocent
(still a whisper) You didn't kill anyone
(sarcastic) What am  doing in here then
Listen to what  have to say
Decide for yourself
The dark silhouettes of  and   watch from behind a two-way mirror
What's he doing here
Says he is the man's doctor
(taps side of his head) You know
know it's his doctor
(into intercom) need the file on
(reads clip-board) Daniel Paul Schreber
'
Schreber
Yes
Isn't that his doctor
(evenly) Yes
(beat) And it's -  with an 'h'
Yes
An "h"
The inspector looks up from the speaker
-    , White seems to have calmed down
The men in black  -  they're the killers
White stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass
You're a liar
No, it's the truth
So you're telling me the truth this time
Is that it
The doctor removes a   from his black bag, places it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the guard's view
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer
Not that again
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this
(points to syringe) But this one's special
It will help you understand, everything
(cuts in) 'm not injecting anything into my brain
Anton  -   mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment
arranged it
It was a lie from the beginning
It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have
You have been left  - blank
Schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him
You can change this, all this
(points at syringe again) But you must take it
White stares blankly at him for a moment, then: You've been working too hard
Please
Don't be foolish
Time is short
Let me show you something
Look at this syringe
Why
Don't ask stupid questions
Look at it
White reluctantly does this
Concentrate
Imagine the syringe rising
Picture it floating above the table
Do it
'
The syringe starts to vibrate, actually      - floats stationary between White and Schreber
It's a trick
No it isn't
You are doing it
Now raise it over the glass and
Suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor,  itself in his shoulder
He yelps, grabs it
Oh, sorry
The doctor pulls out the syringe, is about to say more when a Your  -  time  -  is  -  up
Schreber looks to where the voice came from  -  a speaker above their heads
(looks at White) gave you your chance, now it's too late
They'll learn you are here soon
It's all over
paces towards the exit
steps in front of him
The doctor is startled
Doctor
What brings you here
Just visiting my patient
Really
And how is his state of mind
He's seriously disturbed
The doctor is nervous, glancing about
You seem a little edgy
Everything okay
Yes, of course
Everything's fine
He tries to push past
Bumstead grabs his arm
To tell you the truth, 'm glad we've run into each other like this
Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends
Loose ends
looks like a trapped animal, when: Bumstead
Bumasead turns to look down the corridor
He sees peaking out of his office door
need to speak to you
Immediately
The door shuts again
Bumstead turns back
The doctor is -  the corridor empty
White is staring through a glass door at The cop gets up and moves off
White looks up
small , high up on the wall
Impossible to get to, even if his hands weren't cuffed
Nothing he can do  -  he looks at a clock on a wall
on the clock  -
enters ' office
nervous - is flanked by  -  in ill-fitting brown suits
Bumstead, these
er, gentlemen are here to collect White
Bumstead suspiciously eyes the two men, beside ' desk
(to men) Who are you
(even more nervous) Please, Bumstead
Co-operate  - it's easier
This is highly irregular
have a right to know
1 We are from a mental asylum
He notices that this man's moustache is -
The other man wears spectacles    in the frames, clutches an un-lit pipe in his teeth
Yes
That's right
He's ill  -  he needs expert help
see
1 Yes, Inspector
Has he been displaying any strange
behaviour
He's been a little angel
If you could show them to the holding cell now
on Bumstead's face
Bumstead and the   walk towards the holding cell
Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he enters
'
He fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -   into the room
White is gone
But where
Bumstead throws a look back
1 Where is he
The cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee
He looks at the inspector, sees the room is empty
nervous twitch knocks the cup from the cop's hands
-  smashing on the floor
- Underground
of trains arriving and departing but none are seen
broken tiles on a wall to :    - sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused, groggy from sleep
He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully tries to free them from the cuffs
He starts to cry
He puts his head in his hands, his body spasms with each sob
of the empty corridors of the subway
White's crying is heard  -  echoic
-   small feminine  touches his head
Startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be attacked
from the church looks down at him
and the  are getting grilled by
Yes, sir
'm sorry
But  don't understand how it was possible
The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed
(shouts at cringing ) How could you have been so stupid
'm sorry, sir
Alright, get out
Bumstead gets up and leaves
You stay
The cop hustles out, shuts the door
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me
This case is very important to me
Just a little warning:  've got my eye on you inspector, remember that
Yes, sir
He leaves
White, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat, follows the   up a flight of dark stairs
she keeps looking back at him, smiling but
White and the woman step into a run-down apartment
She points to a couch
White looks uncomfortable
She smiles again, then turns on the radio
She steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone
He gets up and starts to tune the radio
babble of fragments of voices and music, then:
earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended
White listens nervously
and now for a message from - food products
Across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar
He crosses to the doorway and looks in
The woman stands naked against a deep red wall, her back turned
She has an elaborate on her back  -  looks like an
She puts on a dressing gown and
White steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the couch
She steps from the doorway holding a    in her hand
She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at him
White looks down
His hands seem to have   -  they poke out of his sleeves like tiny children's limbs
The cuffs effortlessly slip off
White looks at the woman, then back at his hands  - , they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been removed
He looks at the woman again, grateful
He can't help smiling
Her eyes
Her lips
Her neck
She leans forward, goes She touches her tongue to his lips
Kisses his face
She pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open
White does not respond  -  seems uncertain
She sits upright, astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses his chest
She stops, her face in shadow
Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them
She starts to breath deeply
-  their bodies entangle, begin to move rhythmically
The   ,  a microphone behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall
On the other side of the one-way glass a reel-to-reel tape recorder is picking up the
The building the lovers are in   into the air, past taller buildings and floats out over the city
Its shadow moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers
White sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window
He opens his eyes,  himself awake
Looks across the dark room
The   stands naked at the window, clutching a large red megaphone
she shouts down at the streets drifting past
He's up here
He raped me
Hurry
Before he kills again
stand on roof-tops, watching the building drift past
White runs to the window,  the woman
As they struggle, the building is landing softly in another part of the city
move towards the entrance
-  finds he is still on the couch of the woman
Then he notices her standing by the window (minus megaphone)
The wind pulls at her black hair distant
He gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the dark city
She ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a table-lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal shadows on the wall
White watches her
He walks across and sits next to her
She points to herself
(a whisper) Sachiko
He nods slowly, looks at her
She waits for him to respond with his name
He shrugs, remains silent
Then he puts his hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow
That's me
'm a shadow
She smiles at the shadows
Do  look like a murderer to you
She just keeps smiling, not understanding
Kisses him
He notices an old phone on a corner table, removes the note again and rings the same number
This time, after several rings the call is answered
'
Yes
Who is this
Who's there
White remains silent
Sachiko stands and leaves the room
'
John Is that you
Who is this
What do you know about me
In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko hesitates momentarily
She slides a hand into White's coat, removes the wallet
She takes out some cash, puts the wallet back, then she
- pulls up in his car
Across the street is ' surgery
He is about to get out of the car, when the and   steps into the street
Bumstead watches the shadowy man for a moment
Then gets out and , assuming it is Schreber
Bumstead follows inconspicuously
Without warning, the figure stops and
Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide
He gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a   in the dim light of the alley
When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of the Man  -  like he disappeared into thin air crosses the wall beside Bumstead
He spins, looking around behind him
Then he looks up into the air
The shadow of a   crosses the face of a building
- wet dog sits in a corner gnawing a bone
crackly voice recites a list of names from a small speaker-box mounted to a wall presses a door buzzer
, opens the door and looks out
-     in the dark corridor adjusting her hair nervously
She pushes past the Japanese woman, into the room
John
stands inside the room, looking at the woman, expressionless
The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him, kisses him passionately
White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts
He pushes harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor
She starts to cry
The   past flaking bricks  -  to a window
Behind the glass  and  sit across from the  who attacked White
She is talking, though nothing can be heard, drying her eyes with a handkerchief
The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs
Please believe me
It's me , John
Your wouldn't lie to you
You told me  could come and see you -  now you want to just send me away again
White looks
-  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement underneath
thought it would make more sense
'm getting the pieces, but when put it together it feels like
Like you're telling me about somebody else's life
It's the truth
need you know you're innocent
How do you know 'm innocent
Of course you are
You couldn't do those terrible things
Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then
can't do that
It's dangerous
What about my parents
Do you know where  can find them
They're dead, John
He stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city
You have an uncle
You were very close
She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it to White
This is where he lives
'm sure he would like to see you
(taking paper) Thanks
(looks at him for a beat) Don't you want me
My body
Remember how my skin feels
Touch it
She notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious
Sachiko silently stands and leaves the room
The wife puts her face in her hands, overcome with tears
What's your name
(looks up  -  still sobbing) Elizabeth
White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it matches
(thoughtful) Yes
In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple
She want to help
Alright
Here
He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman can see it
Know this place
She looks at the card
(stops crying) Of course
Your home town  -  where you grew up
White stands abruptly, startling the woman
He glares down at her intensely
How do  get there
Tell me
That's easy
You
She trails off into silence
Her hand, about to point in a certain direction, freezes in mid-air
strange,  forgot
White sits back down quietly
Yes
Very strange
Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor
Underneath is a -
Opening it, she climbs down a hole
In the semi-darkness she moves to a
She cranks a small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open
Music plays softly
She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box
- apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her thigh
She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes
-  feet walk along a tattered rug, approach a door
Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always
startles a huddled man in a blanket, sitting before a small t
v
set
This is   -  the detective with mental problems
He's unshaven, haunted
Clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy- hole
Bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch
Thompson backs away, points his gun at the figure through the door
Go away
Open up, Thompson
It's me
Thompson puts his eye to the door again
Bumstead
-  the inspector turns, looks at us, his face , fish-like
Thompson undoes four locks, opens the door a crack, but leaves it chained
Can't let you in
sorry
'm on the serial killer case, need to talk
Not that
Anything else
Thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead
You don't look so well
'mon, let me in Thompson
Thompson stares at Bumstead, then silently unchains the door and lets him through
can't talk about that As long as you understand, that's all
The room is very dark
Bumstead is assailed by a wave of putrid smells
It's a mess  -  rotten food, overturned furniture, dirty clothes
Pull up some garbage  -  make yourself at home
Thompson smiles weakly
They sit down, face each other in the gloom
scuttles past Thompson
With lightning reflexes he throws a shoe at it
The rat runs under a table
He looks back at Bumstead, smiles, slightly insane
They've taken my mind, my memories
What
Who has
Is that your idea of a joke
don't remember
(looks around) Take my advice, Bumstead
Get off this case
Now
What is going on
(looks more frightened) Wish  could tell you, Bumstead
Strange business
He screams horribly
Stands, clutching his head
Startled, Bumstead falls backwards off his chair
Thompson, still clutching his head, runs and starts    against the wall
Get away
Leave me alone
Thompson's head is   -  bloating
It rapidly elongates into a pink fleshy tube
Thompson's head continues to grow -  his features are lost beneath folds of skin
His screaming is stifled
Thompson falls to the floor
His head    -  larger than his body
Small tendrils sprout from the main appendage
Bumstead takes cover behind a sofa
Then, as violently as the head began to transform, it stops
Bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple growth sprouting from Thompson's collar
At the top of the growth an orifice opens
An  of green bile spouts into the room  -  covers everything in sight
Then the head starts to shrink
Thompson's features appear again
It returns to normal size
Thompson groans, sprawled on the floor, clutching his head
Bumstead looks on in horror
It's  -  it's disgusting,  know
Thompson's face is heavily bruised, covered in sweat
His nose starts to bleed  -  he wipes it on his sleeve
Jesus
We have to get you to a doctor
No
No doctor
Bumstead stands unsteadily
But
How long has this been happening
few days
a few weeks  -  dunno, can't remember
(stands slowly) Worse thing is,  never know if it will change back again
Now, please leave me alone
- ,  and  sit around a small table, eating quietly
Without warning, Elizabeth starts to cry again
White tries to ignore her
Sachiko looks sadly at the wife, puts a hand on her shoulder, gives her a handkerchief
The woman quietens down
They resume eating but in no time Elizabeth again bursts into tears
White looks at her now
(through sobs) Sorry
Sachiko leans across and puts her arm around Elizabeth, helps her to her feet
Elizabeth hangs onto the woman as she is led from the room
White can hear the sobbing still, as the women move through to the bedroom
They sit on the edge of the bed  -  Sachiko holds Elizabeth's hand, smiles at her
(calmer now) 'm sorry
This is embarrassing  - my husband doesn't know who  am
With this, she starts to cry again
Sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips
- speaking in whispers
The Men continue talking as   , through several levels of concrete and machinery  : -  - are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna device
The group of   have gathered once again
One addresses them all
The line of junction between two edges
(unison) We have located him
Now is the time, yes
switch is thrown
Electricity sparks to life
hum is in the air
Let the tuning commence
The congregation of  place  to their foreheads in a trance-like manner
They chant, quietly at first, steadily building in volume
The  stand and   to some inner beat
The    to a diagram pinned on a board representation of a man's legs
Trousers rolled up above the knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh
Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion -  the legends are an unknown language
The antenna glows with a ghostly green light /  - White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the window
distant screams
He glances across to a wall, notices   there  -  something about it looks
'
distorted electronic image of White's  looming up
At exactly that moment the   , flies erratically down the hall, around a turn and disappears
White follows

It is ajar, dark inside
Movement
The women are naked on the bed
The   has her eyes shut, head back in ecstasy
The  is bent over her, kissing her stomach
-  watching through the crack in the door
The women are oblivious
He moves away slowly, feeling strange
His feet stop making contact with the floor
He grabs a table to steady himself
The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and smash
He's
White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the light-fixture in the ceiling
It breaks off in a cloud of plaster
Sparks briefly illuminate
He falls heavily -  now the floor
The apartment is upside down
He stares up at furniture and objects
White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing heater stuck to the floor
Water is running  -  filling the tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's head
White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the floor
It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off
Pulls himself towards the tub
Gravity becomes   as he sinks in the warm water
He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath
Submerges his face
distant throbbing
, like a huge machine heart somewhere in the building
He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling
blurry   moves into his vision
It stares down at him
White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the thin veil of water
The  reaches out grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully
White gulps for air, swallows water
His eyes widen
He tries to stop the hand strangling him but can't
Suddenly the hand pulls away
The   stumbles back and  into bloody explosion
The body splits apart, throwing internal organs through the room
White awakens in the bathtub
He looks about the room
Empty
Silent
He gets out of the water, starts to dress

Small world

No one available
third   steps up to the cop in charge, glancing at the bile on Bumstead's suit
They won't come out
We'll interrogate them anyway
The cop leads Bumstead behind a
small area neatly arranged  -  a double bed, various possessions
Someone obviously lives here
The room is empty however
This is the family of the victim  - apparently they were in the apartment when he committed
(looks around empty room) What are you talking about
Oh, yes
He walks to  , bends over and lifts the bed-spread
In the shadows underneath, Bumstead can make out man, an old woman, three or four children
They don't speak English
How will we interrogate them
Well, sir
don't know exactly
Under the bed, Bumstead can see a
He walks over to her
She puts a hand over her mouth, edges away
It's alright
won't hurt you
Without coming out from under the bed she hands the inspector a crumpled paper
He looks at it then glances over his shoulder

The    steadily, into a crack running along the length of the divider  -  we can see the room on the other side, with the cops moving about

There's too many loose ends with your case

What do you know about these men in black

Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then  understood why
He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint
They didn't have faces
What
That's right
Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads
No mistake
just hadn't remembered it that way
Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory

Once  started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had
inconsistencies
It was like a game
would think about a person or a place, or an event
Then  would turn the lights off
Sit down in a comfortable chair
And study each detail of this subject
He glances at White, then back to the road
Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me
Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then: Is there anything you haven't told me about this business
Even the most insignificant thing
(thinking) No
Nothing  can think of
Except
Go on
Well
The only thing 've been certain of, all this time, is that need to get to the ocean
The point is no one seems to know how to get there
Why, that's ridiculous
You just
He trails off
Shakes his head slowly
We'll get to the bottom of this mean it
' The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open suddenly
White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the doctor before he can protest
met a friend of yours the other night, doctor
Tall fellow
No hair
Rather pale skin
don't know what you're talking about
That's surprising
He was leaving your office at the time
You are mistaken
What are you hiding
Nothing
don't know anything
removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face
Please, they'll kill me
think it's time you introduced us to your little friends
- ,    sit in Bumstead's car in an alleyway
Schreber points to a    in a wall
In there
Just like that
The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall
Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the foot of the door, lifts it and takes a  from underneath
He unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside
He waves the other men forward
White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the mat  -  it says:   on it
Through the door  -
There is only a down button
Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open
They step inside
The doors close, the lift descends
What is this place
You wouldn't believe me if  told you, Inspector
Have patience  - you'll see for yourself
When the doors open again the three men look out on a - The  wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base of the building
It stops,   into the steps repeatedly
It looks down and shrieks with a string of mechanical obscenities
' and  follow  down a corridor to what appears to be an ancient crypt
They enter a door  -  it has something written on it in a strange language
They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light switch, suddenly White  dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead turns to him
Look
White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks
On these hooks hang   coats -  that's not all
Each hook carries
Bumstead and White step closer, look at the faces
They seem to be elaborate, very life-like
Put them on
White and the inspector look at each other, incredulous
- The door opens
White, Bumstead and Schreber step out, wearing poorly fitting masks and coats  -
The three men come across a small area with a raised platform, between arches
number of   roll past on tracks  - the scene resembles some bizarre amusement-park ride
The carts are numbered on the side  -  all of them empty
Get in
Hurry
White, Bumstead and Schreber hop aboard
The cart takes them into a  , deeper into the secret underworld of the They   a subterranean landscape of unexplained contraptions and bones
(to Bumstead) Where do you think this goes
It sure isn't the fun-fair
The cart finally comes to a stop in a cave
Bumstead, White and Schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a walk past them
Follow me, and do exactly as  do
They join the end of the line, falling into step
The , with ,  and  in tow, enter and sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs
White and the inspector do the same
appear in circular portals high up on the concrete walls
faces the others at the front of the room
1 Eleven past eleven  -  the Night of the Eye
The seated Men start to
in the front row stands
2 The Eye is too small for the head of the pin
1 Yes
stands
Next to the first, who sits again
3 What is it that floats on the water
The Eye
1 Indeed
So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing part of the strange ritual
It will be White, Bumstead and Schreber's turn shortly
White is worried, looks at the others
(whisper) What do we do
(hisses back) Fake it
What
is next  -  he stands abruptly
The eye
Master of time and space
Then it's Bumstead's turn
The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with horseradish on rye
1 at the front seems confused for a moment  -   of the others turn towards Bumstead
1 (uncertain) Good
The inspector sits back down  -  whispers to White without looking at him
Nothing to it
White stands
Hesitates
Then: Eye
eye, captain
White sits down, shaking his head, embarrassed
1 Um  -  yes
rises up  -  keeps rising, above the Men's heads
4 My spine will bend for the Eye
He turns sideways, still floating
, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away
Was that for real down there
'm afraid so
The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him back
What the hell is that
At the end of the alley the  advances menacingly
Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and disappears
Quick
My car
Fortunately '  stands nearby
The two men leap in, start it up
Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the glare of the headlights
The puppet's head opens, a   pops out, spins, lifting the puppet into the air
The car passes beneath it at speed
Screeches off into a street, races along between tall buildings
What now
This ocean business
know where can find a map
need to go back to the station
Where will you be
White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him from his pocket
'll go see an uncle of mine
(reading) Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double six  -  three
Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with the wheel, driving at breakneck speed
Good
(looks in rear mirror) Uh-oh
White turns and looks behind them
-   gaining on them
-  sitting    of a stolen car, driving like crazy
' White takes out his gun  -   at the rapidly approaching car
(remembers) It's empty
Take mine
Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat
They swap
The puppet  , a mechanical arm extends towards Bumstead's front tire
extends from the end of the mechanical arm
---- heading for the spinning wheel
White fires
Shells hit the ' car, shattering windows
cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat, metal  off the road
White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash
Bumstead fights to keep control,  into the side of the other vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans flying
The ' car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side- street and disappears
(looks behind him) Where did it go
(looks back also) Don't know
Both look    -  to see the '  pull out in front of them,
Bumstead's car is going too fast
Slams the brakes
-  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car approaches like a bullet
' Jump
Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad
The two men
The car continues onwards
-
In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves up from different sides of the street
Look at each other, turn and head in  directions
on mangled metal  -  a   starts to pull itself from the wreckage
- White steps up to a   in the side of a building sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface
Dominating everything is a   with scales  -  a  -type
White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue curtain
In the booth a   is snoring with his mouth hanging open, his head sagging
White knocks on the window
The man wakes with a start
Yeah
That's what  said
(looks at White  - rubs head) What
'm looking for this address
The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily
Upstairs
Through there
He thumbs the blue curtain
Curls up, shuts his eyes again
dark room full of       -  an aquarium
Several corridors meander between large glass panels that look into illuminated tanks of sea creatures
White moves past a shadowy doorway
He can barely make out - White moves cautiously in the darkness
On a door a tiny says:
The door is unlocked
He opens it and goes in
An entrance hall of an apartment
large number of of all sizes line the hall
on the wall  -  family portraits
White examines these, concentrates on one in particular  -  a young boy on a red push- bike, in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in a bathing suit:
it says
strange
White hides behind a sofa
Whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly
White cannot see what it is
John
White turns to see an   in his pyjamas sitting in a The man pushes a lever on the side of the chair whir of electric motors
The chair carries him out of the shadows
White steps from behind the sofa
Are you alright
What are you doing here
Is this one of your jokes, John
It's been so long,  thought you'd forgotten your uncle Karl
Uncle
Karl
- -    a dark, claustrophobic pipe
around tight corners,  down straight lengths of ducting
Dim light spills from wire grills spaced along the walls
up to one grill, at the end of a long stretch of tunnel  -  stop, nowhere left to go
We can see through the gaps in the wire, looking down into
White and uncle Karl are having a -
Shots of a recent vacation  -  the uncle doing a series of mundane things
(chuckling) Not often  get a chance to show these
He changes the slide:  an image of him standing against a brick wall
And this is me again about  -  um  - would guess about twelve feet further to the right of the last shot
Now just behind the wall is the hotel stayed at  -  sweet little place
The
Uncle Karl wheels over, picks up the receiver
(talks down the line) Hello
Yes, he's here
(holds out the phone to White) It's for you
White concerned  -  takes the phone
Yes
(he listens) Oh, it's you
Yes
My uncle apparently
Just looking at some memories
You have
That's good
: - Bumstead talks to White on the phone
He stands in a dark room, surrounded by charts and maps
At first  thought there was no way to get to the ocean
The buildings are a barrier, no windows, no doors -  everything just, well, ends  -  only thing would be drill a hole
But then,  saw it, one door, just one
Inside a tenement building
Bumstead is interrupted by a
He looks to a frosted partition  -  dark figures walk past on the other side
He quickly sorts through  , making as little noise as he can
(whisper) We can meet later  -  but first have to do something
Look  got to go
: White holds  , listens to Bumstead on the other end
Where can we meet
Alright
Good
As White hangs up he notices   behind a big old crockery cupboard
The cupboard has been pushed up against the wall, hiding the door
quickly folds the map and shoves it into his pocket
As he turns and runs from the room we standing behind a shelf in the room
' continues to change slides  -  the noise echoing about the room
White moves over and sits down next to him
Look
This is a good one
What is that door
Which one
There
Behind the cabinet
Where does it go
The uncle watches the slides
Such a joker
Like your father
No
Have a look
He leads the old man over to the cabinet
You see it
Yes
Where does it lead
It must be a closet or something
White pushes at the cabinet
The old man helps
They only manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy
White decides to just climb over it
He squeezes through, opens the door and climbs a set of dark stairs
Uncle Karl watches
Don't trip over
It's dark up there
- a light switch  -  it is flipped
-  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions
White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been eaten out by a swarm of
He drops it in disgust as the insects scurry over his hands
In a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great interest
At the bottom of the box he finds a  - On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's writing  -  a title:    -    ,
White sits down and flips through the book in the dim light
Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings
As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more disturbed
He flips through faster and faster
Pages flip past, stopping occasionally
Glimpses of
The   and
Cross-sections of the , the cavity in their head with the   clearly illustrated
on White
He looks up,
' White emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his chest, lost in thought
He steps quietly into a hall-way  - notices the old man putting   back on its cradle
John,  didn't see you there
White and Uncle Karl turn falls off a wall, revealing a hole
shine from the darkness
leaps from the hole
Its blades unfolding, spinning wildly before it hits the carpet
It faces the two men
What is that (to Karl) Get back
Filthy beast
Shoo
Go on
Shoo
He wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off
No
The puppet goes for Uncle Karl
whirr of metal, and the walls
Uncle Karl horribly
White grabs a chair  -  holds it above him
The puppet turns from the dead man in the wheelchair
White lets it have it
The chair  , splintering into pieces
The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers
White has a fire-poker now
As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall
White runs out the door
He leaps into a waiting elevator
Pushes the top floor button
-  The elevator moves upwards
White looks through the circular window in the door
-  Floor after floor    -  deserted
He looks at the floor indicator
lighting up: 86, 87, 88
Then the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark corridor
The  is at the end
It turns to face him, , a horrible high-pitched shriek from its mechanical voice box
White  the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors won't close
The puppet is upon him
He , straight up
It goes under him,   the back of the elevator
White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the compartment
extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around the ankle
him across floor
shrieks wildly again, as
-  is  in the closing doors now
Lift descends
The puppet squeals
The arm
White stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle
He can hear the elevator descending
Suddenly it   -  starts returning to his floor
White turns and runs again
The lift doors    -  the   emerges and races after him
He tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end
Nowhere to go
He can hear the puppet approaching along the corridor
Suddenly he notice   on a wall
He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe
Crawls frantically
He sees a  ahead
An opening
He kicks the grill off sudden gust of wind
The pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go except a hundred stories
He screams, almost falls
Turns to start crawling back
Suddenly the end of the pipe fills with
The puppet has followed him in and is advancing
No choice  -  he looks out the hole
on the outside of the building, running vertically near the opening
It looks impossible but it's his only chance
He climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening, for the pipe
The puppet is almost upon him
He swings across, gets a  on the pipe
He slips,   - holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole
The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it
he hears a    -   to see the puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand
soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical giggle
circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves down onto White's
-  sweat beads and runs down his forehead
-  as it cuts into flesh
spatters White's face as he grimaces with intense pain
He can't hold on
, plummets through space
Screaming
- stand about '  on her life- support machinery
The surgeons have face-masks on and are in deep shadow
The woman stares blankly, still in a coma
looks up from his wristwatch
can't wait any longer
He is standing in front of the   in the glassed-in counter
'm sorry
told you, she is being examined
He turns and storms off down the corridor
The  stands, shouting after him
Mister Bumstead
' One of the "doctors" leans down and grabs a handful of leading out of a box beside the woman
We will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs
Yes
He pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks  - The woman comes to life momentarily, starts to claw at the glass shield in front of her face, like she is suffocating
The life drains from her weak body and she is -  it bursts open
Bumstead is standing there
The masked surgeons are startled, they turn rapidly to face him
(steps forward) What is happening
Ah, Inspector Bumstead
We are glad you are here  -  'm afraid we have done all we can
Yes
Your Mother has passed
Yes
Bumstead turns towards his mother
But she was getting better
We are sorry
The cancer  -  it was fatal
Bumstead turns to the men, confusion in his eyes
She doesn't have cancer
The men glance at each other for a moment, then back at the inspector
We knew that
Yes
(the other men nod) Anyway  -  she is dead
Bumstead leaps forward,   one of the surgeon's masks
-  He turns to look at Bumstead, pale skin, staring eyes, a
grab him from behind
(struggles) 'll kill you all
One of the Mystery Men steps up to the struggling inspector, places the palm of his hand across Bumstead's eyes
You will obey us, yes
In your mind there is a dark space
Bumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical implements, grabs a
He cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man attempting to hypnotise him
The other Men leap towards him
- ' His eyes are shut tight
He opens them, slowly  , curious why he isn't dead
White floats in -, hovering ten feet or so above a dark body of water
He looks amazed
Shuts his eyes, rubs them, opens them again
Still floating
He clenches his fists and  his body
Slowly he starts to , hovering at an even height over the water
feature the figure of White levitating across the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships
-  He comes to a stop
Smiles in amazement
Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has opened beneath him
floating to the surface
White's  rises slowly out of the water
- floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny white parachute
He swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself silently through the still canals of the city
Oil tankers move silently through inky water
White paddles the boat to the bottom of  , climbs a rotten ladder
He runs off into the shadows
The  cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear propeller
It reaches the pier, climbs to the top
The prop retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a concrete surface
It looks around  -  it knows White is there somewhere
'
trail of   on the ground
It follows them, is led to a crane cabin
'   -  is White, a lunatic grin on his face, at the controls
startles the puppet
It looks up
'
Follows the crane up into the air
The crane is swinging around against the dark sky
dangles, stops above the puppet
Nice knowing you
'   -  It pulls a lever
-  Shakes and starts to fall
-  Screams up at the plummeting container
The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature
Silence
Dust floats in the air
's running
He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it out alive
: - sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood
He waits
startles him  -    in the shadows across the roof
White
It's too big to be White
The man steps from the shadows
(walking forward) Hello, Bumstead
He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector
Bumstead lies bleeding, against the wall
He points his own gun at the advancing man and pulls the trigger
Dammit
Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away, picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall
Without Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand
Why do you always have to find things out the hard way
Couldn't you just do your job, you idiot
told you, didn't
These people are not playing games, Bumstead
They can do anything they want, don't you understand
(a hiss) You're one of them
You bastard
(laughing) In a way, we all are, inspector
You
Me
Everybody
Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the  of the roof
He keeps laughing
Time for that early retirement, Bumstead
Didn't bring the gold watch 'm afraid
(weakly) No
Please
'
looms up  -  a long drop to the street
White paces nervously through empty streets
He stops, to get his bearings, then turns and runs into: in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels
skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm
An inhuman moan
Terrorised, White pulls back
Ahhh
it hurts
The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall streetlight reveals
covered in blood, encased in a metal framework covered in silver blades
What happened to you
'm
being
punished
The blades are connected to the wheels  -  they turn when he moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly torture machine
Between screams of intense pain, the doctor speaks
had to  -  ahhhh  -  find you
The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his face
What is it
We are
living in their dreams
Schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming  - furiously, peeling back flesh
He glances at White one last time
Insect
dreams
is running
As he approaches the building he hears a scream  -  looks up to see a figure   the roof
He runs over
Looks down at the twisted body moans  -  barely alive
White kneels by his side
' hand moves across to an expanding  of red beside him, traces an '' on the ground in the blood
(reading) Aitch
The inspector seems to be dying, then revives momentarily, puts in white's hand, looks up at him: Gesundheit
His eyes roll up and he
White stares at the body, then: didn't sneeze
- The  turns off the lights in the main hall and steps into his office, sits down, pours himself a hot drink; turns on the radio, opens his conic-book
disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his office, looks into the darkness
around the empty morgue
Nothing
Decides to go back to his office
He turns and is startled by three obstructing his path
1 We are looking for the White victims
And who the hell are you The mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger Man 1 is clutching by his side
He becomes very scared
Over there
Numbers eight to twelve
look over to where the mortician has pointed in unison
Man 1 looks back
1 Thank you
The mortician's throat  blood
He grabs reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor, before he hits the tiles
The Mystery Men step to an adjoining chamber
Man 2 puts down a Box he is carrying, opens the lid
green glow oozes out
The other Men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby wall
Stainless steel doors open
Body-length trays slide into the dim light
covered in white sheets
Man 2 with the box removes a  , filled with a glowing green liquid
He steps    and injects each with the syringe, through the sheets
When he has finished he steps back, places the syringe back in the box
The  leave silently
All is silent and still
Then the shape beneath a sheet starts to
Then another, and another
- is running again, clutching '
the entire corridor
-  until the view is impossibly wide  -  like a cross-section of the building he's in, a doll's house with the roof taken off
The runs, amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and passages
White is no more than a   -  the hall-way stretches in both directions, behind and in front of the moving figure, through an infinite labyrinth
We no longer make out the figure
The x-rayed environment resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city  -  the corridor an ever increasing
- White reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs
''  -  a rusted metal letter on the door
White steps forward
He knocks once and the door creaks open, unlocked
The rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish
Mould grows on the damp walls
door stands at the end of a long empty room
He can hear the muffled sounds of ,
White starts to walk forward, smiling
As he approaches the door he begins to feel colder
He opens the door and looks out
blast of   -  blue ocean and sky
John White
White does not turn about, he takes a step forward, then another  - and      -
He glances up at a small  built into the wall  -  the  of the sea- side
He hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him
Hopes dashed, he turns
-  a gun pointed at White's stomach
There is nothing, Mister White
Beyond the city
Never has been
Unfortunate
Yes
White is led into a pitch black room
'   -  In the darkness  -  he looks across to the Mystery Man standing beside him
How did you know where to find me
We knew you would turn up here eventually
Been waiting for you, yes
Hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way
The Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward
As soon as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and shuts the door, cutting off any existing light
-  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights start to come up all over the room
It's a normal, average-sized, living room
All the furniture has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an arrangement resembling an   of law
In fact, White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box
The apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the kitchen) and a series of figures step through
All the  take up specific positions around the room, without uttering a word, but don't sit
One   opens a curtain beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small room, stand   , crammed shoulder to shoulder
The people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of spectators
An eerie silence falls on the room
The kitchen door opens again
White is shocked to see the the room and adopt positions in what is obviously the area for the jury
The      steps out of the shadows, pushing a pram
Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white sheet
Within the pram is the  clutching its own head, with spine attached, under its arm
Then the mutilated  hops out, followed by the three brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of the
Finally, his  and the  , still in passionate embrace, take their positions
Another door opens  -  a closet
Within stands the figure we have only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly   with the cane
slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the closet
Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a toilet is heard flushing
He is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting his withered body on his cane
Looks like he will play
Everyone in the room now sits
Mister Black looks at White
-  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear, but cold
Welcome
White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook called:
John White, you are to be tried for murder, yes
You wish to confess to these crimes now
White is silent
He leans over and scratches his legs through the fabric of his trousers
They itch like crazy
Mister Black turns to the assembled people
Very well
The testimony of the prosecutors
Yes
stand and step across to a wooden easel
1 stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc
drawn on stiff cardboard
2 uses a pointer while he describes the evidence to support their case
2 We will show that John White is abnormal, a menace to society, a dangerous sick individual, and that the court should have no mercy in finding him guilty and punishable to the extreme for his crimes
1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the easel
It shows White at the door of the  ' apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood
1 Exhibit  shows the accused leaving the scene of his most recent crime, yes
photo taken by a remote camera planted by one of our agents
White watches in stunned silence
general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is made
Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly
2 Exhibit
1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to  2
2 Actual tape recording of accused committing aforementioned crime, yes
He turns a switch, the reels spin slowly
hush fills the room
1 (sounds like  ) No
Please
scream
2 (sounds like White) Shut up
Another scream
ripping sound
3 (sounds like his ) John
Don't
Another scream
White is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this any longer
(a squeak, almost inaudible) Stop it
This is a lie
Mister Black turns to White
The Men testifying stop the tape and look at him also
Something to say
Ready to confess
The Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the victims and the spectators in the adjoining room
(back to a whisper) didn't kill anyone
Speak up
Yes
(finds his voice) It's lies
Everything
He grips the barrier before him
from the pram containing the   -  it rocks violently from side to side
The   rises from her chair
She has difficulty standing, her limbs stiff
She looks at White, opens her mouth to say something, but no sound comes out
Instead a tiny scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground
She sits down
White is stunned
Bring the witnesses
are led out of the kitchen by a Mystery Man
Shown to seats behind a podium
The woman looks sadly at White
You are the accused's parents
That's right
Yes
Wait a minute
You had your turn
Let them speak
(angry) My parents are supposed to be dead
You can't keep changing the damn rules like this
Why go through this ridiculous set-up
Why don't you just kill me and be done with it
(smiles at parents) Please, continue
This is insane
He looks over to the victims
It was them , not me
(points at the Mystery Men) They killed you
Looks back at the Mystery Men
You have invented all this
History is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  - a fiction
You are the authors
His knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier
fanciful idea, Mister White
Everyone has a job  -  a function
Each one teaches you more about your invention
'm what is called a murderer The whole court listens in silence to White's testimony
You've given everybody memories, but missed out
The Doctor saw to that -  played your own game
And now
looks at the  , then back at
You're trying to get rid of me
There is silence
Whispers
Faces staring
Why do  threaten you
You're scared aren't you
and the gathered   look speechless at White
Suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous , led by Mister Black
terrible cackle fills the room  -  all the   laugh hysterically, so do the mutilated victims
The spectators in the adjoining room remain silent
Ah  -  a plot Now we have a plot
(chuckling) Very inventive
The older couple behind the podium look disturbed
Please, John, you're embarrassing us
Shut up
(chuckling still) You have proof
Evidence
Yes
(holds up notebook) It's all here
Mister Black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's nothing
book of delusions
Anything else
But
see
(turns to the victims) The verdict, yes
Wait, this isn't fair
The   stands again
This time she opens her mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then: (whisper) Guil  -  ty
White is agitated, fear in his face
Mister Black stamps before him repeatedly
-  official-looking documents
The stamp says: on White's eyes
Before  pronounce sentence
Suddenly the papers on the bench in front of Mister Black Mister Black recoils, almost falling off his chair, taken by surprise
The Mystery Men all look at White, a murmur of concern
Mister Black looks up at White  -  angered
How dare you use your tricks on me
White, genuinely surprised, looks around
Several Mystery Men from him, scared
didn't realise
Shut up, freak
Monster
You are insignificant
He glares across the room, angrily
An   in a corner starts to vibrate
on Mister Black's eyes
The chair rises into the air  -   across the room at White
Mister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall
White ducks just in time
The gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause
White regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his own
He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  - a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically
This display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with his mind
Mystery Men are
White is amazed at his own performance
You'll regret that
Mister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his mouth
(shouts) Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials furiously
Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting
Yes, we have a problem here
Shut it down immediately
White doesn't understand what is going on
the  of machinery
a clock hanging on the wall
the
It suddenly
All eyes are on Mister Black
This has all gone too far
Yes, much too far
Mister Black starts to
His eyes shut, clenches his teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to the floor
Around the room  , plaster rains down from the ceiling
: - All over the city things      -  a devastating impact on the landscape
street
Beneath the pavement are pulsating intestine-like organs
These burst open with pus
building vanishes
car on a street corner flies into the air
telephone box   , faster and taster, digging itself into the concrete
Monstrous   sprout from the hole left behind
Geysers of   spurt into the night sky
forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone steps
is coming apart
: ' The room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and gaping holes torn in the walls
Several   huddle behind an upturned table, watching and
They face each other, both still standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle
The fighting is taken its toll on both men
hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face White with its shining silver blade
Mister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony fists by his side
Pushing every ounce of mental power at the knife
White, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind against the knife
The blade   , ever so slowly at first, towards White
His body is shaking with his mental effort
bead of sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his vision
He is losing
- We see an
group of dark figures regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table
From his perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he removes a syringe from White's
Good as new
Yes
Everything is easier now
His vision , he can see
It's
Behind him a who turn out to be
Mister Black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask
Underneath is a mess of
This is what Mystery Men really look like
He laughs, starts to rhythmically  -  a strange dance-step
The others join in, as they too pull off masks
Each Man reaches up to his left ear in unison
They pull squirming  out, hold them up to the light
The insects scream triumphantly
White screams too
And he can't stop
Everything goes
Then the sound of a key rattling in a lock
door slowly creaks open
- enters a small room
Dappled  through a tattered lace curtain
clock ticks on a wall
cough
from the corridor
, talks as he enters: It's small but clean
(it isn't) and the view's nice
(points to window) Isn't it
enters
He is haggard, eyes rimmed with red
He still holds the small black , tight to his chest
He stands in the centre of the room, looks up
Strangely, though the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories  - windows sit at various heights
White walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands
narrow street and at the end, the ocean
The sound of distant surf, he can taste the salt spray
(without turning) 'll take it
The man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go, shutting the door
White puts the notebook down on a table near the open window
White has fallen asleep on the bed
He wakes, troubled
Stands and walks over to the sink next to the bed
He moves like he is underwater
The sea-breeze tugs at the curtain, draws him to the window
Down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings
approach each other
He pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the woman, places it against the pillow on the bed
He sits on the edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs nothing out of the ordinary
White is disturbed by a   in his coat pocket
He reaches in and pulls out a small,
Disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the creature
White raise his foot
His heel comes down with a sickening
towards the notebook near the window
As the   we can read the title on the cover:    -    ,
Now a sudden    blows open the book
The pages flicker past
Glimpses of happy things
child's drawings of smiling people
The sun shining down on a blue ocean full of sailing boats
Fields of colourful flowers
Cute animals
- , distant, muffled
slowly towards a door
The final door  -  no others beyond this
-  His haggard face moves through darkness
He looks down at his walking feet
-  White sees water, waves breaking, through the cracks in the floorboards of the hallway
The cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot, by the  outside
-  As he reaches towards the handle
-  As the door opens
sharp line of light cuts across his features, as his eyes blink and water
The wind pulls at his messy hair
is louder now
-    -   looking through the door, along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape
At the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of She looks out at the ocean, her back turned
at White standing in the open doorway, squints into the sun
Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the first time
He steps    briskly  -  a weight gone from his shoulders
Everything is clear finally, he knows exactly what to do
voice recites names over a
system
follows White, moves down the pier toward the woman
As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles
(indicates the sea) Beautiful
White nods slowly
He looks out of place in his crumpled suit
He stares out at the ocean
Seagulls fly over
Sun reflects off waves
Yes
What's your name
He looks at her
Smiles
Then, slowly, brings his hands to her throat
John
White
