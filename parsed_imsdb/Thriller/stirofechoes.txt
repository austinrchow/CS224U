Written by David Koepp Based on the novel Richard Matheson March 26, 1998 Sometimes within the brain's old ghostly house, hear, far off, at some forgotten door, music and an eerie faint carouse And stir of echoes down the creaking floor
"Chambers of Imagery" Archibald MacLeish In the black, a child
Gentle  sounds
: , a four year old boy, sits in a bathtub
The door to thi bathroom is open and his mother is visible in the background, walking back and forth in the bedroom, getting dressed to go out
The  is blaring in the bedroom, the music echoes off the tile in the tiny bathroom
Jake is playing with a plastic airplane
He answers a question
() Sometimes
() With my toys
He looks up, but we're close in on him and can't see who he's looking at
(cont'd) My
blue sword
No
The one with the gray tape around the middle
That one
He lands the airplane on the water
He giggles
(coast' d) That's silly
(o
s
) (from the bedroom) Jake
You all right in there
(calling out to the door) The airplane takes off again
Jake lowers his voice to a whisper
(cont'd) What
() My daddy, but he doesn't know about it yet
He brings the airplane in for a careful water landing and lets go of it
He looks up
() 2
: (cont' d) Can  ask you a question
He pauses, looks to the door to make sure his mother isn't too close
Moving back now, we see that Jake is all alone in the bathroom, staring at the empty bathtub across from him
(cont'd) Does it hurt to be dead
, the toy airplane sinks and crash lands on the bottom of the tub
, , twenty-six or seven, Jake's mom, city girl knows how to take care of herself, pokes her head in the doorway, buttoning up her blouse
Who you talkin' to, Jake
He turns to her and whispers
It's a secret
: ' , Maggie's age, lean and muscled like somebody who works for a living, lies on Jake's bed next to his son, reading him a story
Jake is nearly asleep
Well,  was walking in the night, and saw nothing scary
For  have never been afraid of anything
Not very was deep within the woods when, suddenly,  spied them
saw a pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them
wasn't scared
But, yet, stopped
What could those pants be there for
What could a pair of pants at night be standing in the air for
Maggie leans in the doorway and whispers
Is he asleep
My brother's here
() 3
: Tom looks at Jake, who is asleep
Tom closes the book, turns off the light, and covers his son
He kisses him on the forehead
Tom goes to a dresser and turns on the baby monitor (the transmitter)
Its red light glows
After Tom leaves, Jake opens his eyes and stares
: The Chicago skyline looms over the street they live on
Not the suburbs, but not quite downtown either
Racially mixed
Two story brick houses jammed side by side, barely room for a raised voice across the narrow driveways
Bar on the corner, neon sign -- "'
"    rants his way down the opposite sidewalk
Tom, Maggie, and , early twenties, come out of the house and head down the steps
Tom carries the baby monitor (the receiver) in one hand
Jake's breathing is clearly audible on the speaker
Tom's on the sidewalk
Maggie, still three steps up, stops and puts her arms wide
Tom turns around and Maggie lets herself go, falling straight forward
Tom catches her on his back and carries her piggy-back
She leans around and bites his ear
What are the odds of a single woman being at this thing
`Bout a million to one
Any hot mommies
Depends
How big you like `em
The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway of the house across the street
It backs into the street, its passenger door hanging open
The  honks the horn and a runs out of another house and jumps into the moving vehicle
They take off
The Homeless Guy berates them, shaking his fist
They reach the steps of the house next door comes from within, shadows move in the windows
Tom swings Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around her, and kisses her
Great kiss
It goes on
() 4
: Excuse me, hello,  enjoy soft-core as much as the next guy, but this is almost like incest for me
(still kissing Tom) Should we tell him
Sure
'm pregnant
Get the fuck outta here
He grabs Maggie and hugs her
Tom starts up the steps
(cont' d) Look at this,  haven't even had a second date in a year and a half, you guys are on your second kid
Philip catches up to Tom and throws his arms around him
(cont' d) You big huggable bear
You're still goin' back to school, though, right
You promised me
don't know,  just found out about this
'm telling you, if you never go back to college you'll regret it for the rest of your life
The memories have of being a freshman -- those were three of the happiest years of my life
: & ' - are crowded into a living room
It's loud, smoky, there's music and a ton of booze -- empty beer bottles, five gallon jugs of wine, big liter bottles of vodka and gin
() 5
: The men are mostly on one side, women on the other
As Maggie heads toward the women, Tom grabs her arm and pulls her back close
Seven years, and 've still never been to a party where you weren't the one wanted to hang with
She smiles, melted, and they part
Tom joins the men
, Vanessa's husband, an athletic-looking guy holding a sleeping three-year-old on his shoulder, talks with  McCARTHY, fortyish, big Irish drinker, and  , who is also older than the rest
Tom-Tom-Tommy, how are ya
He shoves a beer into Tom's hand
Alive on the planet
(nods to Harry) Harry
Hello, Tom
Takin' care of the place
Actually, 'm drillin' holes in all the floors, Harry
(as Tom drinks) That's it, take the medicine deep into your body
Good, good
So how you likin' the neighborhood
Well,  grew up about a mile from here, it ain't like a foreign country
The hell it isn't
This is the best God damn neighborhood in Chicago, `cause we look out for each other, and that's sayin' a lot as we approach the Year of our Lord two thousand
What are you, runnin' for Mayor
() 6
: (2) , the local crank, pipes up
Hey, did any of you guys see those Dominican crack dealers hangin' around the park again
Everybody
(to Bobby) What is Lenny doing here
Did you tell him you were having a party
Vanessa made me
Yeah, laugh it up, laugh it up, and when you all wake up dead with your throats cut some night -- mean,  could see if he just heard the noise and wandered in, but to actually invite him into your home
-- don't come cryin' to me
, Philip surveys the selection of females
He sees , late twenties, hasn't lost the weight from the last baby yet -- Not attracted to
-- , a thin, nervous woman around Frank's age -- (cont' d) Not drunk enough for
-- and a   with enormous hair
(cont' d) Frightened by
, everyone has eaten, some have left, the ones that remain are bombed
dances dirty
Frank stares long and hard at someone's cleavage
() 7
: Sheila, the nervous woman, stares at Frank, pissed off
He looks at her, gives her a "What
" gesture
Must be married to each other
Tom, on the other side of the room, hears a  of women's voice: and turns
He sees Maggie blushing, receiving hugs and congrLtulations from the two or three women around her
:, Vanessa talks to Maggie while she mixes up a blender of Margaritas
The room is jammed with people
How did you and Tom meet
He saved my life
No, really
'm serious
The summer  was nineteen,  was at Jones Beach,  swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg
There was no way  was gonna make it back
was goin' down,  was swallowing water and everything
Tom was a lifeguard
don't know what he was doing out that far, he said he just had a feeling
Oh my God, did you have sex with him like, that night
Had to
He said 'm his slave until saved him back
That's so romantic
Bobby and  met when  peed in the guys' john at a Bon Jovi concert
She hits "puree" on the blender
, the party's down to the hard-core half dozen, who are passing a joint
Tom sits on the couch, feet on the coffee table next to their baby monitor
Maggie is next to him, Frank and Sheila are jammed in there too
() 8
: Bobby and Vanessa sit on the floor opposite
Philip is in a chair at the end
(ople who say they were hypnotized weren't really, they were just, you kn)w, playing along
Then how could they have needles stuck into their throats without bleeding
Without even making a sound
Bullshit
You never saw that happen
Uh, hello,  had a two inch needle stuck right into the thick of my arm, by my professor, while  was under hypnosis
Bullshit
You're making it up
That's disgusting
saw his arm the next day
It left a mark
Bullshit
Can you learn another word
Prove it
Yeah, let's see
Hypnotize somebody
Hypnotize Vanessa
() : (2) Oh, no
Uh uh
Why not
Because,
night make a fool out of myself
n
;
ght,  don't know, expose myself or sowething
She clutches her arms around her breasts as she says that
You get the feeling she'd like to expose herself
thought you didn't believe in it
don't, but -- do Maggie
Yeah, right
You do it, Sheila
We promise not to make you do a strip tease on the kitchen table
Sheila glares at him
They must be fun to hang out with
That's what 'd do
That's exactly the kind of thing 'm afraid 'd do
Hey Frank, you're the one who's so curious, why don't you- No
Ah, that's different
Whaddya got to hide
No fuckin' way,  ain't gonna do it
Tom sits forward
What the hell
'll try anything once
, a hand switches off the lamp on the table
Another hand turns off the lamp in the corner
The music is turned off
Tom sits in the armchair in the n3arly-darkened room
Philip shoves the coffee table back and sits on it, directly in front of him
The others crowd around expectantly, silent
No sound
from anyone, please
Any distraction can break it up
He raises his index finger and holds it about a foot in front of Tom's face
(cont' d) Okay
Look at it
Damn fine lookin' finger
Laughter
() Be quiet
(they do) Look at it
Keep looking at it
Don't look at anything else, just my finger
Can you clean out the nail, it's kinda makin' me sick here
Philip raises two fingers and jabs Tom in the eyes
(cont' d) Hey, what the fuck
Shall we try this again
(rubbing his eyes) Asshole
() 11
: Look at me, Tom
You're not afraid of this
You want this to happen
Don't you
Poke me again you son of a batch and 'll clock you,  swear to Go'
Philip, have you ever done this before
Maggie, please,  nearly have a master's degree in cognitive psy- Have you ever done it before
Well, 've seen it done a dozen times
Try not to screw him up permanently
(to Tom) You want to be hypnotized
Say yes
Yeah
" want to be hypnotized
" want to be fuckin' hypnotized, already
Okay
Close your eyes
As Tom does, our eyes close too, big heavy lashes dropping over everything and plunging us into blackness
(o
s
) Just listen for a moment
12
, we can still hear the sounds of the living room
Tom breathes
Ice  in a glass as someone drinks
car by outside
(o
s
) Now look at the backs of your eyelids
Do you see anything there
(o
s
) Uh
Out of the pitch black, we can detect tiny images
(o
s
) Some colors
something floating
up
(o
s
) Focus on it
small squiggly line comes into focus, drifting up through the black, then bouncing suddenly downward
(o
s
) Now
want you to pretend you're in a theatre
We're sitting in a theatre, a bare stage at the front
(o
s
) movie theatre
Okay, we're sitting in a movie theatre
It's crowded with people, waiting for the movie to start
(o
s
) You're the only one there
The people disappear
The theatre is empty
(o
s
) You're sitting near the front
We pop up ten rows closer to the screen
() 13
: (o
s
) The walls of the theatre are black, covered with black velvet
Black velvet descends over the walls
(o
s
) The seats are covered with black velvet
Black velvet crawls over the seats
(o
s
) There is no light in the theatre
The lights click off
(o
s
) In the whole pitch-black theatre, there's only one thing you can see
The white screen
You drift toward it, in your chair
Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white
We move slowly toward it, floating over the seats
(o
s
) There are letters up on the screen
Tall, thick, black letters, but they're out of focus
You drift closer to them, trying to read them
Blurry black letters appear on the screen
We drift closer
(o
s
) You're comfortable in your black velvet seat, very comfortable
You just sit there, looking at the screen, drifting closer in your chair, staring at those letters on the screen
You're relaxing
Your feet and ankles are relaxed
Your legs are relaxed
Your hands are limp and heavy
Your arms are relaxed
Your face
The letters come into focus, you're close enough now, you can read them
The letters are right in front of us now, but still blurry
(o
s
) The letters spell -- () 14
: (2) The moment he speaks the word, five giant black letters come into focus on the white screen, filling our entire field of vision
(o
s
) We stare at that word for a moment -- -- and then everything goes black
No sound, no image, no nothing
And then
& ' Six faces stare right at us from up close
Tom is in the chair, eyes open, looking disoriented
Didn't work, huh
All six faces burst out laughing, a great nervous tension released
Somebody turns the lights back on, somebody else hits the music
(cont' d) What
More laughter
Philip seems very pleased with himself
Maggie comes and sits on the arm of the chair next to Tom, puts her hand on his face
Are you okay
Did somethin' happen
People start talking, all at once
You were faking it
You had to be faking it
What are you talking about
That was the weirdest thing 've ever seen in my whole fuckin' life
How do you feel
() 15
: How am  supposed to feel
little
, hot, maybe
EveryboJy laughs again
Tom wipes his forehead
He's covered with sweat
He gets up
He doesn't like this at all, being the only one not in on the joke
What'd you do to me
Nothing much
Just had you stretched out as stiff as a board between those two chairs -- He points to two dining room chairs that are sitting back to back four or five feet apart
(cont' d) (lighting a lighter) -- and ran this back and forth under your legs
Tom feels the backs of his legs
He looks at Maggie
That happened
You said it didn't hurt at all
And he kept it moving
Hey, thanks a lot, it was very nice of you not to burn my flesh
Joey Ariola woulda burned it
They laugh again
Tom looks at him, stunned
Who
The kid who beat you up all the time when you were twelve
You told us all about him
You were cryin' and everything
() 16
: (2) Tom seethes, humiliated
Vanessa looks at her watch
(low, to Vanessa) Don't
Not time yet
What
() Huh
Not time for what
Tom, you didn't do anything embarrassing or anything
Aright, somebody else go
Come on, let's go, somebody else, right now
Tom, look -- Nobody
Well, then  guess the party's over, ain't it
(to Maggie) Let's go
Come on, let's go home
You're getting a little too worked up about this
You know,  don't think so, because 'll tell you something, it's a very nasty feeling to know somebody's been fuckin' around in your head for everybody else's amusement, you know
(lightening up a bit) mean, Joey Ariola, Christ,  haven't thought about him in maybe ten years, and -- come on, man, somebody else has gotta go
Don't make me be the only- () 17
: (3) On the mantle over the fireplace, a clock
Everyone is immediately silent, staring at Tom
He looks at the clock
It's eleven
He lifts his foot, pulls off his shoe -- -- and throws it out the window
There is an explosion of laughter
Why'd you do that, Tom
have no idea
Even more laughter, now everybody's slapping him on the back
Tom nods, "yeah, yeah, laugh it up
" couldn't resist
Tom cranks an arm around Philip's neck and pulls him down, choking him
But it's playful, his sense of humor returning
Any other surprises you left in my head, you fuckin' dead man, you
: & ' It's dark
Tom and Maggie lie in bed, awake
hope it's a girl,  can't help it
Six brothers,  mean, give me a break
'm sick of all these balls around the house
He doesn't laugh
She rolls over, strokes his chest with one hand
(cont' d) What's the matter
Two kids
'm only twenty-six
How did this happen
She slides one hand down, under the covers
() 18
: (imitating him) "Please, baby, please baby, just this one time,  can't feel anything with one of those on
" No,  now how it happened, 'm just sayin'
You're gonna have to stop work, at least for a while
'll be workin' Saturdays for at least another year, maybe two
You don't have to
We'll get by, we always do
Tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling
How many times  gotta ask Harry to fix that
He said he fixed this place up, so how come the roof leaks every time it rains
Relax
Her hand is moving
He twists
Maggie, you don't think,  mean, ten, twelve years from now
don't want you to think 'm gonna be a line man forever, you know, like Frank or somethin'
It's a good job
You know how many guys would kill for your job
'm smarter than that,  know  am
(kisses his ear) Relax
She's making it hard for him to concentrate
() 19
: (2) 'm smarter than Philip, Christ, six years in college, he's still got his head up his ass
just want you to know, this ain't where  plan to stop
She licks his ear
He closes his eyes
(cont' d) All my life,  feel like there's something better inside me, it's trying like hell to get out and it's like x won't let it
She rolls on top of him and whispers
Let me help
, the clock reads 2:31 a
m
Maggie is asleep, Tom is lying on his back, still awake
He looks over at the clock, agitated
He stares up at the ceiling
He closes his eyes
races across the back of his eyelids: -- Philip's face, close to his, a finger held in front of him
--  flame, leaping out from a cigarette lighter
Six more faces, pressed in close to his
Himself, floating in an armchair above an empty movie theatre
, Tom snaps his eyes open
He rolls over onto his side, punching his pillow
He closes his eyes again
, faster this time
We share his point of view: --  twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a dumpster
--  fourteen year old girl kisses us behind a brick building
() 20
: --  vicious dog sinks its teeth into our calf
-- Maggie, drowning, reaches out to us
The images Increase in speed, a half a dozen flip by so fast they're almcst subliminal -- a car tire, a broken arm, falling into water, breaking window, ham and eggs, a bolt of lightning
, Tom sits up abruptly, shaking his head to clear it
the fuck, man
He puts his hands to the side of his head
It hurts
lot
Maggie stirs, but doesn't wake up
Tom gets up and walks out
As he passes Jake's room, he does a double take
' , the four year old is awake
Not just awake, but standing next to his bed, perfectly straight, staring at the open doorway
Tom steps in
He can see by the light of the nightlight
() Jake
The little boy doesn't answer
Tom walks slowly over to the boy and squats down in front of him, putting his arms on the boy's shoulders
(cont' d) Are you okay
Jake just looks at Tom, straight into his father's eyes
The boy's face lights up in a wide smile
He reaches out with one hand and rests his fingertips on Tom's forehead
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy
The hell does that mean
But before Tom can respond, Jake turns, climbs back in bed, rolls over to face the wall, and goes back to sleep
Tom shakes some Advil into his palm; washes three down with a glass of water
He runs water in the sink, splashes some on his face
He straigltens, looks in the mirror as he wipes his dripping face
He stares at himself for a moment, then summons his nerve and closes his eyes
, more images come
-- The front of Tom's own house, from a distance stands on the porch, waving to us to come in
-- Rough hands attack us, covering our eyes and face
--  face, close to ours but blurry and distorted, as if seen through dirty, blue-tinted eyeglasses
-- Wooden floorboards as we race down toward them
We hit, hard, and our blood sprays out onto the wood
, Tom's eyes pop open
That was disturbing
Tom strides into the living room
Their house is small, crowded with kids' toys and furniture they got for their wedding
Tom paces back and forth, holding his head in his hands
He turns and bolts into the kitchen
, Tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf
He finds what he's looking for, a large carton of orange juice
He opens a cabinet, takes out a glass and fills it
He upends the glass, drains it in one gulp
Still unsatisfied, he picks up the carton
He drinks the rest
Juice runs down his chin
, Tom drops onto the sofa
He sits for a moment, trying to regain himself
His breathing returns to normal
He sits forward, picks up the remote off the coffee table, points it at the  and turns it on
When he sits back -- -- there's a woman sitting next to him
() 22
: She's eighteen or nineteen years old, so pale her skin's almost luminous
She's attractive but odd, she wears a billowy black dress with a diamond pattern, bangles up and down each wrist
Her lips are light blue, her eyes red- rimmed
Steam rises softly from her hair and skin; when she speaks, her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of vapor
You can kiss me if you want to
Tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch
The woman stares intently at him and says something else, but her words are lost under the rising sound of static on the television
What
She repeats, but he can only see her lips moving, the words are lost under the static
Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly toward the  and hits the mute switch
When he turns back -- -- the woman is gone
He stands in the middle of the room, looking all around him
But he's alone
Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight around him
He's shivering
drops over him and he nearly jumps out of his skin
It's Maggie, rolling over to embrace him in her sleep
He takes her hand in his and lies still, eyes wide open
: Morning
Tom and Maggie sit at the kitchen table
From the living room, we can hear a-kids' morning show on the television
Tom is wearing jeans and a phone company uniform shirt
Maggie is staring at him
They keep their voices low
What do you mean, like
You mean like a hallucination
Maybe
was awake,  know that
She nods, thinking, no idea how to deal with this
() 23
: Did you, uh, get her name
You know, she didn't menti
-in it
You sure you weren't dreami
g
Positive
had this headache like you wouldn't believe, and  was thirsty as hell
What should we do
You want to call Philip
Yeah, 'll call him
But  don't think he's got a fuckin' clue in life
From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously at something on the
How about my cousin Elizabeth
don't need brain surgery,  just had a weird thing happen, that's all
Like a hypnosis hangover
One-time deal, don't worry about it
Well, if anything like this happens again, we should go talk to Elizabeth
Maggie
Promise me
promise
: There's a pickup football game in the street, a half a dozen sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their plays to coincide with the red lights
Tom gets into a pickup truck with a phone compaty logo on the door, starts it up, and pulls forward to the neat house
He hits the horn
While he waits, he turns and loo--s back up at the front of his own house
one of the images that blasted through his mind last night
It's his own house, on a wintry day
man in an overcoat is standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way -- "'mon in
" But the image is silent, slow and eerie
We move slowly toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat
, Tom turns slowly away from his house, just as off his windshield, nearly breaking it hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal Tom jumps a foot
He gets out of the car
McCARTHY, seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed
Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of me
The kid with Adam doesn't seem embarrassed, he just reaches for the football
Tom beats him to it
(cont' d) You gotta play right here in the middle of the street
Frank is out of his house now, approaching the truck
He wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over his shoulder
Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your own grandfather
() 25
: (looking at his hood) Aw man, it's dented
This ain't even my truck
They're gonna dock me for this
That'll pop right out
Use one of them plunger things
Adam, say you're sorry
'm really sorry, Mr
Witzky
There you go, he said he's sorry, whaddya want from a kid
Let's go
Frank gets in the truck
The other football players walk toward Tom, calling for the ball
, a great-looking seventeen year old, stares pointedly at the ball in Tom's hand
Tom looks at him
Hell of an arm ya got there
Kurt smiles and shrugs
Tom tosses the ball back to him
Kurt turns and catches it behind his back as he walks away
, Tom gets back in and closes the door
That Damon kid, he's gonna break your old passing records this Friday
Bound to happen some time
Comin' to the game
(starts the car) Yeah, 'm comin', 'm comin' (o
s
) Hey, Tom
Tom turns
Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is headed toward him
But Tom notices something behind Harry police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop
() 26
: The   behind the wheel is staring out the window, looking right at Tom
Harry comes up to the open window and starts talking, but Tom is looking past him, at the Cop, who has stopped now
(cont' d) Thought 'd stop by and pick up the rent
Save you the trip across the street
It's still two days yet, isn't it
Tom looks more closely at the Cop
He realizes the Cop isn't looking at him, he's looking past him, toward Tom's house
Yeah, just thought you'd want to get it out of your hair
() Well, my checkbook's inside
can wait
Hey, Frank, some game we picked to miss last night, huh
How many yards Adam end up with
Tom turns in his seat, following the Cop's line of vision
Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns
Harry lets out a low whistle
Tom sees what the Cop is looking at so intently -- it's Jake, who's playing on the sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches
Tom turns back, but as he does the police car is just pulling away
: The signal division of the local phone company has a large main floor
twenty-foot wall on one side of the room shows a forest of jagged, blinking lines
, Tom is wedged between giant walls of circuit boards
He pulls a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a line at random
() 27
: He pulls up the test handset unit that hangs from'his belt and listens, hoping from a dial tone
Instead, he cuts in on a '
(o
s
) (on phone line) -which was okay,  guess, but then he told me he loves me, and it was just like, oh my God, can you please make yourself any less attractive
Tom pulls off the clip and picks another line
Now it's a '
(o
s
) -unless they find out we already locked in with Cooper at eighty, so it's imperative we lead them to believe we're honestly trying to-, Tom clips to another line
It's a  '
(o
s
) -start at my lips and lick your way all the way down to my- Tom starts to unclip, then hesitates, only human
The voice abruptly changes
(coast' d) Hey, did somebody pick up on your end
Is your wife there
Tom unclips and picks another line
He gets a dial tone
He enters a number on his headset
answers
Phil, it's Tom
Is there anything else important you said to me last night, while  was under
' Philip (Maggie'a brother) is still in bed in his apartment
It's a smallish place, one wall is all windows with a lovely view of a factory, its stacks belching black smoke into the air
Philip's hung over
He holds the phone like he resents it
What time is it
() 28
: (o
a
) Quarter after eight
What are you, still in bed
Quarter after eight
Jesus, Tom, this is barbaric
() Other than the shoe thing, what else did you say to me
Hang on, lemme,  gotta get my bearings here
Who is this again
Phil,  gotta get back to work, was there anything else you told me to do after  came out of it
If you're asking if  gave you a post- - Post-hypnotic suggestion,  know what it's called, Phil
Did you leave any others behind when you were kickin' your big, clumsy-ass feet around inside my brain
No
Tell me the truth, Phil
No,  swear
went out of my way not to,  even added a thing at the end to make sure
What thing
,  didn't want you to retain any of the experience, you know,  wanted you to have control back, so  made up this thing
() 29
: (2) What thing
God,  don't remember,  haven't had caffeine in almost eighteen hours, how am  supposed to- In general, what was it
Well, it was perfectly harmless, just said, uh,  said "When you come out from under, your mind will be completely free
There's nothing binding it
Nothing holding it back
You will be completely open
" Tom stops, thinking for a long moment
Yeah, 'd say that about describes it
Describes what
Never mind, it's gone now
gotta go
Describes what
But Tom has hung up
Philip unplugs the phone and goes back to sleep
: Jake sits at the kitchen table in his pajamas, eating a bowl of cereal
Maggie, in work clothes, is walking back and forth behind him, talking on the phone, finishing her makeup, drinking coffee, and doing the dishes
(o
s
) Hi, Adriana, it's Maggie
Listen, our baby-sitter just backed out on us for next Friday night -- Jake turns and looks at the empty chair next to him
He smiles at it
Then he giggles
He covers his mouth
() - - 30
: (cont' d) -- and there's this game Tom and really wanted to go to and  was wondering if
(to the chair) told him
(o
s
) (into phone) Oh
Yeah,  understand
No, no, no, don't worry about it
Okay
Bye
(hangs up) Shit
Shoot
Shoot,  mean
She picks up the phone and dials again
With all she's doing, she doesn't notice that Jake is having a conversation with the empty chair
(cont' d) (into phone) Philip, hi, it's me, call me when you wake up, is there any way -- Yes
-- you'd consider dumping whatever bimbo you're going out with Friday night and baby-sitting for us instead
Who
'd call mom, but it's a long drive for her and she's not feeling very well again, so
call me as soon as you can, and no, 'm not kidding
(hangs up) Okay
Well, that'll happen in about a million years
() 31
: (2) (to Maggie) Call Vanessa and ask her about Dorothy
i'aggie stops, looking at him
Jake is calmly eating his ca
real
She looks at her watch
Good idea
She picks up the phone and dials a number
Jake just keeps eating
Behind him: (cont' d) Hi, Vanessa, it's Maggie
What's your baby-sitter's name again, Dorothy
Are you gonna use her Friday night
Really
Would you mind if  asked her to sit for us, just this once
Oh, great, thank you so much, you saved my life
What's her number
Uh huh, uh huh
Great, thanks again
Okay
She hangs up and finishes her make-up in her reflection in the toaster
(cont' d) When did you ever meet Dorothy, Jake
Samantha told me
(didn't hear that) Oh,  bet you saw her when you were over playing with Jessica the other day, right
She was there then
Jake turns to the empty chair on his left
He looks at it for a moment, then turns back to Maggie
Yes
That's when  met her
He goes back to eating his cereal

Muller
Tom Witzky She shakes his hand limply and steps inside, just to the side of the door, looking down
Tom stares at her, longer than is Maggie comes forward with the baby monitor and takes ove r, leading Dorothy into the room
Hi, Dorothy, thanks for coming, remem ber me
'm Maggie, we met over at Vanessa's once or twice
Okay, Jake's asleep already and he hardly ever wakes up, a band could play in his room and he wouldn 't hear it, so Shouldn't have any trouble with him a t all
His room is right up at the top of the
As she goes on, showing Dorothy aroundexplaining where they'll be se and where he is, staring
and so forththe , Tom stands rooted At Doroth ya  strange  sound grows in his ears
He just watchest , h leads back into the living w room, showing nhers remotes work , that thesTV the sort of thing
sneaks a look up at Tom, then g
Feeling his stare, Dorothy staring down quickly averts her gaze again, at the carpet, Th e buzzing fades
dj , no later ti12nGmidnioht' q if that s okay with you
It's okay
Great
Let me just grab my coat we' re out of here
and () 33
: She runs upstairs
Tom is still standing where he was
Dorothy sits on the sofa, hands in the pockets of her jacket, which is still zi pped up to the neck
'Whir don't you, uh
why don't you mak%- yourself comfortable
Take off your coat
Without looking at him, Dorothy obediently unzips her jacket and takes it off
Her b reasts are fuller than one would expect at her age
She l ooks up at Tom, and now there's defiance in her eyes
Wh at are you lookin' at
(cont' d) Excuse me
He goes upstairs
In the bathroom, Tom drinks a glass of water quickly, then shakes three or four Advil in to his palm
In the mirror, he notices Maggie, staring at him from the doorway
Where did you find Dorothy
Vanessa recommended her
She's used her before, she said she's real reliable
Tom nods
(cont' d) Are you
She's looking at the Advil
He smiles, faking it
Too much caffeine, that's all
He pops them in his mouth and swallows them dry
(cont'd) Let's qo, Tom and Maggie step back into the living room and head for the front door
The mom ent Tom lays eyes on Dorothy, the sound returns, loude r this time
() 34
: It drowns out Maggie's voice as she gives Dorothy last minute instructions and says goodbye
Tom reaches the open doorway and glances back inside
Dorothy is looking at him as he swings the door shut
NIf : The buzzing stops the momen% the door is shut
Tom and Maggie go down the steps
Tom lookz back over his shoulder, at the house, in time to see Dorothy's face, peering out between the blinds at them
She releases the blinds and they snap back into place
: Tom and Maggie walk down a crowded sidewalk with Frank and Sheila, from next door
(to Tom) Don't get me wrong, it's great what the Damon kid is doin' and everything, mean, 'm sorry your record's gettin' broke, but, what, it held up almost ten years
Tom is terribly distracted, looking back over his shoulder, still plagued with a headache
Yeah, `bout that
They round a corner
Just ahead, a high school football field is surrounded by bright lights, mobbed with  and plays on the field, it's just about time for kickoff
(raising his voice over the ) So you got that, that's great
What 'm sayin', though, is this year it's all Kurt Damon this and Kurt Damon that, and yeah, the kid has an arm, but high school football is running the ball -- smash-mouth, in-your-face, power football
Always been that way
Tom glances up at a mercury-vapor streetlight as they pass under it
() 35
: The same  sound, the one he heard when he first looked at Dorothy, comes back now, seeming to come from the street light
Tom shakes it off
(cost' d) Now Adam, and  admit,  am biased, but my kid is having ona hell of a season and it's like nol
-)dy noticed
If they'd just give him he carries he could break a thousand yards
And on an eight game schedule
He pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump, offers one to Tom, who declines
walks past
Frank notices
Carefully
, Sheila and Maggie walk together
Sheila stares at Frank as he ogles the teenager
Look at him
Why doesn't he just lick them when they walk by
() According to Tom, the average guy carries around a hard-on two and a half hours out of every day
What are you gonna do
() 've got a few ideas
-  walks past and Frank gives her the big crank-around
(cont' d) Look at that
He's not even picky swear to God, that man will stick it in a bowl of soup if it's still warm
Maggie notices Tom, up ahead, with a hand to his temple
She catches up
Are you okay
He forces a smile
They head into a crowded tunnel that leads into the stadium
36
, Frank raises his voice still higher
It becomes a horrible drone to Tom
Six eighty-three with three game
- left, he only needs to average, ti
iat, a hundred and five, hundred and six yards a game
He hits a thousand and we're talkin' major scholarships, the kid could write his own ticket
That kinda thing's good for everybody, helps the whole neighborhood
He's goin' a hell of a lot farther than ever did
Look at the quality of the tail he's already gettin'
He passed me in that department when he was about fourteen
He passes Tom the bottle
This time, he takes a swig
They come through the tunnel and into the stands
Below, the field is brightly lit
Frank's voice is, thankfully, drowned out by the enthusiasm of the crowd
They make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers and sit down
The crowd is delirious with anticipation, and a bit loaded -- there's a lot of schnapps in that crowd, and beers snuck in here and there
And that's the grown-ups
, the visitors kick off
, the crowd
Tom tries to concentrate on the game, but he's totally distracted
He looks to the right, drawn by a flash of light
car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the field with its high beams on
Tom stares at the lights
The sound comes back, louder the longer he stares
The crowd  its approval of something
Tom turns back, tries to follow the game
He wipes sweat from his forehead
Maggie is staring at him
She takes his hand and leans over, into his ear
() 37
: '
As Tom turns to her, his eye is drawn by something just over her head
towers over them
When Tom s\ares directly into the dozen large globes, the  souni overwhelms him, nearly deafening
His hands shoot up to his ears -- -- and he leaps to his feet
Sf"
Tom fights his way out of the row, climbing right over people
They  their objections
Tom races down the now-empty tunnel
light shines at the far end,  madly
few seconds later, Maggie starts into the tunnel
Tom, wait
Tom bursts out onto the busy sidewalk, threading his way between  and cars as fast as he can
Maggie follows a few moments later
Tom races around the corner and onto his block
He bolts across the street, forcing a car to lock `em up at the last second
The Driver : Tom keeps running
He reaches the sidewalk just in front of his house and stops in his tracks, staring at the house, wild-eyed
All the lights are off
Oh, no
He bounds up the steps and tries the door
It's locked
He fumbles in his pockets for the keys
Tom unlocks the door and bursts inside
Jake
No answer
He races up the stairs
' Tom  open the door to Jake's room and flicks on the lights
In Jake's bed, the covers are pulled back, the sheets are rumpled
But Jake Js gone
Tom races out
Still staring at that empty bed, we can hear other doors in the house being thrown open, lights being switched on, and Tom's outraged voice calling out for his son
Maggie comes hurrying up the steps of the porch just as the front door flies open
What the hell is the- She took him
What
, '  , Oh, my God
She bounds up the steps, calling out for Jake
She can't be that far
He runs to the corner, desperate, and looks up and down the street in both directions
There are a lot of people out, she could be anywhere
39
: He turns, looks up and down the side street
Nothing in the first direction, but when he looks the other way, he hears a faint  sound in the distance
He doesn't hesitate, just takes off toward it
, Tom is running as hard as he can
He stops, abruptly
The buzzing sound is gone
He looks to his right
Behind a wall, there is a large parking lot filled with buses
He turns around
dull white glow comes from the windows of the place on the corner
He looks up, at the sign
It's a Greyhound bus station
Tom hurries back toward it, reaching the door just as Maggie comes running up from the opposite direction
Wait right here, keep your eyes open
He opens the door and goes inside
Tom steps into the station, still breathing hard
The sound returns
But from where
Is it in his mind this time, or really here, in the bus station
The place is empty except for one person, sitting on a wooden bench with their back to him, near the departure doors
Tom walks slowly across the place to the figure
It's Dorothy
As he draws closer, he sees Jake's face, over Dorothy's shoulder
Jake's eyes are open, and he's staring up at the ceiling
Tom follows his son's gaze
Jake is staring up at the lights, the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its cancerous look
The tubes  loudly
It's the sound Tom's been hearing
Jake sees his father and smiles
Tom puts a finger to his lips -- "Shhhh
" Jake yawns, closes his eyes, and drops his head onto Dorothy's shoulder
He goes back to sleep
Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench
Dorothy is softly, an old nursery rhyme
She looks up suddenly and sees Tom
She starts to jerk to her feet
Tom puts a hand out -- take it easy
Dorothy sits back, caught
Tom steps closer to her, carefully
He holds both his hands out, palms up
() 40
: Give him to me
She shakes her head no
Outside, a   and a police car flashes past the window, its red lights spinning
They both hear it and glance over, then look back at each other
Tom raises an eyebrow
She knows what he means
(cont'd) Give him to me, Dorothy
Trembling, Dorothy reaches out, Jake in her arms
Tom gently takes the boy from her and holds him tight
The front door flies open and Maggie races inside
Tom gives Jake over to her
(half asleep) Oh, hi, Mommy
She's relieved, but livid
(to Dorothy) What the hell is the matter with you
Dorothy jumps to her feet and races through the door that leads to the back, where the buses leave from
(to Maggie) Take him home
'll be there as soon as  can
He runs after Dorothy
Dorothy races out of the bus station and into the forest of parked buses
Tom comes out a few seconds later, giving chase
Dorothy cuts between two parked buses -- -- and is nearly hit by a third that's just arriving
Its horn  as she trips and falls to the ground, the bus just missing as it  past her
Tom reaches her
Dorothy writhes on the ground, sobbing, raking her hands through the gravel, hysterical
() : Sit up
Sit up,  want to talk to you
She manages to drag herself into a sitting position
She shoves back, against the wheel of a bus
Beyond them, the bus that nearly hit her stops on the far side of the lot
Dorothy is quivering, still crying
Tom squats in front of her, a few feet away
(cant' d) Why were you taking my son
Go away
Do you want me to call the police
(shakes her head no) Then tell me why you took him
He isn't safe in your house
Why do you say that
He told me
He told me so
The  of the bus that nearly hit her is out of his bus now
He  at them from the other side of the lot
Jake said that
(she nods) What else did he say
Nothing
was sitting there,  was watching him sleep,  was just watching him, like 'm supposed to, and
and he sat up in bed, he looked right at me, and he said "'m not safe in this house
" Two times, he said it, and then he went back to sleep
Where were you taking him
() 42
: (2) California
To my father's house
My real father, not -- (like poison on her tongue) -- Duane
Jake would be safe at my father's house, we'd both be safe there
You too
(she nods) Why aren't you safe here
She doesn't answer
The Driver is coming over to them, still (cont' d) Dorothy
Dorothy, why aren't you safe here
The Driver is still closer
Frightened, Dorothy gets up, to run again
Tom grabs her
(coat' d) Hey, wait a sec- As his hands close around her arms -- flashes through his mind
' , sweaty and unshaven, leers over us, too close
, Tom abruptly pulls back from Dorothy
He is enraged
Who is he
She just looks at him, frightened
He shakes her, violently
(cont' d) : ' , fortyish, slouches on a sofa, watching Moe hit Curly with a rake
Duane's drinking bourbon
In his defense, he is using a glass
Duane's face is the one Tom just saw in the image in his mind
() d16 - - i12 ---
- - A86i - 43
: Duane hears the front door open and close
You're early
Your mom's still at work
Hey, do you know if she bought any more who the fuck are you
Tom is storming across the room toward him
(cant' d) Hey hey hey hey
Tom already has Duane by the collar
He wrenches him to his feet
(cont' d) ' '
Are you Duane
Who
don't even know who you're- Duane looks over Tom's shoulder
Dorothy is standing in the doorway, frightened
(cont' d) Dorothy, who the fuck is this guy
Tom hurls Duane across the coffee table, knocking over Duane's bong
Duane hits the floor hard
He starts fumbling in his pocket, but Tom is on him, ripping him to his feet again
She's a little girl, you son of a bitch
She' s fifteen years old, and you fucked her
What the hell is the matter with you
' ' Look, man,  don't know who you are or what she told you, but- Tom hurls Duane across the room
He  into a bookcase, breaking the glass shelves and knocking a bunch of pictures and knickknacks to the ground
Duane , tries to roll away to escape Tom, but Tom picks him up by the back of his collar and his belt, like a dog
() 44
: (2) He hurls Duane toward the stairs
Duane  down hard
Before he can get up, Tom hauls him to his feet and hurls him furthe: up
He's kicking Duane's ass up the stairs
At the +,)ttom, Dorothy watches, her hands over her mouth
She's thrilled
, Duane lands, a few feet ahead of Tom
This time he's got a second or two, and he manages to dig the butterfly knife he was groping for out of his pocket
He whips it around, opening it, but Tom is fast and crazy with rage, he just grabs the thing by the blade and rips it away from Duane
Blood flows over Tom's knuckles as he tightens his grip on the knife
He twists it around, holding it by the butt
There's madness in Tom's eyes
(wielding the knife) You got ten minutes
Pack your shit
You don't leave a note, you don't try to call, and if you ever, ever come back here again, 'll know, 'll find you, and 'll stick this so far into you they'll never get it out
You got it
Duane nods, terrified
, Dorothy sits on her hands at the edge of the sofa, waiting nervously
Tom comes down the stairs
He folds the knife, uncertainly, never handled one of these things before
He shoves it in his pocket
'll stay until he's gone
Upstairs, dresser drawers , Duane
He's packing
(cont' d) Shouldn't be long
You're bleeding
() 45
: She hurries into the kitchen
Tom looks around, at the mess he's made
He's embarrassed, frightened by his own rage
Dorothy comes back with a dish towel
She takes Tom's hand, wipes the blood away and wraps the towel around it
(cont' d) Than : you
He starts to pick up the things that were knocked off the bookcase
Tell your mother 'll pay for this
It's okay
He picks up a framed photograph
Broken glass falls out of the frame as he turns it over
Tom freezes
(cont'd) What's the matter
Tom just stares at the picture
(cont' d) What
Tom turns the picture around to show Dorothy
The woman in the picture is about eighteen or nineteen, bears a faint resemblance to Dorothy -- -- and is the same woman he saw in his living room
(coast' d) Yeah
Who is this woman
My sister
Did she have a black dress, kind of a diamond pattern on it
Yeah
46
: (2) She wore a lot of bracelets, those thick ones, different colors, all up and down her arms
Yeah, all t2;+ time, she probably still does
How d
, you know that
Upstairs, there is a tremendous  as a closet door closes and Duane
(o
s
) Where is she
don't know
Can  talk to her
No
Why not
She ran away
About six months ago
Where did she go
don't know
She don't write or nothin'
Tom looks down at the photograph again
What's your sister's name, Dorothy
Samantha
: i ' The red light glows on the baby monitor, and Jake's breathing can be heard from in his bedroom
Tom and Maggie sit on the couch in their living room, the nonitor beside them, just one light on
He has his arms arounc' her, holding her tight
His hand is bandaged
They're shaker
Samantha
That's what she said
Where have  heard that name before
Dorothy said she ran away about six months ago
But she could still be around
Hiding or something
mean, she could have actually been here when you saw her
If she was, she's very quick getting in and out of a room
Where was she
When you saw her, where was she exactly
On the cushion right next to you
Maggie looks down at the empty half of the couch, freaked out
She pulls in closer to him
What was it like
At the game, mean, how did you know about Jake
Did you see anything
It's hard to explain
just got this -- feeling
Like when  was drowning
() 48
: little bit
But a hundred times stronger
Does it hurt when it happens
Like you wouldn't believe
Fecls like my brain is tearing in half
God, Tommy, what's the matter with you
Why do you assume it's bad
Maybe this is a good thing
If your brain is tearing in half
told you there was somethin' in me
Maybe it's comin' out
like it better in
Just roll with it
What's the worst that can happen
You'll go insane
Kill yourself
Kill me and Jake first
Well, yeah, that
want you to go see my cousin Elizabeth
Make sure there's nothing wrong
Just tell her about the headaches, that's all she needs to know, you don't have to bring up the other stuff
Suddenly, he smiles
() 49
: (2) Hey, know what
(she looks at him) It is a girl
She furrows her brow, "how do you know
", then follows his gaze down to her belly, where his hand is resting
: Tom, dressed in a patient's gown, walks down a hospital corridor with
, fortyish
Elizabeth makes notes on a clipboard, walking and talking fast, all business
Elizabeth does not have the human touch
Do you have any metal plates in your skull
Any shrapnel lodged anywhere in your body
No
No cardiac pacemaker,  assume -- iron filings near your eyes
Huh
You don't work with sheet metal, do you
No
Left here
() 50
: They turn down another corridor
(cont' d) Do you have an inner ear transplant
No
Aneurism clips in your brain
No thanks
Do you suffer from claustrophobia
Only in, like, really small spaces
(she looks at him, straight ) You have a great sense of humor
Right, then jog left
They do
Do we really gotta do this
You've had no head trauma, no serious viral infections you can recall, you haven't been out of the country, you're not a drug user, you have no history of migraines
suppose could open up your skull in the operating room and then decide what to do, but 'd rather take a few pictures first, wouldn't you
She pushes through a set of double doors
The  machine is a long tunnel with a body slab sticking out obscenely, like a tongue
stand on either side of it
One wall of the room is glass, behind the glass are the -- and Maggie, who waves supportively
Tom swallows
() 51
: How's it work
Elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some commands
It creates an electromagnetic field thirty thousand times stronger than the earth's
That stimulates your brain's protons to align themselves
Then we shoot radio waves into you, which knocks the protons out of alignment
They then realign themselves, sending out radio signals we record on the scanner
The computer reads the signals and makes a series of detailed cross-sections of the layers of tissue
Tom looks at the machine, then back at her
Can  have another Valium
, Tom lies down on the "tongue
" The Nurses wrap sheets around his arms and tuck them in under his body, immobilizing them
He looks at one of them questioningly
So your arms don't touch the sides of the machine
That would be bad
She smiles and nods
The other Nurse puts a white cloth over his hair
2 Your party hat
He tries to smile, but he is unnerved
Elizabeth leans in, staring down at Tom
It's so nice you and Maggie finally came to see me at work
, a Technician hits a series of switches
, the tongue starts to move, sliding into the tunnel
Tom lies still, staring upward as he is pulled inside, like a corpse in a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue
, it's only about two feet across, and less from top to bottom
Tom blinks, staring up at the ceiling as the tongue comes to a stop
It's incredibly claustrophobic
Kinda hot in the coffin
'  comes blaring out of speakers mounted on either side of the tunnel
,     , Yo, hey, hey, woah, 'm right here
Can you turn it down a little bit
, '
' , Elizabeth leans back from a microphone and turns to a Technician
Go ahead
The Technician enters some commands on a keyboard
, the giant "hammers" that are contained in the cylinders that surround the tunnel start to move, slowly at first
, Elizabeth turns to Maggie
() 53
: Did he bring any music
Yeah, right here
She hands him a cassette
Elizabeth puts it into a tape deck and pushes "play
" , the hammers pick up speed, and these things move
It gets noisy fast
, Tom's eyes widen
The hammers whip faster
Their  is tremendous
Tom's music starts playing from the speakers
It's The Doors, "People Are Strange
" The hammers whip faster
Elizabeth was right, it's good the music is loud, because the sound coming from the hammers is deafening, like gunshots going off all around his head
' Tom, in spite of himself, bursts out laughing
, they can hear the thundering hammers, the blaring music, and above it all, Tom's crazy kind of laughter
Elizabeth looks at Maggie
: Three electronic screens, two red and one whitish-blue, display various cross-sections of Tom's brain
Graphs and columns of numbers are listed alongside
No tumors, no growths, no scars or lesions, no intrusions or damaged tissue of any kind
Except for one tiny abnormality, your brain anatomy is textbook
Physically, anyway
() 54
: What abnormality
Well, it's so insignificant it's hardly worth mentioning
She leans forward to one of the screens and points to a spot on a cross-section
(cont' d) It's the parietal lobe
Here
There's a slight distension, just the tiniest bulge here in the arc of the crescent
That's uncommon
How uncommon
One in a half million, maybe, it doesn't really have a name
But it isn't consequential
Wouldn't have any effect on cognitive processes
Great
There's nothing wrong with me, gotta get back to work
(stands and shakes hands) Thank you for everything, Elizabeth, owe you a giant one, hey, you think can get some of that Valium to go
Elizabeth scowls at him
(cont' d) Worth a try
Take care, say hi to Michael
(to Maggie) 'll pick up Jake,  told him 'd take him to the Pier tonight
He heads for the door, eager to get the hell out of there
Maggie lingers, looking at Elizabeth, hopeful
There's really nothing wrong with him
Nothing at all
Maggie
said nothing physical
: Maggie is in the bedroom, cleaning up
She picks up Tom's pair of jeans from the floor and folds them over one arm
Something  to the floor
She picks it up
It's the butterfly knife, the one he took from Duane
She stares at it, fascinated and frightened
She lets it drop open
There is dried blood on the blade
Gingerly, she closes it again
She opens a drawer and puts it in, then thinks better of that
She takes it out again, looks for a place to put it
She drops it in her purse and zips it shut
She'll deal with it later
: Navy Pier is an amusement park/shopping mall built on a pier jutting out into Lake Michigan
It's a nice night, the pier is crowded, just enough urban edge to be interesting figure bobs along above the crowd -- Jake, sitting on Tom's shoulders
They stop and join a  watching a , a good one, keeps five burning pins in the air
Jake suddenly looks up, confused by something
He stares past the juggler, through the flames
Behind the juggler, a is staring at the little boy -- it's the same Cop who was parked outside their house earlier
Jake stares back, the flaming pins flying up between them
Tom moves on, his boy still on his shoulders
The Cop turns and watches them go
Jake turns, looking back over his shoulder at the Cop
The Cop raises a hand and waves
Jake just stares
, there is an elaborate model train set on display in the window
Daddy, look
Woah, check it out
He stops, helps Jake down off his shoulders
Jake presses right up against the glass, staring at the train as it circles the track
Tom squats, admiring it with him
() 56
: , the Cop is still watching them
He walks closer, stops only about ten feet away, staring
Tom glances up, sees him, thinks nothing of it
The 'op steps closer
, Tom sees the reflection of the Cop
Closer now, staring
Tom turns and smiles, tight-lipped
He recognizes him from the other day
The Cop smiles back, doesn't go away
(to Jake) Hey, look at that one
He carries Jake to the next window over, a different display
The Cop wanders closer
Tom finally turns to him, tense
(cont' d) How ya doin'
Fine, fine
He's staring at Jake
Is there a law against lookin' in the window now
Huh
Oh, no, `course not
'm off duty
live right up there
That's great
See ya later
He sweeps Jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away
It's even stronger in him than it is in you
Tom stops
Turns back
What
The Cop smiles and makes a face -- "you heard me
" () 57
: (cont' d) don't know what you're talking about
Jon't be afraid of it
Tom just star
s at the Cop, trembling slightly
The Cop walks forward
Fascinated, Tom does not back away
The Cop lowers his voice
(cont' d) You're not alone
Tom is too rattled to speak
(cont' d) You don't know about Cacophony yet
Tom shakes his head no
The Cop pulls out a note pad, scribbles something on a page, tears it out and holds it out to Tom
(cont' d) Come next time
His hand shaking, Tom accepts the paper
The Cop reaches out and tousles Jake's hair
(coast' d) Bye, Jake
The Cop turns and walks away
Bye, Neil
The Cop looks back over his shoulder and smiles
Tom looks at his son as if he's never seen him before
: ' Jake, fresh from a bath and in his pajamas, sits on the floor of his room, playing with model cars, intent
He's  a soft tune to himself, the same one he hummed during his bath in the opening
Tom and Maggie sit near him, staring at him
They're freaked out
What have they got on their hands here
Their tone is soft, gently probing
() 58
: Jake, do you remember the other day when we were talking in the kitchen
Jake doesn't look up, just keeps playing and
(cont' d) was loo3
ing for a baby-sitter, remember
(Jake plays) And you said "Samantha" told you about Dorothy
Do you remember that
He keeps playing,
Jake
Mommy's asking you a question
Nothing
Is Samantha someone who talks to you sometimes, Jake
No answer
She tries a different route
(cont'd) Can you remember any of the things that Saman- Jake looks up sharply
Don't ask the boy any more questions
They freeze, staring at him
His tone was odd
And did he just refer to himself in the third person
(cant' d) Talk to me
He goes back to playing, and to that little tune
It's becoming rather haunting
Maggie and Tom look at each other
Good God
: Nighttime
Tom and Maggie are asleep in bed
Suddenly, Tom's eyes pop open
() 59
: She's downstairs
He sits up
His head is killing him again
There's a glass of water on the night table
le grabs it and drinks greedily
He turns and looks to the open -loorway
He swallows
He stands up
He looks down at Maggie, who's still sound asleep
He walks to the door
Maggie stirs, feeling him gone
Tom walks down the narrow hallway, toward the staircase at the far end
He's scared
He starts down the stairs
Halfway down, he dares a look through the wooden posts that support the handrail
Samantha is standing in the middle of the room
She looks up at him
For a long moment, they just stare at each other
Steam rises lightly from her as she breathes
Tom is shaking, barely finds his voice
Samantha
She speaks, but when her voice comes out it's horrible and distorted -- muffled in a strange way
He takes a few trembling steps down the stairs, closer to her
She walks forward a step or two
She speaks again, louder, but the voice is still unintelligible and bizarre
Tom reaches the bottom of the stairs
She reaches out a hand
He stares, terrified
The hand draws closer
Almost beyond his own control, Tom raises his own hand
She comes closer
Tom is frozen at the bottom of the stairs
Their hands draw closer still
Their fingertips touch
() 60
: Tom , as if something very heavy were put down on his chest
His mouth drops open, his chest twitches
He can't breathe
They stand there, frozen in that position
Tom tries, but can't draw air
'  calls out from the top ci the stairs
Tom
He can't answer
He's panicked, but unable to move
With every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst from his mouth, all the air going out, none coming in
From the top of the stairs, Maggie can see him, standing there, hand outstretched into the darkness, touching nothing
But from Tom's point of view, he's touching fingertips with Samantha
He's frozen, breathless, and now his cheeks start to turn pale, unnaturally white
Another few seconds of this and he'll pass out
(con t' d) Tom
She races down the stairs
(cont' d) Tom can't look at her, can't move
tear rolls down his cheek as his lips begin to turn blue
(cont' d) ,
ATfHE
She grabs hold of him
As soon as Maggie makes contact, Tom collapses
He sees Samantha break away from him with a of irritation
She moves, not quite walking, but a herky- jerky kind of lateral movement toward the dining room, fast, like someone on a dozen espressos, an angry thing that has to slow itself down to a crawl just to talk to us
In the dining room, she flops over onto the floor, like a reflection appearing suddenly on the surface of a pond
Into the floor, she disappears
Maggie grabs Tom's face and turns it toward her
He takes a big lungful of air
() 61
: (2) (cont' d) Was she here
Tom nods, sucking air greedily
(cont'd) Why
think we better find out
: It's a street party, and it's jammed
Police barricades are at both ends of the block
Half barrels of beer sit in big plastic garbage cans, ice dumped over them
Everyone seems to have agreed on which radio station to listen to, and most of the couple dozen cars parked in the driveways have their radios tuned to it, loud, the windows hanging open
Outside Bernie's Tap, the bar on the corner, a are running pass patterns out the front door, cutting left at the mailbox, and catching a football thrown from inside the bar, out an open window
Well, they don't actually catch the ball
, the Homeless Guy we've seen on the street a few times is drinking right out of one of the beer taps while nobody is watching
Lenny, the local crank we met before, is outraged
,
He chases him off, trying to kick him in the ass but spilling his own beer in the process
(cont' d) (to no one in particular) You see what 'm talkin' about
You see what  mean
, Jake plays with a couple other
, Frank is giving a lurid lesson on the proper way to pump the keg to two
Tom joins him
() - -
Err- r - - - - ab a
ter
s 62
: You know you're under surveillance here
He gestures to Sheila, Frank's wife, who's about ten feet away, keeping an angry eye on him
What can  do
Nature commands me to spread my seed
hear and obey
Sure, great, just don't be surprised if some day Sheila digs out your 38 and buries a slug or two in your ass
Please
The woman can't even step on a spider
Spider doesn't fuck around on her
, Sheila is talking to Maggie, disgusted with Frank
They change, Maggie
Ten or so years of marriage, a kid or two -- they become a different human being
Sheila, if you're so miserable, why don't you leave
Adam's almost out of school, he can handle it
Oh, Frank would love that
No want him out
like that house
How long have you guys been there
Almost fifteen years
So
you know most of the people around here pretty well, right
' , somebody actually manages to catch one of the passes coming from out of the bar and is immediately tackled by three drunks
On the pavement
Ouch
, Tom is now talking to Harry Damon
But, you know, what am  gonna do, 'm a single father with a son to support, can' t just say fuck everything
So scraped together enough money to make a few downpayments, and here am
landlord, for Christ's sake
So you've been in this neighborhood a long time, right
is questioning Sheila
Did you ever hear of a girl named Samantha Muller
() From over by Baldwin
think so
Yeah, kinda, name rings a bell
, in response to the same question from Tom, calls over to his son Kurt, the good-looking football player, who is leaning against the front of his yellow Trans-Am, talking to a couple other guys
Hey, Kurt, you remember that Muller girl
(to Tom) Like he ever tells me anything
() 64
: The music coming from the car is too loud, Kurt can't hear
(cont' d) () --
He gestures
Kurt drags himself off the hood and saunters over
(cont' d) Do you remember that Muller girl
What, Dorothy
He makes a "big breasts" gesture
No, the other one
Samantha
Lenny, the crank, joins the conversation
You mean the retard
She ran away
She did
is on the same subject
She was always hanging around the guys, you know, she wanted to be with the "in" clique and everything
There wasn't much chance of that
, asks Tom a question
Why you wanna know about her
Oh, Dorothy baby-sits for us sometimes and she started talking about her sister, wonderin' how she was doing and stuff
promised her 'd ask around, see if anybody'd heard anything from her
() - - - Ambb

: She took off back in March,  think, with some black guy
)id she ever live in that house we're n
Frank comes up, one arm around his son Adam
Who
No
You're the first tenants since bought it
(to Harry) Harry,  saw those Dominicans back in the park again
By the basketball courts
What do you want me to do about it, Lenny
We could go talk to `em
Scare `em off, if there were enough of us
Yeah, Lenny, they're gonna be terrified of you
keeps talking to Maggie
She was a pretty girl, but real shy
Pretty simple
She had these crazy ideas she could be an actress, you know
She thought she was gonna be a big movie star
mean, there was no way, but you couldn't tell her that
thought it was kind of sad
have joined Tom and the others
() 66
: (to Tom) Two one one
Okay
211
Got it
Two hundred eleven
give up, Frank
(puts his son in a hammerlock) Two hundred and eleven yards rushing the other night
That makes eight ninety-four with two games to play, kid needs a hundred and six, that's only fifty-three a game
He could walk through the rest of the season and hit a thousand
(pulling free) Dad
Behind them, the guys playing football out of Bernie's Tap have now organized a full-fledged game of tackle in the street, over the objections of their wives and girlfriends, who shout at them to stop
embarrass him
Are there worse things that can happen to a human being
Hey, Adam, way to go, man
() Thanks
() 67
: (2) (to Harry) Well, if you hear anything about her, lemme know, okay
About who
Tom's askin' about that Muller girl from over by Baldwin, you know, the one that ran away
The retard
Jesus, Lenny, don't use that word
What, retard
() No, "the
" She was almost your age, Adam
You know anything about her
Adam doesn't answer right away
They all look at him
: Huh uh
Suddenly, the guys playing football run a play right through the middle of them -- sweaty, middle-aged bodies fly in every direction
Everybody  and lunges backward, protecting their beers
The conversation is broken up
But the football players are upset, and a fight breaks out
The crowd gets out of the way, half to watch the fight with glee, the other half to shake their heads and watch the fight
' , while the fight goes on in the background, Adam wanders away from the group and sits down on the hood of Kurt Damon's car
He's rattled
Kurt notices him and comes over
He sits next to him
() 68
: You okay
Yeah
(Kurt is looking atIhim: 'm fine
You don't look fine
Really, Mom
How do  look
(hands up in surrender) All right, all right
Just, if there's, you know, if there's somethin' you wanna bullshit about or anything, just let me know
Might help
You could climb off my back, that'd help
Adam walks away
Sorry
, two police cars arrive, their lights flashing
jump out and wade through the crowd to bust up the fight
So much for the party
Sheila shakes her head
It can't ever just be nice
Someone's always got to ruin it
: Nighttime
The city lights are on
The sound of rises faintly over them
We're on the roof of a house, and a figure with its back to us is doing the crying
The figure drinks from a bottle
long, hard pull
() 69
: Coming around thefrontwe see the figure is Adam McCarthy, Frank and Sheila'sson,sitting on the roof of his house, staring out at thecityand getting quietly shit-faced
: Tom pries his eyes open, exhausted
Sunlight streams through the window, right into his face
He squints, looks at the clock
It's 10:26
Oh, man
He sits up, painfully
beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes
, Tom pulls his jeans on
He sits on a chair, puts on a shoe
But the other one's gone
He feels under the chair
Not there
He opens the closet door
Not there
He looks under the bed
There it is
He grabs it
note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- " " Tom takes it down and reads it
Tom comes downstairs and heads for the kitchen
There's someone standing in his living room, in the doorway from the dining room
It's Frank, his neighbor from next door, wearing a red shirt
Frank is staring at the floor
Frank
What are you doing here
Frank looks up at him
His face is sad
They're going to kill you, Tommy
You and Maggie both
() 70
: Frank turns and walks to the front door
He opens it, walks outside, and sits on the top step of the porch, looking out at the street
Tom follows him
It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a m
ss from the party yesterday
Tom comes out and looks down at Frank, who's just sitting there, staring out at the litter
Why did you say that, Frank
(in his own world) This is a decent neighborhood
On the street,   ride their bikes straight at each other, full tilt,
At the last second, one of the kids swerves, the other taunts him with cries of "Chicken
" bird swoops over Tom's head, too low, and Tom flinches
He walks across the driveway, toward Frank's house
The waves to him, headed down the block
Tom waves back
Tom walks up the steps to Frank's front door and knocks calls from inside
(o
s
) Come in
' Tom opens the door and comes in
Adam, Frank's son, is standing in the middle of the living room floor, a big smile on his face and one arm behind his back
Hi
Hi
Want to see what 've got
Sure
Adam pulls his arm around from behind his back
He's holding a 38 with a carved white handle
() 71
: (cont' d) Is that your dad's
Not today
Come here: Tom walks toward him
(cont' d) Closer
Tom walks closer
He's right in front of Adam
(cont' d) bet you never saw this before
He points the gun barrel at Tom -- -- then swings it around and points it at his own heart
Oh, don't do that
Adam pulls the trigger
Tom  as Adam collapses to the floor, blood pouring from his chest
His body convulses -- -- and Tom's eyes pop open, in bed
That was weird
Tom blinks, exhausted
Sunlight streams through the window, right into his face
He squints, looks at the clock
It's 10:26
Oh, man
He sits up, painfully
beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes
, Tom pulls on a pair of jeans
He sits down, puts on a shoe
But the other one's gone
He feels under the chair
Not there
He opens the closet door
Not there
Tom blinks, unsettled
This is kinda familiar
He turns and looks at the bed
() 72
: Please don't be under there
He bends down, lifts the blanket, and looks under the bed
There's his shoe
(cont' d) Shit
He grabs it
note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- " " Tom winces as he takes it down and reads it
Again
Shod, Tom comes down the stairs and into the living room
Frank's not there, thank God
Tom goes to the front door and opens it
Uh
Frank
But Frank's not on the porch either
Tom steps outside
It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a mess from the party yesterday
draws Tom's attention
Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other, full tilt
Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they At the last second, one of the kids turns away
The other taunts him with cries of "Chicken
" Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk
bird swoops low over his head; he really flinches this time
The Mailman waves to him, headed down the block
Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back
He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house
He starts to walk toward it, slowly at first, then picking up speed, jogging across the driveway
He's halfway there -- -- when a  rings out from inside
Oh, God
() 73
: He races the rest of the way, bounds up the steps to the house, rips open the screen door
But the front door is locked
He  on it
(coast' d) ,
He  harder, but there's no answer
He goes to the window beside the door and peers through it
, he sees Adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living room
, Oh, God, no
Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window
' Glass  and sprays all over the floor
Tom knocks the rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the house
He races over to Adam's body
There is a pool of blood around his chest and his body is convulsing
In his right hand, he clutches a 38 with a carved white handle
Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please
He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's chest, trying to stop the bleeding
(cont' d) This is really happening
, it's really happening
: Tom sits on his front steps, shell shocked, red light flashing off his face
An ambulance and two police cars are parked in front of the house next door, radios  with official activity
() 74
: Tom just stares
car comes barreling around the corner and to a halt in front of the house
Frank and Sheila leap out of the car and race toward the house
Tom watches as they're intercepted-by a  who tries to restrain them for a second
But they're hysterical, they've obviously been told something serious has happened and they're desperate to get inside
They blow past the Cop and hurry up the stairs, just as wheel a stretcher out of the house, headed for the ambulance
The sheet isn't over Adam's head, at least, but that's about the only good sign, they're working on him frantically
Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of Adam's parents -- Frank's anguished, disbelieving , Sheila's horrified
: a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address and a time scribbled on it
The word "Cacophony" is legible
Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment, then hands it to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket
He takes it and shoves it in his pocket
He's nervous
They both are
She smooths his jacket
He turns to go, but she tightens her grip on his jacket
Doesn't want to let him go
We need some answers, right
Maybe they're the only ones who have any
She nods
Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring
'm sure they're very nice people, but in case they aren't -- She hands a thin black cannister to him
(coat' d) Mace the shit out of `em
He smiles and shoves it in his pocket
She kisses him
Tom walks down a street in a dodgy neighborhood at night, checking addresses
He stops and looks up, at an old, formerly grand apartment building that's fallen on hard times
- The corridor is even creepier
And massive
Tom reaches a door all the way at the end and knocks
moment later, the door opens
very heavy-set woman in a floral print dress () smiles at him
hope you like fondue
' Vivian sets a plate down on a  tray in front of Tom
There is a pile of chunks of various hard-to-identify meats, a silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake with an American flag stuck in it
Tom sits on an overstuffed couch that's leaking stuffing
Dip away
Thank you
Listen, is, uh -- Vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to Tom, , in his seventies, in a wheelchair, an oxygen tube running into his nostrils
(coat' d) Is there a guy named Neil here
He's a cop
Well, of course he is
She turns and heads back into the kitchen, passing , her identical twin, who's wearing the same print dress, this one with a red background instead of blue
Beverly serves two people on the far couch, one a    , the other a  in his early twenties
Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot, full of cheese
Beverly dips and eats, winks at him, and flits off across the room
Herman turns to Tom and asks something in a raspy voice
() 76
: Excuse me
Irritated, Herman gestures for him to lean closer
Tom does
What does it want you to do
don't
'm sorry,  don't under- Herman wraps his bony fingers around Tom's wrist
Then you're not listening
(o
s
) It's his first time, Herman
Give him a break
Tom turns
Neil, the cop he saw the other night, has come in from the kitchen
Tonight he's in street clothes
(cont' d) (points at Tom) Lemme guess
"Distended parietal lobe," right
() Who are you guys
Don't have a name
Cacophony Society, somebody said once, that stuck for a while
You know, like too many voices in our heads
think it's too melodramatic
How about "fellow sufferers
" Vivian comes in from the kitchen with two big gallon jugs of orange juice
There are AAAAHS1 of appreciation
Does everybody here -- see things, like me
() Buncha freaks, huh
Speak for yourself
() 77
: (2) No, Herman, you're a freak
"Mutants" is a better word for the rest of us
He pulls 'ip a chair and sits down opposite Tom
On the other side of tie room, Vivian and Beverly tell an animated two-part story to he teenage girl and the homey, finishing each others' se
tences
(cont' d) Like any other part of our body, our brains have evolved a lot in a hundred thousand years
Our first thoughts were formless
Struggling consciousness
Sensation
An instinctive tie to our environment
But then our brains began to focus
We sacrificed the intuitions we first had so our thoughts could be directed, so we could master specific functions
That's where we are at the moment
We're brilliant with technique, but we've given up instinct
So the next evolutionary step, the step yet to come, or perhaps it's already in the making, is actually backward
To maintain our higher functions, but reawaken the part of our brain that was pure intuition
That was receptive to anything, because it didn't know enough not to believe
You're a freak of nature, pal, an evolutionary step
You're double- jointed
(taps his head) Up here
Are we the only ones
Hardly
've heard of groups like ours in San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis -- those are just the cities 've been to
Tom, you're what they used to call a medium
You're like a man in a dark tunnel with a flashlight, but the light only goes on once in a while
When it flickers on, you get a glimpse of something, but not enough of a glimpse to know what it is
Just enough to know it's there
() 78
: (3) What about my son
(sn files) The ncxt generation
Much better flashlight
Wright, if there's all these people who got this power, why doesn't everybody know about it
Why isn't it common knowledge
It is
lotta people know
Unfortunately, the easiest people to convince, the believer types, they also tend to be the dumbest
And people who demand proof -- well, this isn't something we can control, it comes when it comes, so if you can't make it happen, how can you prove it
It's like that singing frog in the cartoon, but when the guy puts it on stage it just croaks and he looks like a jerk
Herman laughs, horribly
He likes that cartoon
(cont' d) Some of us try anyway
say who needs that kind of aggravation
This all started when  was hypnotized
Is that how it always is
First time 've heard that one
it comes all different ways
Sometimes it goes the same way it came
So it does go away
For some people
Don't look for rules
We're off the map here
What does it want you to do
() 79
: (4) What does what want me to do
You saw a ghos-, didn't you
' Yeah
Twice
t
girl that disappeared from my neighborhood
Now the kid next door just tried to kill himself
think he knew something, but now 'll never know what it was
And gotta know
Look, what'd the bitch want
Why do you assume she wants something
They always do
Something they need finished, something they can't do any more
Why me
Because she's confused
Doesn't know why other people won't answer her
She only knows that you will
If she hasn't asked for something yet, she will
And once they ask, it's very difficult to stop yourself from doing it
What do you mean
She can, it can make me do something  don't want to do
Oh, no
You'll want to
Badly
You won't think about anything else
You won't sleep
You won't eat
You'll lie
And God help anyone who tries to stop you
What if  stop me
What if  just don't do it
() 80
: (5) Then you got a weird bitch friend for the rest of your life
Just listen to her, Tom Let her tell you what she wants
: '  - pounds on an apartment door
Philip opens up
He was asleep
What, what, what
want you to hypnotize me again
' Tom paces the floor in Philip's apartment
Just slow down, you gotta be a little patient with me here, `cause, um
well, Tom, Tom, 've got a confession to make
See , ,  just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes before you walked in, so this shit you're tellin' me here is fuckin' with my mind just a little bit extra, okay
Tom grabs a chair from Philip's desk and sits
Do it
, they sit face to face
Okay
Close your eyes
Tom closes his eyes
81
, (o
s
) Just like last time --  want you to concentrate
Listen to the room around you
Tom listens
The factory  softly outsioi the windows
few  in the street below
His
(cont' d) Now focus
Concentrate
Look at the backs of your eyelids
Do you see anything there
' , (opens his eyes) Would you just get to it, please
All right, all right
Tom closes his eyes again
(cont' d) want you to pretend you're in a movie theatre
We're sitting alone in an empty movie theatre
The seats and walls are covered in black velvet
(o
s
) It's very dark
Everything is covered in black velvet
The seats, the walls, the floor
In the whole pitch- black theatre, there's only one thing you can see
The white screen
You drift toward it, in your chair
Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white
We move slowly toward it, floating over the seats
(o
s
) There are letters up on the screen
Tall, thick, black letters, but they're out of focus
You drift closer to them
() 82
: We do drift closer to the blurry letters, but our attention is diverted by something
Three rows from the screen, there is a figure in one of the seats, its back to us
' Tom's eyes are sill closed
His face furrows in conctrn
There's someone in here
No, it's empty
There's someone else here
No, man,  said you're alone in the theatre
But there is someone in the theatre with us, and we continue to drift forward toward them
(o
s
) You're comfortable in your black velvet seat, very comfortable
Actually, we're quite nervous, drifting closer and closer to that figure sitting in the third row, its back to us
(o
s
) Your feet and ankles are relaxed
Your legs are relaxed
' Tom's eyes are still closed
His chest is twitching
hard to breathe The figure in the seat is only a row or two ahead of us now
It's a woman
We keep drifting closer
(o
s
) Your hands are limp and heavy
Your arms are relaxed
Your face
() 83
: Our hand reaches out, touches the shoulder of the woman
She turns
It's Samantha
Her face is shrouded in plastic
Her mouth presses against the plastic, it forms a horrible round 0, contorted in a silent scream
' Tom's eyes flicker madly under the lids
Philip's worried
want you to look at the screen
() can't breathe
Look at the screen, Tom
Now Tom's not just an observer in the movie theatre, he's in the movie theatre, sitting right next to Samantha
She's pawing at him, it's all he can do to fight her hands off
In their struggle, his fingers close around the plastic that shrouds her face
He sweeps it off her head
(o
s
) The screen, Tom, look at the screen
You can read the letters now
Samantha's face is bloodied and bruised, as the plastic comes off she  for air and lets out a ghastly, inhuman that fills the theatre
Philip's voice gets louder as he struggles to maintain control of the hypnosis
(o
s
) Look at the screen, Tom, you're close enough now, you can read the letters, you're right up next to them
Tom, still holding off Samantha's grasping hands, turns and looks up at the movie screen
(o
s
) The letters come into focus, they spell -- Tom's eyes widen as he stares at the screen
Three huge letters pop into focus and fill our field of vision
The letters say: () 84A : 85
' Tom's eyes pop open and he staggers backwards, gasping for air, knocking the chair out from under himself
He falls back against Philip's desk, scared out of his mind
What
What happened
Couldn't breathe
Are you okay
Tom wipes his brow, he's covered in sweat
Plastic, like sheets of plastic
He shoves Philip out of the way, finds the refrigerator on the other side of the room
He rips it open, searches for something to drink
Philip follows him
think you need to sit down, man, something very next level was happening there, you should have seen your face
Only beer in the fridge
Tom  one open and upends it
(cont' d) Uh
want a brew
Tom drinks the entire can
(cont' d) Feel better
Tom nods, wiping his chin
(cont' d) What happened
Tom looks at him, calming
She told me what she wants
: & ' Maggie's Sentra pulls into the driveway of their house, parking behind Tom's phone company truck
She gets out, dressed in work clothes, and pulls two bags of groceries out of the trunk
She looks at Tom's truck, then at her watch
Home already
& ' Maggie comes in the front door
(calling out) Hey
You're home early
She struggles to take the keys out of the door while still holding the groceries
(cont' d) Can you pick up Jake
'm exhausted
She comes in and kicks the door shut behind her
Tom's nowhere to be seen
From somewhere in back, there is a faint sound
(cont' d) Hello
No answer
She heads into the kitchen with the groceries
In the kitchen, a letter is waiting in the tray of an old fax machine on the counter
Maggie stops in the doorway, staring at the floor
Muddy footprints lead into and out of the kitchen, through the door to the back
Thick chunks of wet mud are everywhere
Hey, look what 'm not cleaning up
She sets the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a gallon of milk
She opens the refrigerator
She does a double take
The entire top shelf is jammed with cardboard cartons of orange juice
From outside, the  sound comes again
She follows the muddy footprints out the kitchen door
The back yard is smallish, but it's a nice little patch of grass
Used to be, anyway, because now there are three large holes in it, dug seemingly at random locations
Large piles of dirt and rock are heaved up next to the holes
Tom stands in one of t1
e holes, his back to Maggie, hoisting a large pick axe high over his head
He brings the pick down, into the hole
Busy guy
Maggie is aghast
She walks slowly across the yard, past a pile of shovels and buckets and other tools
She draws closer to him
Tom
Tom raises the pick high and brings it down hard
The hole he's in at the moment isn't more than two or three feet deep
But, hey, it's early
Maggie draws closer
In between swings -- (coast' d) Tom
Tom whirls, the pick raised to defend himself
His shirt's off, his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat
Maggie jumps back
You scared me
And with that, he turns back to the job
Swing
scared you
Swing
(cont' d) Tom
Swing
(cont' d) What are you doing
(doesn't turn around) 'm supposed to dig
() 88
: Swing
Maggie walks around him, so she's facing him
He keeps working
What do you mean
Zom shrugs
Swings the pick
'm supposed to dig
Who says
He just looks at her from under his sweaty brows
You know who
(cont' d) Oh
Tom manages to break apart the rock he was working on with the pick
He tosses the axe, which bounces crazily across the grass at Maggie's feet
She jumps out of the way
He hoists himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose
He sprays water into the hole
(cont' d) Why are you doing this
Water softens up the dirt
He tosses the hose aside and grabs a shovel
He jumps back in the hole and starts to dig
No,  mean
Could you stop for a minute
(he keeps digging) Would you please stop for a minute
What don' t you get
'm supposed to dig
' He looks up, supremely irritated, and leans on the shovel
"Well
" () 89
: (2) (coat' d) M2y are you digging
(isn't it obvious
), 'm searching
What are you searching for
The question isn't "what
" We both know very well "what," even if we don't want to may it out loud
The question, Maggie, which, as you can plainly see,  am very busy trying to answer -- the question is "Where
" think we should call the police
And tell them what, exactly
Run it by me once
Practice, see how it sounds
(looks at his watch) Anything else
Why don't you come in the house with me
Take a break
want to talk to you, you're not yourself right now
This is just fucking typical, isn't it
He climbs out of the hole and walks toward her
(cont' d) What do you want me to do, Maggie, you want me to go inside, sit down in front of the , drink eight or nine beers till  fall asleep in the chair
Like that
Maybe repeat the whole thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after- () 90
: (3) -until  grab my chest-and die
May )e  was already dead
This is the mos
important thing that's ever happaned to me, the most important thins 've ever done in my life, Maggie, my whole stupid life, and you want me to just
By the and of his tirade,   are staring over the back fence
He's only a few feet from Maggie now, the veins in his neck standing out
She holds her ground
() 've known you since 'm nineteen years old, you never talked to me like that before
Not one time
He stares at her, furious -- -- and then jumps in the hole and starts digging again
Maggie turns and stalks across the yard and into the house
Tom keeps digging for a moment, then hurls the shovel across the yard
InterRUPtions
He picks up his tee shirt, snakes angrily into it, and marches across the yard toward the house
(cant' d) (to the Neighbors) What are  lookin' at
Maggie site at the kitchen table, reading the letter that came in on the fax
Tom comes into the room behind her, pauses in the doorway, composing himself
She keeps reading
He sighs, heavily
She doesn't turn around
He goes to the refrigerator and takes out a carton of orange juice
He takes two glasses from a cupboard and sits down at the table opposite her
He fills both glasses and puts one in front of her
She looks up at him as he drains his
He pauses, staring at her
() 91
: You gonna drink that
She doesn't answer
He takes her glass, drinks some
(cone' d) 'm sorry
No answer
(coat' d) Okay, 'm not sorry
She ignores him
He looks at the letter in her hands
(cont' d) Who's that from
My brother Steve
My mother's going back in the hospital again
() No, sh- He stops himself
She looks at him
What
He shakes his head
(cont' d) What
Nothing
They stare at each other
Tom's face is pale
Maggie is concerned
The phone
Maggie stares at Tom
The phone again
She lowers her voice, pleading
What is it
Tom can't look at her
The phone  again
Tom gets up, opens the door that leads to the back yard, and goes outside
Tom takes a few steps out of the house, putting his hands to his head in pain
Whatever it is, he knows
In the house, the phone rings a fourth time
Maggie's voice drifts through the open doorway as she answers i;
( - 9
) Hello
Tom closes his eyes
(o
s
) Steve,  was just going to- She stops
There is a long silence
Tom opens his eyes tear runs down his cheek
He wipes it away
He turns and walks back toward the house, slowly
There is dead silence inside
As he nears the doorway, he hears the sound of the telephone being placed back in its cradle
Maggie reaches the doorway at the same time Tom does
She looks up at him, her eyes filled with tears
He puts his arms around her and she breaks down
He holds her
He holds her for a long moment
(cont' d) You knew
(no answer) You knew, didn't you
When's the funeral
Sunday
We should leave as soon as we can
We
She stiffens
(cont' d) Oh, you, uh
you want me to go with you
She looks at him, deeply hurt
Then enraged
She pushes him away from her, hard
He stumbles back into the yard
() 93
: (cont' d) Hey,  just thought, maybe, you know
your family might want
Do   you to come with me:
To my '
Of   want you to come, why the hell ' you come
But he's looking past her, at the holes in the yard
'm just
kind of in the middle of something here
She looks at him, absolutely incredulous -- -- and then storms back into the house,  the door so hard two of the glass panes spiderweb
: Jake, twisted around in his car seat, looks out the back window of Maggie's car
He raises one hand, waving
Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage, still in his mud- stained jeans and tee shirt
He waves back
The car pulls out of the driveway, fast, and  off down the block
Jake and Maggie are gone
There are now five large holes in the back yard, and Tom is running out of places to dig
Nevertheless, he drags the hose across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far corner
He stops short
Hose won't reach
, he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard
, this one in the far corner, he reconnects the hose and turns on the water
Nothing comes out
() 94
: Come on
Tom curses and trudges back toward the house
Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit-hen
Tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the far wall
He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap that covers the floor
He shoves the screwdriver into a crack in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the middle of the closet floor
Through the hole, he can see a ladder resting up against the wall below
He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts to climb down
As Tom climbs down, he reaches out for a chain that hangs from a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on
They have only a partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight feet deep
The rest of the area under the house is just crawl space, barely enough to wriggle through
Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side, where a mess of water pipes all converge
He picks through them, finds the valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one on
surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot
He turns to climb back up the ladder
And stops
He looks down, at the floor
It's dirt
He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking
, the pick axe falls
Tom has brought all his tools into the basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement floor
The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the earthen walls
He works
It's quiet in the neighborhood
The  sound of Tom's pick axe falling echoes over the block
Tom digs
The hole is almost four feet across, five feet deep
He's uncovered a large rock, a major chunk of stone, right in the middle of where he wants to dig
He's excavated all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it loose with a pry bar, but it won't budge
Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning against the pile of mud and stone he's already hauled out
He thinks
: Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply warehouse
Tools are mounted on the wall for sale -- shovels, picks, post hole diggers
Got all that
Tom keeps walking
The tools get bigger
Huge shovels
Tractor blades
Hand pile drivers
Almost, but not quite
Tom keeps walking
At the end of the row, underneath a sign that says " " is an industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews use to bust through whatever's in their way
Tom's face lights up
The jackhammer rides in the back of Tom's pickup truck, rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes
Tom pulls into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate
Using all his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the back of the truck
It's incredibly heavy, it takes all his strength to haul it up the stairs, kick open his door, and bring it into the house
, Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is washing his car
He hears a from over at Tom's place and turns
He sees Tom at his pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it
Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor
Lenny stares at him
() 96
: Sheila, carrying flowers and looking like didn't sleep last night, comes out of her house and heads for her car
She stops and stares too
In Tom's basement, the compressor descends through the trap door above, seemingly of its own accord -- than we see it's at the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space, sweating and straining, lowering the thing down
It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer
, Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb, which also has an electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a yellow safety cord
He flicks a switch on the compressor and it  to life
He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power
Tom picks up the jackhammer
He hauls it over to the rock that's been in his way
He positions the jackhammer's spike on the top of the rock
He lowers a pair of goggles over his eyes
He swings his weight up, onto the jackhammer, and squeezes the handles
The jackhammer  to life
It's deafening
Tom's whole body quivers
It's like riding a bull, but the rock begins to split in half
Tom  with joy, barely heard over the din that echoes in his basement
As the sun goes down, the sound of the  jackhammer is plainly audible on the block
The familiar Homeless Guy stops and  something at Tom's house
Across the street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and stares at Tom's house
What the hell is that guy up to
: ' group of     mill around a living room, muttering in the soft tones of those at a wake
() 97
: There's a lot of big Irish guys drinking beer, guts stuffed into sweat-stained white shirts
Maggie excuses herself from the group and steps into another room
' The door is ajar, people visible through it as Maggie dials a nu-rber on a bedside telephone
The phone rings on the other enc
And rings
And rings
Just as she's about to hang up, Tom answers
(o
s
) (sounds angry) Hello
It's me
(o
s
) (changes his tone) Oh, hi
How ya doin'
'm okay
(o
s
) How's your family
You know
Drunk
Fighting with each other
(o
s
) Listen, Maggie, 'm sorry
was an asshole
should be there with you right now
Yeah, well, what can  say
You are kind of an asshole
How do you feel
(o
s
) Fine
lot better
Much, much better
Everything's fine here
Real good
Have you had any- (o
s
) Nope
Not even one
No, uh
no more digging
() 98
: (o
s
) No
Uh uh
Back to normal
Look, 'm sorry too
' wish  hadn't just stormed out of there,  shouldn't have left you alone
(o
s
) deserved it
Are you okay
You sound funny
What are you doing
(o
s
) Just
moving a chair
There
Why don't you come up here with us
This time of night you could make it in an hour
(o
s
) Well,  can't, really
Why not
(o
s
) (a lame lie) 'm, uh, not supposed to use the truck for personal trips
(trying to keep her cool) Alright
'll come down there and get you
'll leave right now
Behind her, the bedroom door swings open
Jake stands there
He looks terrible
She doesn't hear him come in
(o
s
) No, no, no, no, no, what do you want to do that for
Don't come down here
Feathers everywhere
Maggie turns back to Jake -- and
He's peeing his pants, the urine drizzling down over his shoes
() 99
: (2) (into phone) Oh, my God,  gotta go
'll be there in an hour
(o
s
) Maggie, wait, no, Mag- She hangs up the phone and races over to her son
Honey, what happened
Why didn't you tell me you had to go to the potty
Jake turns and looks at her
Help Daddy
: & ' Tom  down the phone
He's standing in the dining room, which is now so mud-spattered it looks like the inside of a cave
The table has been shoved against the wall, legs sticking out into the room
One corner is filled with a pile of broken-up chunks of rock
Tom strides across the room in two steps, lowers himself, and drops his legs through the open trap door
Tom sails down into the basement and lands nimbly on the floor
Doesn't even use the ladder anymore
The rock is gone, broken apart by the jackhammer, and the hole is now eight feet long and as many wide, and about four feet deep
Tom leaps down into it and goes back to work
: ' In the front hall of the house, Maggie is putting on her coat
Jake sits on the steps, his coat on the carpet next to him
Jake, come on, we have to go
'm staying here
() 100
: What
want to stay at Uncle Steve's, don't want to go home
Why not
Because 'm not safe there
Because of the feathers
What does that mean, Jake
He shrugs
Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to the other room
It's okay,  can watch him
Maggie, in a hurry, agrees
She bends over and kisses Jake on the forehead
Be good
She opens the door and heads out
As it's swinging shut: Don't stop for the train, Mommy
' Maggie hears that just as the door closes behind her
She misses a step, thinking about it, then starts walking to her car
She walks faster
Then she runs
: In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the dirt
The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the pile
He bends down and pulls it out
() 101
: It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches square
Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it
flas
es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice befoi-
, too close to his, sting at him through that blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses
, Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand
He begins to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions
At one end of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it sticks on something
Something buried
Tom drops the shovel
He falls to his knees and uses his hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was
More blue plastic
Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good grip on it with both hands
He pulls it up
Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle of the pit
Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again
, flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously
' is of a man possessed
He digs as fast as he can
, Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed
Above him, we see what it is
long piece of blue plastic, wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and two and a half feet wide
Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic
He flinches
pops into his mind, another familiar one
Afl , standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in winter, waving to us to come up
() 102
: , Tom jerks his hand off the plastic
He swallows
He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife
He slides the ra or blade forward
He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the knife through the sheeting
He walks the length of it, making a slit down the middle
He reaches out with shaking hands and pulls part of the plastic back
The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand
Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi- colored bracelets
Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half- decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress with the diamond pattern
Tom stands there, his chest heaving
He looks at her hand, thinking
He sits down next to her
He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back
Can't do it
But he's gotta
He opens his hand, reaching out for hers
He slides his hand underneath -- takes a deep breath -- -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones
He
His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue, and  comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he first saw her in his living room
' It's a wintry day
That same steam rises up in front of us, coming from our own mouth
We're looking at the front porch of Tom's house as we walk past it
The house is being remodeled, it's surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered with plastic Duvateen
The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us
() 103
: Hi
(off screen, we're in her point of vie sr) Hi
'mare a sec
What
want to show you something
We look back, over our shoulder, then back at the Figure
You mean me
This close now, we see the Figure is Kurt Damon
You want to show me something
Her manner of speech is childish, like a grade-schooler's
() Well, of course
don't see anybody else around
We start up the steps of the porch
Kurt smiles, beguilingly, and holds a hand out to us
What is it
It's a surprise
He tugs
She resists
What kind of surprise
Well, if  told you, it wouldn't be much of a surprise, would it
We let him pull us through the door
104
Kurt leads us into the living room
The windows are covered with tinted plastic, casting an eerie blue light through the place
Adam McCarthy is in the living - loom too, drinking from a bottle of schnapps
He's drunk, slurring
He sees us
Happy St
Patrick's Day
What's the surprise
Uh
don't you have it
He giggles
Oh yeah, the surprise
The surprise
They laugh and look at each other
Kurt drinks, then forces the bottle back at Adam
(cant' d) 'm too wasted
Drink, motherfucker, drink motherfucker, drink motherfucker He wrestles with Adam, forcing him to drink
Half of it runs down Adam's chin
don't think there is a surprise
We turn and start for the door
Kurt hurries around, intercepts us
Yeah there is, yeah there is
He puts his arm around us, leads us back into the room
() 105
: (cont' d) The surprise is
we decided we want to be your friends
You do
Oh, yeah, so bad
He laughs
Why do you want to be my friend
Are you kidding
Look at yourself
Kurt turns Samantha toward an old mirror that hangs over the fireplace
She's good-looking, if she knew it
Terribly insecure, doesn't even like looking at herself
We turn away, embarrassed
(coast' d) Ah ah ah, look
He makes us look in the mirror again
(cont' d) Mama, you are hot
He turns her toward him, looks at her, closely
(coast' d) () Come on, let's be friends
Well
, you can kiss me if you want to
Kurt leans in close, kisses us
After a moment, we force our head away, looking down
Kurt's hand is on Samantha's breast
We push him back
(cont'd) Not like that
But Kurt pulls us closer, roughly
We struggle
Come on, Samantha, 'll be your friend,  swear  will
() () 106
: (2) (cont' d) Just be nice to me
Be a good girl
You're a good girl, aren't you
have to go home
We struggle some more
He gets his powerful hanis on our shoulders and starts to push us down
Come on, baby, how `bout a little helmet wash
His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it
We tear away, get up and run for the door
From behind, something hits us very hard
The floorboards race up at us, all of a sudden
We land on them, hard, bounce off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood
Our head lands sideways on the floor
We see Adam McCarthy, vomiting in the corner
Abruptly, we're rolled over and are staring at the ceiling
Kurt Damon is on top of us, his face too close
Her hands rise up, try to push him off, but he's stronger
Samantha starts to
Hands close over our face
She bites, and the hands are pulled away
She  again
(cont' d) Kurt holds her down, begins to try to undress her
She writhes and
She gets one hand into Kurt's hair and pulls as hard as she can
He  in pain
In the corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears
', ,
But she keeps screaming
Adam staggers to a boom box that's sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch comes on, loud
It's a haunting tune, we recognize it
St's the song Jake has been humming
Kurt continues his fumbling, drunken attempts at rape, tearing her hand out of his hair
() 107
: (3) ' Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts plastic Duvateen
He races over to us with the sheet -- -- and everything turns blue
Now our sights and sounds aye muffled and distorted through the blue plastic
We see the image that has haunted Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue demon as he grapples on top of us
' , Tom is sprawled out beside the corpse, their hands locked together
His color is cadaverous
He's suffocating
He thrashes
, back in Samantha's point of view, we struggle, we thrash, it seems to go on forever
Slowly, the sounds become fainter and fainter and fainter
and everything stops
We hear the muffled voices of Kurt and Adam  at each other
The sheet is ripped off
We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam stand above us, chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces, looking at us like we're a dog they just killed with their car
Oh, my God
What the fuck did you do that for
Is she dead
No shit she's dead
Oh, my God
Look at her tongue, man
'm not here
() 108
: never saw nobody dead before
We start to fall back, and down, as if sinking into the floor
Kurt and Adam grow taller, further away
Their voices fade
wish  wasn't here
It's fuckin' gross
This isn't happening
Fuckin' plastic over her face
Good thinkin', Adam
What do we do now
Kurt and Adam are very far away, blobs of light at the end of a black tunnel that's closing in around us
Just before everything goes completely black -- Tom's fingers twitch open and his hand pulls free of Samantha's
He opens his eyes and gulps air
The color returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers
But as he does so, he stops, staring intently at something in her fingers
We don't see what it is
Tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the ladder that leads upstairs
As he goes, we pause, looking between two rungs near the top of the ladder
In the darkened crawl space under the rest of the house -- -- a pair of eyes stare at us
It's Kurt Damon
He twists around quickly and scoots back out under the house, the way he came in
' Under the front porch, a wood frame access panel lies on the grass next to the foundation of Tom's house, where it has been removed
Kurt Damon wriggles out from under the house and comes onto the grass
() 109
: But the sound of the front door of Tom's house opening sends him scurrying back into the shadows
'  come down the steps and head off across the driveway
moment later, Kurt darts out from'his hiding place and hurries across the street, toward his own house
"om, nearing the front steps of Frank's house next door, thought he heard something
He turns back, but Kurt is gone
Tom climbs the steps to Frank's house
Bouquets of flowers have been left here and there on the steps, along with a few candles and handwritten signs -- "Hang in there, Adam," "We Love You," that sort of thing
'  , Tom knocks on the front door
moment later, Frank opens it
He looks devastated, shell-shocked, his eyes sunken from crying
He's wearing a red shirt we've seen before
How's he doin'
Frank shrugs
Can't talk much
He might make it
Might not
Sheila's over there now, 'm headed back
Frank, 'm sorry
'm sorry because
think  know why Adam shot himself
And  have to call the police about it
But  don't want you to hear it from them,  don't want Sheila to read it in the paper
You have the right to know before anybody else
What are you talking about
Come with me
He nods toward his own house
Frank stares at him, frightened, but what could possibly be worse than what's already happened
Hang on a second
() no
: He turns and heads into the house
few moments later he reappears, carrying his jacket
Tom leads him across the driveway
The Damon house is visible across the street
One by one, the 'lights flick on in its windows
Tom doesi
't see
He and Frank reach the steps of his house and start up
(cont' d) This better be important
Tom doesn't answer, just opens the door and gestures for Frank to go first
In the Damon garage,  scramble frantically through drawers and come up with a handgun
Now the hands find a box of bullets, shake them out onto a workbench
The hands load the gun
& ' Tom closes and locks the front door
Frank looks at him --- well
Tom leads him toward the dining room
In the Damon house, the same hands pull on a pair of leather gloves
The gloved hands screw the top off a bottle of bourbon, raise the bottle to lips that drink heavily
Frank reacts to the ruined dining room
He looks at Tom
What the hell is goin' on around here
Tom goes to the trap door and lowers himself halfway through
Frank follows
The gloved hands carry the bottle of bourbon into the Damon living room, still under construction
The hands raise the bottle and offer it -- () 113
: -- to Kurt Damon
Harry, his father, is the one wearing the gloves
Kurt looks terrified
Drink up
You got this'started, you're God damn well gonna help finish it
Kurt takes the bottle and drinks
He starts to lower it, but his father forces him to drink more, and more, until he nearly retches
' Tom and Frank stand on opposite sides of the grave, staring down at the corpse of Samantha Muller
Frank is horrified
How did you find this
Does it matter
You don't know it was Adam and Kurt
It was
But there's nothing to
you're talking like a nut, that's what people will say
This is just a body, it doesn't prove anything
No, it doesn't
He bends down and lifts Samantha's lifeless hand
He pries open her fingers
She's clutching a tuft of hair
(cont' d) But this probably will
Frank stares for a long moment, struck dumb
Finally, he turns his back
His shoulders heave as he cries, silently
In the misty night, the figures of Harry and Kurt Damon come out of their house and skulk across the street, toward Tom's
112
Maggie drives, as fast as she can
Up ahead, red lights flash and gates fall in front of a set of railroad tracks
Train coming
Cars are stopped, waiting for it
Maggie pulls to a stop at the back of the line -- -- then thinks better of it
She drops the car in gear, hauls it around the others, and bolts for the tracks
The train, nearly upon her,  its horn
Maggie flies across the tracks and  through the gate on the other side, a split-second before the train through the intersection behind her
She cuts it hard to the right to miss the waiting cars on the other side, and pulls it back on the road
She drives on, shaking like a leaf
Frank is still sobbing, his back to Tom
Tom takes a step toward him, to comfort him
- mean
Frank, we have to- mean, what were we supposed to do
Tom stops
(cont' d) The kids come to us, she's already dead, the damage is done, there's nothin' gonna bring her back
But those boys, they've got everything ahead of them
Frank lets his jacket drop to the floor, revealing his right hand
He's holding the 38 with the carved white handle
He turns and looks at Tom

: (coast' d) What were we supposed to do
Send our boys to jail for the rest of their lives
Our own flesh and blood
Over her
E3 Hairy and Kurt Damon reach the front steps of Tom's house
They look up and down the block
There's no one out
No one to see
Frank still has the gun hanging at his side, tears streaming down his cheeks
Who you planning to shoot with that
Who do you think
think you haven't decided yet
He's right, and Frank knows it
Get out of here
What are you gonna do, Frank
Frank raises the gun, in a fury
' , Frank,  won't go until you- Frank aims the gun just to the left of Tom's head and pulls the trigger
The bullet  off the ladder
Tom starts up the ladder
114
Tom crawls out the trap door and hurries out of the dining room
" Tom races ak
ross the living room, scoops hi: truck keys off the desk, opens the front door -- and finds himself face to face with Harry Damon and his son Kurt
Harry  Tom in the face with the butt end of the gun
Tom falls to the floor, moaning
They step inside, quickly closing the door behind them
They don't speak
Kurt starts to drag Tom, who is still stunned, across the living room floor
Harry pulls a folded sheet of blue plastic from inside his jacket and spreads it out on the carpet
Kurt drags Tom into the middle of the plastic and drops him there
Tom is staring up at them, starting to regain his senses
'
Kurt does
Tom, regaining his strength, starts to struggle, but Kurt puts his knee in the middle of
Tom's back and pulls his head back
Kurt is blubbering, hysterical
(con t' d) Harry pulls the gun from his belt and raises it, putting it to the back of Tom's head
But then he lowers it, his hand shaking so hard he can barely hold onto it
He works up his nerve -- (cont'd) -- raises the gun again, puts it to the back of Tom's head, cocks it -- () 115
: and a spray of headlights splashes across the far wall of the room
Nobody moves
Outside, they hear k car pull into the driveway and park
The engine shuts off
Kurt looks at his father, panicked
Harry looks down at Tom
Tom closes his eyes and prays
Maggie-pulls the keys from the ignition and gets out of the car
She walks toward the house, looking anxiously around the neighborhood
As she reaches the steps, the light in the living room window abruptly clicks off
She stops
She starts forward again, slowly
Now the porch light clicks off
It's real dark
Maggie digs the car keys out of her pocket and feels for something on the key chain
Something that's not there
Mace
shit
She starts up the stairs
She reaches the top
The last light that was on inside clicks off
Now the house is totally black inside
Remembering something, she pulls her purse around and feels inside it
She finds the butterfly knife, the one she found in Tom's pants
She holds it in her left hand, keys in her right
She goes to the door
She unlocks the deadbolt
Inside, she hears a  sound
She unlocks the knob
She puts the keys back in her purse
() 116
: She switches the knife to her right hand, keeping it closed, concealed
She opens the door
The room is pitch black, so b:Aggie leaves the door hanging open
Some light spills in from the street
Tom
No answer
She steps inside and fumbles for a light switch
She flicks it
Nothing happens
(cont' d) Are you here
She crosses the room to another light and  its switch
As the light floods the room: Harry, who was hiding behind the front door,  it shut
Kurt Damon is still kneeling on Tom's back, holding one hand roughly over his mouth, trying to keep him quiet
(cont'd) - Harry raises the gun in his hand and points it at Maggie
She lunges toward Tom, but Harry grabs her by the arm and flings her roughly to the ground
Tom takes advantage of the moment to flip Kurt off his back
As the kid flies, Harry whirls, training the gun on Tom
'
But Tom tries to scramble to his feet
Harry starts to squeeze the trigger -- -- and  in agony
Looking down, he sees Maggie has plunged the knife into his thigh
She rips it out and plunges it in again
Harry's arm flies up, the gun goes off, and the bullet  through the ceiling
' On the second floor, in Jake's bedroom (which Jake is not in) the bullet  up through the floorboards, tears through his mattress, and bursts through the little boy's pillow
The pillow explodes in a cloud of fea-hers, which fly everywhere
Feathers everywhere
Tom crawls over to Maggie and grabs hold of her, putting himself between her and Harry, who still has the gun
Over at the fireplace, Kurt Damon pulls the poker out of its holder
Harry aims the gun
Kurt lunges forward with the poker
Two shots ring out from the doorway to the dining room
Harry clutches his chest and drops to the floor
They all turn
Frank stands in the doorway to the dining room, clutching his 38
Kurt rushes toward him, , poker raised high
Frank pulls the trigger two more times
Kurt goes down
Maggie
Tom huddles over her
Frank lets the weapon slip from his fingers
It hits the hardwood with a
Tom and Maggie look up
Frank looks at them
In that red shirt, he is exactly the image Tom saw of him in his dream
They were gonna kill you, Tommy
You and Maggie both
Frank turns and walks to the front door
He opens it, walks out onto the porch, and sits down on the top step, facing the street
Tom looks at Maggie
They're both in shock, can hardly speak
() 118
: You
okay
Maggie nods, shaking
(cont' d) You saved me
Baby, 'm alive be;ause of you
They hold each other
Tom comes out of the house
Frank, sitting on the top porch step, makes no attempt to flee
Tom sits down beside him
From all around the block, voices are starting to rise up -- "Did you hear that
" "What the hell
" "Somebody call a cop
" Frank shakes his head
Cold-blooded murder
can't let something like that happen
Not here
He looks at Tom
(con t' d) This is a decent neighborhood
few tentative faces gather across the street, staring at Tom's house, wondering what the hell
wails in the distance
thought so, Frank
sure as hell always thought so
: stares up at us from inside a rolling bassinet
The bassinet is wheeled swiftly down a hospital corridor by a It's a long trip, wherever it's going, but the baby waits patiently, staring up at the ceiling, eyes open
Above the baby, the lights streak by, white blurs
The Nurse leans down and looks at the baby
To the baby, she's just a fuzzy blob
Almost there
() 119
: The baby turns and looks sideways
The doors of the hospital rooms whiz by, brown smears
(cont' d) Just around this corner
She rolls the bassinet around a corner and toward one or in particular
The baby sees a bunch of shapes inside the room
Maggie, who has recently given birth, struggles to sit up in bad as the Nurse rolls the bassinet into the room
Tom, grinning, gets up from the chair he's sitting in with Jake
Meet the family
She picks up the baby and holds her out to Maggie, who takes her eagerly
Hi, baby, did you sleep well
sure didn't
The baby sees Maggie's face, blurry, but friendly
Tom leans in
So you're the one that's been kicking my wife
The baby sees Tom's blurry face
Jake steps up, onto a step stool, so he can see over the edge of the bed
Let me see, let me see
Maggie turns the baby so she's facing Jake
The infant looks at her older brother
At first, his face is as blurry as everybody else's
But slowly, Jake's face becomes crystal clear, even though everything around him stays out of focus
(cont' d) Can  hold her
If you're very, very careful
Climb up here
() 120
: Jake climbs up on the bed
Maggie puts some pillows around him and carefully places the baby in his lap
Jake looks down at the infant
His expression becomes very serious
Gently, he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the baby's forehead, the same way he did to Tom's forehead that first night
The baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment
So long, in fact, that the adults become uncomfortable
Well, they
certainly get along, don't they
Suddenly, Jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his parents, thrilled
Then he looks back at his sister
He leans down and whispers softly in her ear
Don't be afraid of s t
Tom and Maggie look at each other
