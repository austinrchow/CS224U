Eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street falafel

She's dressed in a professional suit
She looks very sad

Eddie is broadsided
Hurt
Just like that
She shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy

Look, 'm going to give 90 pages to Mark on Friday
If you could just wait, see what he says- Stop
You think  don't know what you do all day
've loved you know the good stuff, and  know the shit
And it's all shit to you now
You're the one living it
() Don't think  don't know it's worse for you
Then you know  could use a friend
He tries to push the key back
He cares about her, but he's also "working" her sympathy, which she instantly smells
Don't you dare try that shit on me
() 5
: She pierces Eddie with a look
Doesn't take the key
Well -- what'll work, then
They both almost laugh
They know each other so well
But she looks away, steeling herself
see where it's going
You'll lose your apartment
And then what
You'll move in with me-- Not with that enthusiastic invite-- --And then it'll go on this way, and 'll rag on you, and finally boot you out -- and then what mean, have you run the film

) She knew what was beckoning: the lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Newark
We'd even had sex on it once
And it was a thing to be pitied and avoided
Eddie sighs
Drops the glib tone
Looks at her, finally mustering the honesty she deserves
(') Lindy
really thought  had it in me to do something
-- wasn't getting around it, but it was fucking there
And now, , ah
don't think it is
There
--Anything

Lindy looks at him, clear-eyed, seeing him as he is, and loving him anyway
You know what
'd have had you move in anyway

If, what
She looks away
Its hard for her to admit this: () 6
: (2) If it was me you wanted
And not Melissa
never think about Melissa--
- We are in Eddie's mind, in his , and we are seeing a ,  , wearing an undershirt, bending seductively over him
- From Eddie's eyes we can tell the memory is still fresh
She shakes her head, looks away
It's clearly over
She gets up
He follows

--Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't tell me what happened yesterday
We can see on Lindy's face that she's still vulnerably pleased that Eddie remembered to ask

You got it--
Yeah
'll have my own assistant
You believe that
() You deserve it, Lindy
Yeah, thanks

She smiles weakly, breaks eye contact
No good to keep looking

Eddie makes an attempt to reach for the check, which Lindy grabs

the ex-brother-in- law
Shit
It's gotta be-- 9 years--
But who's counting
(taking him in) Hey, you
He genially whacks the sides of Eddie's arms
Eddie halfheartedly whacks back
Vernon sizes Eddie up
(') Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't you
() 8
: Eddie didn't need that
He's very self-conscious about his weight
Sedentary job, you know
So you're still trying to write
As a matter of fact, 've got a book contract
Vern looks half suspicious, half impressed
(') How about you
() Still dealing, Vernon
() Do  look like 'm still dealing
Eddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut
No
Come on, let's get a drink
wanna hear about this book
Nah,  should go-- You can't tell me you're a health nut, now
Not with that tire- () Enticing invitation
Thanks
Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket pocket
'mon, c'mon, one beer
Or  won't give `em back
He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach

: (2) It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern
When's that ever stopped you
() Fuck
- brings beers to Eddie and Vernon who sit at the bar
Eddie clearly wishes he were elsewhere
So
how's Melissa
Ah-hah
That's why you agreed to the beer
'm making conversation, Vern
Well,  don't know how Melissa is
-  (   ) Melissa, naked, silhouetted in the bathroom door
: - How don't you know
You're her brother
don't see her
She lives upstate now, she's got some kinda internet home sales kinda job
a couple of kids
This is unfathomable to Eddie
He tries to keep his voice casual
couple of kids
10
- Melissa, her lovely face over a mirror, doing lines
: - Who's the husband
What are you, jealous
It's just a question, Vern
Vernon can sense his emotion
Walked out on her, if you really want to know
But what do you care
You guys weren't even married six months, were you--
mean, it was just a coke thing, right
Is that what she said--
" coke thing
" It unexpectedly hurts Eddie
Maybe it's just a bummer day
Or there's a deeper wound than he knew
But  wanna know about this book
How's it going
(considering the question) How's it going
Well
'm behind
'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know
How much have you written of it
beat
Not one fucking word, Vern
() 11
: Wow
Creative problem, huh
Vern appraises him
(') think  have something that can help you
He reaches into his pocket
Eddie thinks he knows what's coming
Oh, no-- no, no, no- You don't even know what it is
You're still dealing
No -- yeah --will you listen
This isn't recreational
've been doing some consulting for a -- You mean a lab in some little Yalie's basement
Give me a-- No, this is an exclusive product coming on-stream next year, they've had clinical trials, and it's approved

Eddie bites
Okay, what is it
Vern reaches into his jacket, produces a tiny plastic sachet with his right hand, tapping something out into the palm of his left
He holds this up for Eddie to see
a (') What's in it
Vern puts the little white tablet on the bar
() 12
: (2) Just take it
Get you over the hump
'm too old for this, Vernon
Look, they've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits, and-- you know how they say you can only access like 20 percent of your brain
Well, what this does-- Vernon
Look at me
Do  look good
smoke too much: my chest is sore
fucking corpse has more energy than  do, 've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions
One of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and 'll keel over dead
My life's in the crapper, and ' think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if  do some brand new, shiny designer
Vern's phone rings
He holds up his index finger --shh
-and takes the call
( ) Gant
(beat, getting agitated) When
-- know, but when
(looking at his watch) Tell him we can't do that
He knows that's out of the question
We absolutely can't do that
Vern is edgy
Very tense
He continues: (') No, 'm not going to tell him
You tell him -- no, now
He turns off his phone, gets up
() 13
: (3) (') Fucking people
'm afraid 'm going to have to leave you here, Eddie
But let's hang out again, have another beer
He takes out his business card, and places it carefully next to the little white tablet on the bench
(') By the way, that's on the house
don't want it, Vern
Vern smiles at him
Don't be ungrateful, now
You know how much these things cost
Eddie shakes his head
(') Eight hundred bucks a pop
He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes
Eddie is still looking at the pill
Which seems to be looking back at him
- Eddie makes his way home, a little tipsy and filled with self- loathing
(
) All the way home she was back on my mind
Melissa
memory -- Melissa's face as she's talking, laughing
(
) She'd been so smart
Smarter than anyone around her
And oh, how she loved to provoke people

-  - Melissa, sparkling, beautiful, surrounded by people, in intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types
--Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another
You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers
--Those bitches hate each other
Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had
woman, right
We can't delegate, we can't command --  mean, there's a reason we're not generals--
The men gasp, shocked and titillated
The women are furious
Melissa smiles to herself --she's trying not to crack up

We   ' ,   as her voice fades down and Eddie's fades in

Her life made no sense

She's clearly terminal

This block may never be gentrified

" He digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with
'  -  - It's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up
Eddie trudges up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years of paint
Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible smoker's cough that makes him double over
He sounds like he's 80 years old
He finally gets it under control, gets a glimpse of himself in the storefront window
He looks bad, and he knows he looks bad
He reaches into his pocket
sits teasingly in the palm of his hand, looking up at him
(
0
) Well
There was less than nothing to lose
Quickly, impulsively, he swallows it

Eddie tries walking faster

You could be a bike messenger and come up with that

But she follows, getting in front of him

oh my God
listening to her rag, if  were tripping

--Look, 'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out -- 've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed

felt it
'  -
The room is changing
springing into sharper focus
(

) Levels more, layers more, 3- more
galactically more
But the same
Just the depth and beauty
of clarity
There seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little more light -- he can see more clearly
The  drops out for a moment; he can see ' , mouth contorted, continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her eyes that's not mean
something anxious
He looks at her with a sudden keen intelligence
And sympathy

She's taken aback
-What
His eyes go to    in her arms
" was blind but now  see
" () 18
: On a gut instinct, Eddie takes a shot, pushing his words forward with a new, sharp, penetrating intimacy, articulateness
(') You don't like me, and  don't blame you -- you see a schlumpy energy- sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband
You're hoping 'll blow my brains out
But my existence shouldn't make you this upset
What is it
He's hit a nerve
Look, that's none of your- Something wrong at school
How do you know 'm in school
His eyes flick down at her bag
People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange
Are you some kind of creep
Have you been following me
just saw the book-- You can only see a corner of it
How did you know
He looks down
She's right --only a corner of the book is visible
Eddie realizes: 've seen it before
(

) (') It was true
12 years ago
In college

hoping she'd have a condom

) Somehow, my unconscious had served that up
a memory 'd never even recorded
Or was it there the whole time
and all  needed
was the access
'  - As it sinks in: (

) Vern was right
This was no recreational drug
Eddie's eyes flick to the laptop in her bag, his manner suddenly intimate, confident
(') If you're writing a paper, that's not the book 'd use
Well, who asked y- Cal Berkeley has her oral history
'd start there
Her son is still alive
You could Google him
Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents
You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor
During this speech,    and the sound goes down
() 20
: Eddie and Valerie's mouths are moving
she's asking questions
he's supplying answers, lots of them
(

) (') Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some documentary, was all bubbling up to my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information
Valerie's whole posture is relaxing, the look in her eyes becoming
friendly

' - mirror image of Eddie's, but considerably nicer
We the  of two people -- Valerie and Eddie --  , mutually satisfying  from the other room

) We'd really worked on her paper, too
In 45 minutes it was a polished gem
She was pleased
We see the laptop set up, books scattered -- then, obviously abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit

) (') One nice little side effect stayed hard for hours
We  female groans of pleasure
Laughter
'  - dishevelled Eddie opens the door to his apartment
He enters, looks around
(
) Happy and sore,  returned home
'  - It's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers home: what a mess
Books scattered across the floor, dirty dishes, broken Venetian blind sashes
The nest of a slob
() 21
: (

) But it couldn't be my home, could it
Who would live like this
: Speeded-up shots of Eddie sifting through his books and tapes
Cleaning up the kitchen
The bathroom
Picks up books
He starts moving the sofa
: the living room, rapidly whipped into shape
If not stylish, habitable
Final shot: he's sitting on the (repositioned) couch

Abstemious and tidy

What  needed to do
And how to do it
His eye falls on his
The  : Eddie flipping through research books, typing onto his keyboard, the printer printing, doing Internet searches
pages and pages spit out of the printer
'  - Eddie, in his underwear, is sleeping soundly
He stirs, rolls over, cracks open an eye
He gets up, schlumps to the mirror, looks at his unshaven face
The penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes

No surge of brilliance came up to greet me

'  - Eddie drops      on the desk of Mark looks skeptically at Eddie, then the pages
You're kidding
No
() Words have appeared on paper
Yes
Written by you
Eddie knows he's on thin ice
Three pages
That's all you have to read
If you read them in the next hour, and you don't want to keep reading 'll give back the advance
- Eddie standing on the street, the crowd flowing around him
He turns this way and that, clearly anxious, impatient
Where to go
What to do to kill the time
23
-  -  : 1
Eddie orders a  from a food cart
He is having to dig into his pockets to come up with the change
The becomes so impatient he won't give him the pretzel, and serves another customer first
Eddie looks at Makes sure it's on
No call

Eddie sits on a stoop, slowly nibbling on his pretzel, his eye glued to his phone
No call
3
Eddie tosses the finished pretzel's wrapper and in frustration
Eddie jumps up, fumbles with his phone just as a passing male    pulls out his phone and answers
The ring wasn't for Eddie
'  - Eddie comes in, then notices something's different
His has a blinking red light
Eddie clicks the button, breathless
' Eddie
give me a call when you get in
() The second message is from Mark too
'  (') Eddie, 'm 40 pages further in
call me
it's a little grandiose, but 'm still reading
third message -
'  (') Okay, how did you do this
'd, uh, 'd really like to -- shit, just call me the minute you get in, call
Okay
Okay
(
) Eddie jumps up, gleeful-- he knew it
Then his smile fades
Reality hits
(
) But how would  finish
It was "enhanced" Eddie who displayed all that brilliance
Not me
'   - Eddie, holding Vern's card, buzzes the buzzer
There's no answer
Eddie buzzes again and again
Finally: () 24
: ' () Yeah
Vern
It's Eddie
' Bad time, okay--
Vern -- last night 90 pages just wrote themselves
totally chucked the novel  pitched them -- suddenly , Vern, how this whole societal economic class struggle -- and its solution -- didn't have to be futuristic or fictional -- it was actually  here, in our lifetime -- and  could just lay it out, like, like a manifesto, or something, like Mein Kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck
(no response, realizing) Okay,  won't talk any more about this if you let me in
The buzzer buzzes
'   - The door opens
And Eddie is taken aback
Vern has been beaten up
Really worked over
His lip is split, his face puffy and bruised
His right hand is bandaged
Well, that was fast
- Don't ask
Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie with his left hand to come in
The place is all mismatched antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell
Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated
(') So, Eddie
guess you're interested after all
() 25
: Yeah
That stuff's amazing
It works better if you're already smart
Eddie can't get over how bad Vernon looks
- You don't want to know
And Eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what happened
What's
um
what's it called
It doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile
And that's the way we want it to stay
The boys in the kitchen are calling it -48
"The boys in the kitchen
" Vern, that doesn't sound  approved
"-approved," that's a laugh
Did you really believe that shit
Eddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee
(
0
) Okay, so what did we have here
Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere, given to me by a highly unreliable guy hadn't seen in years
So you want some more of it
Yes
Definitely
Vern chuckles
He knew it
() 26
: (2) We'll talk about it
But first maybe you can do me a little favor
Uh
sure
Eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but Vern clearly has him by the balls
You can see, 'm in no shape to go out right now
Will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit
And maybe pick me up a little breakfast
Eddie sighs
Vern tosses him a set of

(

) the easy sacrificing of dignity for the guaranteed return of a dime bag, or a gram, or in this case a little pill that was going to cost me a month's rent
He arrives at Vernon's door
He takes out the keys Vern gave him, but he doesn't need them
The  is
27
'  -  - ' As Eddie pushes the door open, he can see Vernon sitting, quite normally, on the couch
As he enters the room, though, he sees that the place has been
Destroyed
Eddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck
And then sees it
'  - In the center of his forehead is a neat little
is no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow
He starts shaking
then, seized with horror that they might still be in here, he edges to the bedroom
We hear as he peeks in
'  - ' It's been ransacked, too
Torn to shreds, bureau drawers opened and dumped, pillows ripped open with knives
But no one is there
'  - Eddie's shaking hand can barely hold the phone
Yes
need to report a murder
Eddie
Morgan
--Edward
won't
He puts down the phone, puts his head in his hands
: Eddie sitting
Shifting his butt in various positions
Holding a   he's found --just in case "they" come back

And the longer  sat there, the clearer saw
Vern had known whoever had done this
He'd opened the door

) And one guess what they'd been looking for
28
'  - Eddie, cleverly wearing kitchen gloves, is now furiously tearing through the rubble the thieves have left behind, the scattered clothes, under the bed
- Eddie pokes quickly through the medicine cabinet -- nothing but Tylenol
'   - Eddie sits on the couch with (dead) Vern, staring at him, as if a corpse could give up a secret
He looks down at ' At least you got your last meal
There are lots of takeout containers around
(') You never did like to cook
Eddie's eye falls on '
Unlike the rest of the kitchen area, it's pristine
Unspattered
Eddie jumps up
'  - Eddie opens it
The inside is as clean as the outside
We now -- the cops are finally coming, and Eddie must rush
Eddie pulls out - Taped to the inside is
Slowly, Eddie pulls out the package, reaches into it
'  - He is holding about    in cash
But that's not all
He reaches in again
there's something else inside
Eddie's hand pulls out a
But there's still something else
he reaches in again
And now Eddie's hand pulls out      - he pries the seal off
Inside are Eddie      , voices
Making a decision, he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket, jumps down from the chair
pushes through the door
() 29
: He sees Eddie, spins,    right at him
Let me see your hands
Eddie throws his arms in the air
Heyheyhey
'm the one that called you
- Eddie sits, making his statement to an overweight
No, ex-wife's brother
just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to, you know
The Detective looks at him suspiciously
Buy some drugs
Wha-- No

Something good, eh

If all this comes off

You should have pre-negotiated

You shouldn't
Eddie returns Van Loon's look coolly, implying that it really might be in Van Loon's best interest to trust him
Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty
Let's say forty- five
Done
Forty five thousand dollars

Forty million's plenty, Eddie
There's plenty more where this came from
He tries to read Eddie's smile which is removed, far away

Eddie opens his mouth

Eddie has to look away from her, biting his lip
He can't show her any sign of sticker shock
The face he turns back to her is composed, even blase
He shrugs -- no problem
We see an almost sexual excitement dance in her eyes

Eddie comes in
The room has been completely ripped to pieces -- just like Eddie's apartment

Gennady's security guys reach into their jackets

Gennady laughs, an unpleasant sound

But it's not necessary
Gennady's eyes are glazing
His gurgling gets quieter
He's quite dead
Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him, suddenly weak and exhausted
