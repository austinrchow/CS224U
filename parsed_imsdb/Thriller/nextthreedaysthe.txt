--                                        2 Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert,  and on one side,  and  on the other is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem
You have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you
He is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd
looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit
She appears to have had a hard day at the office
She's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves
John's good-looking brother, , boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, , who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions
and  are laughing
Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card
You know what
If you were smart you would stop talking right now
Sue me
just know that women should never work for women
John laughs and applauds
Mick buries his head
How can you say that
They're always threatened
Especially if you're beautiful and they're not
Erit, you are so full of shit
So, your boss isn't threatened by you

2   :                                                       2 Because she's a bitch
-- (as John and Mick laugh) --Not because she's a woman
And you would describe her as "attractive"
That has nothing to do with it
And there is my answer
Either of you like another drink
Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory
Women should work under men, men under women
That's it
(egging her on) But men under men
That's fine, too
(the men burst into laughter) They're used to it
Why are you laughing
(re: Erit) don't know, bro, but  think 'd rather work under you than her
(insulted, shoots back) Oh please, 'd rather work under him, too
That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight
You'd rather "work under" John
You have a problem with that, too

2   :    (2)                                                   2 No, why would  have a problem with your little sexual innuendo
What is up your ass tonight
Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is going to explode" look
John feigns complete innocence
So,  shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me
(claws out now) Lara, if  wanted your husband would have him
How
You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits
The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged
-- You know what your problem is
That was a great meal
Okay--okay

--                                3 Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup
John and Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming
She is completely full of shit
' try and agree with me now
You know what
don't even believe she is in the dental profession
Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her black mood, and she has no intention of letting him
Shut up

Woman's a complete fraud
We went to her office party, idiot
think she hit on me that night, too
Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in the raincoat she was carrying
They climb in, under
You are completely delusional
She wasn't even hitting on you in there; just don't like her
understand
People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery
She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it away
You are such an asshole
You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your-- She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she stops him short by kissing him passionately
His hands slip under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater
(') Someone's going to -- Her hand goes to his pants
He yanks at the seat lever and it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him
After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors
She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other

, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them
(') Did he cry
Only when  dropped him down the stairs
Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs

-                                     5 She peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly
6
-                                               6 Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna
John nods for her to check the mirror
She tugs at the knot in her hair
Thanks
See you next weekend
Jenna exits
Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out
John reacts: "Oh God
" Lara's smile broadens; she kisses him
He pins her to the wall and they start all over again
He feels for the light switch
He finds it; we cut to

'  --                                    7 Lara wakes, troubled
It's the middle of the night

'  --                                                8 Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked
She locks it and looks out
Satisfied, she sits and watches her son sleep

--                                               9 Three year-old  holds a knife and fork as he sits at the table watching his dad cut up his pancakes
Okay, your turn
Luke skewers a piece with his fork
Lara passes, hustling to get to work
(') Very good, very good

(') No, no, no; you feed me
(to Lara) Your son is hopeless
Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo
Squeeze in tight
You can't do this every morning
It is way too corny
Smile
It's just until he's eighteen
It flashes
Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go
(') Present
(examining it) Sweetie, you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue
You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes them in thirty seconds
(as if stung) love brushing my teeth
(to Luke) The lies your mother tells
(ignoring him) When's your last class
Three, and  have papers to grade
Can you pick up Luke
After yesterday  probably don't have a job anyway
Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow

9    :    (2)                                               9 Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange
(pulls note off fridge) Did you call your father
When
(heading for bathroom) "When
" Yesterday, for his birthday

-                                    10 Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin
(
) sent him flowers and a handmade card
You're completely impossible
(
) Did you notice what  got for my birthday this year
grunt
11
-                                     11 Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went Made me tear up
Lara returns, trying hard not to smile
Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here
(to Luke) Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy
How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you
Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer
() 8
11   :                                                        11 Now she's driving a wedge between us
give up
And now she is abandoning you
Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back shoulder
Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom
12
-                            12 Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it run red
She looks at her hands: blood
The doorbell rings
13
-                                       13 John rises to answer the door
14
-                            14 Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood on her shoulder
She rubs liquid soap into it
15
-                                         15 As John opens the door,   shows his badge
and a team of detectives push past
John has no time to react
Police
Mr
Brennan
sees the police rush past him and gets scared
(') My name is Detective Quinn
This is a search warrant for these premises
John hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside
(') (stops him) Stay where you are
Get your -- Touch me again and you'll be arrested

-                                     16 Lara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero
She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member, who takes it and bags it under: Lara Brennan
Lara Brennan, you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas
She takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her
She's dead
Elizabeth is dead
17
-                                           17 (tries to push past) She didn't do anything
will only -- (tries again) She didn't do anything
Put him in cuffs
The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his wrists
John watches as his child cries, his wife is led out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart
Cut to

--                                          18 (
) Daddy
light comes on
John steps out of his bedroom and enters his son's room
(
) It's okay
Just a bad dream
He comes back out carrying Luke, now  -

'  --                                      19 John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him
You okay
Luke nods
(') Okay, you can sleep here as long as you stay on this side of the bed
Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side
(') You're such a snake,  don't know why keep falling for the same trick
John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow
John reaches for the lamp
Beside it sits the framed photo that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning
He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes

--                                            20 The "," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from underground and we   to see the city
(
) But Sam's your friend, right
21
--                                 21 Tilt down from a passing -Train to find John and Luke, walking toward the huge, modern Allegheny County Jail
Not at lunch
Does he take your food
No
Did he say something mean
(Luke nods) About Mommy
() 11
21   :                                                        21 Yeah
Did you hit him
Yeah
Good
Where did you hit him
Near the swings
Wow
bet that hurt
Yeah
22
-   --                               22 - John waits in a long line, mostly women
He glances over at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and sees children playing
Luke plays by himself
- John puts his key ring in a plastic container
The guard takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings
John guides his son toward the metal detector
Luke walks through and the buzzer goes off
John instinctively moves forward to help
guard stops him with a hand on his chest
On the other side of the metal detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something from his pocket, looks at it curiously
It's a toy
The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech
The guard waves John through
No beep
John kneels and pulls on Luke's jacket
(') Don't worry
We'll get it back
23
-  --                                 23 They walk along the hall with all the other visitors
12
24
-    --                       24 John stares out the window at the city beyond
Life seems so close
He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen round tables and plastic chairs
The concrete block walls are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages of hope
Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos
The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and prisoners in red jump-suits marked   enter
Lara enters and looks around
She is pale, thin and her hair has returned to its natural color
Lara hurries to him and gives him a real kiss
She breaks and steps to Luke, who plays with his back to her
Hi honey
Can Mommy get a kiss
(no response
Tickles him) Come on, give Mommy a kiss
Rat-Bag
Give Mommy a kiss
He gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his Legos
Is Daddy reading you my letters
Every night at bedtime
What are you building
fort
Lara pulls him into a hug; no response
She kisses his head and sits at the table with John
She squeezes his hand
(') Was he scared going to school
walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave
What did you make him for lunch
() 13
24   :                                                       24 Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no "vegetables" on it
He swore he ate his apple
He hands her a pack of photos
Lara devours them
Look at his friends
And his desk
This is his teacher
Miss Phillips
You may have to move to another school district
Already spoke to a realtor
(still looking at photos) How was your first day
Excellent
Over half my class stayed awake
Talked to your mom
When is she coming
She's having a lot of trouble with her business
It's only been a couple of years, 'm sure she'll get around to it
(beat) Have you heard anything
About the appeal
Yes, and 'm just not telling you
What did Meyer say
--Don't-- -- It can take months for the court to rule
() 14
24   :    (2)                                                 24 saw that woman
She was there
She couldn't have just disappeared
Meyer's looking for a new investigator
Her coat snagged my purse,  felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it
He'll go through all the evidence again
Great, because  haven't quite bankrupted us yet
We're doing fine
(fondly) You just lie and lie
(strokes his face) But you are very handsome
(admiring him) Can you do me a favor
don't know, 'm a little busy
need you to run for governor
-- Oh, that  can do
You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because  don't think  can last another twenty years
She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place
He reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back
(') 'm okay
'm okay
() 15
24   :    (3)                                               24 know
But it's going to be fine
promise
She just stares at Luke, his back to them, playing
You think he'll ever want to kiss me again
25
-    --                25 The prisoners file out and are patted down
Lara turns and blows Luke and John a kiss
They watch with the other visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room
26
-   --                 26 Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump- suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for contraband
Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls it on over her underwear
Another small, daily humiliation
27
'  --                                    27 Start    '
Widen to see Luke standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a complicated-looking electric toothbrush
John sits on the toilet, staring at his watch
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty
Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror
(') Good
Luke nods
28
-    --                 28 The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it
John backs out, Luke in his child seat
He brakes and finds , the woman who lives behind them, at his window
How's Lara
She's doing okay
() 16
28   :                                                         28 Tell her we're pulling for her
will
She holds up a plastic water bottle
They won't recycle these unless you take off the cap
(cap vs
bottle) This is trash
This is recyclable
Ok
Thanks
John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in
29
--                                                    29 Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash over his face
He watches Luke play with a girl his age
Luke
Let's go, Toad
Come on
Luke runs to him
John pulls Luke's jacket on
He doesn't notice the young mother on the next bench, , watching him admiringly
She calls to the girl Luke was playing with
Time to go, Carrie
John glances in time to see  plop down in the sand, arms folded
He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who heads to retrieve her daughter
John walks off with Luke
30
--                                     30 John waits as a courtroom lets out
steps out with a young associate
He spots John and approaches
John,  said my office at four o'clock
can't leave, 'm in -- (holds up a Subway bag) figured you had to eat
Meyer relents, turns and calls to his associate
() 17
30   :                                                      30 Do you have the ruling in Brennan
She kneels and digs through her rolling briefcase
31
--                                31 John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the ruling
The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at his desk
During this he gets up and walks out past them
But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot
The  was rejected
No new evidence can be submitted
Not anymore
It was a robbery
Someone stole her purse
And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue
'm sorry; this really
sucks
John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words
So, that's it
Now we just have the Supreme Court
John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case
No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings
So,  need to find an indecent one
No, 'm going to file it
But need you to do something for me
Anything
() 18
31   :                                                        31 need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife
(stopped by that) 've seen the evidence, Meyer
'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, 'm just saying look at it
He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon-- (is this a bad joke
) We went out for dinner
How do you do that after you kill somebody
She would have to be a psychopath
-- And the fight in the office
Everyone fights with their boss
But this one ended up dead
John looks at Meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed
So, you never believed she was innocent
How can you say that
So, what are you saying, Meyer
That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out
And you have no idea how much  hate saying that
(exiting) 'll find someone to file the pleadings
() 19
31   :    (2)                                                   31 John
Come on
For Christ's sake
John is long gone
Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash
32
-   --                            32 John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass
The door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side
John smiles and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him
John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his face
Lara gasps and cries inconsolably
John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears run down his cheeks
He taps on the glass and points at her phone, but she doesn't respond
He taps harder and harder -- desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it
He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention of the guard on his side
Lara turns and exits
John stands and yells her name, but she can't hear it, and neither can we
33
'  --                                 33 We're in an old working class neighborhood
John sits in his car, trying to pull himself together

, their mother, looks up from clearing the lunch dishes
John's face tells them everything they need to know
Mick slams his fist against the door
In the back yard with Luke, , John's father turns to see Grace tearfully embrace John
George looks away, uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention
35
'  -   --           35 John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the back porch
Erit steps out with beers to replace their empties
She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and George play with the dog
After a moment Erit looks to John: know you won't want to hear this
() 20
35   :                                                       35 -- Erit, go put somebody to sleep
She stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff
Thanks
Had to be done
(long beat) am really going to pay for that
John has to smile
36
--  ()                           36 John drives through a rough part of town on their way home
He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver
He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches John staring
John looks away quickly and drives off
37
'  --                                      37 John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and photographs
As John sifts through the evidence

stands at her car door in a small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots
She turns toward camera -- comes right at camera, making a terrible impact and collapses to the floor

uniformed female prison guard looks up from her magazine and keeps her eyes on John
He looks to his wife, who's attached to an

Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive
He kneels beside her and puts a hand on the bed

John reads him a letter, the yellow envelope open on the bed

Lots and lots of love, Mommy

He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug
He places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer crammed with tools and screws and tape and such
He rummages through it
Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on the counter
The harder he searches the more he becomes frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the counter, feeling destroyed and needy
And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another drawer and reaches in
John stares at the hand, afraid to move, afraid to look up
The hand finds a tube of glue, places it on the counter and moves away
John turns to see  walking away
She turns, smiling and shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room
Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room
No sign of her
And she isn't in the living room
He bolts into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar
He flings it open

He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at a time and discards each in turn
As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer screen linked to the school system
: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by the school search engine -- many of the items have already been inspected

His words are drowned out
The bartender gives him a beer on tap
John asks for "Hart
" The bartender nods to a man at the back who is playing a video game
John walks off, passing a - at the bar who watches him
John approaches
Mouss said to come see you
He did, did he
What do you want
Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number
How do you know Mouss
He babysits my kid
(sizes him up, then:) Okay
Harv gives him a look; nods for him to follow

They see his face, try and hide their reactions
You did remember  was showing the house
Give me two minutes

'  --                              115 John sits as Grace approaches with iodine and cotton balls
Through the window he sees Luke playing with the dog
It was stupid,  fell off the bike
The bike that's been in our garage for two years
Put your head back
Some guy made a crack about Lara
So, that's what you do now: punch everyone who thinks she's guilty
What's that supposed to mean
It means it's important what believe, not -- Really
So, what do you believe, Mom
John stands and opens the back door
Why are you trying to start a fight
(calling out back door) Come on, buddy
(to his mother) Where is his bag
Why are you doing this
Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears
No reason
just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent
My mistake

John turns and sees  standing in the open doorway
He has heard everything
He gives his son a dismissive look and walks off towards his bedroom
John feels like a heel
(to Luke) Give Grandma a kiss
Luke does, and the two of them leave with his bag

John pulls away

He sees Mouss' parked car and slows; Mouss stares at him
John flashes his middle finger and drives on
Mouss considers doing something but just flips him off

As he returns to his car, he doesn't notice , the long-haired guy from Drake's Bar, watching from astride his motorcycle

John pulls out and the motorcycles follow at a distance

He rings the bell again
John runs and snatches a kitchen knife, returns to the door, secures the chain lock and opens the door a crack
What
Mike speaks in a loud, atonal and unnerving voice
was at the bar
know what you are looking for
Caught off guard by the voice, John just stares at him

Three passports, a driver's license and social security number that can take a credit check
Thirty seven hundred

Mike stares at him
John stares back
Parking lot of Don's

As he looks up, he sees    staring in the window, his helmet still on
John's heart almost stops
The rider

The guy hands John a 9MM handgun wrapped in a oilcloth

Show me how to load it

First, find any key that fits into the same make of lock

The key won't turn

The lock opens

People avoid looking at his face
One woman can't help noticing
John nods and smiles
He pushes the elevator button and notices the name:

Two children play in the set that is used to teach them how to speak to a prisoner behind glass using a phone

She is a
Mr
Brennan

And just put your thumb there
And Lara puts her thumb print on the book
(') Thanks, that's all  need
The notary heads for the door
John turns to the female guard who is waiting
'll just be a moment
He turns back to his wife
(touching him, melting) Your poor face
How could you do that to yourself
am useless without you
can't even ride a bike

But you should have told me before this

don't want you not telling me things

Knowing he isn't paying attention, a  angles his multiple choice test so that his friend behind can see the answers

He slips inside and finds a rack with keys
He takes one from the hook marked

He turns to see Paula standing in the open garage door

was wondering if  could ask you to water my plants next week; 'm going in for an operation
hope it's nothing serious
My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me
He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him
But 'll be fine

And she walks off
John gets in the car and slips the gun between the seats

Checks his watch: 1:49
car pulls in
The guy sits there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant

He looks around, knowing he is supposed to leave
He makes a call
(
) English Department, this is Catherine
Hi
It's John
Luke isn't feeling well, 'm going to take him home need Carl to cover my 2:30 class

) will let him know

His cell phone rings, displays the name ; John presses
He feels for the gun between the seats
143
'   -  --                      143 The guy comes out of the restaurant
John watches him walk to his car
The man sees him and stares back
John checks his watch

The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty

(
) Are you ever going to answer your goddamn phone
Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John realizes  has pulled up without him noticing
His hand goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the pulls up to the passenger window
You were supposed to leave
need them
You notice that guy was a cop
Which guy
The one with the red light in his back window
John feels ridiculous
Mike hands him the documents
(') Just give me the money
John hands him the envelope of money
Mike checks it
(') You want this too much
You're going to fuck it up
Mike speeds off
The second rider gives John a look and follows
John looks over the passports with their new names

-  --                             144 Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging his lunch pale
John watches him go, then reaches down beside his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth
He hides it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing
145
-   --                                 145 John moves through the line toward the metal detector
He takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and () 50

He steps through the metal detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can get to it
He hands the dish to the guard
How are you doing today
Don't touch that
Sorry
John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone -- John palmed it
The guard dumps John's key ring on the counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors
pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail
146
-  --                                  146 John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors
He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard ahead
By the time the group stops for the door ahead to open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator
He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing and feels for the slot
Finding it, he slips in the bump key
It fits
The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting room and the crowd starts moving again
John quickly bumps the key and turns it -- but it won't turn
He bumps it again
Visitors keep moving past him
He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is preoccupied at the door
He turns it harder
Nothing
He tries to pull it out
It's stuck
John panics
The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd
John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and snaps it off in the lock
among the visitors sees what he is doing but averts her eyes
John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the slot between the elevator and the shaft
He slips back into the crowd and moves on
Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to the visiting room

John rounds the corner into the visiting room
The camera stays on his face until we finally hear
147
-   --                          147 John waits in a line against the wall, beside a door to a small office
Through the glass he watches the interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing
She nods and leaves, passing him with a look
The Major holds the door open for him
148
'  --                           148 The  plays John the  video from the corridor
He flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall
The crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms obscures the view of the elevator
So, you are where in here
In the middle there
In the middle
Can you point to yourself
(looks) It's hard to tell
think that's me there
Why
He freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the background
So that's not you there
By the elevator
(looks) No
(points to another person) was over here
You want to tell me what's going on
You want me to tell you

The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock
You know what a bump key is
Sorry
Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John
Finally: If this was you, you might want to think about what's going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison
The major stares right through him
149
-  --                                 149 John heads toward the exit, accompanied by a guard
As he nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step ladder, holding a new  camera
150
-   --                               150 Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge to run
The door opens just before he gets there and Collero steps in, Quinn holding the door for her
John charges past, noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him
Quinn turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby and vomits
-- The worst date you've ever been on
This was worse
And this guy
He really thinks he is doing great
Then he's driving me home and  know he's going to try and kiss me, so pretend to fall asleep
mean, 'm actually snoring, right in his car
Does that stop him
John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him
They lock eyes
Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying attention and wonders what he's looking at
(') What

Quinn keeps watching
Did  tell you not to date cops
Collero's eyes find John as well
He disappears around the corner

He checks over his shoulder to make sure he isn't being followed
152
--                                            152 John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room
His head turns as he hears someone  on the front door
He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun; dismisses the idea
Then he hears the voice: his brother
(
) Let me in, asshole
153
-   --                       153 Mick bangs again
(
) Open up
(more banging) Your car is in the garage,  know you're in there
154
--                                     154 John doesn't move
As we pull back we see that the living room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of furniture, save an old  set sitting on a box
John knows he can't let his brother see this
The   in the house to the south opens his door and looks out and scowls
What's your problem
He's not home
Not home
So you're saying 'm blind
No, 'm saying you're an idiot

Then just gives up
You know what
You're right
am an idiot
And he walks off to his car

--                                        155 John leans back against the wall, in the middle of the bare room, and listens to his brother's car start and drive away

Luke trots up
Can  have my cookies
You hungry
You want your sandwich
No
John hands him two packaged cookies
Luke runs off and hands them to Carrie
Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention
Carrie

She just already has it all figured out

(smiles and admits) remember your daughter
She's hard to forget
(digs in her bag) Oh, this is for you
Luke was supposed to bring it home
Hands him an envelope
He opens it and sees a birthday invitation with jungle animals on the cover
He has his father's memory
It's for Carrie's birthday party
Please come; 'd love to meet your wife
'm afraid she can't be there
It's complicated
understand
With me, too
Carrie, come on, time for lunch
(to John) We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us
Oh, we're pretty
you know
Busy
John smiles, busted
(') Come on, we owe you for the cookies
That's true
And  made those cookies
And learned how to pre-package them

Come on, Luke
They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind
Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment
Do you trade off time with Luke
No

David stands above him on the porch, holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is no way he wouldn't see him
John holds his     breath and waits
The porch light flicks off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens
As before, the     two exchange words, but now the  in John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else

He checks the closet -- empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here
John turns to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag on the floor half-filled with cash
John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into the trash bag
205
'  -   --                         205 The dog barks; the door

Don't leave me
don't want to burn
Don't let me burn
The hall is now thick with smoke
John stares terrified at the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he knows is a mistake

'  --                             208 John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into the back seat
He throws the trash bag into the passenger seat and slams the door closed behind him
Not even a heartbeat later    leaps up and snaps at the partially open window
John struggles to get the car turned on and the window up as   tries to force his way into the car
Through the front windshield he sees   leap over the back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun
John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the car, the thug getting off a shot

209
--                                           209 John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant and shattering a taillight
210
-  --                                  210 John slams the transmission into Drive and speeds off down the street
The dog barking disappears
All that's left are the sounds of the dying man
John keeps throwing looks over his shoulder
don't want to die
don't want to die
Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the back seat
We don't have to see the body to know he's dead
John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of approaching fire engines
He catches a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror before pulling out

--                                              211 John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open
He steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes the door and gets in
As he drives away we see David's body lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered
212
-  --                              212 Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the wound in his side
He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies a bandage, fresh from the box
He pulls a new shirt and jacket from a Target bag
moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full of cash into his backpack
213
--                                       213 John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket
He barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out of the restaurant

strides into shot, drinking a Red Bull, which he crushes and discards on the porch

'  -   --                      215 Nabulsi climbs the stairs to find
watching the team work
Nabulsi steps up behind the  worker
(almost a whisper) Get out of my way
The man flees like he just saw the prince of darkness
Nabulsi cocks his head and looks down at the dead man
(') What do we have
miracle
Meth lab in the basement, the house still standing
Should be just a crater
(straddles Alex) Do we know him
Alex Gaidar, history of violence and drug trafficking
Nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room
He have a kid
Neighbor said wife left with him last year
Big surprise there
They type all this blood yet
No, but someone left through the back door bleeding
Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit bench
Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs

216
--                                       216 John snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns and walks back to the Prius
217
'  --                              217 John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key from the lock
It's the middle of the night, so he is surprised to see a light on in the kitchen
He enters, carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair
When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas, reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea
Hi
What are you doing up
George shrugs
An uncomfortable silence
(') 've come to get Luke
George nods
After another silence, John starts down the hall
His father appears in the hallway behind him
John
Are you alright
John turns around, surprised
'm fine
The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the room
His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket falling off the chair
George lifts it to set it right and sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane tickets and passports
218
'   --                                  218 John steps into the room that he had as a teenager
Luke sleeps in the single bed
John sits beside him, touches his face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here, and is overwhelmed
219
'   --                   219 George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket
We do not see the destination, but he does
He opens the passport and reads each of the false names

220
'   --                                220 John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like this
He tries to wake Luke
Hey
Hey, buddy
Not a chance
John checks the old alarm clock: it's just after three
He lies down beside Luke for just a moment
221
'   --                                     221 John  to the sound of a whistle
He checks the clock
It's almost five
How could that have happened
222
'  --                          222 John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in his hand
John stands from the table strewn with food
What do you say
Thank you
Give Grandma a big kiss
'm too tired to kiss
Luke
'll get lots of kisses next weekend
(to John) We want to take him to the Harvest Festival in Kutztown, where they have the Clydesdales
John thinks about saying something, can't
He watches Luke give Grace a kiss
Thank you, Grandma
John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway
His father holds out the jacket in silence
John takes it
The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket

He looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence
John can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows
Bye Mom
They kiss
John's father stands behind him
Goodbye
George grabs his son in an awkward hug
John is shocked
He pats his father's back
They break
(to Luke) Let's go
John leaves
The front door closes
Grace walks away

224
'  -- -                             224 Nabulsi kneels beside a fire hydrant, using a shard from a taillight to scrape at a smudge of flaking black paint
Harris comes running up, out of breath, from the alley
Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase a black car down the alley, so that's probably his
We'll have the taillight debris at the lab by the time it opens
Before
Nabulsi stands and hands him the large shard of glass
225
'  --                                         225 John packs a backpack -- two white lab coats, wire cutters, a large screwdriver, two rolls of duct tape, the handgun, insulin vials, etc

(calls) Can  carry it
John appears with a box of trash bags
No
Just what fits in your bag
John hurries off
What about my pockets
(
) Or your pockets
Luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table
He digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket
quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor
227
'  --                                      227 John takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his wrist, right beside the watch
15, and under it, 35
He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos, sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything
He decides it is too late to worry
He loosens an edge of wallpaper and starts tearing it all down
228
-    --                    228 Luke sits in the back seat with their carry-on bags
John tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the back
He picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to the alley
He looks around, then stuffs this final bag into his neighbor's trash can
229
--                                  229 John tosses the last trash bags over the side of the dumpster that sits in front of a demolished house
As he closes the tailgate we get a good look at the broken taillight

-                                                230 He checks the clock on the dashboard and drives faster, taking a quick glance at his son to see if he is okay back there
231
--                                   231 John sits in his car in the back alley, watching the parking lot
The driver comes out carrying trays of test results and puts them in the back of his van
John grabs the large wire cutters and screwdriver from his car and hops out
He takes a few steps to the rear of the one-story building, pries open the phone box and snips the phone wires

--                                     232 clerk on the phone is cut off
She jabs the connection key, does not get a dial tone -- looks to the lights on the other phone lines and sees them go out as
233

He is moving before the van exits the parking lot

John turns to Luke
Daddy will just be a minute
John grabs his tennis ball
235
--                                      235 John holds his lab results between his teeth as he flips through the envelopes
He finally finds Lara's envelope, removes her report and replaces it with this one

John tugs Carrie's birthday invitation from his pocket, flips it open, checks the handwritten address

(with a certain disgust) What kind of a criminal drives a Prius
socially responsible one
(avoids Nabulsi's searing look by reading the report) Over a thousand of them registered in the city, seven thousand in the state
How many registered to felons
Six in the state
Four of them to embezzlers or white collar criminals, one to a rapist, one to a murderer
Guess we start with the murderer
She's in prison for life
The rapist is out
Find him

Hi

Those aren't easy to wrap
(now awkward) You know the party is at eleven, right
What time is it
(checks watch) Nine
Oh, 'm so sorry,  should have looked more carefully
It's no problem
(to Luke, re: present) Why don't you go give this to Carrie
Luke spots Carrie on the back step and runs over
(') Well,  guess you can help
Oh
Actually,  can't stay
have to run some errands
(recovering with grace) We'll see you later then
Thanks so much
(a moment) If
John looks to Luke and realizes this might be the last time he sees him

He has my parents' phone number in his pocket

No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors he sees a squad car screeching to a halt
He grabs Lara's hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner
They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them
They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward them
John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when Lara attempted suicide
John stiffens, but the guard runs past -- looking for a couple in lab coats

Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next Left
John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to make this choice -- their freedom, or their son

Perhaps they can escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to them
Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his grandparents after all

Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field
