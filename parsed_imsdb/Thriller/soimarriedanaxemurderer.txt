"     " Screenplay by Robbie Fox : : - Over this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San Francisco which is accompanied by a - trio
Kerouac's poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco
We come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street
We   to " " and continue along to the where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous "'m looking into the distance, having a brilliant thought" pose
, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel shirt and torn jeans, walks   , right in front of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the exact same pose
We   to reveal that Charlie has a bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the alleyway
We  Charlie into
We  him through the store
By day he is the Assistant Manager, by night he is a poet
in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading, Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed  Bit
Charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal
(sotto) ' approaches
Do you have the book On The Road by Jack Kerouac
Every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in to get copies of On The Road
Charlie is use to this and without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display of thousands of copies of On The Road
Another approach
Do you have a copy of On The Road by Jack Kerouac
Again not looking up, Charlie just points
Thanks
- Charlie puts the "" sign on the door and proceeds to walk home
The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the as he sees life, warts and all
As the streets become less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own and, a
The streets become even more deserted
The night is closing in on him
cat darts out from an alleyway and startles him
He quickens his pace
make him cross the street to avoid the danger
Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance
Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto: He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his window
sound from within
: taking papers out of a desk drawer
: carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing it
He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand
Sound of   from his apartment upstairs
: with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde
: finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of his apartment, bat raised above his head ready to swing
: clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them into a dufflebag; the jewelry is followed by 's
: pushing open his apartment door in a mock  maneuver, then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in the bedroom
He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop making a loud metal 's sound
He freezes, terrified
: where the , freeze
: Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce, waits two beats
then springs Samurai style into
He freezes
that the  belong to the angelic blonde in the broken picture
It's Charlie's girlfriend,
Sherri
What are you doing
'm leaving you
Oh, thank God
thought you were robbing our own home, because frankly, that's insane
mean, what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home
don't mean to meddle, but isn't it better to rob other peoples' homes
Start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth
That's not funny, Charlie
'm really leaving
She continues to pack
Charlie tries to unpack her things
What
Just because we had a fight last night
We've had a fight every night for two months
Ever since  brought up the subject of marriage, you've found fault with everything  do
Why couldn't we have gotten married, Charlie
(beat) 'm too young to get married
(begins putting her things back) 'm only twenty-nine and a half
We love living together
It's been two years now
need something more
See, Sherri, this is frustrating for me, okay
When we first started going out  thought we agreed that we weren't the sort of people who got married
That's like saying we're not the sort of people who are going to grow old
We're not going to fall into that "growing old" trap
Face it, you've got a problem with commitment, Charlie
Take a look at your other girlfriends
Every time you get close to a commitment there's something wrong with them
Hey,  broke up with them for good reasons
What about Sandy
Sandy was an alcoholic
No-no-no
You thought she was an alcoholic
She just drank more than you drank
What about Jill
She hated my family
You thought she hated your family
Nobody hates your family
Everybody loves your family
What about Julie
She smelled like soup
What does that mean
She smelled exactly like Campbell's Beef Vegetable soup
She was dirty, physically dirty
Well, Charlie,  wonder what you're gonna say were my problems
Are you gonna tell your friends that  was a junkie, that  wasn't supportive enough or that  smelled like relish
Charlie,  loved you
It could have worked out
(she goes to the door) Think about it
She leaves
- - '  - Charlie and his best friend,  , are out for a night on the town
Tony is second generation Italian-American with very Mediterranean features
They're listening to Teenage Fan Club
They pass Ghierardeli Square
Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're Scottish you know
Oh
had that dream again
Oh, is that the one where you suspect that a fat man in a diaper, on a lazy susan has interfered with your plans for the evening
No, but  have had that one
No, in this one 'm in love
Yeah
And  say to myself, ''ve finally found somebody that 'm truly comfortable with
' You know when you're so comfortable that you'll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl
Anyways you know what  do in the dream next
You propose
(after a pause) No
die
But Charlie, you're a normal suburban guy at heart, from a normal suburban family
Didn't you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a family
Yes, but, 'm afraid, okay
There are seven main rites of passage in a man's life
Birth, first day of school, last day of school
Marriage
Kids
Retirement
Death
'm at marriage
'm two rites of passage away from death
'm sorry,  wasn't listening
Tony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind them
He slouches down into his seat
Christ
It's the cops
Tony, you are a cop
know
Isn't it awful
work with those guys
They're assholes
The police car passes
'   - Tony and Charlie enter
There is a poet on stage
The club is full of art tarts and college bohemians
They are greeted by the club's owner, , an Italian man in his fifties
Salve zio mio
Allora
Che catzo fai, Charlie
Hi, Uncle Giuseppi
Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa e' in galera per la terza volta
Tony's uncle shows them to a table
'll have the waitress bring you cappuccino
What did your uncle say
He says my Dad's back in jail again
Ah, 'm sorry, man
You know, it's funny  don't even feel related to my parents anymore
feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents
feel more Scottish than Italian
Tony Spiletti,  don't think you could get more Italian than that
Unless of course your name was Tony Italian Guy
Charlie checks out the girls in the coffee bar
'm so bummed
Sherri was great, wasn't she
'm an asshole, aren't Yes
You've got to help me get through this night
You've just got to get back on the horse
The waitress arrives with two cappuccinos in extremely large cups like they have in France
Waitress, 'm sorry, there seems to be a mistake
ordered the large cappuccino
Two girls at a nearby table, laugh
Charlie and Tony exchange, "This could be promising
" looks
(to the girls) Do you think these cups could be larger
They're practically bowls
The girls laugh again
feel like 'm having Campbell's Cuppuccino
Join us in a cup of coffee
There's enough room
Sure
The girls come over
My name's Susan and this is June
We think you're funny
My name's Tony
This is my friend Charlie
Look, Tony, 'm going home
See you later, girls
Tony grabs him and pulls him aside
You really don't understand, do you
When a girl comes over to your table and says, ' think you're funny
' It means you've pretty much been given the keys to the city
Charlie, this is big
Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit
Here's what's gonna happen, Tony
We'll end up going out with them tonight, maybe even home with them
Well go out for two months
Soon she'll move in, we'll be happy, She'll want more of a commitment
'll be terrified and 'll do something to ruin it
Just like  did with Sherri
He leaves
Tony is left with the two girls
Poor, guy
He seemed so nice
(talking, choked up) just broke up with somebody as well
She left me high and dry
The girls try to comfort him
' Three quarters of the furnishings and items have disappeared with Sherri
Charlie sits dejectedly on the floor over his Poetry Journal
He is missing Sherri
We see
' He looks out and is struck by an idea and begins to write
' Again he looks out, finds his inspiration and continues to write ' ' gentle tear rolls down his left cheek
He pauses, then finishes off the stanza
After the last line he scratches out the entire poem
He closes the book and turns on the  set to  to veg out
The show is "What's Cooking
With Burt Wolf
" Charlie is driving in his car
He drives slowly looking for an address
Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front
'  - Adorning the front are a " " sign and miniature flags of the world
Charlie goes inside
' It's a small, hip shop selling specialty meats from around the world
Charlie looks around
Suddenly, an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a blood-stained smock enters
It is
She has a cleaver in one hand and something bloody in the other
(angry) Goddamn shoplifter
(conscious of Charlie's presence; holding up bloody meat) But  got him
(smiles) You're next
(backing out the door; terrified) 've come at a bad time
No stay
No, no, really
Obviously you've got things you have to do
You've got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso
Dig a makeshift shallow grave
Cover the body with quick lime
Really so much to do, so little time and 'm only in the way here, 'm just gonna go
Good luck
(referring to meat in hand) Oh, this
Oh, no, this is what he stole
This isn't a piece of him or anything
This is Icelandic Shank
bet it goes well with a nice Chianti
Fittfittfitt
(laughs) Can  help you
Yes
Do you have haggis
Yes, we do
It's over here in our Scottish Cuts section
One
This is a section under glass flying a Scottish flag, with haggis and various cuts of Scottish meat
Yes
've never been able to find haggis anywhere, except at my parents' house
They're Scottish
Harriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis
Behind her is the large " " sign
(ringing up his order) That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine
Will there be anything else
Yes
know it's a long shot, but you wouldn't by any chance happen to have any Prussian Venison
Now where in the world would  get Prussian Venison
Charlie's charmed
Charlie is driving along listening to Kerouac
We absorb the flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street
' '   - An old crappie apartment building in San Francisco
Charlie's car pulls up
We hear " " by the Bay City Rollers
' '  - Charlie approaches a door
(calling up) Mom, Dad, 'm here
(
) We're in here, son
The apartment is a shrine to Scotland
Scottish paraphernalia, miniature Scotty dogs, shortbread tins and, on wall, framed pictures depict famous Scotsmen, Sean Connery, Jackie Stewart, Alexander Graham Bell, James Doohan (Scottie from "Star Trek"), Sheena Easton, Billy Connolly
'  - We see , , , and little , Charlie's fourteen year old little brother all singing: (singing) ------- (noticing Charlie) Come give your old man a kiss or 'll kick your teeth in
The group are eating dinner on  trays
Charlie walks over and turns off the record
Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would ya
Oh,  love Charlie Pride
(begins singing; in thick Scottish accent) , May, shut it
is in his late fifties, a butcher, with Coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair
His red- haired wife, , is in her fifties, attractive with a soft, but tough appearance
Little , has a very large head and a skinny neck
Like Charlie, he was born in America
Charlie gives his Mom a hug, his father a kiss
Hey, William
(on his stomach on the floor; watching ) Hey, Charlie
On the television, Stuart's team, Glasgow Celtic, has scored
Aye -- magic
Let's have a look at the re-play
William, move your head
Look at the size of that ooy's heed
'm not kidding
It's like an orange on a tooth pick
Stuart, you're going to give the boy a complex
'm not kidding
That's a huge noggin'
It has it's own weather system
It's a virtual planetoid
(shouting to William) Heed
Move
We see the re-play of the goal on
Tony sits down and May brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes, piled very high
Is that enough potatoes, Charlie
Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in "Close Encounters"
(sniffs the air) Do  smell haggis
Aye, you do
(taking it) 'll put it in the frig
Charlie notices Tony reading some papers
He realizes it's literature from the Lyndon
LaRouche Society
Dad, what are you doing to Tony now
Why do you abuse his mind like this
That's the latest report from Lyndon LaRouche, outlining how the Queen and the Rothschilds masterminded the Soviet overthrow, so that they could reclaim lands they had annexed during the Holy Roman Empire
(goading Charlie) You know a lot of this makes sense
think you're suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages start to relate to their captors
Listen, Sonny Jim, it's a known fact there's a society of the five wealthiest people in the world, called the Pentaverate, who run everything and meet three times a year at a secret country mansion in Colorado, known as "The Meadows
" (sarcastic) And that's obviously why we haven't heard about it in the newspapers
(inappropriately angry & loud) That's right
They fuckin' own the papers, smartass
And everything else
Why do you think Scotland's not been able to get independence
Because the Queen the Pentavirate and those English dome heads in West Minster won't have it
Who are the other members of this pentaverate
The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys, the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders before he went tits up
Oh,  hated the Colonel with his wee beady eyes
And that smug look on his face
Dad how can you hate "the Colonel
" Because the Colonel puts an addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it fortnightly
Interesting
coo-coo Would anyone like a juice
Charlie, did  tell you, we bought a Juice Tiger
Juice Tiger
Aye, it's a juicer
It's part of my National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet
Would you like potato juice
Thank you, no
Sherri's late
Yeah, uh, Sherri and  broke up
Oh, you didn't
Sherri was the daughter your father was never able to give me
'm just not ready for marriage
'm twenty-nine and my poems haven't even been published yet
But it's not just the poetry is it son
You're afraid if you get married you'll lose your muse
Look at me, was a strapping young butcher, at the height of my creative powers
When it came to de-boning a side of beef, there was nobody that could touch me
Then  married your mother
And people would still stand in awe as  filleted a shoulder of lamb
Maybe it's just as well not to get married, look at the news
Where did put it
Heed
Move that melon of yours into the bathroom and get the paper for your mother
William gets the National Enquirer and brings it back
That's not news, Dad
That's bullshit
wouldn't wipe my ass with that paper
What are you talking about
It's the fifth highest circulating paper in the United States, 'll have you know
Oh, here it is
Mrs
The Honeymoon Murderer
She marries men under fake identities, and then murders them
She killed some German martial arts expert, and some plumber named Ralph Elliot
Her whereabouts are unknown
There's another goal on the  set
Scores
Two nil
Magic
Ah, beautiful goal
We  on the set
Time passes
The  set : The two teams are shaking hands
And the final scores chyron shows Celtic beating Rangers three nothing
We see Charlie and Tony are leaving
Stuart is blind drunk
(singing Rod Stewart's song) '   , ' ' , '
Ah, you're steaming
She meets Charlie and Tony at the door and kisses him good- bye
She turns to kiss Tony, and holds on the kiss far too long
(pulling away) See you later, Mrs
MacKenzie
Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian bastard
See you later, mom
(calling out) See you later, Dad
Fine
Go
You've stayed your hour
Charlie and Tony leave and enter
where they find William sitting on the stairs waiting for them
Take me with you
- Charlie's drives by and notices Harriet, who's unwinding the store awning in Dutch national costume
The banner announces "
" "
" Charlie slows down to look at her
She looks great in her little Dutch costume
- Charlie is again writing at the counter
Another enters
Excuse me
You wouldn't happen to have
Charlie again points to the Kerouac section without looking up
Thanks
Charlie writes
, , : ' She's on his mind
Charlie's car pulls up
The sign reads, " " " " The store is very busy
There is a line at the meat counter seven people deep
Charlie takes his place at the end of the line
We see a montage of a persons hands chopping a rack of lamb into lamb chops, and carving meat with surgical efficiency
(spotting Charlie in the crowd) Oh, hi haggis, right
It was a big hit
(finishing up with a customer) remember you told me you were Scottish, but do you really like haggis
No
think it's repellent in every way
In fact,  think most Scottish cuisine is based on a dare
Harriet laughs
(to the next customer) Can  help you
(to Charlie) Sorry, 'm really busy
Look, um, my dad's a butcher, do you need a hand
Well, actually, Yes
Charlie puts on a very stylish butcher smock and crosses behind the counter
Can you get me four Belgian porterhouses
Do you know what a porterhouse looks like
'm meat literate
Time passes we see a montage of Harriet and Charlie serving customers
Ending on a customer's  of Charlie
(
) Yes, do you have any fresh blubber
'll check
(pause) You want blubber, right
Yeah
We see Charlie's  of an Eskimo with a "lower forty-eighth" accent
My parents are coming to town
You know how parents are
They'll drive you nuts
The Eskimo exits, there are no customers left
Look, 'm really grateful
Can offer you some meat as payment
Please, help yourself to some meat
'm trying to be a vegetarian
Trying to be a vegetarian
Yeah, the problem is  really love hot-dogs
think the meat industry invented hot-dogs to stop people from becoming vegetarians
There's got to be something  can do to repay you
You could take me to a nice romantic dinner
- Charlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs
As Charlie puts the relish on, he smells the relish
(sniffing the relish) This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend
hate talking about old relationships
Then let's not and say we did
(she laughs) That was easy -- What a nice guy
You've probably never done a mean thing in your life
You'd be surprised
'd like to hear
(to his confused look) Name me something bad you've done in your life
Are you kidding me
No
Did you ever steal anything
You ever hit someone
Well, 've been in fights
Let me think
(as Charlie thinks) Not one bad thing, Charlie
Tell me something bad you've done
And it better be bad
mean, evil
How evil
Really evil
(thinks) Like how many people have you brutally murdered
"Brutal" is such a subjective word
mean, what's brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to another
Next to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking through a coin-operated binocular
He says something which causes her to cry
This just reminded her of that scene in "Brian's Song"
Actually, he just proposed to her
Those are tears of joy
She lifts her soda to toast them
Prost
The man and woman smile and nod
Danke, Fraulein
You're very smart
It's a shame 'm going to have to destroy you
Do bright women intimidate you
No, not at all
Really, what do you look for in women you date
(thinks) Well,  know everyone always say "sense of humor", but 'd have to go with breast size
(she laughs) How about you
In a guy
Income of course, and then
(thinks) savings
He smiles at her
Me likey how you thinkey
'  - The lights turn on, and then they enter a very bohemian apartment
There is artists paraphernalia strewn around small bar separates the living area from the kitchen
She smiles and walks off into the kitchen
'll make us some tea
He checks out her apartment
On the wall there is a huge poster of the
Hey, you know what this apartment needs
really large oversized poster of Atlantic City
used to live there
That's where had my first supermarket job
On his way out, he peeks into the bedroom, where he finds a bed that is facing neither parallel nor perpendicular with the wall
It is just kind of "there"
(
) (coming into room) only have chamomile
hope that's all right
He looks at her and then at the "Oddly-placed" bed
It's North-South
(to his confused look) For health reasons
See
had this friend, he was a martial arts expert
Anyways, he used to sleep North-South
don't know
It's a martial arts thing and it just sort of became a habit with me
(walking into living room) You know Scotland has it's own martial arts
It's called
It's mostly head butting and kicking people when they're on the ground
Harriet starts laughing
Then so does Charlie
They lean into each other
Pretty close
Too close even, and when it seems like they're going to kiss, Charlie suddenly gets uncomfortable and looks at his watch
Late
No
No
Not for me
Who for then
Who for then what
Well, you looked at your watch and said it wasn't late for you wondered who it was late for
Not me
No, Sir
Not here
(after a pause; checking watch) Maybe it is late
She gets him his coat
He starts to leave
Look, the truth is, yes,  had a great time, and 'd like to kiss you, but if we do kiss, then we'll kiss on the couch and if we kiss on the couch, then we'll kiss in the bedroom, and once you're in the bedroom -- Well, the thing is, always rush it
And this time  feel like maybe  should wait
Maybe we should let it build naturally and grow, instead of just immediately spending the night together
want to spend the night together
(sold) have no problem with that
- They are both fast asleep
She is curled up in his arms
Suddenly, she begins to speak
Yes
Yes
Charlie's eyes open
He smiles
Yes Ralph
will
Ralph
Charlie's smile fades
He sits up and looks at her
She is lying completely still on the bed, her eyes closed, and still sleep-talking
(
) Now now Ralph
(waking her) Harriet
Harriet
(as her eyes open) You were having a dream, or
You kept saying the name Ralph
Ralph
Ralph
heard you say it
(sleepily) That's odd
Just today  was thinking about, her
She's a friend
(starting to leave) Is she nice --
Ralph
Yeah
She's great
: '  - Charlie is sleeping alone in the bed, and the sound of is heard off in the distance
His eyes slowly open, he looks around, remembers where he is
He puts on his shorts and walks towards the bathroom
- Through the steam we can just make out Harriet in the shower washing her hair
Charlie walks over
You know
with this drought in California total strangers are urged to shower together
He opens the curtain
It's not Harriet
The woman, , calmly looks at him and closes the curtain
Go away
Oh God
'm sorry
Jesus
Excuse me
He backs out of the room
- ' The door opens and a hurriedly dressed Charlie emerges
Before he gets to the door he once again encounters Rose
She's completely dressed
Even her hair is dry
Hi
'm really sorry
must have scared the
'm Harriet's friend, Charlie, and you must be
(hopefully) Ralph
'm Harriet's sister, Rose
And this is Harriet's note
He reaches for it, but she reads it aloud to him
(reading) 'Dear Charlie,  didn't want to wake you, make yourself at home, thanks for making me smile
' Harriet
That's a very nice note
'll make you some breakfast
Gee, 'd love to but 'm running late
What would you say to blueberry pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape juice and Kona coffee
- Charlie and Rose sit at the table each eating a bowl of dry cereal
'm sorry  didn't have any of those other things
Hey, that stuff'll kill you while Fruit Loops are light and probably reasonably high in Fiber
like Apple Jacks too
Got 'em
So this is your apartment
Rose starts sketching Charlie
Yes
She's been here the past three months
ever since she came back from Miami
used to visit her occasionally
She didn't speak of me
(shakes his head, no) She told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about Ralph
She spoke of them
She spoke of the martial arts guy and screamed about Ralph
(affectionately) Well, you know Harriet
Actually,  really don't
(puzzled) But you did have sex with her
(taken aback) Hello
Yet you still don't know her
(contemplates this) See, that's the problem with sex
It's not very revealing
My, look at the time
He stands up
(after a pause) You should be careful, Charlie
am
usually
just
You should know, this is very unusual that would do this so soon, in this day and age particularly, but
We just really hit it off
We did
And
'm gonna go now
won't tell Harriet that anything happened
But
nothing did happen
Exactly
Or she would be jealous
And when she gets jealous, we both know what she's capable of
No, we don't
You do, like  said, just met her
You'll be okay, Charlie
Just be careful
She leaves
Charlie is baffled
- As Charlie walks by, , a lanky customer in his late teens is buying a book
Hey, Charlie
How you doin'
Good
Good
Look, Fred
(leaning in) You got a lot of girlfriends, right
You know any girls named Ralph
Ralph
Gee, Charlie
Isn't that a guy's name
Well, not necessarily, but
Never mind
Thanks, Fred
Charlie catches the store manager, , on her way into her office
Hey Penny,  wanted to ask you -- you know some girls named Ralph, right
mean, that's a girl's name also, isn't it
(confused) don't think so, Charlie
Uh
(walking away) Forget it
Thanks
She walks into her office totally confused
-    -  - Tony and Charlie are waiting in line
as they travel to the island
(
) You know 've lived in this city all my life and 've never been to Alcatraz
We open on the   of a
We find our tour group in the holding area
The   is a beefy man in his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military precision
Hello, everyone 'm a park ranger and  will be leading you on the tour
All the park rangers here at Alcatraz were at one time guards, myself included
My name is John Johnson, but everyone here calls me Vicki
Will you please follow me
They are led out
We see that Alcatraz is a sinister place
Cold and unforgiving
The Park Ranger leads them to the center of a cell block
You're glowing, Charlie
The man's in love
Sssh
Stop it
'm trying to listen
This is the main cell block area
Home to such famous criminals as Al Capone, Micky Cohen, Joseph "Dutch" Critzer, and Robert Stroud, the famous Bird Man of Alcatraz
Follow me, please
The Park Ranger leads them past the famous visiting rooms, the mess hall, all the way to the solitary confinement area
This is the cell for solitary confinement, that over the years has come to be known as Times Square
Tony and Charlie are at the back of the tour group
So did you and Harriet
you know
(grinning) Sssh  don't want to talk about it
With that look, you don't have to talk about it
The grin alone could get you five to seven years
Tony, get your mind out of the gutter
All you need to know is that she's a sweet, kind and loving person
Now this is something none of the other tour guides will tell you
In this particular cell block Machine Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the prison system, a "bitch
" And one day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut out his "bitch's" eyes
Look, what can  tell you
'm smitten
'm in deep smit
dunno
just don't wanna talk about it, because then  start analyzing and that's not good for me
Good
think that's good
Just let it happen
Exactly
That's what's gonna be different this time
Something strange happens, let it go
It's not my business
Like Ralph
She says Ralph in her sleep
Who's Ralph
don't know who Ralph is
Moreover, don't want to know
Good
And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't enough retribution for Kelly, the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing into the "bitch's" ocular cavity
Tony and Charlie look at each other
They're a little queasy
Exactly
(beat) Tony, 'm happy
Don't let me screw this one up
-    - They are eating Bay burrites
Did you have a nice date last night
Rose,  don't really -- He disturbed me while  was naked in the shower this morning
Yeah, he stayed over
didn't mind
Charlie and  laughed about it over breakfast
That's good
He said you had great sex last night
He did
(a beat) Yeah
He seems really stuck on you
hope for you that it lasts
Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving person
We like each other, but don't want to think any further
It's taken me a long time to get back to dating, and  want to take things real steady this time
Well, you can trust me not to tell him anything
He was quite happy not to talk about the past
did a sketch of him
Rose shows the sketch to Harriet
(looking at the picture) That's good
Think 've caught him
The eyes are good
Charlie really liked it
It's a good likeness
Boy,  really hope it works out
Rose,  don't wanna screw this one up
'   - Charlie enters the building, holding a handful of poetry books
He passes a    coming out
The guy nods and Charlie nods back
'   - Charlie gets three feet down the hallway
Stops in his tracks and heads back to the front door
He opens it and yells to the delivery guy: Hey, uh
Ralph
(turning around) 'm Gilbert
Shit
'  - She opens the door enough to see that she is wearing only a blouse that goes below her hips
She looks fantastic
He hands her the poetry books
(teasing him) Charlie, they're beautiful
'll put them right in water
He follows her inside and puts the books on the bureau
He goes over and kisses her
You look great
was just getting dressed
(picking up skirt off couch) What do you think of this skirt
Honestly
(pulls her close) 'd leave it off
So then you think  could go to a poetry concert like this
She drops the skirt and stands there
She's fantastic
Let's forget the poetry concert
It's already been nine hours since last made love to you
(smiling; walking away) Come on we're meeting your best friend
wanna look good
The second go to the ladies room he's gonna tell you what he really thinks of me
He follows her to the bedroom door, constantly trying to kiss her
Come on, Charlie
We have to be there in fifteen minutes
(following her into bedroom) Fifteen minutes
Perfect
She closes the door on his face
(through door) Maybe later
(
) thought of calling you
(startled) Aaaahhh
Charlie turns on his heel
Rose has appeared out of nowhere
(after a pause) To warn you, Charlie
(after a pause) There are just some things you should know, about Harriet
About Harriet
About her past
don't wanna know
mean, look everyone has some skeletons in their past
only care about the future
Not the past
Here's the thing
may have to tell Harriet
Tell her what
That we're lovers
We're not lovers
know, and it's a damn shame
Harriet walks in the room, fully dressed, and fully dazzling
hope 'm not interrupting
(feeling weird) No, not at all
We were just talking about
Rose and  met yesterday, so
So  heard
Harriet hugs Rose and then stands right next to her
So, don't you think we look alike
Oh, we do not
Harriet was always prettier than me
And a heck of a lot more popular
She always had boyfriends
The only thing  ever got was good grades
(slightly uncomfortable) Good grades are good
She's just being kind
Show Charlie one of your photographs, Rose
Rose is a great artist
No, Harriet
don't want to
They're not good
You're so modest
If  weren't here to brag for you,  just don't know
(taking out a posterboard from cabinet) Show it to him, Rose
Do it
He turns it over and there is a picture there
collage of unrelated images put together
And it is beautiful
But it's very abstract
Violent perhaps
Confused definitely
He likes it
It's beautiful
Thanks
What is it
dunno
What do you call it
dunno
lot artists don't like to title their work
They feel it biases the viewer
It is titled
It's called " dunno"
Charlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet
It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for Rose
hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty
We should get going, Charlie
Thanks, Rose
See you later
Bye, Charlie
Rose, great to see you
We should all go out together some time
The three of us
That would be great
That would be
interesting
Charlie and Harriet walk out
- Charlie and Harriet wait in line with bohemian types and poetry lovers from the suburbs, and all walks of life
Directly behind them are
The marquee reads: "  -
" think you're going to love Alan Ginsberg
He's great
Oh,  know all about him
(
) Hey Charlie
Tony is getting out of a cab accompanied by Susan, the girl from Spiletti's Coffee House
He approaches Charlie
Sorry we're late
Tony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the Little Old Ladies on the other side of Charlie
You must be Harriet
've heard a lot about you
(to Tony; re: Harriet) This is Harriet
Oh
Sorry
Of course
(whispering to Harriet) apologize
Charlie described you as much older
And heavier
(smiling) Oh, he did
Thank you, Tony
This is my best friend
And this is Susan
Charlie, you remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's
Yes,  do
You're funny
Then she
The girls start inside, Tony lags back with Charlie
(whispers to Charlie) give Susan one night
- is on stage
He is brilliant
Tony, Charlie, and Harriet are all amused
Susan is bored stiff
Charlie is looking at Tony
Tony glances over at Susan and gives Charlie an "Oh, well
" look
Then he looks at Harriet and nods in approval of her
'  - The four of them walk along the wharf
Charlie is at one of those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets and try and knock them down
Charlie knocks two down
One more and you get your pick
(to Harriet) You do it
No, Charlie
'm the worst
Come on, you'll be great
The arcade man turns around to watch
Harriet winds up and throws the bean bag directly into his neck
Hey
Sorry
told you Charlie
No, no, you're okay, you're just having control problems
They both start laughing
He puts his arm around her
In the b
g
the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co-worker
They continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a House of Horrors
It looks somewhat run down and Harriet looks questioningly at Charlie
know this is really, really cheesy, but in a way this is one of the places in San Francisco 'm most proud of
Yeah, let's go in
Tony nods agreement
Susan looks bored
They go inside the it's as low rent as Charlie described
The " " so described in a poorly written sign, is an overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup
He looks like a roadie for the band,
He stands at a podium, smoking and reading a paper
As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment utters: Boo
- Harriet and Charlie enter Bill's Wax Museum
The  of the wax museum greets them
Hi
'm Bill, welcome to my wax museum
They walk over to the exhibits
There are exhibits of Abraham Lincoln, Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton
As they look more closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as Bill's
They laugh
- Pouring rain
Charlie and Harriet, wrapped in each others arms, walking through the rain
feel so safe with you right now
You're never going to leave me, are you
feel like  could be here forever
: ' - : ' - to see Charlie in bed
He lies awake on his side, his back up to Harriet's
She is sound asleep
Suddenly: (sleeptalking) Ralph
No, Ralph
Charlie sighs, then just shrugs and tries to fall asleep
What can he do
: ' '   - Charlie and Harriet wait outside his parents' door
Well, this is it
It'll be fine
They enter the door
' '  - We again move along the hallway
We pass the Scottish wall, of fame, Scottie from "Star Trek", Sir Walter Scott, Sir Harry Lauder, Sheena Easton, Al Pacino, Billy Connolly, then the   to Pacino, where it
Mom, Dad, we're here
May comes up, wearing a fancy country and western outfit
Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet
Ah, she's beautiful
Thank you
She's so sweet
hope you keep her
(calling) Stuart, come out here
You tube
When he comes up, Stuart is wearing only a shirt with his boxer shorts
Ah, it's the wee Harriet
Stuart, put your pants on
Hold your horses
(calling to William) Heed
Pants
William comes around the corner with his pants
Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the Scottish wall of fame
Oh, that's for Tony
So, Charlie tells me you're a butcher
Let's talk meat
Dad, no one wants to talk shop
Especially butcher shop
Come here
Stuart gets him in a half-Nelson
Ah
Dad, dad  have a back zit, man it kills
Charlie struggles to free himself
Stuart turns to greet Harriet
As he reaches out his hand
Totally instinctively, Harriet grabs Stuart's hand and twists it behind his back
Charlie is startled, as his date has just gotten Stuart into a Half-Nelson
(releasing his hand) 'm sorry
just
You just surprised me
'm sorry
like this one Charlie
She's quite a filly
'm really embarrassed
Don't be embarrassed about having a good strong butcher's grip
Do you link your own sausage
Oh, ignore him
Come have a look at some photos of Charlie when he was a wee'n
Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures
Ah, Charlie, lighten up
You've got a pickle up your ass
(whispering to Harriet) 'm gonna use the bathroom
You be okay alone with them
(kissing) Fine
Don't worry about it
Hurry
They smile as he leaves the room
Make sure there's paper, Charlie
Charlie picks up the pace, scared of what he might hear next
Make sure you leave the seat down
(shutting her up) Ma, just show her the pictures
And light a match
(to Harriet) He always leaves the seat up
He's gotta learn
' - He closes the door, and shakes his head
What can he do
Those are his parents
On the wall opposite the toilet is a well-used dart board with pictures of the Queen Mother and Colonel Sanders
Hooked to the magazine caddie is a small container of darts
- May excitedly shows Harriet family photo albums
This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky
He's a policeman in Canada
And our cousins Ruth and Jack
He's just got a restraining order from his wife
She's a lovely girl
This is Billy
He's a member of parliament
He drinks
What a nice family you have
He doesn't seem in any hurry to leave either
He listens through the door to Harriet enthusiastically looking through old photos
Charlie glances down at a stack of National Enquirers on the magazine rack
He flips through a few
He sees one of the absurd headlines: "   " Charlie shakes his head
(
) (through door) Charlie was the cutest baby
(
) (through door) You okay in there, Charlie
You didn't fall in, did you
(through door) Jesus
Charlie then looks down at another article in the Enquirer and reads: "'
-
" It is the article about Mrs
-- the axe-murderer who kills her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under a different identity
May is quickly flipping through a photo album, pointing out pictures of relatives as she goes: can't believe the resemblance between you and Charlie, Mrs
MacKenzie
With Harriet speaking in the b
g
, Charlie continues reading, now absorbed in the article about the 3 victims: (
) (through door) You have the same smile
It's so incredible
" #1 -       " " #2 -      " " #3 -     -  " '  -  -
- ' Sitting in the front seat of Charlie's car, smiling, content, a great meal, a great night out with Charlie and a nice evening with his parents
Slowly  across the front seat to Charlie
nervous anxious "what the hell am  getting myself into" look on his face
So, that was some move you put on my Dad, there
Did you study Karate, or
No
Not officially
dated a guy for a while who ran a studio
Oh, the martial arts expert
The north-south guy
Here in San Francisco
Actually, Miami
He looks straight ahead, trying to act unfazed
But, he's very phased -- his expression is covered in it
Was that before Atlantic City, or after
Oh, that was years ago
Atlantic City was recent
didn't care for Atlantic City
town full of gamblers and lounge singers
He keeps driving
- Charlie walks through the precinct towards Tony's office, holding the National Enquirer in his hand
Hey Charlie
Is Tony back there
The Sergeant nods and Charlie heads back to the office
- , Tony
Do you have the K673 form completed yet, that street vendor incident on Powell Street
(really bummed) Yes, Captain
Tony, do you mind my saying that you seem a little down
Captain
It's about my work
About being a policeman
Tony, if there's anything wrong, 'm here to listen
know
And that's what's irritating, you're too nice
Too nice
Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes
You should be constantly on my case, like the captain on Starsky and Hutch
Once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office, accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you're sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the commissioner
Well, as you may know, Tony
don't report to a commissioner
report to a committee, some of whom are appointed, some elected and the remainder co-opted on a bi-annual basis
quorum -- Police work should be all about running around, following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right, going out on a limb
Well Tony, 've never seen it that way
For me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public
(exasperated) Captain
When  joined the police force,  thought  was going to be Serpico and unfortunately  ended up being Toma
would have settled for Beretta
That's interesting Tony
'm perturbed that you should be so disillusioned
Charlie enters
Hey, Tony,  gotta talk to you
Oh, hello, Charlie
Look, 'm in the way here
You guys probably have something you want to talk about, and Tony, if you've still got stuff you want to sort out, please, you know where the suggestion box is
The Captain exits
Nice guy
Hey, what's up
'm having doubts about being a cop again
It's not like how it is on cop shows
All  do is fill out papers and reports
Let me get this straight, your Captain hasn't threatened to have you up on charges so fast you won't know what hit you
No
He's never once said to me that he was going to "throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday
" Anyways what's up
Charlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on
, the Honeymoon Killer)
Have you heard of this case
Mrs
She murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again
never heard of it
So what
Curious, that's all
read about it, and
(after a pause) think 'm dating Mrs
(after a pause) Two words, Charlie
Get therapy
They have doctors that deal specifically with this illness
Everything's adding up, Tony
One of the victims was a martial arts expert
Last night at dinner, she put a martial arts move on my dad
There about twenty thousand people in San Francisco who are martial arts experts
Should  arrest all of them too
If they also say Ralph in their sleep think it'd be a good start
(showing him paper) Ralph Elliot
plumber from San Francisco
Missing since his honeymoon
You're just getting scared
Like the dream, you feel Harriet could be the one, so you start to suspect her of things, 'cause deep down you're scared that if she is the one, you'll marry, and marriage to you is death
Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay
They're my dreams
Analyze your own dreams
(a beat) It's not a marrying thing, Tony
It's a murdering thing
(showing him paper) Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right
Well so did this guy, right around the same time she left town
(reading article) "Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a name for himself for being able to sing in six different languages the song "Only You"
(putting paper down) Does she know the song "Only You
" don't know
It hasn't come up yet
Charlie, move past it
You're running your life by the National Enquirer
(defensively) What
It's the fifth highest circulating newspaper in the United States
(taking paper back) Mrs
Please
Look it up
- Charlie and Tony are in the back with , a stocky black woman in uniform, who works in the files department
There's no record of any deaths
All three of these guys were reported missing around the time of their honeymoon, but so were the wives
No pictures of any of the brides
For all we know they just picked up and moved away
And Ralph Elliot, too
Charlie, you're talking about three guys over a seven year span
That's hardly news
No deaths
Elopement in this state, as of this day, is still not illegal
(re: the article) Yeah well murder is
And this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman
Mr
MacKenzie, we've found that, most National Enquirer articles are actually based on our own police reports
They take the facts and fabricate a story around them
It's true, Charlie
You gotta realize that
mean, personally,  would lie to you, but Kathy
has this crazy notion of always telling the truth
(patting his back) You feel better now
It guess so
It's just
if  had a photo of Harriet,  could show it to the relatives or friends of Mrs
's victims to identify her
Charlie, listen to me
There is no Mrs
Drop it
Okay
- '  - Charlie knocks on the door
Rose answers
(thrilled) You're back
But Harriet's not here yet
Maybe  could wait
Sure
That would be fine
She then starts to slowly close the door
He props it open with his hand
Inside
was hoping
(letting him in) 'm glad you asked
didn't want to be so forward
mean, if you're waiting inside, then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite, and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there's the chance that you would really want to talk and it's me who'd be busy, but in an attempt not to be rude,  sit there and listen to some story that you don't really want to tell and  don't really have time to hear
You know
couldn't agree with you more
think about a lot of things
Look, if you have work to do, you go right ahead
("ah, here's an angle") mean, to tell you the truth, 'd love to see your work
Okay
What would you like me to do
No,  don't want to see you work was talking about your work
Your photographs
That one that  saw was so, wonderful, and
Harriet's far more talented than am
Well, 'm sure it's so subjective anyway and
(out of patience) Rose, show me your photos
There are two kinds
Beautiful travel pictures and very erotic black and white portraits of young men and women
All with a slight sadomasochistic quality
At the bottom of every photo is says: "Seasons Greetings"
Hey, these are some interesting photos here
Very impressive
Nice shots of Sauselito and
some good bondage shots
lot of people wouldn't think to mix the two subjects, but they're really a natural together
(new thought) Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any pictures of Harriet by chance, would you
(re: her cards) Well,  don't think she'd wanna do this sort of
No, no, not that
Just, in general some photos
Any little snapshot would do
doubt 'd have any
Harriet hates being photographed
The sound of a key in the door as Harriet enters the apartment
(
) Rose -- did  see Charlie's car out in front
We're in here, Harriet
(walking in) What are you guys doing
(covering up) Oh, nothing
Just looking through some of Rose's work
Charlie wanted a photo of you
And that
That too
Why of me, Charlie
Well, sentimental reasons
Something to remind me of you when we're not together
She takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss
There, can you remember that
Okay, it's just,  was gonna give one to my parents, too, and
(getting nowhere) Another time would be fine
It's hardly a matter of life and death
- ( ) In the news tonight, regarding a Beverly Hills Jeweler, Morris Cohan, who died last week, police are now suspecting that Morris's partner, Lawrence Sachs, may have murdered him with an untraceable poison
Reveal: we are in
'  - Charlie is on a Stair Master, as Harriet walks in wearing a robe
The  is on in the b
g
Where you been
Downstairs
have a surprise for you
Great
just wanna do a quick twenty minutes on the Stair Master before bed
Harriet drops her robe, and from over her shoulder we see that Charlie prefers what he sees to working out
'll do forty tomorrow
(getting into bed) got something much healthier for you than that
She pulls out a milkshake from behind her back
What is it
It's a health shake
Eggs, malt, cinnamon, oranges
It's great mixed it up downstairs
continues on about poisons and poisoners
Charlie glances at it
( ) Poisoning has become the second leading method of murder in recent years, due to
Charlie watches the , looking a bit disturbed
Harriet offers him the shake
Oh, look, 'm full
Dinner and
No
You'll like it Charlie
No, really, thanks
(putting it up to his lips) You won't try it
spent twenty minutes making it
He takes it
Lifts it to his mouth
then puts it on the table
(sniffing it) Ummm
Smells good
Maybe 'll take some to the office tomorrow
(running into bathroom) 'm gonna brush my teeth
Be right back
Charlie goes into the bathroom
' Harriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass down on the counter
'm gonna take a quick shower
Charlie notices the empty glass on the counter
Harriet, where did the shake go
What do you care
drank it
(getting into shower) You could have at least tried it
You make me feel bad sometimes, Charlie
don't know why
With her in the shower, he sneaks back into the bedroom and checks the trash can
Nothing
Then he runs around the bed to the other trash can
Nothing
He looks thoroughly confused as she enter the bedroom, wearing a towel
She takes the towel off as she slips underneath the covers
He gets into bed next to her
She gives him a kiss
Sorry
'm a little sensitive
You didn't want to drink my milkshake
So what -- right
( ) Regarding the murder between the two partners, we talked to Toxicologist Dr
Show on the issue
Charlie and Harriet are watching the news show is patched in via the Anchorman's close circuit
( ) Doctor, is it possible that one could be poisoned with no trace at all
( ) Certainly
There are plants that grow very commonly in our own backyard that could easily be fermented into poison
Take for instance the
(getting nervous; blocking out ) Harriet, why don't we shut the light off
( ) Really
And how easy it that to do
( ) Scarily enough, quite simple
You merely take the
(blocking out the again) Maybe we should turn the light back on
Yeah that's better
Charlie, what's the matter
Nothing
Charlie
Well, it's just
(re: the ) The
You can't even watch the news these days without getting depressed
know, Charlie
And it's not just that
Look at the things people are doing
Partners killing each other
mean, you hear a story like that, and
who can you really trust these days
What do you mean
It's like, have you ever stood with someone at the edge of a cliff, or the edge of a subway platform, and you think, just for a split second, "What if  pushed him
" Well,  don't really take the subway ever, so
Charlie turns over on his side, she cuddles up behind him
'm just making a point of how many times we trust people with our lives
mean, look at us
If you didn't trust me, you would never be able to fall asleep
Why do you say that
Look at you, you're sleeping
Look how vulnerable you are
mean, could do anything at that point
(nervous) What could you do
(sweet and innocent) Anything
You're lying on your side, asleep,  could
stick a needle in your ear
(grabbing his ear at the thought) Aahhh
'm just making a point of what a good relationship we have
Goodnight, sweetheart
He looks very uneasy
She kisses him and shuts off the light
The moon gives the room an eerie glow
Well, good night
Good night
She doesn't close her eyes
He's scared to close his
Pause
Well
good night
(smiling) Good night
They both look over at each other
She closes her eyes
He takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes
And covers his ear with his hand
- Charlie is on the crowded platform
Next to him is an old lady with a lot of shopping bags
Three kids on skateboards whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands
Cat toys and cans of cat food go everywhere
Charlie bends down and starts to help her gather her stuff
Thank you very much, young man
've gotta get all this stuff back to my children
Your children
When  say my children  mean my cats
You see my children moved out years ago, so all 've got is my cats
have over one hundred of them
That's a lot of cats
(
) Charlie
Charlie looks up and sees Harriet waving to him from the subway stairs
He waves back and motions
"'ll be there in a second", and continues to help the old lady
She watches from the stairs
You see this red toy
That's for the Captain, he's finicky
and this blue one
That's for Marco Polo
Two train headlights are seen off in the distance
Do you have a name for all of your cats
Oh, yes
Charlie glances over at Harriet, who slowly makes her way down the platform towards him
Let me see
There's Winston Churchill, Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie
The train is getting closer and closer, and so is Harriet
He was Scottish
Harriet moves forward a step, Charlie moves back a step
Wasn't he Irish
As Harriet seems to get closer Charlie continues to back up, picking up cat toys
Charlie realizes he has no where else to turn
so he side steps down the platform, never stopping his conversation with the lady
Actually he was Scottish
Trust me, know these things
Harriet is moving in on him
Charlie steadily makes his way down the platform, feigning accidentally kicking cat food down the platform
The old lady is unsure what is going on, she tries to keep up with him
Now that you say it, he was Scotch
Charlie runs out of platform
Harriet is very close to him
The train is closer, so is Harriet
Charlie lets out a scream
Noooooo
Charlie is standing at the edge of the platform, Harriet is a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by
Charlie is safe
People are all staring at Charlie curiously, including Harriet and the old lady
Charlie is embarrassed
(embarrassed) Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink
Scots are a people
Sorry, that just always bugged me
No one knows what is going on
'm sorry,  didn't know it meant so much to you
Hi, Harriet
- ; , ,
We find Charlie at the marriage counter
Yes, Sir, can  help you
'd like to put in an announcement of my parents forty-fifth wedding anniversary
Sure, it's $4
50 per word, and you've got a choice of standard or bold
Bold, and here, 've written it out
Charlie looks over to the deaths counter
He overhears two obituary assistants having a conversation
#1 Hi, Frank, busy week
#2 've only got two
It's dead around here
Both assistants laugh
Charlie is mildly bemused
#2 Well, 've got this one guy, a tourist
He had a heart attack on a cable car
#1 Looks like he left his heart in San Francisco
Hey, that's a real person you're talking about
#1 You're right, 'm sorry
#2 Well, there's this other guy Elliot, Ralph
Plumber, disappeared four months ago
Body found in a sewer
(pause) #1 (despite himself) guess he took his work too seriously, and his life went down the drain
Did they mention anything about his wife
#1 (crest fallen) You're right,  feel bad
Point taken
'm mean, these are real people we're talking about
No, 'm serious
Did he mention the wife
#1 You made your point
was wrong to make a joke about a person's life
really want to know about his wife
#1 (crying and shouting) , you win
'm a bad, bad person
#2 Frank take it easy
#1 No, he's right
(pounding his head with his fists) 'm for shit, 'm one insensitive asshole
Is there any mention of the wife
At all
#1 '
Charlie exits
- Charlie stands outside the announcement office, terrified
Harriet is talking to a
Hi
'm sorry
(beat) think you're a terrific woman
(beat) just don't think we should see each other anymore
She moves around to Charlie
She lifts his chin so that he is looking directly into her eyes
Why not
And tell me the truth
The truth
Okay
The truth is
She is so close to him, and so very beautiful, it's distracting
The truth is
'm afraid that you are
(he can't) You're going to laugh
don't think so
Okay
the truth is that 'm afraid you're going to ki
leave me
'm going to "cleave you
" What does that mean
Leave me
Not "cleave me
" Reject me
And so  decided to take matters into my own hands and get it over with by
Rejecting me
(he feels awful) Purely preventive
It's not anything you've done
know that
So why are you leaving me
(heartbroken) Harriet, maybe 'm not meant to be in a relationship
single tear runs down her cheek
She brushes it away quickly
never wanted to hurt you
You haven't
At least you left early on
(she's crying) So, that's it, then
've got a lot of work to do
(to Customer) Now, where were we
Charlie goes
'   - Charlie lies on the bar head down
Tony rushes in, looks around and sees Charlie
(without lifting head) Two hours and four minutes
Tony, need you, and two hours and four minutes later you show up
Sorry
know it was irresponsible to stay at the drug bust until it was over, but
What happened
(slowly sitting up) 'm gonna tell you, but when  do, just say nothing
Don't judge me
Just be my friend
Okay
Fine
Okay
broke up with Harriet
You're an asshole
What's your point
'm sorry,  just
why
Tony, she's a killer
The
everything
But nothing's proven
The only thing you're actually sure she did so far is she's treated you like a King
dunno, Tony,  just
Besides, everyone has something going on with them
mean, you can't find everything in one person
mean, she's bright, she's funny, she's independent
So maybe, and it's really just a maybe, she kills her husbands
Marriage is give and take, Man
You take the good with the bad
'  - Charlie lies in bed
He's writing in his journal
He stares out into space
Inspired, he writes
'         , - pauses a moment to reflect, then writes
- - - Thinks of something else and writes
His hand reaches across and scratches it out
-  - Charlie is exiting a vintage record store
Suddenly he finds himself face to face with Sherri
She's accompanied by a handsome young man
Hey, Charlie
Hi
How're you doing
(he glances at her friend) Good, huh
'm okay
This is Michael
Michael, this is Charlie MacKenzie
know
Why don't you two talk
'm going over there to buy some magazines
He walks over to a magazine stand
That good looking and he can read
'm teaching him
heard you have a new girlfriend
We broke up
There were problems
Problems
Difficulties
Let me guess
(smiles) She's a murderer
For a moment, Charlie is too stunned to respond
Then
Why did you just say that
(laughs) What else is left
'  - He's on the Stair Master, stepping very lethargically
The : He goes to answer
Hello
(through phone) Not that it matters anymore, but thought you should know -- someone just turned themselves in for the murder of Ralph Elliot
Really
Did she confess to the other murders
Just the plumber so far, but she'll come along
(after a pause) little old lady from Pacific Heights
Said he overcharged her on a leaking sink
Really
Leaky sink, huh
Anyway, crime to stop
Gotta go
'll catch you later
Tony hangs up
Charlie stops pedaling on the bike
Now he really feels like shit
Harriet's not a killer
Sherri's not a cheater
He races out of the bedroom
Moments later he appears, puts on a pair of pants over his exercise shorts, then races out the door again
/
'  - Charlie races along towards Harriet's house
'   - He races up to the door and starts to bang and knock and ring
(through door) Harriet, it's me, Charlie
(
) Go away, Charlie
've gotta talk to you, cause  miss you, and  made a mistake
and if you give me another chance 'll change
will
promise
'll get help, or therapy, or
Yeah, that'll be great
Therapy
Even twice a week
'll check with my insurance to see if 'm covered, but forget that
Harriet
The chain opens on the door
You really hurt me
'll make it up to you, can we at least talk
Sure, talk
Rose steps up behind Charlie
(
) Hi, Charlie
AAAhhhhhh
(as she now proceeds to be let in by Harriet) Trust your first instincts, Charlie
You never do
It's your big mistake
That and the haircut
Once again, baffled by Rose, Charlie touches his hair, shakes it off and looks Harriet right in the eye
don't want to lose you
You didn't lose me
You rejected me
'm unrejecting you
How do  know you won't reject me again
love you
(after a long pause) love you
But you blew it, Charlie, you blew it
She goes into the house
Charlie stands there dejected
He knows he's blown it
'  - Harriet is doing a load of laundry consisting of bloodied work clothes
Suddenly she can hear the sound of , very loudly
Annoyed, she goes out her front door to tell her neighbors off
Just as she's about to knock on the door, she realizes it's not the source of the music
At that moment her neighbor, who is a , comes out in nightclothes
don't mean to be a pain, but 'm a stewardess, and  have an early flight out in the morning
Can you please keep your music down
thought it was coming from here
But someone keeps shouting your name over and over
Puzzled, Harriet rushes back to her own balcony
'  -  - Harriet rushes out and smiles as she sees the source of the noise
Charlie serenades Harriet in the street below, accompanied by a  with a , a ,  - , - - - , ' crowd has gathered in the street and spectators group on their balconies
They break out into
Charlie proudly takes the applause and bows to Harriet
She throws him a flower
He's won her back
- '  - Romantic with candles surrounding the tub
Harriet and Charlie are bathing together
Wherever one of them moves, the water extinguishes a candle and Charlie lights it
This is keeping him pretty busy
've been there for almost a year only planned on stay with her for a few weeks, but she gets upset every time  say 'm moving
You were close as kids
pretty much raised her
You know the scene
Depressed mother
withdrawn father
(she remembers) My dad was a photographer too
Really
He hated it
Trudging off to those weddings every Saturday night
Other people's celebrations he called it
He said sometimes they didn't even offer him a glass of soda
He had a small studio, and every year at Christmas he'd take a picture of me and Rose and put it in the window on a little card that said "Seasons Greetings
" Awful pictures
It's like
could see his pain in my face
Anyway, me and my sister worked with our "childhood issues" in different ways
She became a photographer and  became phobic about having my picture taken
It's quite a family
Where are they now
Your parents
Dead
Car accident
There is a  at the door
(
) Harriet, its for you
' Charlie comes out of the bathroom in a robe
Charlie,  want you to meet a friend of mine
Say hi to Ralph
(shocked) Ralph
plain looking lady in her thirties, , is sitting by the window
(delighted) Oh, like Ralph, the lady carpenter in Green Acres
This is Charlie
love you
It's nice to meet you
(ecstatic) Nice
It's more than nice
It's great to meet you
It's fantastic to meet you
just,  can't tell you how glad  am
Ralph
Really
am
Well, thank you, 've heard a lot of nice things about you too, and
He rushes over to hug her
Oh, Ralphie,  love you
Swept up in his enthusiasm his towel falls off
Harriet is shocked, but amused
'll leave you guys alone
Have a great time
Charlie realizes he is naked
His arms are still wrapped around Ralph
'm naked, aren't
Why, yes, you are
should really get dressed now
He hurriedly puts his towel back on, bolts to the bedroom door
Just before he enters, he pauses and turns to Ralph
(to Ralph) Call me
He leaves
(to Harriet; a little confused) Friendly guy
: and Charlie's mother, , shoulders her way through the door, carrying a    with a big 45 written on it
: ' '  - May and Stuart's 45 year anniversary party
is at the piano playing "Happy Anniversary" as Charlie's parents, all their friends and Harriet all sit around the piano : Happy Anniversary to you
(Etc
) The song ends
May and Stuart blow out the candles
Okay, everyone come and get a piece of cake and some milk
Hey Dad,  got an anniversary present for you
Stuart looks up, and Charlie gets him in a headlock and pins him to the ground
'm proud of you, son
'm proud of you
(Stuart addresses the group) just wanna propose a toast
To my wife
Forty five years ago today May and  got married
Some of you were there, some of you weren't born yet, some of you are now dead, but
We both said, " do" and we haven't agreed on a single thing since
But, 'm glad  married you May cause
It could have been worse and besides
still love you
They kiss and everyone
Uncle Angus breaks into, "Stand By Your Man
" May and Stuart start to dance
Charlie looks at another young couple who are touched by this sincere display of love
He looks over at Harriet
Stuart and May feed each other cake
Charlie approaches Harriet
Harriet,  wanna talk to you
Boy, you really made some impression with Ralph
She can't get over you
(stalling; nervous) 'm just so happy for you to have friends like Ralph
What a great friend to have
Is everything all right, Charlie
You're perspiring
Harriet
marry me
What
want to have a wedding
With you
No
Please
don't know, Charlie
It's so good like it is
Why don't we just live together first
Because,  love you and  want you to marry me and be with me for 45 years
want you to have my children, and  want to have your children know that sounds like a lot of children, and they might not all get along, but
'm finally ready to trust you and to make a commitment
Marry me, Harriet, please
Be my wife
Harriet flinches slightly at the word "Wife", but Charlie is too wrapped up in the moment to notice
Stuart addresses the group
'd like to thank Charlie for throwing us this party
hope some day you have the same great 45 years that we've had
People clap and smile
Harriet looks at Charlie
He has tears in his eyes
Yes
At first it doesn't register
Then
You will
She smiles
Let's get married, Charlie
They kiss
(from across room) Harriet, come here a minute
want you and Uncle Angus to play a song together
Harriet and Charlie kiss one last time and she goes to the piano
Charlie stays in the corner, and Tony comes over
Hey, sorry 'm so late
What's happening
Nothing
Nothing at all
Just two little things
(as Tony looks in) That woman over there in the corner
She's Harriet's friend, and her name is Ralph
No shit
And secondly
That woman over there
(Re: Harriet) That's Harriet, and we're getting married
(excited) Fantastic
What did  tell you
She's a great girl
And the last thing in the world she'd be is a murderer
And then Harriet begins singing at the piano
(singing) " Tony and Charlie look at each other
"Only you
" Then Charlie looks at his bride with confidence
He walks over and joins her
She sings to him
It's a moment
- Charlie and Harriet pick out a diamond ring
Charlie and Harriet point to brochures of the different cities they could go to on their honeymoon
They decide on a picture of the "  " in Oregon
' They are getting their blood tests back
Harriet looks at hers, casually
Charlie is nervous
Reluctantly he opens the file and looks at it
He is pleased with the results and does a victory dance
- Charlie and Harriet are being married
Harriet is in a beautiful wedding gown
Charlie is wearing a kilt
Tony is the best man
He also wears a kilt
Stuart, also kilted, May, the whole family along with a hundred well-wishers are in attendance
The   presides
Rose is in a kilt
Now, Mr
MacKenzie, if you will take this woman to be your wife, through thick and thin, for better or for worse, please say: " do"
do
Now Harriet, if you will take this man, through good times and bad, for ever and ever, as your husband, please say " Do"
Harriet starts to speak; but right before the words come out, she stares into Charlie's eyes and
Charlie looks nervous
So does the Scottish Minister
So does Tony
So does everyone
(after a long pause; finally:) do
Now Charlie
Kiss the beautiful bride
Charlie and Harriet kiss
We can see (though Charlie can't) Harriet has a strange unsure expression on her face
Tony notices it though and can't figure it out
Let's get pissed
The wedding march kicks in being played by a drunken Scotsman on
Scottish accordionist and a Drummer play
Some    are  and along with the tune
Some young girl  in traditional Scottish costume, dance the sword dance along to We pass the buffet which we see is catered by "Meats Of The World
" Then we pass a very drunken Stuart in a heated discussion with four other people
You know Golden Gate park was designed by a Scotsman, MacClaren, which is who MacClaren park was named after
The others agree heartily
May and Tony are dancing
May is dancing uncomfortably close
She keeps sliding her hand down to his ass, which he then has to move back to his shoulder
Then we come to William, who's reluctantly at the children's table
All his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to feel his head
We find Charlie in a corner
One of the hooting Scottish aunties is trying to get him to have another Scotch
(proffering the Scotch) Charlie, get this down your neck
Auntie Molly if  have another one 'll end up underneath the table with my kilt over my head
Tony joins them
Where's Harriet
don't know
Oh, there she is
She's in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous
She has enough food in front or her for three people
She eats ravenously and incessantly
Charlie goes over to her
little hungry, were you
At that moment, a  goes off
Harriet looks up angrily
What are you
Then she realizes it's Rose
She calms down and smiles
Charlie looks at her, a little peculiarly, but Harriet regains her composure
Sorry
The flash just
The band kicks into a new dance
comes up to the bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his ear
The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and then breaks into Rod Stewart's "   '
" From across the room we hear Stuart singing
(full volume; singing) '
Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up
The young people in the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests start getting into the swing of things
The bagpipe man continues playing
It is clear that he is far too drunk to play
He slowly keels over, drunk
And as he falls over face first, he lands on his Bagpipes
The bagpipes let out an like the last dying throes of a tortured animal
The   extends into the next scene
- (
) Wait 'til you see this place, Harriet
'  - They drive along the beautiful coast
Harriet is still eating
They're listening to
This is Teenage Fan Club
They're from Scotland
They're great
We'll have the whole lodge to ourselves practically
can't wait, Charlie
wish you could be me, so you could know how great it feels to be with you
It sounds wonderful Do you think that would be a good line for a poem
Honestly
It sounds a little Hallmark
Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft
have a habit of sabotaging relationships, and there were a million times during me and you that could have blown this, and  just thank God that  didn't
- Tony is at his desk
The captain kicks open the door, knocking Tony's feet off the desk
The captain is now dressed in suspenders, a loosened tie, and a shirt with pit stains
, Spiletti,  got word from upstairs that you been pokin' your nose into that Ralph Elliot case
Yes, Captain
Don't "yes, Captain" me, Spiletti
You're outta line
This is strictly homicide
Captain,  got this friend
Friend
Yeah, we all got friends, Spiletti
'm warning you, Stay away from this one
Back off, Italian boy
You're getting too close to this one
Captain,  know what 'm doing
Trust me
What's the news
can't believe 'm doing this, but that girl who confused to Ralph Elliot's murder also confessed to other murders
knew she would
knew it
Yeah, apparently she also confessed to killing Abe Lincoln, Julius Caesar, and Warren
Harding
She's a nut, Spiletti
(getting up) Oh, my god
gotta go
Yeah, screw this one up Spiletti and you'll be writing parking tickets for the rest of your days
won't let you down, Captain
Tony exits for a beat, then pokes his head in the doorway
That's much better Captain
(nice again) You think so
Well, thank you very much
- Tony hurries to his car
- They stop at a gas station with a small mini-mart
As Charlie is filling the tank he notices Harriet slipping the key out of the ignition before she walks to the mini-mart for more food
You want anything
Lamb chops, creamed spinach, stuffed tomatoes and a Hershey Bar
Harriet arrives at the little Ma and Pa type mini-mart and smiles to Charlie
If they don't have all that, 'll just take the Hershey bar
'   - Tony stands at the door, buzzing the buzzer to no response
'  - They are still driving along the coast
Charlie is eating his Hershey Bar
Harriet's eyes are becoming a bit glazed now, her movements a little static
She keeps looking behind them and out the window
What do you keep looking behind us for
(joking) Is someone following you, or
They were
think they're gone
(curious; pausing) What do you mean, they were
The gas station guy
thought he was chasing us for a while, but guess he stopped
The gas station guy
Why would the gas station guy chase us
don't know, Charlie
guess for not paying
What do you mean not paying
You didn't pay him for the gas
forgot to pay
didn't want to be away from you for any longer
So, you just left
Yes
And you're an accomplice
He stops mid-bite on his Hershey Bar
He's confused
'm not sure  understand
Look, Charlie, don't you get it
We're a team
(going with it) can play that game
'll get the next gas station
Like Bonnie & Clyde
He and Bonnie continue on the winding road and pass a sign that reads: "   - 40 " - '  - Tony knocks
No answer
He picks the lock and enters
- Rose is tied up and lying in a pool of blood
Tony stops for a beat, draws his gun and slowly walks over to her
Just as he gets there, a
Oh, hi
(practically hysterical) What is it with the women in your family
was just doing a murder series in honor of the wedding
Hey, this is real blood
Yes, Harriet, give it to me
She's a butcher
(Tony reacts) She owns a butcher shop
need a picture of Harriet
Sorry
No can do
You took a picture at the party saw it
It didn't come out
Look, Rose
need a photo
The picture didn't come out
(he waits) It was unflattering
In made her look ten pounds heavier
(he waits) She's my sister
She's been implicated in a crime need the photo to eliminate her as a suspect
And if she's not innocent
If she's, you know, "quirky
" If she's "quirky" we'll save Charlie's life
Rose pulls out a photograph -- Charlie and Harriet
Looking young and in love
- beautiful old Colonial Mansion, nestled in the mountains and forests of the North-West
Romantic and from another day
Charlie and Harriet pull up in front of it
The Valets open the door for them
It's like a castle, Charlie
It's so beautiful
Welcome to the Dry Creek
You just beat the rainstorm
Two hours later and the roads'd probably be closed
Great
If you could help us with the luggage, we have these two in the back seat and
As they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head
She walks straight at the , so only we can see her expression
Her expression is one of simply "losing it"
Harriet
What are you doing honey
Harriet turns around and smiles at Charlie
He smiles back
- Charlie and Harriet stand at the desk
Harriet is not quite paying attention
Her attention span has slipped to none
She's fidgety
She looks around suspiciously at everything and everyone
Welcome, Sir
We have you with us for four nights, Mr
MacKenzie
Dinner reservations are at eight-thirty
Great
Sounds terrific
Also, you might wanna prepare some candles by the bed
We're expecting the rainstorm to get even worse
We might even lose the power tonight
Did you hear that, Harriet
storm
can't think of anything more romantic than the two of us trapped in our room in the middle of a rain storm
(noticing her) You okay, Harriet
Just a little head-ache
(to clerk) Excuse me, is there a drug store in the hotel
want to get some aspirin
Right beyond those trees, Ma'm
Anything you need
Thanks
Don't go anywhere
'll be right back
Harriet walks off to the lobby store, backwards, looking at Charlie
Charlie watches her walk off
The Desk Clerk sits staring at Charlie
You think she's really got a head- ache
What
Ah, nothing
Here's your key
You're in the Oak Room
Charlie looks back at the drug store, where Harriet is shopping
She waves to him
Charlie looks back at the Desk Clerk and grabs the key
: & coming out of a fax machine
'  - , the owner of the Plumbing store, dressed in overalls takes the Fax out and then picks up the phone
That's Ralph Elliot's wife, alright
She had shorter hair in those days
- , the new owner of the studio, dressed in a gee, looks at the same fax
(into phone) Mrs
Richter gain much weight since then, but it's definitely her
'  - , the owner, talks into the phone, holding up the faxed photo of Charlie and Harriet
That's his little lollipop, alright
Boy he loved her
'll tell you, she was a lot of fun
Smart
doll face to boot
'  - Tony is on the phone
Kathy, seen before at the police station, stands with him
Circuits are out from the storm
Tony gets to the police station door and opens it
Kathy follows him
(to Kathy) Keep trying the hotel
Tell the chief just chartered a plane up to Oregon
The Police Captain enters
(points to his hair) See that Spiletti --  gray hair
Every day, Spiletti,  find another one
And that's all due to you
Get out there, and catch me some bad guys
Not now, Captain
(nice again) Sorry
Tony dashes out of the police station and into his car
'   - beautiful suite, with a fireplace burning a big stack of wood, with another stack next to it, with an  in it
Music is playing softly on the stereo
And Charlie and Harriet have just finished making love underneath the covers, illuminated just by the light of the fireplace
This is the best honeymoon  could ever imagine, Harriet
If we had to pack and go home right now, 'd still think it was the greatest honeymoon ever
Harriet doesn't respond
Her head is turned from his
Don't you agree, Harriet
Harriet
He pulls the sheets away from her face to see that she is crying
(wiping her tears) What
What are you crying
What is it
It's nothing
It's just
was just thinking
We're married now
And  always wanted to try and have kids, and
So do
Look, there's nothing more 'd like to do than have, kids, or
It's just,  get scared that certain things will happen, or
What are you talking about
You're gonna be a great Mom
know you will
It's not that, Charlie
What then
You're gonna laugh
Tell me
Of course 'm not gonna laugh
Kids is a big thing
It's hard
'm sure  have the same fears
If we have kids, Charlie, things happen
Kids are healthy and fine, and some aren't, and  don't know if could live with myself if  gave birth to a child with webbed feet
Charlie stops to think about this
Webbed feet
Webbed feet
You're laughing
No, 'm not laughing
You think that's silly
No, no
That's a natural fear
've thought about that fear
It really worries me, Charlie
(quite confused) Well, look, they have, doctors -- assume -- that deal, only with, webbed feet
And, God Forbid, and 'm talking strictly hypothetically, should that happen, we'll find one
(kissing him; happy now) You're the greatest Charlie
(confused, to say the least) Thanks
We should get ready for dinner
/
- small plane flies through the clouds
It's just Tony and the pilot
Dennis never really realizes this is more than a sightseeing tour, and constantly points out scenic points along the way
Out your left side, you can see the Sierra Nevada, which is the largest mountain range west of the Rockies
Great
Rockies
don't care
Oregon
Move
'       - Charlie is dressed very sharply in sport coat and tie
He yells into the bathroom where we can see part of Harriet from behind
You almost ready
The first seating is in five minutes
(from other room) just wanna look good for you, Charlie
That's all
'm sure you look great
'm sure you look
Harriet turns the corner, wearing a nice dress
Her hair looks okay
She's wearing perfume
The only problem is, she has two lines of mascara running down her cheeks
She's been crying
Charlie looks curious
Do  look okay, Charlie
Yes
Well
Charlie points to his own eye
What's wrong
Nothing
You kind of look like Tammy Faye Baker right now
She looks in the mirror
Oh, yeah
She goes back into the bathroom
- The plane descends towards the runway
The rain comes down hard
(
) As we prepare to land, we can see off to our left Lake Shanony, which is
(
) Just land
Don't worry about Lake Shanony
don't give a shit about Lake Shanony
The plane touches down
- Rain pours fantastically on the gothic castle
Wind blows hard
'  (
) toast to our new friends, Charlie and Harriet
- beautiful dining room with a small dance floor
Charlie sits at an intimate table for two with Harriet
small band plays in the b
g
, as the   is making the toast
The five or six other couples in the restaurant also hold up their glass
we're honored to be here for this very special day in
The  at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a Everyone stops and watches and waits
'm sorry to interrupt, Sir
There's a phone call for you from town
(Charlie takes phone) They say it's quite urgent
The toast, as well as the entire room, stops -- almost like an
Hutton commercial, waiting for Charlie's phone call to finish
(curious) Hello
- Tony speaks into the phone frantically
Charlie, you okay
Great
Couldn't be better
Charlie, listen to me
It's her
Harriet is Mrs
She killed Ralph and the two other men
Charlie looks up across the table at Harriet who is completely caught up in the event of seeing how long she can keep her hand in the candle before it hurts
She puts it in, smiles then takes it out
She shakes her hand, and repeats the process
(talking softly) Look, that's great -- it just so happens though, that  met
(louder than he had hoped) Ralph, and much to my delight, not only is she alive, but she's female
thought  told you
Harriet looks at Charlie, very suspiciously
He looks back at her, and tries to smile, pretending that he is having a pleasant, and completely irrelevant conversation
Rose had a picture
It checked out
It's her, Charlie
She is the murderer
Charlie, your food is getting cold
Charlie waves "One Minute" to Harriet, as she watches
So, what do  do
called the police
All the roads are closed, but they're on their way
In the mean time just
The line goes
Hello
(pressing receiver) Hello
What's a matter, Charlie
(to concierge) The phone just went dead
was on the phone and it went dead
That's quite common, sir
'm sure the lines'll be out in the whole city 'til tomorrow
Enjoy your meal, Sir
The Concierge takes the phone away
Charlie turns slowly to Harriet, genuinely scared
What happened, Charlie
Nothing
Nothing happened
Just the lines are down
Phone lines
Suddenly, the band leader continues with his toast
(over microphone) so to these two young people, we wish them a long and happy life together and would like to play their song
The Platters -- "Only You"
The band starts to play "Only You"
People
Harriet and Charlie just stare at each other
He knows
The older couple at the next table,
&
, lean over to their table
How about the traditional Bride & Groom dance
Another couple walks by and pulls them literally out of the their seats and onto the dance floor
Come on
It's a tradition
Charlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing slowly with Harriet
He's scared out of his mind
The music plays in the background
Harriet smiles strangely at him
He tries to smile back, checking all the Exits, planning an escape
Then suddenly, call it luckily,
, interrupts: Excuse me
Could  cut in on your dance
Of course
Sure
Charlie gives her hand away to Mr
Levenstein
He takes Mrs
Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the , when suddenly the
The  is out
The In the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting for an exit to the outside
He arrives in someone's arms on his way

You have to help me

The     and Charlie is in '  again
Her face is near menacing now
She smiles a very disturbed grin
He doesn't know what to say
(much too pleasant) Hello, Charlie
Charlie and her are squared off
Neither speak
Suddenly both of them are lifted into the air
They look down and see the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing them up in the air again and again
The  plays along loudly
Harriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared
Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and down the hallway
Let's take 'em to their room
Yeah, 'm sure they've had enough of these crowds for one night
My dinner
didn't finish my dinner yet
Smile, Charlie
Act like you're having a good time
- / Tony is talking to an attractive young girl behind the airport Rent--Car booth
-- 'm sorry, Sir
The roads are all closed
We can't rent any cars this evening
You have to rent me something
've gotta get up there
My friend's in danger
& '  - The other hotel guests threw them inside
The room is all made up, the sheets are pulled down, the firewood is cut, the  is in the wood
Have a good night, you two
Come on in
Stay for a nightcap
No, you two wanna be alone
See you
(demanding) Stay for a nightcap
Sir,  really don't think  should (shouting) The bellboy is frightened and runs away
(shouting down the hall after him) Harriet pulls Charlie back into the room, frightened that he's leaving
Don't go, Charlie
- Tony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep
(flashing his badge) Excuse me, Sir, 'm with the San Francisco Police Department
'm on official business and 'm afraid have to commandeer your vehicle
(unfazed) No
What do you mean no
happen to know for a fact that you don't have the power to commandeer my vehicle
This is true
(pause) Please can  commandeer your vehicle
Well, where are you going
To The Dry Creek Lodge
'll give you a lift
Well,  don't want a lift,  really want to commandeer the vehicle
Please just let me commandeer the vehicle
Why don't you just let me drive you there
Really,  don't mind, it's on my way
(pause) You're not going to bend on the commandeering thing are you
No
Well, if we get stopped will you at least let me say that  commandeered the vehicle, but  let you drive
'm uncomfortable with that
Please
All right
' Charlie & Harriet are all alone
The voices trail off down the hallway until they disappear
Charlie and Harriet stare at each other
Harriet blocks the door
Charlie looks around the room
The Axe
The Corkscrew
The letter opener
The fountain pen
At this point, everything in the room looks like a potential weapon
Harriet takes the axe
heard you on the phone before, Charlie
There's something 've got to tell you
(frightened) Harriet,
've been married before
already know
About my husbands
Yes
And  was meaning to have a word with you
We could get an annulment
(screams) AAAhhhhhhh
Suddenly the power goes off again
They're both in the dark
scuffle
Charlie has restrained Harriet, throws her in a walk-in closet and locks it
From behind the door, we hear Harriet
Which continues
Charlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky escape
He rushes to the door to escape
He opens it and standing there is Rose
Aaaaah, Rose,  never thought 'd be so glad to see you
Rose smiles
Charlie puts down the axe
The lights flicker back on
(going to the phone) Maybe the phones are working again by now
He listens for a dial tone
Beside the phone he sees a note
He starts to read is: 'Dear, Harriet
just can't handle the commitment
'm leaving you
' Signed, 'Charlie
' And behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised
What the hell is this
didn't write this
And at that moment he turns to find the his head
He ducks just in time
What the fuck
She takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk and the room is in complete
Charlie
Why did you marry Harriet
warned you not to marry her, didn't warned all of them
But none of them listened to me
They all went ahead and married her
She's the pretty one
Where's Harriet
What have you done with my sister, Harriet
Nothing, Rose
If you've done something to my sister, Harriet,  swear to God 'll kill you
We stay in Charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from what he can't see
He stays very silent
(from the closet) Where are you, Charlie
What's going on
Then Rose strikes a match
She lights a candle and comes toward him
He looks around
The window is open
And Charlie is gone
- Tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy, winding road on the way up to the hotel
Tony is drumming on the dash
Could you stop doing that please
-  /   - Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building
The storm continues
Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase him
He rounds the bend
Charlie looks into one room and sees
&
there
There's loud playing in the room Call the police
'  - The Levensteins prepare for bed
Charlie races by their window
Then Rose races by
Call the police
Mr
Levenstein closes the curtains
He can't hear
- Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at several points
Rose then appears on the roof holding the Axe, still
(mostly to herself; slurring most words) Charlie, did you like your note thought it was pretty accurate did all the husbands' notes
can forge anyone's handwriting,  can write in anyone's style
See, 'm an artist
Harriet isn't an artist
Sure she could get a husband, but she could never have done this
And you know what 'm most proud of
What's that, Rose
Harriet never knew
She thought they all just left her
protected her
She's my sister
Charlie turns and runs
Rose chases him
Tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn
(shouting) Charlie
(from closet) Tony, is that you
It's me, Harriet
'm in here
Carefully, Tony opens the closet door
Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie
They're out on the ledge
(not believing) Get on the floor and put your hands behind your back
Harriet willingly goes on the floor
Sure, anything
You've got to save Charlie
Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window
Tony is standing with his back to the window, between it and Harriet
She looks out of the window and screams
Look
It's Charlie
From Harriet's  we see Charlie on the ledge edging along
He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the pursuing Rose, and rushes off
Tony looks behind him out the window
Nobody is there
Nice try
swear to you
It was Charlie
Look
Now there's Rose
Rose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand
No you don't
beg you
Look
It is Rose
Oh no, not again
(he glances at the window) Aaaaah
Rose
' There is opera music playing
Charlie rushes by, past the window
There is a beat and he comes back, staring inside in amazement
Mr
Levenstein is in a Viking outfit
Mrs
Levenstein is in full Norse Regalia
' Charlie gulps and rushes on, hastily pursued by Rose
Rose pulls the Axe back and swings, and the momentum of the swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery icy roof she falls and starts to slide
Just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof, Charlie climbs down the roof
He stands over her
She's about to slip
Her hands are losing strength
Her fingers are slipping
The rain is falling harder and harder
Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for life
He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips
She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder and harder
Charlie now is nowhere near her
He then gets down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the side of the drainpipe to get her
Rose looks up helplessly at him
Not really asking for his help
Not denying it
She's accepted her fate
Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself hanging on for dear life
He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below
Charlie, then with all his strength -- his "where has this strength been my whole life" strength -- pulls her up to the roof next to him
Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over to where Charlie is detaining Rose
The police take her, handcuff her and cart her away
From the corner of the roof appears Tony
hate to bother you on your honeymoon, Charlie, but
Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the doorway
He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet
Thank God
'm sorry  doubted you, but  thought you were the killer, but you were acting pretty strange
thought you were going to leave me, like the others
Thank God they were just murdered
thought they were always leaving me
Below, Rose is put into a police car and taken off
The disappear
So do the crowds
: : ' Charlie is on stage looking very beatnik
He's reading his poetry, but we can't hear it
He nods to someone off stage
Harriet is in the audience, also looking very beatnik with their three year old son, , a miniature beatnik version of Charlie
(
) My dad was right
You don't lose your muse once you're married
Nothing changed, except  gained a great son, Stuart
on Charlie's poetry
The crowd goes crazy
Thank you very much
kicks on
It's Saturday Night by the Bay City Rollers
------- Charlie comes off stage and joins his wife and child at their table
He is very happy
