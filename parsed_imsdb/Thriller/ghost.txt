"" Screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin - The   slowly through clouds of moving dust
Shafts of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere
An eerie netherworld envelops us
Strange ghostly forms appear and disappear in the distance
They seem like apparitions
Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky light
We see hints of a huge demolished space
An old white plaster wall
Momentary blips of light flash across it
of street traffic are heard dimly in the distance
With startling impact, the  of a sledgehammer explodes out of nowhere
The wall shudders
assault the audience
They are loud and jarring
The wall buckles
Chunks of plaster  to the floor
The air fills with new swirls of white dust
The  smashes
Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the atmosphere like searchlights in a fog
huge section of wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air
We hear voices talking
(
) What a mess
(
) told you
Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on the other side of the wall, all wielding
can't breathe
Use your mask, dummy
One of the figures adjusts something over his face
Isolated rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in the air
(singing) "Volga boat
, man
" Whoomph
His hammer pounds the wall
Molly laughs
The    and for the first time we see them , in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful
, in his late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features
Sweat is dripping down his brow, leaving streaks in the dust
, early 30's, removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two-day stubble
Both men have their shirts off
: Suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness
Another thud and more light
We see a hole
The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with something around the edges
Then, with a tug and a loud yank, a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor
Huge clouds of dust fly into the air
Molly looks up, astonished
Sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there
And about eighty years of dust
We have all this height, Sam
We could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs
That would leave all this space
(eyeing her curiously) For what
For space
Just space
Be great for bumper cars
Carl laughs as he looks at Sam
Their bodies, covered with white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures
Sam, this may be none of my business, but 'm concerned you're doing too much coke
Sam glances down at his white body
They all laugh
Hey, Sam, turn around
Sam obeys
Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and the outline of a tuxedo jacket
Her lines are quick, accomplished, and subtly erotic
(offering his body) How 'bout me
Molly nods
She reaches out and superimposes an armless female torso over his
His stomach jumps sensually as she touches it
Molly pulls back to admire her work
He looks like a Greek statue
'll never wash again
Molly laughs
Sam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers
Molly begins to count
All together now
One, (they strike the wall with their hammers
The wall shakes) two, (they pound again
The wall begins to give) three
In unison, they hit it once more
massive section of plaster and metal topples to the ground
New clouds of dust fill the air
Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor
Something rattles inside it, a penny
Hey, look what  found
There's a penny inside
(he hands it to Molly) For luck in our new loft
It's a good omen
(shaking her head, disagreeing) You're the good omen
She glances at him lovingly
Carl looks at the two of them and grins
As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines of the space they are working in
It is a huge loft over four thousand square feet
Banks of windows run east and west
Molly steps back and admires the room
It's gorgeous
You guys lucked out
Hell,  bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment
Sell it
Carl, we just bought it
What  wouldn't do for a place like this
It's gonna be great
&  -  - It is morning rush hour
Sam and Carl, both wearing suits and ties, exit the Wall Street subway station and approach the Headquarters of Market Security Bank & Trust
Oh, by the way, Sam,  had to move your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in Gary Alan
He called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the Danway stuff
Three o'clock was the only time he could make it
Also, the board meeting in
has been confirmed for the 12th
got you on a 9:00 a
m
flight
Sam seems preoccupied
(continuing) Hey, Sam, relax
This isn't brain surgery you're going into
hate pitching to these Japanese guys
They make me nervous
mean, what am  supposed to say, "Who do you think'll win that big Sumo championship"
Sam, you'll be fine
You're great with people
Sam's jacket flares open
He is wearing yellow suspenders
Carl notices
(continuing) Hey, nice
like those
Sam, not completely comfortable wearing them, buttons his jacket
Molly
Carl smiles and then turns to admire a car going by
Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa
That's the car 'm gonna drive when 'm making two hundred grand
Better pay off your Mustang first
,  - Sam and Carl are standing on a crowded elevator
It is deadly quiet
Suddenly Carl elbows Sam and winks
There is something he wants him to do
Sam hesitates a moment, annoyed, and then relents
He clears his throat
So Carl, what did the doctor say
He said it was contagious
Very contagious
shouldn't be going into work today
(he coughs loudly) But what could  do
He sneezes
People on the elevator freeze
And what about the rash
Not good
It's spreading everywhere
On your genitals again
Everywhere
He said be sure not to touch anyone
We see people trying to inch away
Carl coughs again
They hold their breath
The elevator stops at the next floor
All the passengers get off
,   - Sam and Carl, laughing, walk through a large office area bustling with activity
Employees, in various cubicles, are talking on telephones and punching information into computers
Sam heads into his executive office
Carl steps into a cubicle across the aisle
, Sam's secretary, approaches him
Morning, Mr
Wheat
Morning Rose
Listen, when the Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore take them right to the
They're already here
She points to a windowed conference room
Sam turns around and sees a large group of   standing inside
They're early
know
And Andy Dillon called
He said they need $900,000 transferred to Albany by noon
Noon
Damn
He hurries over to Carl's cubicle
He is on the phone
Carl cups the mouthpiece
Hold on
Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by noon
Can you transfer it to his payroll account
Sure
Just let me have your  code
Sam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book
He jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to Carl
Discretion, huh
You bet
'll do it right away
-   - Sam and a group of fifteen somber Japanese businessmen are sitting around a large granite conference table
Sam stands up and speaks a simple greeting to them
(in Japanese) Good morning, Gentlemen
On behalf of Market Security Bank & Trust, welcome you to our city
The men smile happily and nod their heads in unison
Arigato
They look to Sam, expecting more
Uncomfortable, he clears his throat
'm afraid that's the only Japanese know
But  realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to Market Security
Rather, 'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs
As you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York
(his throat goes dry and he takes a sip of water) But, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace
enters the room and hands Sam a piece of paper
It reads "   2
" She hands him a phone
Sam looks surprised
He nods apologetically to his guests
Excuse me
(he picks up the receiver) Hello
: dressed in a long, clay covered smock
She is in a potters studio
are in the background working at their wheels
five-foot high ceramic vase stands beside Molly
It is still wet
She toys with it as she speaks into the phone
man and a woman are lying in bed when the woman's husband suddenly comes home
Frightened, she tells the man he has to leave instantly through the window
He has no time to dress
: straight-faced, listening and trying to look as if it is important
Uh hmm
(
) It's raining outside
The man, running naked along the street, sees some joggers approaching
The entire contingent of Japanese men is staring at Sam
(
) (continuing) One of the joggers calls out
"Hey, do you always go jogging naked
" And the man says, "Yes, always
" Okay
(
) And then the other jogger says, "And do you always wear a condom
" The man looks down, embarrassed, and replies, "Only when it's raining
" Sam squelches a smile
Well, that's just fine
(
) Now just relax and have fun, okay
It's not the end of the world if you lose this account
You've always got me
Thank you
'll remember that
(
) See ya
He hangs up and stares at the Japanese men
short smile crosses his face
: eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky
As the we see that we are inside a building and that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above the street
group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty bringing it in
Suddenly Molly steps  the
Where you guys from, the New York City Ballet
With a gutsy maneuver, Molly leans out over the sidewalk and tries to grab hold of the ropes
She can't reach them
Suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist
She screams
Saved your life
Sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft
She does not think it is funny
You bastard
Don't do that to me
You scared me half to death
Better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street
Here, look out
Sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings out over the sidewalk
Molly gasps
Sam's feet push at the angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the loft
Quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it in
The workmen applaud
Molly eyes him with admiration
Suddenly we hear a voice call out
(
) Sam
Molly
Anybody home
Molly looks to Sam
Carl
Did you invite him
(under his breath) couldn't keep him away
Carl enters, shakes Molly's hand, and pats Sam on the back
Hi, Moll
Hi, Sam
So, how's it goin
Before they can answer, a  turns to Molly
(
) Where do you want this
In the bedroom
- As the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly decorated loft for the first time
It is painted now in lovely pastels
The floor, a huge gymnasium-like expanse, is lacquered with polyurethane
Furniture and boxes are piling up along the walls
Dominating the space, with a kind of surreal presence, are a large number of Molly's sculptures and ceramics
There is also a vintage jukebox
Carl is impressed
Wow
The place looks great
Really great
You like it, huh
"Like" is hardly the word
never imagined it would be this beautiful
This is incredible
mover lugs in a heavy old chair
Molly sees it
Sam, you kept that chair
What do you mean
It's comfortable
For
love that chair
But it doesn't go with anything
It goes with me
It's okay, 'll paint it
Sam pinches her ass
Molly smiles
-  - Sam, Molly, and Carl are sprawled out on the floor, eating from Cartons of Chinese food
Frank, a gray cat, eats beside them
Unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere
It was the middle of December
was sitting in my old office, the one Charlie's in
Suddenly,  heard this woman screaming
thought someone'd been shot or something
They took away my MasterCard
It was Christmas, for godssake
She was four thousand dollars over her limit
It wasn't four thousand
And 'd already sent in the payment
You're the ones that lost it
She's still angry
No 'm not
The cat begins nibbling Sam's food
Get outta here, Frank
(the cat scampers away) You should have seen her
All pink and flushed
Her skin was gorgeous, like a rose
And she's screaming, demanding to see the president
So Wilton brought her to me
You
You weren't even a  yet
She didn't know that
Carl smiles
Can you believe it
And the next thing  know, he's telling me his life story
couldn't believe it
Everything
About his divorce, how he'd just arrived in New York, how he didn't know any women
And all with this Montana accent
What's a Montana accent
The one you always slip into it when you get nervous
"Yes, Ma'am
Thank you, Ma'am
Can  fondle your breasts, Ma'am
" (laughing) wasn't nervous
Admit it
You liked me
You were interested
(matter of factly) thought you were cute
Cute
(looking at Carl) Do you believe this
should have been Picasso's mistress
should have been living in Barcelona or Paris
But no, 'm moving in with a New York banker who thinks 'm cute
She looks at Sam and grins
Carl is staring at Molly, obviously turned on by her
He is embarrassed when she catches his gaze and quickly looks away
'  - Molly, dressed only in a -shirt, is sitting at her potters wheel throwing a series of pots
Sam enters the studio
He is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans
What are you doing
felt inspired
At 2:00 am
She nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in front of her
Sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, molding and forming the clay
She is forceful, assured, gifted
The clay responds to her slightest effort
Slowly, almost unconsciously, Sam reaches for her shoulders and begins kissing them
(continuing) You notice Carl's eyes today
They were all over you
What
Are you jealous
Sam, let me tell you something
He's not even looking at me
It's you he idolizes
He doesn't see me at all
Anyway, he's not my type
Sam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay
Molly looks up at him
(continuing) What are you doing
feel inspired
His hands dig into the clay
Molly smiles
Their fingers seem to dance together
After a moment, she reaches up to him, her clay-covered fingers streaking his face and curving down to his chest
Sam grins and reaches down to her
: ' as it presses two buttons on his jukebox
We watch as the mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers it to the turntable
The arm hovers over the record and then descends
It begins to play
The song is "Unchained Melody" by the Righteous Brothers
are dancing in the middle of the dark loft
Moonlight pours through the windows and shines off the floor
Wads of packing paper swirl sensuously around their feet
Molly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back
The moment is sweet and erotic
We watch as Sam slowly draws his fingers down over Molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her eyes, her lips
Sam slides his hands under Molly's -shirt, slowly moving them toward her breasts
Her breathing slows
They dance silently, her hair swaying in the soft light
We hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished floor
Sensuously, Molly's shirt lifts above her navel as Sam presses into her
Their stomachs touch and part and touch again
She bites her lip
Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his jeans
Sam leans into Molly and nips at her neck
She stops dancing
Her eyes close
She stands absolutely still
Sam's hands move to her backside
He pulls her closer
: - , making love on the livingroom carpet
Paper and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across the floor
For all their sensuality, it is their hands and eyes that are most expressive, revealing a tenderness that is deeply moving
Their lovemaking is full of love
The song ends
The jukebox arm retracts and gently slides the record back into its slot
: - Sam and Molly are lying together silently
Molly gazes at him
What's the matter
The matter
can tell
Nothing
really
You're worried, aren't you
About moving in together
No
Not really
Then what
The promotion
don't know
lot of things just don't want the bubble to burst
Whenever something good happens to me 'm just afraid 'm going to lose it
Molly gently strokes his head
You know what
What
love you
really love you
He smiles and strokes her cheek
Ditto
Suddenly the
blares into the room
Sam jumps up, grabbing the remote control unit from under his buttocks
Molly laughs as he turns the
The news is on and they are showing the remains of an airline disaster
Sam stares at the tube
Oh Jesus
Another one
Don't watch that stuff
He motions to wait
Dead bodies litter the screen
It is estimated that 34 people died in the crash, the second in less than two weeks
The
goes
Sam, confused, spins around
Molly is holding the remote control
She nods for him to lie down
should cancel my
trip
These things always happen in threes
Threes
Sam, get serious
Besides, you lead a charmed life
Yeah
So did they
Sam looks at her and then back at the screen
(continuing) Amazing, huh
(he snaps his fingers) Just like that
Blackout
- '  - Sam is sitting at his computer
His address book with his access codes is sitting open beside him
He seems perplexed by something happening on the screen
After pushing a series of buttons and getting the same response, he whacks the computer on the side
Carl, walking in the door, sees him
Sam looks up sheepishly
glitch
What's up
The Mark Greenberg and Larry White accounts
can't get in
Your code doesn't work
changed it
Why
What's up
Nothing
just want to nose around a bit
Can you keep your mouth shut
Yeah, sure
Tell me, what's going on
think 've stumbled onto something
There's too much money in these accounts
Too much money
That's ridiculous
How could there be too much money
That's what  keep asking myself
It must be the computer
've been checking
Yeah, Mr
Fixit
(he hits the computer like Sam did and laughs) Come on, move over
Let me see what can do
Not yet
'm gonna dig around a bit
Okay, okay
Just call me when you're ready for help
(he heads for the door) So, what are you and Moll doing tonight
We're going to the theatre
She wants to see "Macbeth" at the Spring Street Repertory
Carl winces
Sam smiles
- Sam and Molly are sitting in the fifth row of a crowded auditorium
He is sound asleep
scene from "Macbeth"
Sam begins to snore
Molly grabs his nose
He jerks awake
Molly grins
- Bright marquee lights sparkle overhead as Sam and Molly exit the theatre
It is a beautiful brisk night
loved it
could tell
She smiles and squeezes his arm
They walk silently down a dark street, heading toward their loft
The pavement is full of shadows
(continuing) Did  tell you what Marcia said
Six times
Six
No  didn't
Sam, don't be so blase
'll have two major pieces in the show
The New York Times reviews her gallery all the time
This could be huge
Molly, the "New York Times" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school
Who cares what The New York Times thinks
Eight million readers, that's who
Your work's beautiful
That's a fact, Moll
It doesn't matter what anyone thinks
We can tell from the expression on Molly's face that it does
Sam puts his arm around her
She nestles close to him
Then, suddenly, she stops and looks up
There is an unexpected seriousness in her voice
(continuing) want to marry you, Sam
(taken aback) What
've been thinking about it for days
More than thinking
want to do it
want to jump in whole hog
(she pauses) What is that look for
(staring at her) It's just been so long since mean, you never wanted to talk about it
There is a long pause
Do you love me, Sam
What do you think, Moll
How come you never say it
What are you talking about
You say "ditto"
It's not the same
People say " love you" all the time
It doesn't mean anything
Sometimes you need to hear it
Sam stops and stares at Molly
He pauses quietly
He is about to speak when  '  emerges from the shadows behind him
Molly gasps
Sam spins around
is standing in the darkness between two buildings
He stares at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk
Sam and Molly stand motionless
The man hesitates and then begins walking the other way
Molly exhales a deep breath
Sam takes Molly's arm and they continue briskly down the street
Suddenly they hear  coming after them
What should we do
Let me handle this
Sam stops abruptly and turns around
gun is staring him in the face
Molly screams
Your wallet
Sam waits a beat
Give it to him
Sam reaches for his jacket
The Mugger grabs his wrist and then carefully pulls the wallet out himself
Take the money
Just leave the wallet and my
He swipes Sam across the head
Molly screams
The Mugger whacks her across the face
Sam explodes, plowing into the mugger with all his might
Sam, No
There is a wild, all out brawl
Sam fights like a mad man
Suddenly the  goes off
The Mugger panics and takes off running
Sam charges after him
Sam
The two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows
Sam gives up
Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward Molly
We can see Molly dimly at the end of the block as Sam approaches
She is screaming for help
Frightened, Sam calls out
Molly
She doesn't answer
Sam tenses and starts running toward her
He is just three feet away when suddenly he stops
An expression of pure terror overwhelms his face
: - drenched in blood
Her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock
Panting, she stoops down to the curb as She grabs hold of something lying in the shadows and pulls it toward her
It is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms
Sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands beside Molly
His eyes are awash in horror and confusion
He seems unable to move
on his face as the full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes
Suddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream
No
He jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold of his motionless form
His hands make a strange  as they pass right though it
It is terrifying
Sam jumps up, crazed, frenzied, and begins circling Molly
It is as though he is trying to undo what has been done
(continuing) This isn't happening
It's not happening
He reaches out to Molly for help
His hand cuts through her shoulder
He screams
People are running down the street
The sound of can be heard in the distance
Two  run toward Sam
He yells out at them
(continuing) Help me
They run right through him
He gasps in stunned terror
Sam watches helplessly as they reach his body
Molly looks up and begins screaming hysterically
One of the Men grabs her as the other goes for Sam's wrist
There is no sign of life
The first Man holds Molly back as his friend stoops down and begins some form of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
There is no response
Sam bends down, trying desperately to help
It is a futile gesture
Do it
Do it
The Man bangs on Sam's chest
Blood gushes from the wound
Molly recoils
He bangs again
: - Sam shoots up in bed, panting
It is dark
He stares around the loft in sudden confusion
With a lurch he flicks on the night light
Molly is lying beside him, her head buried beneath a pillow
Sam seems stunned
Molly
Molly
Tears stream down his face
Molly stirs
Sam
What's the matter
Is something wrong
Molly
Sam is so relieved to hear her voice that he can hardly breathe
What is it, honey
Molly, groggy, tries to sit up
Sam reaches out for her
As she turns around, we see staring at the camera
It speaks
(mocking him) What is it, honey
Sam bolts upright, screaming
It is a scream so consumed by terror that one fears it will never stop
: - asleep in bed
He is thrashing at his pillow and moaning
Suddenly, a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder
Sam jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets
: '
Molly is sitting on the bed looking at him, afraid
Sam stares down at her
He is breathing heavily, not trusting his own senses
His hands clutch at the wall
What's happening to me
Suddenly, a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a host of glowing forms, radiating an intense inner light, float before us
blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite vortex behind them
Sam is awed and confused
We sense that the light is enchanting him
The entire room begins to disappear in the light
Molly screams
Don't leave me
need you, Sam
Sam turns and sees Molly, only she is not in the bed
She is back on the street
To his amazement, he is on the street, too, still bathed in the soothing light
Frightened, he calls out to her
Molly
She does not hear him
He calls again
(continuing) Molly
There is no response
Sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a moment
He is torn between Molly and the light
Then, in a painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and walks toward Molly
At that instant, the light behind him disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing
There is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates into the void
Sam is left on the dark pavement
He stands there a moment, as if in shock, and then begins running toward Molly
An  is rounding the corner
: - Swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush
The wails into the night
- Sam's body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort to save him
After a moment, he looks up at Molly
We can tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless
Sam yells
Don't stop
'm not dead
Molly, kneeling over Sam's body, grabs him and begins to cry in long terrible sobs
- , comforting Molly, accompanies her from one of the emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of swinging doors into a separate waiting area
We see and   stand up and approach her
Sam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but then seems torn, afraid to leave his body
He turns back just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled into the corridor and parked alongside the wall
Sam seems stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it
wrinkled   approaches Sam and joins him on the bench
He begins talking
So, what happened to you
Sam is startled, amazed that the man can see him
What
You're new, huh
can tell
Are you talking to me
Relax
It ain't like before, you know
It's a whole new ball-a-wax
Who are you
'm waiting for my wife
She's in 4C
Cardiac wing
She's fighting it
The man sticks his head into the green sheet covering Sam's body
His head disappears
Sam is terrified
(continuing) Shot, huh
That'll do it every time
Poor bastard
Well, get used to it
You could be here a long time
(leaning in close) 'll tell you a secret
Doors ain't as bad as you think
Zip zap
They ain't nothin' at all
You'll see
You'll catch on
Suddenly there is a loud  and we see several operating furiously on an Old Man lying on the table beside them
It is a life threatening situation and they seem to be failing
(continuing) He ain't gonna make it
've seen it a million times
He's a goner
See
Here they come
Lucky bastard
Could have been the other ones
You never know
Before Sam can understand what is happening the entire room fills with a strange preternatural light
Suddenly he looks up and freezes
The amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the operating table
They are emitting a powerful light
Hurry, we're losing him
What'd  tell you
Bingo
The glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help extract it from his body
His physical form changes instantly from a solid object into an ethereal substance
Sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit upward
They evaporate through the ceiling
He's gone
The light in the room grows dull instantly
Nurses cover the dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away
Sam turns to the Old Man
Who are you
What's happening
The Man isn't there
An Orderly approaches the gurney with Sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator
Sam jumps in front of him
(continuing) No
: '
as the stretcher begins to roll right through him
The penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam
He stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly intersects with his
It is a stunning moment of extraordinary strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the Orderly's body passing through his
It is like a glimpse of ultimate chaos, the universe within
Then, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is still shaking
He stares up at the ceiling
Oh God, help me
: '
as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur
The hallway grows dark
It is as though Sam is blacking out
- Slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness
It takes a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral
The   along rows of mourners as seen from ' He seems to be floating among them
We hear snippets of conversations
It all seems strangely odd and disjointed
Time seems unfixed, malleable
We see a  standing beside the grave
As we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit
The
Sam's associates from the bank are among the mourners
(continuing) All that we treasure, our friends, our loved ones, our body, our mind, are but on loan to us
We must surrender them all
We are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end
Sam notices a  in a fancy print dress comforting one of the mourners
The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves
Sam is surprised
He looks behind him, but no one is there
As he turns back, the woman is walking away
She appears just like any normal person until she approaches a large gravestone and passes right through it
Sam is shocked
As our loved one enters eternal life, let us remember that love, too, is eternal, that although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness
Suddenly, Molly
Sam spots her
The Molly
She does not respond
, her sister, leans over to her
Tears form in Molly's eyes
hand reaches out to give her a tissue
Molly looks up
It is Carl
She gives him her hand
He squeezes it with affection
and into Your hands we commend his spirit
May he rest in peace
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost
Amen
The casket is lowered into the ground
Molly approaches the grave
She us a little unsteady
Carl takes her elbow shovel is placed in her hands
With great emotional effort she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket
It lands with a  finality
Sam shudders
: - leaving the cemetery
We hear them talking
What time you going back to work
What's the buzz on Digital
It's sad
He was so young
How's your new Honda
Going away this weekend
: - desperately alone
Down the hill, people are getting back into their cars
Sam can see Molly being let into a limousine
He stands there staring at his own casket, grieving
Then, after a moment, he turns away
Separating from his body, from his own grave site, he runs after her
: - Molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft surrounded by  and
young , her niece, cuddles in her lap
People are eating and milling around
Slowly
It ends on Sam, standing alone in a corner
In the midst of all the activity he is lost and alone
: Raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously
Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it
bowl begins to appear
The camera pulls back and reveals Sam
He is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his chest, rocking aimlessly
Molly looks away from the bowl she is forming
It distorts and bends
Angry, she digs her finger into it
The bowl disintegrates
Tears form in her eyes
Frank jumps up on the bench beside her
Molly stares sadly around the room
Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to the air
Oh God, Sam
Sam looks up
(continuing) picked up your shirts this morning
don't know why
Mr
Reynolds said to tell you hello
broke into tears
It's so hard
Sam walks over to Molly
Desperate for contact, he reaches out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back
(continuing) think about you every minute
It's like you're still here, like  can feel you, Sam
He stares at her, hoping, wondering
am here, Moll
am
Suddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss
Molly spins around
The cat scans the room
Unexpectedly, Sam's and the cat's eyes meet
With a wild , the cat jumps from the bench and takes off running
Sam recoils
Molly stands up
Frank, what's wrong
Frank
The cat is nowhere to be seen
All of a sudden, Molly freezes
Sam is standing right beside her
It is almost as though she senses his presence
(continuing; whispering) Sam
She holds very still for a moment
Sam watches breathlessly, loving her, wanting her
Then quietly, hopefully, he reaches out
It is a useless gesture
In a moment of great poignancy, Molly shakes her head and walks right through him
He remains , alone
- Sam, stands in the corner of a large, walk-in closet, watching as Molly goes through his effects
Boxes, scattered underfoot, are filling up with his life's possessions
Molly reaches for a shirt
Wait, Moll
Not that one
That's my favorite
She tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater
It is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big
Sam recognizes it
Molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek
After a moment she puts it back
Then, in a surprising outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves
Everything comes flying off
Sam reaches out to console her
(continuing) Molly, don't
Unexpectedly, Carl comes rushing into the room
He takes hold of Molly and sits her on the bed
(continuing) Say something
Help her, Carl
It's hard
It's very hard
(sarcastic) Oh good
That's really good
: - Molly and Carl are standing over the kitchen table folding piles of Sam's clothes and placing them into boxes
As Molly lifts one of Sam's jackets, something falls from a side pocket
It is his small black leather address book
Sam stares at it with recognition
Carl sees the book fall and stoops to pick it up but Molly gets it first
Sam's address book
She skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes are too powerful for her
She places it carefully into a box labeled "Sam's Things -- Valuable" and continues packing
She finds the old jar with the penny in it
It's marked "For Luck"
She holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it on the nightstand beside the bed
Carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of Sam's jackets
He examines them
Dave Brubeck
Newport '86
Should toss 'em
No
Molly, we hated that concert
She takes the stubs and lovingly puts them in the box
Sam groans
Carl finds a half used package of Rolaids
Molly takes them from his hand and puts them in the box, too
Oh, you want to save those
Rolaids
What are you doin' Moll
Molly just stares for a moment
miss him, Carl
Carl comes over and takes her hand
We all do
Molly buries her head on his shoulder
Carl strokes her hair
: Carl lifting a pile of boxes and carrying them to the door
Suddenly Molly yells out
Wait
Wait
Not that one
She hurries over and pulls the "Valuable" box from the stack in his arms
He looks at it with surprise
Oh, shit
'm sorry
don't know how that got in there
He turns to the door and then back to Molly
(continuing) Hey, Moll
Why don't you come
It's like summer outside
No
Just for a stroll
It'd be good to get out
Molly shakes her head and turns away
can't do it Carl
Carl, annoyed, walks over to her
Molly
you're not the one who died
Molly stops and looks at him
He has struck home
After a moment she nods her head
Okay
Just a short walk
He gently squeezes her shoulders
Thata girl
Before Sam even understands what is happening, they are exiting the loft
Sam jumps up and runs after them
Hey, Molly
Wait
The door slams shut
Sam is locked inside
Frightened and desperate, he rushes for the door knob
His hand sinks through it
There is a strange sound, like  , as it penetrates the metal and wood
Frightened, he yanks it back
Sam circles the space several times and then returns to the door
Clenching his teeth, he reaches out again
As his hand pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle resistance
The hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his ghostly form presses into it
We sense Sam's fear as his entire arm
The grating shudders up his spine
The sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but Sam does not pull back
Slowly he edges in and presses his face into the molecules of the wood
: '
as atoms and electrons spin past him at frightening speed
There is a sense of a universe in total chaos
Terrifying charge through his body
: pulling back from the door
He is trembling
- He is sitting in a corner singing quietly to himself
"Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and singing this'll be the day that
" He stops, realizing the last word of the song
He sits silently, staring at the wall
Suddenly, there is a  at the door
Sam's eyes shoot up
The door begins to open
Sam stands up
His face begins to tighten
We know instantly that something is wrong
His eyes fill with a fury we have not seen before
The Mugger, the man who killed Sam, is entering the loft
He has a key in his hand and puts it in his pocket
Sam is stunned
The Mugger locks the door
Sam goes wild
He shoots at the man with all his might, attacking him unceasingly, but with no effect
His hands and feet pass right through him
You motherfucking bastard
What the hell are you doing here
What are you doing
The Mugger, unaware that anything is going on, glances around nervously as he moves through the vast space
Entering the bedroom, the Mugger goes to the dresser and quickly examines the drawers
He is very neat, careful to leave no sign that he was there
He seems to be looking for something but cannot find it
Suddenly we hear a   in the front door
The Mugger seems startled
He dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly behind one of the large sculptures
We hear the door
Molly is standing there
Sam goes crazy
Molly, no
Get out
Molly closes the door and locks it shut
Sam freezes as she heads for the bedroom
She walks right past the Mugger
To Sam's horror she stops and turns to look around
There is a curious expression on her face
Seeing nothing she continues through the loft
The Mugger pulls out his gun
Sam looks on in absolute terror
Molly's purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove her clothes
She turns on the radio
Sam doesn't know what to do
The Mugger seems excited by Molly's semi-nudity
He begins skirting the edges of the loft, moving toward the bedroom
Sam is crazed
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Frank appears at the Mugger's feet
Sam's eyes light up
He drops to his knees, crawls over to him, glares into his eyes, and screams
- and jumps straight up
His claws shoot out at the mugger's face, ripping into the flesh near his eye
Blood appears
The mugger sees it dripping through his fingers
The sight of it upsets him
He grabs the cat angrily by the neck
It
Molly in her bra, peers from the bedroom
Frank, what's wrong
The Mugger holds the cat's mouth shut
Seeing and hearing nothing, Molly steps back into the bedroom
The Mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor
Holding his eye, he gets up and rushes for the exit
Sam runs after him, but the door closes before he can get through
He is left inside
- stares at the closed door in a wild panic
He doesn't know what to do
Then, summoning all of his courage, he takes a blind, running slow motion leap and charges through it
'
There is a brief sense of passing through a molecular force field, a miniature universe inside the door
- as he emerges from the door and lands on the other side
He seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with himself
- The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward the subway
patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his eye
Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes
Hordes of people crowd the sidewalk
The crush of humanity is frightening
Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at him
Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their arms cutting through his ghostly form
Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people approach him from all angles
We hear a   roll through Sam's feet and he nearly falls over trying to avoid it
His instincts will not let go
barrage of images and  assaults Sam
It is more than he can handle
Still, he refuses to give up
He stays close to the Mugger
- The Mugger heads down a flight of steps into the
- The Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car
Sam stands near a corner of the train watching him
Suddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening
One of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward him
As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes right through him
It takes Sam a moment to realize what is happening, but then it is too late
- With unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam
The attack is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how to defend himself
With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs hold of him and slams him into the subway door
Sam's head plows right through it
on Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel rushes past him
There is a panicked look on his face
The look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling down on him
on Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost as the other train shoots by the window
With a huge gasp, Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the Ghost's hold
The Ghost flies after him, screeching
Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds himself on the bridge between the subway cars
The subway Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane look
Stay off
This is mine
With shocking impact, the Ghost's fist goes flying into the window
To Sam's terror and amazement, the window
The Ghost smiles
Passengers scream and Sam dives for cover
Sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion
Suddenly, the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel into broad daylight
- The train stops at an elevated subway platform in Brooklyn
'
Sam sees the Mugger exiting the train and frantically rushes after him
- Sam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the street
321   - The Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place
The streets are lined with old apartment buildings
Many windows are boarded up
, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of heavy machinery onto the pavement
Sam hears   coming from a storefront church and notices a sign, "   , ,  , " He looks up to a third story window and sees a similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on the street
He seems curious, but then realizes that the Mugger is nearly halfway down the block
He turns and rushes after him
321   - Sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321 Prospect Place
- Sam follows the Mugger into the building and watches as he opens the mail box for
4D
The name scribbled across it is
There's no mail
'  - Sam enters Willie's apartment
It is a squalid affair
Peeled paint chips litter the floor
The bed is unmade
Willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops in the keys to Molly's loft
Sam sees his wallet
His driver's license, bank , and a photo of Molly are there, too
Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch, knowing it will have no effect
He turns instead to a window and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist
Nothing happens
Damn
Willie dials the phone
Someone comes on the line
She came home
couldn't get it
Give me a couple of days
'll go back
He hangs up
Sam stares at him in wild confusion
Get what
Who the hell are you
What were you doing at Molly's
What the hell's going on
Willie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies down
After a moment he reaches over and takes Molly's photo from the drawer
He studies it slowly
Sam stands by the door in a state of motionless rage
There is nothing he can do
(continuing) Stay away from her
- Sam storms down the street
His movements seem undirected, utterly aimless
He is seething inside
Suddenly Sam looks up
An old   is walking down the street talking loudly to a   tagging along beside her
As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to the side
The Short Woman, however, walks right through it
Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself
Sam, unsettled, rushes away
As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of  explodes out of nowhere
Sam jumps into the street, gasping
phonograph needle  across a record and the woman's voice booms out: ' Sorry 'bout that
to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window
The blares out once more and  of gospel fill the street
Sam looks up
He is back in front of the storefront church with the sign for    , ,  , , hanging overhead
Below it is another sign
"Contact the dearly departed
$20
00"
Sam stares at the sign with curiosity
The  is compelling
After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open door
- record player is sitting near the storefront window, a makeshift microphone placed in front of it
Several rows of folding chairs face a raised platform with nothing on it
number of people are sitting there, mostly women
One gets the sense that this is a cross between a waiting room and a meeting hall
black  steps up on the platform and calls out: Rosa Santiago
tucks a Spanish paperback romance into her purse and heads to a door at the rear of the hall
Sam follows after her
- Mrs
Santiago enters a dark room with a window and door leading to a side street
paisley bedspread is tacked over the window
In the center of the room is a round seance table
Two heavyset sisters,  (39), and  (36), are standing beside an open closet
It is empty
Please be seated
Mrs
Santiago sits at the table
She seems apprehensive
Clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as though demonstrating that they are solid
My sister will be with us soon
She steps back out and closes the door
Louise inserts a tape into a boom box and then steps forward
Sister Oda Mae
Grant us the gift of your all-seeing presence
Appear for us now
She turns back to the closet and opens the door
Like magic, , 41, appears standing inside
She is a black woman in a white tunic
The whiteness of her garment makes it look as if she is glowing in the dark
Mrs
Santiago is wide-eyed
Sam smiles as Oda Mae steps into the room
Mrs
Santiago
Buenos dias
She takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it to Oda Mae
Clara graciously intercepts the money
understand you are hoping to contact your husband
Si
Si
Well,  believe he's gonna be with us today
Oh, tsank you, tsank you
Tears well up in her eyes
She crosses herself several times
But there's no telling about the other world
You gotta cast out all doubt
You gotta believe
Do you believe
(nodding her head vigorously) Si
Si
believe
believe
And remember, we don't make no promises
can phone up there till 'm blue in the face, (she points to the ceiling) but it don't necessarily mean he's gonna be home
Them folks go shopping, they play bingo
It's just like here
You can't always get 'em
Mrs
Santiago, utterly fascinated, nods understandingly
Sure lady
Oda Mae's eyes glance up curiously for a second, as though she heard something, and then she continues
Okay, let's get ready then
Sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves behind Oda Mae
The moment feels rehearsed, theatrical
Oda Mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes
There is a hush in the room
Her body begins to tremble
Mrs
Santiago clutches her chair
Suddenly Oda Mae breaks out of her trance
We got a problem here
don't think he's in
Wait
feel something
Did he know someone who's passed over, someone named Anna
Mary
Consuela
Maria
Si, si
His mama
She's Maria
Ah
knew it
He's with his mama
(sarcastic) Oh my God
Oda Mae's eyes dart uncomfortably around the room
'm afraid this is gonna be too hard
Now  got two souls  gotta contact
don't know about that
It's difficult, you know
The pain
The effort
pay more
How much
How much
Twenty dollars
Way to go
Milk her for every penny
Oda Mae jumps up and stares at her sisters
They look back at her curiously
They can't figure out what's wrong
Neither can Oda Mae
Mrs
Santiago reaches into her purse
twenty dollar bill changes hands
Sam watches, amazed at it all
Oda Mae sits down and goes back into her trance
Her eyeballs roll up into their sockets
/ Praise the Lord
Thank you, Jesus
Oda Mae is beginning to shake again
The two women grab her shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair
Suddenly her whole body stiffens
/ (continuing) Have mercy
Have mercy
Mrs
Santiago stares on in amazement
After a moment Oda Mae's body collapses in a heap
Then, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes a normal pose
After several seconds to get her bearings, Oda Mae begins to speak
Only now she has an entirely new voice
It sounds deep and hoarse, like an old man's
For all its put on theatricality, it is strangely convincing
Welcome, Rosa Santiago
You are fortunate today
The channel is clear
Many spirits are gathering
(scanning the room) Yeah
Where
Oda Mae jerks
Her eyes dart nervously around the room
My husband
(a bit uneasy) can feel his vibration
Yes, yes, he is drawing toward us now
can see him coming
Julio
Julio
How is he
How does he look
Oh, he is a very handsome man
(surprised) Handsome
In our Father's Kingdom we are all handsome
(understanding) Julio
Sam looks on dismayed
He is standing before me
He is wearing a black suit
black suit
Oh yes, yes
He was buried in that
Mrs
Santiago begins to cry
Sam looks around the room with growing disgust
Then he leans over to Oda Mae and yells into her ear
What a crock of shit
Oda Mae nearly falls off her chair
She spins around
Who's there
Sam is stunned
Clara and Louise look at one another in total confusion
This is obviously not part of the act
Mrs
Santiago seems frightened
(continuing) Where are you
(looking around) Who
Oda Mae screams and jumps up thrashing at the air
Her knee kicks the table and sends it toppling
Mrs
Santiago is terrified
Julio
Julio
What's going on
Get out of here
Leave me alone
Mrs
Santiago doesn't know what to do
She begins to cry
Who are you talking to
Clara runs up to Oda Mae
Keep him away
Louise looks at the empty room
Are you talking to me
Do something
Help me
Clara just stares at her sister
Sam is excited and amazed
don't believe this
Hey you
My name is Sam Wheat
Can you hear me
Sam Wheat
Stop it
Say my name
Sam Wheat
Say it
Talk to me, Oda Mae
Say something
Sam Wheat
Sam nearly falls on his face
Clara's eyes widen
She is more confused than ever
Jesus
Samweet
Oda Mae runs into the closet
It has a false panel leading to a hidden chamber on the left side and she barricades herself inside it
Clara and Louise stand outside pulling on the handle
They seem frightened
/ Oda Mae
Oda Mae
- Oda Mae is rocking back and forth on the floor praying
Sam's feet enter the frame beside her
Lord,  swear, no more cheatin' promise, Lord
don't want to go to hell
'll do anything
Gimme a penance
Just make him go away
Go away
Hell no
'm stayin' right here
Oda Mae screams, jumps back into the closet, and bolts up against the door
It tears from its hinges and falls into the seance room, nearly crushing Louise
Mrs
Santiago runs out screaming
Oda Mae takes one look around and collapses in a dead faint
'  - Beads of sweat collect on Oda Mae's brow and cheeks
She seems feverish
Clara and Louise are sitting beside her with damp towels nervously soaking up the perspiration
Oda Mae appears to be talking to herself until we   and reveal Sam nearby
My mama, her mama, may they rest in peace, they had de gift
Mama always said  had it, but  never did
She tol' me all about it, how it felt an' all
But now that it's happenin' don't know what to do
You're scarin' me half to death
Please, you gotta go away, you gotta find someone else
Clara and Louise look at one another with growing concern
Someone else
Are you outta your mind
'm gettin' there fast
(she pushes Louise's hand) Leave me alone
Not till you help me
Where are you
Where
'm right here
'm standing right beside you
(mimicking his words) "'m standing right beside you
" (she pauses and looks up) Are you white
What
Oh God,  knew it
He's white
Why me
Louise looks at her sister and shakes her head
Listen, damn it
You can help me
There's a woman, Molly Jensen
She's in terrible danger
The man who killed me broke into our apartment
He's going to go back
You've gotta warn her
Why would she listen to me
She has to
This man's a killer
He's got a key
Forget it, mister
can't
It's just a phone call
You're all 've got
Lookit
'm not leavin' till you help me
don't sleep anymore, so  can sit here day and night
don't care how long it takes
can talk forever
Oda Mae gulps, a horrified expression on her face
- The telephone rings
Molly, preparing dinner, runs to answer it
Hello
(
) Molly
Is this Molly speaking
Yes
(
) My name is Oda Mae
'm a spiritual reader and adviser
(she hesitates) 'm calling for a friend of yours
He asked me to call
This is important
You gotta believe me
Don't be afraid
Who is this
(
) got a message from Sam
(stunned) What
(
) Sam Wheat
He asked me to call
Molly slams down the receiver, panting
For several seconds she doesn't move
Slowly, she walks to the couch and sits down
She is trembling
'  - Oda Mae hangs up the phone
What'd  tell you
You gotta go there
Look,  don't care what you do to me, 'm not goin' nowhere
'  - Sam is sitting on the edge of Oda Mae's bed, singing
It sounds like he's been singing for hours
He is very hoarse
"'m Henery the Eighth  am / Henery the Eighth  am,  am / 'm gettin' married to the widow next door / She's been married seven times before / And every one was an Henery / Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam / 'm her eighth old man 'm Henery / Henery the Eighth  am,  am / Henery the Eighth  am / Second verse same as the first / 'm Henery the Eighth am
" Oda Mae bolts upright in her bed, her hands over her ears
Okay
Okay
'll go
You just shut your mouth
-   - - Sam and Oda Mae are sitting at the rear of a crowded bus
She appears to be talking to herself
can't believe 'm doin' this gotta be a crazy lady goin' into the city with you
never go there
What the hell you doin' in my life, huh
Why me
Several people move away
- Oda Mae approaches the loft building and buzzes Molly's apartment
She waits a few moments
There's nobody there
Just wait
No, sir
did what  promised said 'd come and 'm here
didn't say anything 'bout waitin'
Just one more time
Please
It's a big place
Oda Mae turns to leave
Sam, desperate, starts to sing
(continuing) "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety nine bottles of beer," Oda Mae stops
She turns back to the buzzer and rings once more
Suddenly Molly answers
(
) Hello, who's there
(nervous) Don't go away
It's Oda Mae Brown called you last night
Your friend Sam says you gotta talk to me
There is a  as Molly hangs up
- Molly walks away from the intercom, shaken
Suddenly we hear Oda Mae yelling up from the street
(
) Hey you, Molly
You gotta listen to me
this is for real
Sam is here
He needs to talk to you
Molly walks over to the window and looks down
Oda Mae is standing in the street looking up
She is calling out at the top of her lungs
Molly pulls back
She is afraid
(
) (continuing) He says remember the starfish at Montego Bay
Remember the picture he took a' you in Reno
(pause) Remember his green underwear, the pair you wrote your name on
She wrote her name on 'em
Molly tenses
There is a sign of recognition in her eyes
- Oda Mae is standing by the curb and shouting up to Molly's fifth floor window
Several people stare at her curiously
She turns to them
Hey, do you mind
This here's a private conversation
The people turn away
She turns back to the window
Sam prompts her
Ask her about the sweater in the closet, the one she knitted that's too big
What about the sweater you knitted that was too big
Four sizes
Four sizes
She couldn't throw it out
saw was there
You couldn't throw it out
He saw
He was there
This is for real
Hey do you hear me up there
peers out of a second story window
hear you
'm not talkin' to you
Haven't you ever heard of phones
Kiss my behind
(yelling again) Listen, 'm not gonna stand here all day
Thank God
Forget it
've had enough of this
Oda Mae is about to walk away when the entrance door opens
Molly steps outside
Oda Mae sees her and stops
(continuing) Molly
(Molly nods) 'm Oda Mae Brown
(walking over and shaking her hand) You can call me Oda
- Molly and Oda Mae are sitting in a booth staring at one another
Why should  believe you
Why should believe any of this
Girl, if you think 'd come down here for the fun of it, you got another think comin'
This Sam of yours
don't know, lady
mean, you ever hear a whole night of "Henry the Eighth  am
" He did that
That's how he got me to go out with him
And he cain't carry a tune
know
Oh God
This is all so crazy
can't believe 'm talking to you like this
don't believe in these things
don't believe in life after death
Tell her she's wrong
He says you're wrong
You're talking to him right now
What
You think 'm makin' it up
Where is he
How should  know
It's not like can see him
just hear his voice
'm holding her hand
He says he's holding your hand
'm sorry
don't believe you
Why are you doing this to me
don't believe a word you're saying
Sam is dead
He's dead
'm holding her hand
He says he's holding your hand
Molly's hand jumps
Oda Mae looks at her
There is a long, poignant moment
Sam chokes up
God,  love her
love her so much
He says he loves you
so much
(shaking her head) No
He would never say that
(his eyes brightening) Ditto
Tell her "ditto"
Ditto
What's that mean, ditto
Molly starts, an expression of true astonishment shining in her eyes
Sam
- Molly is pressed up against the edge of the couch listening nervously as Oda Mae speaks
Sam wanders around the room, anxiously
To tell the truth,  don't know how 'm doin' it
In fack, confidentially, nothin' like this never happened to me before
Now, all a sudden,  can't turn it off
(she sees a photo of Sam) Is this you
Is this him
They both say "yes" at the same time
(continuing; to Sam) Hazel eyes, huh
You sound like they'd be blue
don't understand
Why did he come back
Why is he still here
Cause he's stuck, that's why
He's between worlds
It happens sometimes, when their spirits get out too quick
He thinks he still has stuff t'do down here
Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling
Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude
Molly stares at Oda Mae
do not have an attitude
(to Molly) We're having a discussion
(back to Sam) Whataya mean, you're not angry
If you weren't angry you wouldn't be raisin' your voice like that
Goddamn it, Oda Mae
Ah ah, baby
That does it
don't talk to anybody who takes the Lord's name in vain
She stands up, as if to leave
Molly watches with growing discomfort as Oda Mae seems to be talking to herself
Relax, Oda Mae
You relax
You're the dead one
You want my help, then you apologize
Nobody talks to me like that, understand
Jesus Christ
(to Molly) Excuse me, girl
Time for me to go
Oda Mae heads for the door
Molly is confused
don't believe 'm watching this
Damn it
All right
apologize
Oda Mae stops, pauses a moment, and walks back to the couch
Sam, relieved, paces back and forth
Oda Mae's eyes follow his voice as Molly watches her curiously
(continuing) Please, Oda Mae,  need you to tell Molly what 'm saying
You gotta tell her word for word
Monsieur has a message for you
Molly, you're in danger
You can't tell her like that
And would you stop movin' all over the place
You're makin' me sick
Molly looks concerned
Sam leans into Oda Mae
Say it
He's sayin' you're in danger
Danger
What do you mean
know the man who killed me
Willie Lopez
know where he lives
He says he knows the man who killed him, Willie Lopez
He's Puerto Rican
Molly grows pale as she listens
Her forehead tightens
Write it down
Write it down
You do it
Now 'm a secretary
Oda Mae takes a card from her purse and grabs a pencil
321 Prospect Place
Apartment 4D
321
Hey, that's my neighborhood
Oda Mae seems perplexed as she writes it down and gives it to Molly
Molly, he's got my wallet and my key
He was in here
He's got his wallet and key
He was in here
In here
(directly to Molly) You have to go to the police
The Mugger wasn't acting alone
It was a setup, Moll
was murdered
He says he was set up, that he was murdered
He wants you to go to the police
Molly stands up, afraid
Oda Mae stands up, too
(continuing) 'm sorry
don't want nothin' to do with this
Oda Mae heads for the door as Molly watches in a daze
Where you going
Don't follow me
've done all 'm gonna do
(opening the door) 'm finished
And  ain't comin' back
So don't you come botherin' me again cause it's over
mean it
This is it
Have a nice life
Have a nice death
'm goin'
She lets herself out
Sam just stands there as the door slams shut
- Carl is pacing nervously
He seems very upset
After a moment he approaches Molly
Sam is behind her
Molly, there's no one on earth who'd like it to be true more than me, but you've got to be rational about this
understand your desire to hold on to him, but this
this is absurd
It was real, Carl
She was real
Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it
She needs some support here
Molly, you're a grown woman
How can you believe some fortune teller from Brooklyn
She was in touch with him
don't believe it, Molly
Not for a minute
Come on, Carl
Open your mind
Carl sits down beside her
Carl, she knew things
What kind of things
told you, the picture in Reno, the starfish,
damn it, Carl
(with great difficulty) She said Sam knew who killed him
That he was set up
murdered
Oh boy
This is getting deranged
We're going off the deep end here
Give him the address, Moll
She had a name, an address -- Willie Lopez, 321 Prospect Place
She said he had Sam's wallet
Sam smiles
Carl stands up
His voice begins to rise
This is sick
This is really sick
How can you swallow this crap
Who knows if this guy exists
Maybe she's just setting someone up
That's what  have to find out
Find out
What are you talking about
Sam wants me to go to the police
Sam wants you to go to the police
Molly
Jesus
Are you outta your mind
What are you gonna tell 'em
Some storefront psychic's been getting messages from the dead
Do you know how that sounds
You're talkin' ghosts here, for God's sake
Molly looks suddenly vulnerable
(continuing) 'm sorry
This stuff just really gets to me
You don't believe me
You don't believe any of this, do you
(half heartedly) 'm trying to, but
Look, if it'll make you sleep any better, 'll check it out, okay
Now why don't you go to bed
Try and get some sleep
Molly looks at Carl, annoyed
She doesn't believe him for a second
'  - Carl, in his red Ford Mustang, is speeding up town
Sam is beside him in the front seat
'  - Carl steps into the lobby of Willie's building
Sam follows, wide-eyed
He seems both intrigued and astounded by what Carl is doing
When Carl stops to read the apartment number on Willie's mail box, Sam is thrilled
Way to go, Carl
Carl climbs the stairs two at a time and approaches Willie's door
He bangs on it, loudly
- opens a crack as Willie peers out
Carl pushes it hard and it opens the rest of the way
Willie steps back
Carl, what're you doin' here
Sam freezes as Willie addresses Carl by name
He can barely move
(scared, in over his head) Who've you been talking to
Talking to
What the hell do you mean
What's going on
Some woman knows all about you
The murder, everything
Where's she getting it from, huh
What the hell are you talking about
haven't said a word
Sam is staggered
His body is shaking
She knows your name, goddamn it
She knows where you live
lot of women know where  live
Carl is fuming
This isn't a joke, man
You find that bitch, whoever she is, and
get rid of her, you hear me
've got four million dollars stuck in that fucking computer
If  don't get those codes, if that money's not transferred soon, 'm dead
If lose Balistrari's money, we're both dead
Tell him you only wash dirty money on the first of the month
What is wrong with you
Is everything a joke
You were supposed to steal his wallet
You weren't supposed to kill him
Was that a joke
(casually) did you a favor
Freebee
Jesus
(sickened) These are drug dealers, man
(pause) Don't blow this for me, Willie
've risked my job here
could go to jail
hundred thousand of that money goes to me
Now give me Sam's key
'll get that address book myself
Willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out Sam's key
Sam, unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage
Hauling back, he slugs Carl with all his might
His fist has no impact
You killed me, Carl
You had me killed
Look what you've done to me
Look what you've done
- Carl is on the street heading back to his car
Sam is beside him, yelling right into his face
He is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but Carl doesn't hear him
You fucker
You mother fucker
had a life, Goddamn you
had a life
From the distance, we see Sam smashing into Carl
It is like hitting the air
For all of his rage and bluster, there is nothing he can do
- Molly, neatly dressed, exits her building and hails a cab
She hops inside
Seconds later she hops out again, yelling
You white fascist bigot
Who do you think you are
Bed Stuy's part of New York, you know
This is America
The driver speeds off
Molly gives him the finger
-   - Molly exits a subway station and walks toward 131st Street
She is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as she passes
Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'
Molly pays no attention
Children run up to her, stare, and run away
When Molly turns down 131st Street, the crowds disperse and she is all alone
There is a sense of menace in the air group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks by
One of them whistles
Molly keeps walking
/
' Molly sees Willie's building
She walks into the dank lobby
It is dark and full of shadows
Leaning close, she examines the mail boxes
Willie's name is there
She backs away, afraid
- dresser drawer opens and a box labeled "Sam's Things -- Valuable" is slowly pulled out
hand reaches inside it and extracts Sam's address book
As    , we see that it is Carl standing in Molly and Sam's livingroom
Carl opens the book and quickly jots down a series of code numbers he finds in the back
His eyes sparkle with excitement
- '  - Molly is sitting in a room opposite , 48, and   , 29
Both officers are staring at her as she speaks
She seems very uncomfortable
Look, you've gotta believe me don't even believe this stuff, myself
But this is real
Do you think 'd come here if it wasn't real
You told me to come if  had any new information
Well, here  am
The officers don't respond
(continuing) Don't look at me like that
You guys use psychics all the time
There is dead silence
(continuing) Damn it
know how this sounds hear myself saying it and  want to cringe
But this woman knew things she couldn't have known, intimate details
How intimate
Things Sam only said to me
(smirking) Okay, let me get this straight
According to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place, watching us all the time, huh
(she stands up) 'm sorry
've got important things to do
She leaves the room
Molly gives her a dirty look and turns to Beiderman
'm telling you
The killer's name is Willie Lopez
've got his address
You've got to check it out
Sgt
Beiderman gets up and looks over to Molly
Okay
You just wait here
Let me see if this guy's got a record
He heads out of the room
Molly sits back with an air of enormous relief and gratitude
Sergeant Wallace comes into the room again and picks up a folder
Molly waits nervously
After a moment Sergeant Beiderman returns with a police file in his hands
Molly looks up at him, and then smiles at Wallace as she sees it
She feels vindicated
He lays the thick folder on the desk and opens it up
She hurries over to him
: and reams of police paperwork
as Molly stares at it all in sudden shock
What are you doing
Where's your file on Willie Lopez
There's no file for a Willie Lopez
He was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with
This psychic woman's record goes back a long way
Fraud, numbers rackets, you name it
She's a real pro
between the records and Molly's stunned reaction
We see recent photos of Oda Mae and others going back to her youth
They are fascinating and revealing
We even see photos of her mother and grandmother
In addition, there are pages of arrest records and prison files
(continuing) 1967
Shreveport, Louisiana
Forgery, selling false
Served one year
1971
Baton Rouge
Arrested for fraud, numbers racketeering
Served ten months
1974
Hattiesburg, Mississippi
Fraud, seven months
1984
Albany, New York
Petty larceny
It goes on and on
Molly is overwhelmed by the evidence
(continuing) This woman's a charlatan
You can't believe anything she said
This isn't possible
There were words, private things
How could she have known all that
They have ways
Ways
What ways
They've got a million cons
lot of times they read the obits
All she had to do was see the word "banker"
Hell, they even go through your garbage to find things they can use, letters, old papers
They don't need much
Molly turns away
(continuing) bet you threw stuff out, huh
It could have been anything
What about that underwear she knew all about
Molly's eyes widen
(continuing) Green underwear
'll bet she zeroed right in on that
No
She was real
She said things
She knew about a sweater  knitted, about songs we sang
She knew about this place we went, Montego Bay
Molly begins to cry
'm sorry
know this is hard
People want so much to believe
They're grieving, vulnerable
They'd give anything for one last moment
money, insurance policies
Believe me, these people know what they're doing
Look, know how you must feel
You know, you can press charges
Molly shakes her head no
Sgt
Beiderman closes the file
Molly sits for a long time
She is in terrible pain
Oh God,  wanted it to be Sam
Sgt
Beiderman nods his head compassionately and then turns away
-   (  ) Molly is sitting in her bedroom
The glow of the late afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed
She seems deeply depressed and alone
Gradually her gaze falls on a jar sitting on the nightstand
In it is the penny Sam found when they were first working on the loft
label on the jar says, "For Luck
" In a moment of sudden rage, she picks it up and throws it against the wall
It  on the floor
'  - The code from Sam's address book, jotted on a piece of paper, is sitting beside Carl
(excitedly) God, let this be it
Anxiously, Carl punches the code into a computer and, suddenly, Sam's old accounts appear on the screen
look of relief wafts across Carl's face
(continuing) Oh God, yes
Carl is staring at the same accounts Sam was examining the afternoon before he was killed, the accounts with too much money in them
Carl picks up the phone and punches a number
Someone answers
(continuing) Tony, this is Carl
'm all set
We're fine
Everything's fine
Just tell me what you want me to do
on the other end begins to speak
We want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name "Rita Miller"
Tomorrow, at five minutes before closing, 3:55 p
m
, transfer the full account to First Island Bank of Nassau, registry number 486- 9580
Carl writes it all down
(continuing) Call us when it's done
Tell Mr
Balistrari there won't be any problems
'll do that
Carl hangs up
He seems deeply relieved
He is standing in front of Carl, watching
Quickly, Carl begins punching commands into the computer
He is setting up the dummy account
Rita Miller, #926-31043
- Molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the loft
She seems lost in the vast space
Sam is pacing back and forth
There is a melancholy look in his eyes
Why can't you hear me, Molly
need you
Suddenly the  rings
Molly jumps
Molly's finger is on the intercom
She seems unsettled
Who's there
Molly, it's Carl
Can  come up
Sam freezes
Molly is surprised
She hesitates a moment and then pushes the buzzer to let him in
We hear Carl bounding up the stairs
Don't open it
He's a murderer, Moll
There is a
Molly opens the door
Carl seems buoyant, almost celebratory
He has a bag of fruit in his hand
He is still in a suit and tie
Hi
Thanks
know it's late
'm sorry to disturb you
felt bad about last night
This supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable
don't even read horoscopes
Don't worry
It's okay
No it's not
You needed me to hear you and  didn't and that was wrong
want you to know that 'm your friend, Moll
You were never our friend
(holding out a paper bag) Hey,  brought you some Japanese apple pears
know you like them
(taking the bag) Oh, that's so sweet
Listen, can  come in for a minute
won't stay long
've had one of those days
Maybe a cup of coffee
No, Moll
Don't do it
Don't let him in
(hesitating) Sure
- Carl, in shirt sleeves and Molly in her robe, are sitting on the couch drinking coffee
We notice that Carl is wearing yellow suspenders
Sam is beside himself, watching them
Are you alright
You look nervous, upset
(glancing at her thighs) What can  tell you
It's been tough
Hell, you know
It still hurts so much
(he poses sadly) Then on top of it all
it's the responsibilities
They've given me my own accounts, but 've had no time to adjust
My mind has been reeling
Molly reaches out and pats his arm
There is an awkward pause
(continuing) Where were you this morning
thought you were coming to the bank to sign those papers
didn't have time
(beat) went to the police, Carl
Sam looks at her, amazed
Carl, on the other hand, stiffens
He laughs nervously
You're kidding
You really did it don't believe
What did you tell them
What did they say
You were right, you know
felt like such a fool
They brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick
It was awful
(relieved) ripoff artist, huh
(shocked) Molly, no
The sad part is that  believed her
believed her, Carl
(pause) It was all a sham
(relaxing) Sometimes we need to believe
Why
was a fool
don't believe anything anymore
Why would people do such things
Sam is devastated
(milking it) It's hard to face reality, Moll, the hard cold facts of it
What you have to remember is the love you felt
That's what's real
You have to remember how good Sam was
How much he loved you
Molly holds back tears
Carl reaches out tenderly and strokes her hair
(continuing) You were everything to him, Molly
You were his life
(finally crying) feel so alone
You're not alone
You're young
You've got so much talent
You're fantastically gorgeous
(appreciating his words) Oh God,  don't know what's real anymore
don't know what to think
Just think about Sam
Think about what he meant to you, the years you had together, how wonderful they were
Carl glides his hand slowly, lovingly across her cheek
(continuing) Let your feelings out
Almost imperceptibly, his hand moves down to the nape of her neck
As she moves, her robe opens slightly
Carl notices, glimpsing her nakedness beneath it
Sam notices, too
He freezes
(continuing) Life turns on a dime, Moll
People think they have forever, that they'll always have tomorrow
But it's not true
Sam taught us that
We have to live for now, for today
Molly can barely contain her tears
Carl moves toward her moist cheeks and kisses them gently
Slowly, he guides his lips to her neck and kisses it, too
It is all hateful and sensual at the same time
Sam turns away
Molly feels Carl's tenderness, needs it
She does not notice his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling it toward him
With a little tug the cord unravels and the robe falls open
Molly is confused, aroused, not sure what to do
She starts to pull it closed
He holds her hand
For a moment they do nothing
Then his fingers reach for her thigh
Her body quivers
Carl feels her openness and pulls closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body
Molly's eyes close
She says nothing
No
Sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing uncontrollably at the two of them
Unexpectedly his foot kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and Molly that's sitting on an end table
The picture  to the floor, the glass
Molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken
She sees the photo and recoils
Carl reaches for her
She backs away
Sam is stunned by what has happened
He jumps up and tries kicking over another picture but nothing moves
His foot goes right through it
Molly looks at Carl, drying her tears
can't
'm sorry
can't
It's too soon
You've been great Carl, but
need you to leave
Please
need you to
Sure
It's okay
understand really do
She reaches out and takes his hand
(continuing) Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow night
Just talk
Can  interest you in that
Molly hesitates a moment and then nods her head "yes"
Carl smiles
- Sam rushes madly down a flight of stairs into a subway station
train is just leaving
He jumps on board
: - Sam begins quickly casing the aisles, looking for something
It is not there
Another train can be seen speeding past the window
Sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it, passing through the walls
: - disappointed
Suddenly, an express train passes alongside his local
Sam sticks his face inside it
Suddenly, he smiles and rushes onto it
Sam does not have to stand there long
Within seconds, the terrifying Ghost he had seen before comes charging at him
We notice him more clearly now
He is wearing a dark blue pea coat
There is a grizzled look about him
He has stained teeth and seems perpetually unshaven
Get off my train
This time Sam does not back away
He holds his ground
The Ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal
Posters come flying off the walls
bag of groceries topples from a woman's arms, an old man's cane flies across the aisle, a boy's Mets cap flips off his head
People on the train move quickly to other cars
Unable to frighten him, the Ghost kicks Sam in the stomach
Sam recoils, feeling it, but gets back up again
He is angry now
He begins raging at the other Ghost
The Ghost is shocked
Teach me how you do that
want to learn
'm not leaving til you teach me
The Ghost, exhausted, looks up at him and smiles with appreciation
You stubborn asshole
Sam nods in agreement
: sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station
Sam is trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger
(continuing) What are you doing
What are you doing
You can't push it with your finger
You're dead
The Ghost demonstrates, kicking a garbage pail onto its side
Sam can't quite tell how he did it
don't get it
It's your mind, you idiot
It's all in the mind
The problem is you think you're still real, that you're standin' on the floor, that you're wearin' those clothes
Bullshit
You don't even have a body anymore
It's all up here
You wanna move things, you gotta use your mind
You gotta focus
You hear what 'm saying
How do you focus
don't know how you focus
You just focus
With surprising energy, the Ghost flicks a bottle cap and sends it shooting across the subway platform
(continuing) It's all in the anger
You gotta direct it
You gotta channel it
'm angry all the time
It doesn't do a thing
Cause you're angry all over
You gotta be angry here, in the pit of your stomach
Bring it down here
Let it explode
(he makes an explosive gesture) It's like a reactor, you know
Pow
He kicks a Coke can toward Sam
Sam tries to kick it back and misses
The Ghost laughs
Sam gets angry
He tries again and falls on his head
The Ghost laughs louder
Now Sam is really angry
We see him forcing the anger down into his stomach
He holds still for a moment and then kicks at the can with all his might
To his shock and amazement, it sails right through the Ghost's head
The Ghost smiles
did it
Way to go
: practicing
He smashes at an abandoned tennis shoe with his fist
Nothing happens
From your gut
What do  keep tellin' you
Sam's stomach bulges
He tries again
Nothing
(continuing) Give it time
What else have you got
Undaunted, Sam tries once more
This time the tennis shoe moves
The Ghost nods his head approvingly
Sam is thrilled
How long have you been here
Since they pushed me
Someone pushed you
Yeah, someone pushed me
Who
What
You don't believe me
You think fell
You think  jumped
Well, fuck you
(an unexpected rage starts to build) It wasn't my time
wasn't supposed to go
'm not supposed to be here
Venom spews from the Ghost's mouth
Suddenly he rams a cigarette machine full force with his head
The glass and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere
He throws himself on top of them with terrible longing
(continuing) 'd give everything for a drag
Just one drag
He rolls and wallows in terrible frustration, tossing the cigarettes in all directions
Suddenly he looks up and sees Sam
He is unable to control his fury
(continuing) Who the hell are you
Why are you hounding me like this
Leave me alone
is shooting through the station
The Ghost throws himself into it and in an instant he is gone
- Sam, all alone, walks through the station
Suddenly, he reaches out and pushes a garbage can lid
It swings back and forth
He is delighted
beer can is sitting on a bench
He pushes it off, watching it roll across the platform with childlike glee
Looking up, Sam sees an advertisement for Market Security Bank and Trust
He stares at it with great interest
"Special Banking for Special People
We make it easy for you
" Something registers in Sam's eyes
He yells and jumps straight up, hitting a subway sign with his finger
With great excitement, he runs for the stairs and rushes from the station
- , a black woman with brassy red hair, is sitting at Oda Mae's seance table surrounded by several of her relatives
Clara and Louise stand behind Oda Mae helping with the ritual
Oda Mae goes into her trance
is milling behind Oda Mae
Sam comes barging into the room and looks at them in amazement
What the hell
Oda Mae, startled, jumps up in her chair
Everyone else jumps, too
Clara and Louise look worried
Sam
What is all this
What's goin' on
What'd you do, tell every spook in town about me
got spooks from out of town here
There's stuff goin' on you wouldn't believe
can't hardly believe it myself
Ortisha and her relatives look up, confused
Oda Mae
You're doing it
This is for real
How do you like that
don't
Come on
Look at this
You're doing great
One of the  standing in the background butts in
Can you hurry this up
My husband's in the waiting room
need your help, Oda Mae
There's something we need to do
Forget it
'm not doin' anything
You're holdin' on to a life that don't want you no more
Give it up
Give it up
'm already dead
Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished dyin'
Give up the ghost
And how am  supposed to do that
You're asking me
Ortisha looks at Oda Mae
She has no idea what's going on
Are you speaking to me
Does it look like 'm speakin' to you
(continuing; to Sam) So, are you gonna leave or not
've got work to do
Ortisha is totally confused
Oda Mae turns back to her
(continuing) What's a matter
You're supposed to be concentrating
How do you expect me to do this if you're not concentrating
Okay then
You ready
Let's do it
Oda Mae and everyone in the room gets very quiet
One of the ghosts draws close
Oda Mae's eyes roll up into her head
Then, suddenly, an extraordinary thing occurs
We see the spirit pull back and dive right into Oda Mae
Oda Mae gulps
Her nostrils flare
Her eyes bulge
Oh, Lord
Stop
Whatcha doin' to me
Oda Mae's body goes into bizarre convulsions as the Ghost tries to move inside her
She looks strangely stuffed and enormously uncomfortable
Sam and the others watch in astonishment as she tries to speak, but nothing comes out
Then suddenly the  speaks through Oda Mae
(screaming) Ortisha
Ortisha and her relatives jump up in amazement
(excitedly) Orlando
Is that you
(disoriented) Ortisha, where are you
can't see too good
Here
She's here
In front of you
'm right here
Orlando suddenly zeros in on Ortisha
His eyes widen
Mother of God, what've you done to your hair
Ortisha smiles excitedly
Orlando, do you like it
It's Autumn Sunrise
Suddenly Oda Mae's body begins to shake wildly and her voice booms out, screaming with all her might
Get out of here, you little shit
With frightening speed, she sends the spirit catapulting out of her body
Clara and Louise jump up
Oda Mae is shaking
(continuing) Lord oh Lord, don't you ever do that to me
(confused) Orlando
He is lying on the floor, exhausted
What happened to me
can barely move
You should know better than to try that
It's not worth it
It'll wipe you out for days
That was incredible, Oda Mae
Never again
Never
Where's Orlando
He spoke through you
It was amazing
No more, uh uh, no more
What happened to Orlando
Where'd he leave the insurance policy
You're great, Oda Mae
You're a real medium
It's what you were born for
want everybody out
Orlando
Ortisha looks around the room, befuddled
Clara and Louise aren't sure what to do
Now
Ortisha and her relatives scurry out fast
The ghosts, too, begin passing through the wall
Oda Mae lays her head on the table
Suddenly her whole body begins heaving
She is starting to cry
Sam is surprised
Oda Mae, what's wrong
Out
said out
That means you, too
Sam hesitates a moment and then respectfully follows the others through the wall
- Clara knocks on the seance room door and peeks in
Oda Mae, there's a man here who says he has to see you right away
ain't seein' nobody
Willie pushes his way into the room
Clara isn't sure what to do
Oda Mae looks up
She does not know him
Are you the one that can talk to the dead
beg your pardon
'm not seeing customers right now
said  need to know if you're the one
'm the one
But not now
This is important
have a friend
He died recently
Some say he was mugged
think he was murdered
Oda Mae stares at him curiously
(continuing) 'm told you can contact people like that
Is that true
It's been known to happen
But it's not gonna happen now, so come back later
can't wait til later
He sits down across from Oda Mae and shows no signs of leaving
Oda Mae observes him quietly for a moment
What's your friend's name
Good question
Why don't you tell me
Oda Mae glares at him
(continuing) You're the psychic, right
This ain't no guessin' game
Then what is it, lady
Lookit,  don't know what your trouble is
(getting nervous) Who are you
You're the mindreader
hear you've been tellin' people about me for days
What's my name
- confused and uncomfortable
Sam comes wandering back into the room
His eyes bulge
Willie
Willie
Willie sits straight up in his chair, amazed
How'd you know that
Because 'm psychic
With a sudden thrust, Oda Mae sends her foot shooting into Willie's balls
As he recoils she knocks the table into his lap and rushes for the closet
We see her barricade herself in the hidden chamber
Willie, shaking, scrambles to his feet and, before Sam can stop him,  his gun at the closet door
It is riddled with bullets
Sam screams out
Willie runs to the side door and escapes to the street
Clara and Louise come rushing in
Sam charges into the closet and sees that Oda Mae is safe behind the false door
Then he hurries to the street
- Sam rushes to the sidewalk and looks in all directions
Willie is nowhere to be seen
He hurries back to Oda Mae
- The room is a disaster area, full of hysterical women
Oda Mae is being dragged from the closet, unhurt but in a state of shock
He tried to kill me
Why
Why
No one answers
(continuing) Talk to me
Her sisters start talking but she shoos them away
Oda Mae, we're in trouble
We're in trouble

But  can't do it alone
You've gotta help me
Help you

(stopping, thinking) Help you
Whataya talking about exactly
What else do  have to do
- Oda Mae, dressed to the hilt, is walking with Sam toward the main branch of Market Security Bank & Trust
She seems nervous and upset
This is crazy
This ain't gonna work
don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'
'll teach you
You'll learn fast
As they reach the entrance of the bank, they pass a pair of collecting money to build a shelter for the homeless
One of them holds out a collection box
Oda Mae passes her by, carefully avoiding eye contact
&  - Oda Mae enters Sam's bank
She seems completely out of place
Sam, walking beside her, directs her every move
See where it says "New Accounts"
That's where you're going
(paranoid) 'm not givin' 'em any money
Just do what  say
Oda Mae approaches the New Accounts desk
She seems very uptight
woman  behind the desk looks up at her
Can  help you
Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account
'm here to fill out a signature card for a new account
And do you know your account number
Yes
926-31043
Yes

Rita Miller

Tell her Rita Miller
Rita Miller
(eyeing her oddly) Didn't they have you sign a card when you opened the account
Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today
Carl Bruner opened it for me
He asked me to come in today
Ah
The Officer checks out the name and account number on her computer screen
It all seems to jive
She pulls out a card from her desk and hands it to Oda Mae
Oda Mae stares at it
Just sign you name at the bottom on the first blank line
Oda Mae nods and starts to sign "Oda Mae"
Sam stops her
(continuing) No, no, no
Rita Miller
(to the officer) Can  have another one please signed the wrong name
Sam hits his forehead with his hand
The Officer gives her another card
Oda Mae signs it
Tell her to see that it goes right up to the third floor file since you have a transaction to make
need you to put that in the third floor file cause  got a transfusion to make
what
You know what  mean
(innocently) Umm, can  keep the pen
(surprised, not sure what to say) uh, sure
Oda Mae, delighted, walks away smiling and gives the officer a wave
She is loving this
Thanks
' The clock on Carl's wall says 3:40
He seems anxious
The phone
Carl jumps
He pushes down the speaker button
Hello
Carl Bruner speaking
Carl
Mr
Balsitrari Balistrari
Carl, it's me, John
've got the info on the Bradley portfolio
Oh yeah, yeah
That's great
'll pick it up later
He hangs up
His hand is shaking
&  - Sam and Oda Mae approach a fancy part of the bank housing administrative personnel
They approach a  who is standing there
Tell the guard you're here to see Lyle Furgeson
Lyle Furgeson, please
Do you have an appointment
No
'm here for the fun of it
Don't say that
Tell him Rita Miller's here
Tell him Rita Miller's here
Just one moment, please
Don't embellish
Yes, Sir
(turning around) Excuse me
She waves him on
(whispering) Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a real jerk
Why are you whispering
(he doesn't know) Just be quiet and listen
've known him five years and he still thinks my name's Paul
We see the Guard leaning over Mr
Furgeson's desk looks up and sees Oda Mae
He shrugs his shoulders
(continuing) He's a social moron
You don't have to worry about anything
Tell the guard Furgeson knows you
You spent time with him and his wife Shirley at the Brewster's Christmas party last year
The Guard comes back
What is this regarding
What
He doesn't remember me
We were together at the Brewster's Christmas party
With his wife Shirley
They had that lovely tree
all those presents
Why, 'll never forget all those beautiful
Sam pokes her
She yelps, surprised, and glances around
The Guard gives her an odd look
(continuing) Oops
Gas
She forces a smile
He smiles back and then goes over to Mr
Furgeson
This'll be easy
Furgeson was so drunk at that party, he could have had a conversation with Tina Turner and he wouldn't remember
The Guard whispers in Furgeson's ear
Furgeson appears totally flummoxed
He looks up at Oda Mae, embarrassed, and waves
The Guard motions her to come back
She walks proudly over to his desk
He sticks out his hand
Hello, hello
Of course, of course
It's been so long
long time
Ask how Bobby and Snooky are
How are Bobby and Snooky doin'
(perplexed) Why, they're just fine, thank you
Nice of you to ask
And how is your
family
Couldn't be better
Well, isn't that wonderful
Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities
So tell me, Fergie, how did you do on the Gibraltar securities
(surprised) The Gibraltar securities
Well, it looks like we topped out, huh
"We sure did
" We sure did
(impressed) That was a wonderful tip
"Good old Randy"
Good old Randy
Got a real head on his shoulders
"Her" shoulders
"Her" shoulders
Sure does
Well

So what brings you here today
You're closing an account
'm closing an account
Well

Do you have your account number
926-31043
926-3143
31-0-43
She looks up into the air
Furgeson eyes her strangely
Make that 31-0-43
Numbers
'm dyslexic
He punches Rita Miller's number into the computer
figure appears on the screen
He stares at it for a few seconds and then punches it in again
(trying to be calm) Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing four million dollars from us today, is that correct
Four million dollars
Say "yes"
(gasping) Yes
Four million
That's right
That's right
And how will you want that
Tens and twenties
Pardon
cashier's check
Tell him a cashier's check
cashier's check
Fine
Of course, you realize we're required to get some identification from everyone
It's just procedural
You understand
Of course
Oda Mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a ' and a
Furgeson gets up and walks away from his desk
He seems unsteady on his feet
An at the next desk is using a Brillo pad to clean a stain on her desk
Oda Mae smiles
You know, if you put that Brillo pad in the freezer, it'll last twice as long
The Officer nods appreciatively
- Furgeson lays Oda Mae's  next to her signature card
The signatures match up
He nods his head in approval
'  - Carl looks up at the clock
It is 3:50
He pushes down a button on the phone
answers
(
) Yes, Mr
Bruner
Get me the First Island Bank of Nassau
It's on the rolodex
&  - Mr
Furgeson returns with Rita Miller's signature card and a cashier's check for $4,000,000
Oda Mae's hand shakes as she examines it
'll just need your signature right here
Sure
Sign Rita Miller
Sam looks up and gulps
Molly has just entered the bank and is heading toward them
He jumps up nervously
(continuing) 'll be back in a minute
You're on your own
Don't say anything foolish
Oda Mae signs a form closing the account
Of course the signatures match
Mr
Furgeson examines them both and smiles
He shakes Oda Mae's hand
Now you be careful with this
It's like carrying cash, you know
(positively glowing) sure do
Sam rushes over to Molly
He is not sure what to do
He notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about to pass
He hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a hundred sheets, flying up into the air
Molly, confused, thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up
Sam, delighted, flicks another stack
Oda Mae is talking a blue streak when Sam returns to her
(continuing) Then my mother took all the money from the oil wells and put it in gasoline pumps
Every gas station has 'em you know, sometimes six or more
It adds up
Oda Mae, come on
We gotta get out of here
Say goodbye
(abruptly getting up) Well, 've got to leave
It's been a pleasure doin' business with you
Say "hi" to Shirley and Snooky for me
Thank you, Rita
'll be glad to
Oda Mae smiles and leaves
There is a new lilt in her walk
Suddenly Sam looks and sees Molly about to stand up
Hurry up, Oda Mae
At that second, Oda Mae spots a quarter lying on the ground
She stoops down and picks it up
(excitedly) What a day
Molly sees her, does a double take, and starts to go after her
Unfortunately, Oda Mae steps onto an elevator before Molly can catch up
The doors close
Molly stops for a moment and then looks back across to the executive area
She sees Lionel Furgeson and hurries over to him
Lionel
He is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous
Molly
How are you
Lionel, a woman who just left, a black lady, about my height, did you see her
Well, yes
just took care of her
What did she want
Did it have anything to do with me
Did she ask about Sam
(not understanding) Sam
No
Why
Was her name Oda Mae Brown
No, Rita Miller
She just closed an account
Molly stares at Furgeson
She is not sure what to think
(continuing) Is there a problem
(hesitating, not sure what to say) No
guess not
Thanks
She walks away, confused
'  - Carl, in front of his computer, is going crazy
He keeps punching buttons on the keyboard but the same response appears over and over on the screen
" , #926-31043 $00
00
" Panicked, Carl jumps up
He moves quickly, erratically around the office and then back to the computer
He punches the keys over and over
The same answer appears on the screen
The account is closed
' Carl runs through the office
He seems crazed
People look at him
Carl, is something wrong
Is someone playing with the computers
What
Is this a joke
One of my accounts is closed
Which account
What's wrong
Carl freezes
He doesn't answer
(continuing) You want me to call someone
(changing his demeanor) No, no
Never mind
It's okay
It's all right
can do it
&  - Sam and Oda Mae are walking down the street in front of the bank
Oda Mae is talking to herself
$4,000,000
$4,000,000
Lord Almighty
Oda Mae
Take the check out of your purse
She stops
There is a nervous look on her face
Take it out
Why
Just do it
Oda Mae, worried, removes the check but holds onto it tightly
(continuing) Now endorse it
Sign Rita Miller
(in shock) Endorse it
Why
Do what  say
No
That's blood money, Oda
was killed for that money
Endorse it now
What are you going to do with it
We're giving it away
Away
What do you mean
To who
Look to your left
Oda Mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless
She recoils
Are you outta your mind
Do what  tell you
No
(clutching the check) can't
Yes, you can
If you don't do it, they'll track you down
Your only protection is to get rid of it, now
Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam
'm saving you, Oda Mae
You'll go to heaven for this
Oda Mae growls at him
With great difficulty, she approaches the nuns
The nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion
Write "St
Joseph's Shelter"
With great hesitation, Oda Mae begins to write
We sense that every word is a torment for her
The nuns politely avert their eyes from the check
Bless you, child
Oda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over
'm proud of you
Don't you talk to me
don't want you comin' round no more
mean it
Understand
Come on, we're friends
Friends
Friends
She turns on her high heels and wobbles away
Sam calls after her
think you're wonderful, Oda Mae
She growls again
In the background we see the nuns secretly peeking at the check
One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead away
The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an attempt to revive her
'  - It is after hours
Almost everyone on the floor has gone
Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands on the keyboard
He looks haggard and worn
Sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the monitor screen
Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches, smiling
Search, you bastard
You'll never find it
It's gone
(he smiles) They'll kill you for this, Carl
You and Willie
They'll wipe you off the face of the earth
In a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against the wall and the chair shoots across the room
Carl looks up and sees an empty chair moving
He stares at it in confusion, and then goes back to the screen
He seems desperate
Nothing is working
Panicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and storms furiously around the room
Sam approaches the computer, hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch
The computer  back on
Carl spins around
He stares at the computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off
Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and  it back on again
Carl stares at it
What the
Carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and letters begin appearing on the screen
He sits down, mesmerized by what is happening
Then his face grows tense
The word "-------" is emerging before him
Carl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to see who else is on the floor
He yells out like a madman
(continuing) Who's doing that
There is no one there
He hears the computer beginning to type again and hurries back to look at the screen
One word appears
"--"
Carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist
It crashes to the floor
Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for breath
Sam cannot hold himself back any longer
With a horrifying scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his ribs
You bastard
You goddamn bastard
Carl grabs his side
Ah
He hits Carl again
Carl gasps in inexplicable pain
It's dinner time, Carl
Don't you have a date with Molly, you creepy son-of-a bitch
Sam keeps hitting deeper into Carl's mid-section
Carl doubles over as though he's going to throw up
Jesus
Oh God
Sam is flushed with excitement
Carl kneels beside his desk
He cannot understand what is happening to him
His face goes stark white as the attack continues
Then, unexpectedly, the assault stops
Sam, exhausted, stares hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor
Slowly and dizzily, Carl gets up
He looks fearfully around the office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room
- Molly, all dressed to go out, is sitting in Sam's easy chair, asleep
Suddenly Carl arrives knocking at her door
He does not look well
Sam is with him
Carl
Where were you
thought we were having
'm sorry
Things just got so crazy
completely forgot
Old Carl had a little trouble at the office
Forgot
was worried
Is everything okay
Are you all right
'm okay
'm alright
Look, can talk to you for minute
Can  come in
Molly eyes Carl with concern as he enters the loft
(continuing) need to ask you a question
He needs to borrow four million dollars
Molly,  know what the police said, but when you thought Sam was here, when you thought he spoke to you, what did you feel
What did he say
Why
What happened
(very tense) Molly, that psychic woman,  want to know what she told you
want to know what she said
Carl, stop this
It was all a hoax
told you
It wasn't real
She's a charlatan
(she hesitates and stares at Carl) Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today
Oh shit
(gulping) At the bank
Sam tenses
He holds up his hand as if wanting her to stop
was sure  saw her
Furgeson says she was taking out money
It turns out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown
It's Rita Miller or something
Carl turns white
His eyes bulge
He feels sick
(continuing) What's wrong
Stomach
My stomach
Do you have anything
Pepto Bismol
(worried) Sure
Just a second
What's going on
Concerned, she hurries from the room
Sam digs his hands into Carl's back
Carl jerks forward in intense pain and begins flailing at the air
What are you doing to me
Get away
Get away
Sam does not go away
Freaked, Carl runs into the kitchen and rushes to the stove
Quickly he turns on the gas
He looks crazed
Turning to the air, he begins whispering loudly
You touch me again and 'll set her on fire
mean it
'll kill her
'll blow up the whole building if have to
Stay away
Sam jabs at the knob on the stove and begins to turn it off
Carl sees it move
Shocked and frightened, he grabs it and pulls it off, leaving only the tiny stem in place
(continuing) Go on, try it again
Let me see you turn it off now
Sam, frightened, tries with all his might but he cannot twist it
Carl pulls out a cigarette lighter and gloats
(continuing) Try and hurt me
'll kill her if you hurt me
Sam rushes at Carl about to jam his full fist into his chest, but then he stops, afraid
He pulls back, shaken
Carl stands there waiting for a blow that doesn't come
He begins to gloat
What's a matter
You believe me, huh
You better believe me
want my money
need that money and want it tonight -- at 11:00
If that psychic lady doesn't bring it here, Molly's dead
Sam freezes
Molly enters the kitchen
She grabs her nose
Oh my God
Is that the gas
Carl acts as if that's the reason he came into the kitchen
You must have left the stove on
He fiddles with the dials and turns it off
(continuing) Just glad  smelled it
(confused) Me, too
She opens a window
Molly, 'm sorry
've got to go
Look, there's something going on can't talk now
Some trouble at the bank
Trouble
What kind of trouble
Is it that woman, the psychic
don't have time to talk now
What if  come back
Around 11:00
Carl, what's going on
Let me help you
can't
'm sorry to do this, but it's important
'll be back
Molly is speechless
(continuing) Eleven
'  - Oda Mae is watching
with Clara and Louise
Suddenly she jumps, aware of Sam's presence in the room
Sam
Clara and Louise jump, too
Not again
What're you doin' here
Oda Mae
We're in trouble
They want the check
They're comin' to kill you
We gotta get outta here
The check
What do you mean, "the check"
You said they'd never find out
(afraid) What's happenin' Oda Mae
red Mustang  to a stop on the street below
Sam and Oda Mae run to the window
Carl and Willie are looking up
It's them
They're comin' to kill me
(to Sam, crazed) What have you done
'   - Willie and Carl jump out of the car
They head for Oda Mae's building
'  - Sam steps back from the window
They're heading for the door
(terrified) Jesus have mercy
- Willie forces open a back door
They head into the building
- Oda Mae and the others hurry into the hall
They rush down the corridor and knock loudly on a neighbor's door opens it a crack
Emergency
Let us in
Who you kiddin'
The Woman slams the door and locks it shut
Oda Mae looks frightened
- Carl and Willie climb the stairs two at a time
- Oda Mae and her sisters bang on another apartment door
No one is home
Across the corridor an   sticks her head out to see what is going on
Before she can say anything they push their way inside
What're you doin'
You can't come in here
The cat don't like visitors
She'll pee all over the couch
You wanna pay for
Oda Mae grabs the woman's mouth
: - just as Willie and Carl emerge from the stairwell
They head down the hall toward Oda Mae's door
Willie pulls out a gun, and fires
The lock shoots open
They rush inside
: in the elderly woman's vestibule, peering through the peephole
The old woman is struggling and still trying to talk
Oda Mae's knees are wobbling
They're gonna find us
No they won't
'm gonna get 'em
Oh yeah
And how you gonna do that
Whataya mean
'm a ghost, aren't
'  - Willie moves quickly through Oda Mae's apartment, his gun pointed, ready to fire
He seems furious when he realizes no one is there
Looks like someone just left
'll check the building
He rushes back out and down the stairs
Willie stays in the apartment
Suddenly, the doorbell
Willie rushes over and opens the door a crack
There is no one there
Confused, he backs away
The doorbell rings again
Completely mystified, he aims his gun and opens the door all the way
The hallway is empty
As Willie stands there, wondering what is happening, Sam steps inside and pushes the door closed
It slams shut
Willie nearly jumps out of his skin
Damn
He stares at the door in total bewilderment
At that instant, a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and crashes into his legs
He backs away, spooked
Suddenly, the
flicks  at full volume and then the and the
Lights begin flashing on and off
Willie spins around in total dismay
Summoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie
Willie recoils in unexplainable pain
He seems very disoriented
His gun falls to the floor
He reaches for it and Sam pushes it away
Willie jumps up, afraid
His eyes dart around the room
Sam laughs
(continuing) Who's there
Who's doing that
pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly hit Willie in the head
He freaks
Grabbing his gun, Willie runs into the bathroom and locks the door
Suddenly the hot water faucet turns on by itself
Willie is terrified
Steam rises from the sink
Willie tries to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears to dig his hands into his neck
Willie crumples to his knees
Oh God
There is a   and Willie looks up
Letters are appearing in the fogged mirror
He stares in disbelief as the word "--
" emerges before him
He cries out
(continuing) Let me outta here
Shaking uncontrollably, Willie  his gun at the mirror
Glass and tiles
Willie is cut and bleeding
He grabs hold of the door and yanks it open
Willie rushes to the hallway, charges for the back stairs and stumbles down the three flights to the street
Carl, running down the corridor, rushes after him
Willie drops his gun
Carl picks it up
-- Willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk
People clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman
Carl, confused, runs after him
Sam, too, races after Willie, unwilling to let him get away
Suddenly, a man obstructs his way
Willie goes flying over him and lands face down on the cement
Before he can get up, Sam is all over him and does not let up
People stand back to watch as Willie does battle with himself
Panicked, he calls out to a bystander
Help me
People back away
Carl watches in terror
He understands exactly what is happening
- Willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the street
Cars are bearing down on him from all directions
He does not get out of their way
One driver sees Willie coming and swerves to avoid him
His car skids
Another car brakes to avoid a collision and suddenly both cars crash right into him
Look out
Willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and writhing
His ghostly form reaches out to people for help as they rush past
No one stops
Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the street
Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body lying there
He begins to scream
bizarre and frightening   fills the air
Sam looks up
group of strange dark figures has emerged from the shadows
With a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down and grab hold of Willie
Sam freezes
In an instant they are dragging Willie, kicking and screaming, down through the sewer grates into the bowels of the earth
Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror
Carl, standing in the crowd, turns and runs
'  - Oda Mae and her sisters are huddling with the old woman in the entryway to her apartment
They all appear frightened
The door is opened a crack and they can see people gathering in the hall outside
Sam walks up to Oda Mae
She feels his presence
Sam
What happened
He's dead, Oda Mae
Dead
(she utters a sigh of relief) Oh, thank God
It's over
No
It's not over, Oda Mae
There's still Carl
Oda Mae freezes
She turns to Sam
Who's Carl
- Sam and Oda Mae are in a taxi speeding downtown
Tell him to hurry
Can't you hurry up
Listen, lady, 'm going as fast as can
Sam leans forward and pushes at the gas pedal
The cab shoots forward
The driver seems shocked
Problems
He gives her a dirty look
- There is a  at the door
Molly goes to it
Fastening the latch, she opens it a crack
Carl, is that you
Oda Mae wedges her foot inside
Molly, it's Oda Mae
know what you think of me, but your life is in danger
You have to listen to me
Sam's here, too
You gotta let us in
Molly tries to slam the door but hits Oda Mae's foot
Get the hell out of here
'm calling the police
Go ahead
We want you to call 'em
You're in trouble
Let us in
No
Sam's death was no accident
He was murdered, Molly
Carl was laundering money at the bank
Sam found out
He's dangerous
He tried to kill me
He'll kill you, too
(screaming) Why are you doing this to me
Get away from me
know all about you
You're a fake
You're just a fake
Leave me alone
We see Sam's inside the room with Molly
He gazes at her lovingly for a moment and then calls back to Oda Mae
Tell her she's wearing the blouse spilled the Margarita on and the earrings  gave her for Christmas
Sam says you're wearin' the blouse he spilled the Margarita on and the earrings he gave you at Christmas
: grabbing hold of her beads
Her hand is shaking
(
) (continuing) See, 'm no fake
Go away
Gimme a penny quick
What
Empty your purse
On the floor
Now
Oda Mae obeys
pile of coins falls on the floor
(continuing) Push a penny under the door
Oda Mae obeys and a penny slides into the loft
Molly sees it
Sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the bottom of the door
Pushing gently, he moves the penny up the door until it's eye level with Molly
She watches it, amazed
Then, to her astonishment, the penny floats away from the door and hovers in the air
There is a look of wonder in Molly's eyes as it floats toward her
(continuing; calling to Oda Mae) Tell her it's for luck
(
) Sam says it's for luck
Molly stands there dumbfounded
Her face is completely white
After a moment she reaches for the penny
It falls into her hand
There are tears in her eyes
: Oda Mae standing in the hallway as the door to the loft begins to open
Slowly Molly steps out onto the landing and stares at her, nervously, uncomprehendingly
She hesitates for a long moment and then invites Oda Mae in
- Molly is on the phone
Oda Mae is beside her
Right
Yes, it's right on the corner
We're a red brick building with the entrance on the left side
Please hurry
Thank you Sergeant
We'll be waiting right here
(she hangs up) Police are on their way
Oda Mae takes her and leads her to the couch
What do we do now
Just wait
There is a period of awkward silence
Is Sam here
'm sitting beside you
(pointing) Right here
Molly reaches out tentatively
Sam meets her hand
She flinches for a second but does not pull back
(fingering the air) Can you feel me, Sam
With all my heart
With all his heart, he says
'd give anything to be alive again, just to feel you once more
He wishes he could touch you, just one more time
Oh, Sam
Oda Mae looks away uncomfortably
The   on her face
After a moment she turns around and addresses the air
Okay, damn it, you can use me if you want
Sam looks oddly at Oda Mae
(continuing) Come on
Before  change my mind
Suddenly he understands what she means
: Sam's finger presses down two keys
We see a record slide out of its slot and move toward the turntable
We know what it is going to play
Oda Mae closes her eyes
"Unchained Melody" begins to play
Sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously, awkwardly slides his ghostly body into her solid form
We sense Oda Mae's discomfort gradually give way as Sam emerges inside her
After a second her body turns slowly toward Molly
Oda Mae's hand reaches out and with slow, deliberate gestures, touches Molly's hand
Molly swallows hard
She closes her eyes
: Sam
It is as though he alone is there with Molly
His eyes are full of tears
He can barely move
His hand glides slowly down Molly's cheek
He seems to be in a state of ecstasy and pain
The experience is more than he can bear
He pulls back
Sam
Molly reaches out, takes Sam's hand, and guides it to her soft lips
Sam can barely breathe
He seems totally absorbed in the experience, the sensation of human flesh
His eyes are absolutely still and full of light
He seems to be glowing
Gently, Molly takes Sam's arm and guides him to his feet
Effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft
With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before he knows what is happening, they are dancing
It is a strange, touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their new home
Sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips
She stands motionless
Her face shines
She knows beyond all doubt that it is him
love you so much
: It takes a moment to realize that it is someone  at the door
The light slams back into its shadowy substance and Sam comes shooting back into his ghostly form
Oda Mae is standing with Molly in the center of the room
Sam is beside them
He appears shaken and dizzy
There is a another loud  at the door
The police
Molly heads for the door
Sam calls out
He can barely speak
No
(to Molly) Wait
Sam tries to go instead
To his amazement and ours he is extremely weak, barely able to move
What's happening to me
His ghostly functions are diminishing
There is another  and a voice rings out
(
) Molly, open up
It's me
It's Carl
Get out of here
The fire escape
Oda Mae grabs Molly
Come with me
Oda Mae and Molly run for the fire escape window
We hear Carl yelling in the hallway
(
) Molly
Open up
Are you there
- Carl is standing on the landing
He is holding a gun
He aims it at the lock and
The door to the loft flies open
- Carl moves rapidly through the huge space
Molly
It is obvious that no one's home
Sam, with great effort, rushes at Carl and attacks him with his fists
To his great shock, he has no impact
Carl walks right through him
- Molly and Oda Mae are climbing the fire escape
- Carl runs to the fire escape window
He looks out just in time to see Oda Mae go into the 7th story window
- Molly and Oda Mae run through a new loft that is under construction
It is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls
The fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them half to death
They rush blindly toward the front door
It won't open
Back to the fire escape
Head for the roof
Oda Mae reaches the fire escape window just as Carl appears on the other side
She screams
Carl tries shoving the window open
It won't budge
Molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight
There is an opening at the top
This way
Molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the roof
With a huge shove, Carl opens the window and rushes inside
The window slams behind him
Oda Mae rushes back toward Molly, but her foot catches on a loose cable and she falls to the ground
Help us, Sam
hand falls on Oda Mae's shoulder
She spins around
Carl is standing behind her
She screams as he knocks her to the floor
want the check
Just give me the check
Molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream
(screaming) God almighty, Carl
What are you doing
What have you done
She descends quickly and runs toward Carl
Don't interfere
She's a thief
It's not her money
Carl kicks Oda Mae
Molly rushes at him, attacking him violently
Carl aims his gun at her
(continuing) Keep out of this, Molly
He grabs Oda Mae by the hair
(continuing) Where is it
Oda Mae cries out
In my purse
Where
Over there
She points across the room
Carl sees the purse and yanks Oda Mae toward it
Yanking it off the floor, he tears through it like a wild man
There is no check
He grabs Oda Mae
Where is it, goddamn it
Where is it
gave it away
You're lying
Don't lie to me
He aims his gun at her eye and is about to  when, suddenly, something shoves him to the floor
Carl screams and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae
Sam is standing there
In total panic, Carl scrambles to get up
Horrified, he his gun blindly into the air
Molly and Oda Mae dive for cover
The bullets have no impact
Sam musters all his strength and shoves Carl again
White with fear, Carl grabs Molly and aims his gun at her head
(continuing) 'll kill her
You touch me and 'll kill her
mean it, Sam
Just give me the check
The gun is cocked at her temple
No one moves
Slowly the camera dollies toward Carl
(continuing) Sam, please
didn't mean for him to kill you
It's not my fault
Come on, Sam, give me the check
Give it to me and 'll leave her alone
Nothing happens
Carl looks nervous
Sam
Sam
In a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at his gun
The weapon flies out of Carl's hand
Empowered by an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with a violent force
Carl's body careens into walls and floorboards
Wiring snaps
Two-by-fours crack
Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the floor
With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the door
The lock explodes and the door flies open
Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him
With growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment, colliding into a tall scaffold
Bags of plaster topple to the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air
The apartment looks like a scene from another world
Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from Sam
The dust obscures his escape
Like a trapped insect, he scrambles furiously to the fire escape window
Sam cannot see him
Carl shoves at the window
It is stuck
With a supreme effort, he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass
Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing the window
Shards of glass fly in all directions
Sam turns and sees Carl
He surges after him, but knows he cannot get to him in time
Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an electrical box attached to a dangling  cable
It goes flying toward the window
To his amazement, it hits the frame huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down
Carl looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his chest
Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs and slices into his heart
His body quivers
Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets
His body begins to spasm
He can't get up
look of abject terror flashes through his eyes
He tries to scream
There is no sound
He tries to breathe
There is no breath
With one last effort, Carl lurches forward
To his amazement, his body stands up and pulls away from the window
He looks down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is gone
There is no blood
Excited and confused, he turns around and sees Sam
For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is happening
Sam
There is a strange, silent moment between them
Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible  sound is heard
Frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness
Carl looks behind him and gasps
Past the figures coming toward him, he sees his own dead body
It is pinned to the window sill
Before Carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and envelope him
In a flash, his spirit is caught and surges with the dark forces back into the shadows
Far in some invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream
And then it is silent
It is over
Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly against the wall
She is staring into space
The room is filled with plaster dust
Slowly, emerging from the dust, we see Sam approaching Molly
He gazes at her with terrible longing
Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze
Sam turns to look at it
His eyes are full of surprise and wonder
The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him
As he looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent
His body is beginning to fade
faint smile forms on his face
He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long, silent moment
Goodbye, Moll
Molly's head lifts up
She looks around
Sam
Is that you
(stunned) Molly
hear you, Sam
She starts to cry
Gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near Molly is beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow
To her astonishment, Sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles
(continuing) Oh God
Sam's luminous form appears before her
Molly is overwhelmed by the sight of him
The two of them gaze at one another without moving
They know it is for the last time
It is a silent exchange, charged with emotion
Slowly, the two bodies reach forward
As their lips touch, the plaster dust swirls sensuously through Sam's vaporous image and he begins to disappear
Molly pulls back from him as though from a cloud
His voice rises from the mist
can't stay anymore
Tears roll down her cheek
The brilliant light intensifies
It is beautiful, like a sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow
Molly looks up and sees it all
Oda Mae sees it, too
They're waiting for you, Sam
(smiling) know
Goodbye, Oda Mae
(with deep felt gratitude) Thank you
Your mama would be proud
Oda Mae smiles warmly
Sam turns to Molly
She is gazing at the last remaining moments of him
Her eyes brim over with tears and love
love you, Molly
've always loved you
Molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes
Ditto
The light inside Sam intensifies
sweet smile emerges on his lips
It's so amazing, Moll
His face fills with joy
(continuing) The love inside
He whispers, almost crying
(continuing) You take it with you
They are his last words
His spirit dissolves within its ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate
Molly looks up silently for a moment, her face filled with love
See ya
We see Sam's spirit rise from the room
It passes effortlessly through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone
The room grows dark
Molly sits quietly on the floor
There is a look of awe and wonder in her eyes
After a moment, Oda Mae reaches down to help her up
Molly looks at her lovingly and then gently takes her hand
Arm in arm, supporting one another, they walk quietly from the room
