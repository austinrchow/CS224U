(-) Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important things in life, the things that matter, that help you on your way
If you can't trust your friends, well, what then
series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets
(-) This could have been any city: they're all the same
rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow lanes and passageways
Accompanied by soundtrack and credits
The track ends outside a solid, fashionable Edinburgh tenement
At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement
The door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed with the names of three tenants
They are Alex Law, David Stevens, and Juliet Miller
man climbs the stairs and reaches the door
He is Cameron Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and lank, greasy hair
He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag
Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is answered
Hello, 've come about the room
Cameron enters and the door closes
David, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair
Alex checks some items on a clipboard before speaking
What's his name
don't know -- Campbell or something
Cameron
Cameron
Yes
(to Juliet) Really
That's right
(to Cameron) What
Cameron is not sure what to say
() Well, Cameron, are you comfortable
Yes, thanks
Good
Well, you've seen the flat
Yes
And you like it
Oh, yes, it's great
Yes
It is, isn't it
We alllike it
And the room's nice too, don't you think
Yes
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap
Well, yes
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you
As Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue
(-) mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a prospective flatmate
'm talking here about things like presence, charisma, style and charm, and  don't think we're being unreasonable
Take David here, for instance: a chartered accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard
The point is, don't think you're even trying
Cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs
He opens the main door
() And, Cameron --  mean this -- good luck
Cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him
() Do you think he was upset
Inside the hall of the flat, David approaches the door toopen it
Freeze-frame
(-) David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'
David opens the door to the Woman
've come to see about the room
Outside the door of the flat a young Goth girl, aged about twenty, rings the doorbell
Inside the hall of the flat Alex approaches the door to open it
Freeze-frame
(-) Alex is a vegetarian
Do you know why
Because he feels it provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous personality
It doesn't
He thinks he's the man for me
He isn't, though there was a time when, well, there was a time when
Alex opens the door to the Goth
've come about the room
At the door of the flat a Man aged about thrity-five rings the bell
Inside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open it
Freeze-frame
(-) Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what  think when think of Juliet
Juliet opens the door to the Man
've come about the room
In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i
e
the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair)
What we see are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews
We do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see some facial reaction
All of David's questions are to the Woman
All of Alex's questions are to the Goth
All of Juliet's questions are to the Man
All right, just a few questions
'd like to ask you about your hobbies
Why do you want a room here
Do you smoke
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire
mean, what are you actually doing here
What is the hidden agenda
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question
You're either divorced or you're not
, 'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- 'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear
Now, let me get this straight
This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important
Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that
Did you ever kill a man
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'
, so  has left you,  is ambivalent, you're still seeing  but is the one you yearn for
What are we to make of this
If were you, 'd ditch the lot
There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love
And what if  told you that  was the antichrist
In a sports centre Juliet sits outside a glass-walled squash court
She is ready to play, but at present is watching Alex and David, who are inside the court
Inside the squash court, Alex is about to serve
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination
Serve
was trying to educate you
Just serve
In the same fashion as chess
What
Chess
Chess is often used as well
Will you shut up and play
You're a bad loser
haven't lost yet
Alex serves
The squash-court door opens and David walks out past Juliet as Alex stands behind, jabbing his finger at him
Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial, professional, sexual, everything
Next
Juliet walks in and closes the door
Inside the squash court Alex is about to serve
Did you know -- Just serve
Alex serves
'  ( ) Alex sits in the back, drinking
Juliet is driving
David sits beside her
wasn't trying to win
There is no response from Juliet
() don't want to devalue your victory, but  just want you to know:  wasn't trying to win
Victory is the same as defeat
It's giving in to destructive competitive urges
You learn that in your psychotherapy group
Discussion group, Alex, discussion
thought you stopped going
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges
You of all people should know that
Alex leans close to Juliet
Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex flies forward, elbows him in the chest
() God, you two are sensitive
All 'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason
Why, 'd be proud of that sort of thing
Maybe you should go, Alex
You'll meet someone wonderful
For my life
At a discussion group
think not
For the flat
No
Be someone else like him
One is enough
And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round
liked her
really felt we had something
She could have moved in
We had chemistry
She hated you -- Well, she had problems -- -- more than anyone she has ever met
In her whole life
-- 'd be the first topoint that out
In all kindness  would
But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she
Outside the door of the flat Hugo rings the bell and waits
Juliet opens the door
Hugo is in his early thirties, tall, dark and bohemian in appearance
You must be Hugo
You must be Juliet
Would you like to come in
'd be delighted
Hugo walks in and Juliet closes the door quite deliberately behind him
Hugo looks around, pleased at what he sees, while Juliet watches him
He sits on the edge of the bed
It's nice
Would you like to see the rest
Hugo is seated on the sofa, Juliet sits opposite on an armchair
What do you do
Well, 've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now 'm trying to write a novel
What's it about
priest who dies
see
Yeah
Well, maybe 'll change it
No
Yes,  mean, who wants to read about another dead priest
It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die
You see, it's better already
Writing seems easy
It's a breeze
The telephone begins to ring out in the hall
Juliet does not move and at first says nothing
Hugo looks at her and towards the door leading to the hall
After several rings, Juliet speaks
Do you think you could answer that
The telephone
It continues to ring
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, 'm not in
You're not in
No
All right
Hugo stands up
The ringing continues
Hugo lifts the phone
He turns to face Juliet and looks her in the eye as he lies on her behalf
Hello
Yes
Who's calling please
Well, 'm sorry, but she's not in right now
don't know
Would you like to leave a message
Hugo replaces the receiver
() It was some guy called Brian
Did he sound upset
little bit
Is that good or bad
It's an improvement
The telephone begins to ring again
Shall  answer it
No, just leave it
He knows  must be at home
'm working nights this week
The telephone continues to ring
Working nights
'm a doctor
And he's a patient of yours
No
But he needs treatment
For what
certain weakness
The human condition
You know about it
write about it
And that's not the same thing
No, but like all novelists, 'm in search of the self
Juliet, dressed and fatigued, sits at the table sipping a coffee
Alex is also seated at the table, but wearing an old dressing- gown and munching at cornflakes while he reads a newspaper and talks at the same time
An array of other papers is spread over the table
Has he tried down the back of the fridge
mean, that's where normally find things
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex
Juliet gets up and leaves the kitchen
The soundof a bath running is heard
'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy
All 'm saying is, it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's on about, you know
Alex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to leave the kitchen and get it
(calling from outside) He didn't seem strange, Alex
He seemed, you know -- Juliet watches the bath fill
interesting
Alex considers her reply
Interesting
Interesting
Alex is walking through the hall to the door,muttering interesting' to himself
As he passes the phone starts to ring
He stops and lifts it
Hello
No, she's not in
No
No
No
No ideas
Alex replaces the reciever and walks on to the door
(from the bathroom) Who was it
don't know
He sounded Swedish
Do you know any Swedish men
Maybe it was just the emotion
Alex picks up the mail and looks through it
As he does so,David emerges from his room, dressed for work
() What do you think
About what
About this guy, this Hugo person
don't have time
'm only asking what you think
don't have time to discuss it now
don't care so long as he's not a freak
David opens the door
Alex hands him an envelope
This is for you
It's your mother's handwriting, so  didn't open it
don't like reading about your father's constipation
David snatches the letter and leaves, closing the door
Alex walks back across the hall, opening one of the letters and reading it quickly
(calling from the bathroom) So we'll meet him, then
What
Oh, yeah, sure, if you want
tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography
dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while , aroused and inflamed --' Juliet's hand and arm appear around the bathroom door
She attempts to grab the letter
Alex plays at holding the letter just beyond her reach
() Aroused and inflamed
Alex
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it
'd sign someone else's name
'd sign his name
If  wrote them, that is
Which  don't
Alex, David, Juliet and Hugo sit round a table towards the end of a meal
Alcohol has been consumed
Bowls containing the last of the food sit on the table, being picked at occassionally
Alex dispenses wine mainly into his own glass, alternating with Macallan malt whisky, of which he pours generous amounts
Interesting
see
Yeah, well, that's what she said
Interesting
That's why you're here, you see
Normally  don't meet people, unless  know them already
see
People can be so cruel
So, uh
What
What
You were going to say something
What was  trying to say
Oh, yes,  think, we think, or at least suppose we think -- am  right
Just get on with it, Alex
Keep it going, Alex
You're unstoppable now
We think it's fine
Alex starts eating again
The others watch him expectantly
David coughs
() It's
There's no problem
You mean  can have the room
Well, that's what  said, isn't it
He made it clear
Why, thank you, David
Yes, you can have the room
Alex pours yet more alcohol
'm not usually drunk
Not usually this drunk
Only on expenses
It's true
newspaper is paying for all this
newspaper
With exaggerated scorn, Alex knocks over a glass of wine
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone -- It was you, Juliet, it was you -- -- instead of what he is -- What  am
-- which is -- -- which is a hack
The man we know and love
miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet
() Know and love
Yeah
think you're lying
You're right
You see, they don't really know me
No, Alex, we don't really love you
Alex smiles at Juliet and drinks again
Can you afford this place
Yeah
Hugo reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick bundle of notes, which he places in front of Alex
Alex leans over and sniffs the notes
Can  ask you a question
Certainly
Have you ever killed a man
No
Well, that's fair enough, then
Alex raises his head
Certainly smells like the real thing
At a cash dispenser a man in his thrities is taking out some money
younger man, Andy, stands besdie him, looking around in a mildly agitated fashion
As the money emerges, Andy assaults and robs the man
He starts by smashinf the victim's face repeatedly against the cash dispenser until the Perspex is smeared with blood
When he has final finished and the man lies on the ground, Andy takes the money and the card from the slots, then gets into a car which has pulled up alongside, driven by Tim
Hugo climbs the stairs, carrying two suitcases
He stops at the door of the flat and looks at a bunch of keys before selecting one, which he inserts in the door
Inside the flat
The door opens and Hugolifts his cases in, kicking the door closed behind him
' Juliet sleeps, undisturbed by the closing of the door
Hugo walks across the halland disappears into his room
' Hugo unpackshis bags
Included in his things are a few syringes and needles
All these he puts into the drawer beside his bed
He checks inside a second bag
Hugo dails a number on the telephone and awaits a reply
' Juliet is woken by her alarm clock
The time is five p
m
Alex sits watching television, constantly changing channels
Juliet walks in, wearing a dressing gown
She watches Alex for a few moments
Have you seen Hugo
No
Any idea which channel he's on
The telephone is ringing
Alex lifts up the reciever
Again he is wearing his dressing gown and is on his way to pick up the mail
No, she's not in
Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail
On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work
() Have you seen him
Alex,  don't have the time -- Yes or no, yes or no, yes or -- No
David leaves, slamming the door
Alex returns to the kitchen, pausing only to knock at Hugo's door, which elicits no response
In the kitchen Juliet sits dressed for work, having just returned
He casually opens an envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing it to her
David hasn't seen him either
So  gathered
Maybe he didn't like us
David
Hugo
His car's still there
He's got a car
So what's wrong with that
What sort of car
Alex, how shouldI know
'm just a girl
will ask you once more, what sort of car -- blue one,
And it's still there
We see the door to Hugo's room, then Alex rapping sharply against it
David and Juliet stand behind him
Hugo
Hugo
Sorry about this, but can you open the door
It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions
Your new-found friends
He's not in
He's left and we'll probably never see him again
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side
So
Open it
You want me to kick it open
Yes
Now
Yes
All right
No problem
After several ineffective kicks at the door, Alex turns to David
() You want a go
' Inside Hugo's room we see the door as David, outside, throws himself against it
At the third attempt the lock gives way and the door bursts open
In the foreground at one side is the bed with a naked foot lying still and exposed
When the door is open, David is first in, followed by the other two
There is a period of silent shock as they contemplate Hugo's naked corpse
Alex opens a window
Is this what they always look like
Yes
Juliet drapes a sheet over the body, covering it completely
wonder how he did it
Did what
wonder how he killed himself
presume that that's what happened
What do you think
Quite casually, Alex begins to open drawers and cupboards, emptying the contents on to the floor
Alex
What
What's wrong
What are you doing
'm just looking
Don't
Don't look
No
Why not
What's wrong, Juliet
Aren't you curious
Don't you wonder what he died from
No
The guy's dead
What more do you need
It's not every day  find a story in my own flat
Thats not a story, Alex
It's a corpse
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story
Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet
In a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes and a small bag of powder
Without comment, he holds it up and throws it on the bed
He reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens
It is empty and he pushes it back under
've never seen a dead body before
Alex,  think it's time for you to stop
Alex continues to search
Juliet walks out
Juliet stands alone
' Alex continues his brisk search through Hugo's posesseions while David looks on, appalled but speechless
Juliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom, then picks up the telephone
She dials 999 and waits for a reply
It rings and rings
' Alex has found and opened a large Gladstone bag
Neither David norwe can see into it
saw my grandmother, of course, but  don't suppose that counts
mean, she was alive at the time
Can  show you something
Juliet awaits an answer
Alex approaches Juliet with the open bag
She turns around and looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the receiver
As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a second
Hello, emergency services
The telephone hits the cradle
David, Alex and Juliet are seated in silence around the tabel
The bag, stacked with money, lies open on the table
No
Think about it
No
Come on, David
No
Juliet
No, Alex
It's, it's -- What
Unfeasible
Is that all
You mean immoral
'm only asking you both to think about it
It's asick idea, Alex
It's sick
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it
Don't tell me that you're not interested
know you well enough
You think so
() All right, then, go ahead, telephone
Telephone the police
Try again
No one's going to stand in your way
Go ahead
Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it
The flat is silent
Footsteps are heard outside the door and mail falls through the letter box
The living room, empty
The kitchen, empty
The bag of money still sits on the table
' His corpse lies on the bed, covered as before, incompletely, by a sheet, with parts of his body still showing (a foot, a hand, part of his face or abdomen)
The open-plan office of a busy newspaper
Alex sits at his desk
He is talking on a telephone jammed against his shoulder and while he does so he is casually acknowledging and waving at colleagues
Now, was there a pet in the house
Yes, a pet, like a dog or a budgie or a gerbil
You see, what  need is  Plod rescues Harry the Hamster from House of Horror'
All right
well, that's a pity, you see, no pets, no human angle
Alex hangs up
' Another view of the body: for example, from above
In the accident and emeregency department of a busy hospital, Juliet sifts through a setof casenotes
Another Doctor approaches her
Hi, there
Juliet does not look up
Hello
What happened to that guy
What guy
That guy, the one that died
Juliet looks up
What guy that died
That one, last week
Here
Yeah, here,  mean, where else
Oh, him
Well, he died
() That's what  thought
' The body, stillpresent, exposed and motionless
The curtain flutters by the open window
' Lumsden, a middle-aged chartered accountant, isseated in a largechair behind a desk
He is talking to David,who appears distracted
What do we do here, David
Sorry
Here
Right here
In this firm
Well, it's a wide range of, eh -- Accounting, David, chartered accounting -- Exactly what  was -- -- is often sneered at
Are you aware of that
Not any real sneering as such, no
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it
Eh -- But they sneer, don't they
'm not sure -- Oh, it's unfashionable,  know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done
Yes, sir
And that's why  think you fit in here
'm boring
You get the job done
Oh,  see,  thought you meant -- Which is why 'm trusting you with this account
Lumsden throws a heavy folder into David's lap
' It is almost dark
Only the familiar contour is visible through the gloom
David ascends the stairs to the flat
Alex sits in an armchair facing out of the window
Juliet stands facing into the room
David, the last home, appears in the doorway
He's still here
He couldn't get his car started
When are you going to let the police know
You call them if you want
(to Juliet) And what about you
Well, 'm getting used to having him around
' The corpse as before
' David sits at his desk, looking across the office
Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women in suits are pouring over folders and columned books
No one is speaking except in muted tones on the telephones
David watches them
He looks to his left and to his right: on either side young men like him are toiling over accounts
He turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants sit
He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously given
He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large total at the bottom
When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk
She smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding scene
' The body in silhouette
(-) Let's do it
Inside a large, brightly lit  store with Muzak playing in the background
We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked with potentially vicious tools
(-) All right, now listen
We have to dispose of the body in such a way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse
Burning, dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records
This have learned
Now, what  suggest is that we bury him out in the forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which we incinerate
And his teeth, which we just remove
It's as simple as that
As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as he looks at something off picture
Suddenly a spring-loaded screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few millimeters from his face
David winces as we see that Alex is holding it
() always wondered what these were for
Alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer
() Now this is what we need
And this
Alex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust
Alex walks on
() Now what else
don't know
spade, we need a spade --  wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit
So who's going to do it
Dig the pit,  don't know
No, not that
Then what
Who's going to do what
You know what 'm talking about
Do
What
What
What are you talking about
You know what
Who's going to do it
We all are, David, we're all going to do it
Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit
Is that fair enough
can't do it
don't hear this
won't be able to
You're telling me you want out
Already
You're telling me you don't want the money
Hugo is going off
He smells
The flat smells
We can't wait any longer
'm just telling you  can't cut him up
Alex turns away in disgust
Late at night, in a quiet lane at the back of the flat, a hired Ford Transit is parked
Inside the dimly lit van, Alex and Juliet are laying down plastic on the floor
Who's going to do it
thought we all were
don't thinkI can
But you're a doctor
You kill people every day
don't want to
It's different
And now you tell me
/ Man's face is being held under water
Bubbles escape from his mouth and his eys bulge
Tim hauls the Man's head out of the bath
His legs and arms are bound with cord
Andy sits on a chair, watching
Tim ducks the Man's head under the water again
The Man's face as before
' We see Hugo's face just before Alex, David and Juliet wrap him in a sheet and thick, black plastic
They wear masks over their noses
The smell is making them uncomfortable and irritable
There's something  want to ask
The Man's head has just been lifted from the water
don't know
swear to God,  don't know
Tim ducks the Man's head back under the water
' (angry through his mask) Family
Family
Friends
Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David
just thought we should discuss it
Take his legs
In the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting
They come into view and go down the stairs
They are all very tense and freeze with panic after accidentally banging against another flat's door
They swear at one another and continue theri descent
Tim is ducking the Man again
He writhes and struggles but is powerless to stop it
The back yard and back door of the flats
The door opens and Alex, David and Juliet emerge, carrying the corpse out towards the van
From the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom
The Man's legs extend away from the bath
They are completely still
Andy and Tim stand beside them, looking down
You stupid bastard
Inside the back of the empty van
The door is opened and the body is half slid and half thrown inside
The door is closed and in the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just visible, thanks to a streetlight
One of the doors opens again and David throws a bag of tools in
He then closes and locks the door
In front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side
Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel
Alex turns to the other two
Why don't we just draw lots for it
The other two remain silent
() Whoever draws the short straw does it all
That way, you either do it or you don't
All or nothing
David
don't know
Look, if  draw the short straw, then 'll do it, but 'm not going to do it just because you won't
Alex starts the engine of the van
Through the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of the van come into view
It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass
The engine is switched off but the light remains on
The trio descend from the van
In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David and Juliet stand together
Alex is showing them two long stems of grass and one short one
He encloses them in his fist and holds them out
All right, then, here we are and this is it
Do you want to play or not
Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one of the stems
It is one of the larger ones
Alex and Juliet turn to David
Alex holds out the stems
David reaches out and takes one of the tips
It is the short straw
can't do it
Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders
His right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a vicious sawing noise
The sawing stops as he evidently finished with one extremity
He shuffles back and starts sawing at another
Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug
He observes David impassively
The sawing stops again
Finished
But not quite
Is that going to be deep enough
Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards David
Don't you worry about that
Is this necessary
Yes
Now come on, all or nothing
Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who gestures as if to say, "On you go
' With revulsion on his face, he raises the hammer above his head
' David's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his pillow
He lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling
There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in
Are you all right
(without looking at Juliet) Oh, yes, 'm fine, thanks, just fine
Would you like to talk about it
No
Alex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show, while eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer
Newspapers lie scattered at his feet
The loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened, letting in a pool of light
David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft
Beneath him is a stepladder
Juliet stands half-way up the ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it
As David enters the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it on up to David
Be careful
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands
Don't fall through the ceiling
Is he listening to me
Stop nagging
(to himself) don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being
We could have hid it in the fridge
David moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way across beams and pipes
There are no skylights
He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank)
He strains to see in the darkness
Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water empties from the water tank
David is startled and steps forward, tripping
He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch
Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out
David scrambles towards the trapdoor
' Now clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation
In a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the ceiling
Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'
On the floor of this area are yellow plastic sacks
Juliet appears around a corner carrying one of these
Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues past
Alex pushes a blue car into a quary
- In the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which sit Andy and Tim
Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to Andy, who declines
They slide off the deep freeze and open it
Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord
They lift him up
He is very cold and weak
The Man begins to whisper inaudibly
Andy moves his head so that he can hear the whisper
He listens, then nods approvingly
They push him down again and close the lid
Andy holds the lid while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top
Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball
Everyone is dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the addition of a significant number of kilts
Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt
The trio seem to know a number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak to them
middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to the diners who are still sat at their tables
Ladies and gentlemen, may  have your attention please
First of all, may  thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit
There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out
We move to the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated
Alex leans across to Juliet
You didn't tell me that this was for children
hate children
'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down
Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex
Sshh
want my money back
Excuse me
Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already ists in front of him
For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of mind, let someone else bother about these things
Alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own
Juliet nudges him viciously
() But just before the dancing, 'd like to say a special thank-you to a few of the people who've worked so very hard to make this occassion happen
The 's drone continues in the background while conversation continues back at the table
Do you know many of these people
Yes
They're my friends
see, so if they want to talk to you, we say you're not in
And now, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who are neither or both -- Drum roll
() -- would you make your way to the floor for Strip the Willow
Are we going to dance
Well, it's physical contact, isn't it
The dance floor a few minutes later
It is packed and rather chaotic
Sweaty, dishevelled dancers sling one another around, with the thud of flesh against flesh
Toes are stood on and jackets discarded
Juliet dances with Alex, who plunges in with the maximum of violence, eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among the other dancers
He starts to get up, then rests his head back against the floor
David has not been dancing
Instead he remains at their table and at the bar, drinking steadily and watching the other two
Back at the table, while most people are still on the dnace floor, the trio sit drinking and Alex smokes a cigar
That was good
Can we talk about something
Not now
have an idea
Alex pours champagne on to a stack of glasses
Listen, it's important
We need to talk about what we're going to do -- Just stop worrying
Alex stands and raises his glass
() Love and happiness for ever
For ever and ever
Alex drinks, then puts his glass down
Juliet drinks but does not drain her glass
David sits still
What's the problem
want to talk now
After you drink to love and happiness forever
Now
After
David,  promise we will
Keep him happy
It's not for me
It's for love and happiness forever
David reaches out to take his glass
Suddenly, Alex flings an arm out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing interest
() Look over there
It's Cameron
Who
Cameron
You remember Cameron
No,  don't
What's he doing here
That's not him
Yes, it is
It's him
Cameron, Cameron, come on over
Yo
From some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from the table
What
Nothing
We thought you were someone else
Alex falls forward, laughing, and the other two also laugh as Cameron walks away, humiliated again
() Good luck
love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around
Anyway, what  was wanting to say was this -- () The divine Juliet
Long time no see
Brian approaches and is standing behind their table
Brian
Would you care to dance
Hold on there
Who do you think you are
What
Who do you think you are
You interrupted us
'm Brian McKinley, and who are you
Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you talk to me first
If you want to dance with her, then you apply in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a fucking bin-bag
You didn't apply, so you don't dance
Shocked and frightened, Brian backs away, then turns around to complete his departure
Juliet restrains David with a touch as they watch him go
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time
'm sorry
It's alright
think he got the message anyway
That was stressful
found that stressful
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good
Fucking bin-bag', liked that
You were good
You explored your maleness to the full there
You think so
Well, you certainly had a good look around
You were magnificent
The gents' toilet
Brightly-lit and white-tiled
Alex walk in and goes into a cubicle and closes the door
We hear him whistling and laughing as he passes urine
He keeps muttering bin-bag' to himself
Then he flushes the toilet and opens the door
As he does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone waiting for him
Cameron
What a surprise
As Alex is speaking Cameron's fist flies forward, hitting him in the face and sending him flying backwards
Cameron enters the cubicle and closes the door behind him
Mail falls through the letter box
Alex does not stir
David emerges from his room, ready for his work
He looks towards the kitchen, then walks to the door and opens it
We hear the main door closing as David leaves
Alex jolts with energy with every sound
The telephone begins to ring
Juliet looks at Alex expectantly, but he does not move
Eventually she gets up and answers it
Hello
Hello
Who was it
Don't know
No one said anything
Rendered speechless with desire
recall that feeling, from the days when  had such a thing
Are you all right
No
Then let's spend some money
There follows a video depicting the results of Alex's and Juliet's spending spree
It opens with Alex seated at the kitchen table talking to the camera, absolutely deadpan
Hello
It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over, the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same again
Alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play button on a tape recorder
The music begins
Fast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is switched on and off
Alex wearing several different suits, outfits and silk pyjamas
Juliet wearing several different outfits
Both of them posing with small objets d'art
The expensive watch on Alex's wrist
Juliet's jewellery
Expensive toys
Juliet takes a picture of Alex with a Polaroid camera
Alex holds the camcorder out at arm's length in order to film himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie
() This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and you know, 'm so happy  could die
Darkness
Turned off
The music has stopped
David presses the eject button and lifts the video from the player
Alex and Juliet are seated on the sofa, surrounded by their acquisitions, and are evidently a little embarrassed
Juliet is holding the Polaroid of Alex
think we ought to scrub this, don't you
David reinserts the tape and presses record
Will you calm down
Yeah, you're making us all nervous
David picks up the Polaroid of Alex and throws it down, then picks up a vase
How much did you pay
don't know
How much did you pay
don't know
How much
don't know
Two hundred
Two hundred pounds
Two hundred pounds
You paid two hundred pounds for this
That's what it cost, David
No, no, no
That's what you paid for it
Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it
We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet
From out in the hall, the phone starts to ring
Nobody moves
' David lies awake in his bed
Hearing the noise, David sits up in bed, then gets out, reaching for his clothes
David looks down the stairwell
Other neighbours, in nightclothes or hurriedly dressed, are standing at the open door of the flat below
David descends the the stairs and looks into the hall of the other flat where the occupant, an Elderly Woman, lies groaning on the floor
hand on David's shoulder pushes him out of the way and two uniformed policemen walk past, followed by an ambulance man carrying a stretcher
Did they take anything
Did they take anything
No one acknowledges his question or answers it
The ambulance men emerge carrying the woman, her face bruised and cut
Everyone else begins to melt away
David stands alone on the darkened stairwell
' David lies awake in his bed
Someone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are two new security chains on the inside
The door is forced against the chains with no success and Alex calls from the other side
What is this
What is going on
David
David approaches the door
'll let you in
David closes the door and looks through a new spyhole to see Alex grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the door again
Alex walks in
What is this
Security
From what
Jehovah's Witnesses
There was a break-in
Downstairs,  know
Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six
Alex hands David a rolled-up newspaper
Doesn't it worry you
No, it doesn't
tried to let it worry me but it won't
've worked on that paper for three years
There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day
Every day
Maybe when 'm a pensioner it'll worry me
Alex notices some more tools and the stepladder leading up to the trapdoor
() What's all this for, more security
fitted a lock up there
On the inside
Oh, that'll come in useful
Alex is serving on plates from a large bowl of pasta
David and Juliet sit at the tabel
Is this the same stuff you made last week
No, no, it's different
hope it tastes better than the other stuff
It tastes different
don't want it to taste different
don't know why  bother
Is that enough for you
Hey
What
Yes, that's fine
You're sure
There's lots more
No, 'm sure, that'll be enough
What's wrong
Nothing
You're not eating
Not eating what
Not eating like you used to, that's what
If you give me the plate, 'll eat
Alex hands him the plate and he starts to eat
Alex watches him chew a mouthful
Now swallow
David does so
() You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it
That's my advice
He's right
You'd feel much better about it
David has stopped eating
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it
Be like a weight off your shoulders
You know we're right
Don't you
want to secure it
Secure it
What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank
You're not going to take it to a bank
You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it
Is that it
don't see the point in that
Because that's no good
Remember, we did what we did, we took the money
It was a material calculation
But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place
If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it
None
It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that
didn't get into this for nothing, so that  could have nothing -- Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off
There is silence
David resumes eating
() It tastes different
Alex stands at the sink doing some washing up
He hears footsteps from the loft above
He stops what he is doing and walks slowly out ot the hall
In the darkness we can just make out David's eyes as he sits in darkness
(calling from below) David, David, what are you doing up there
The torch goes on
David lifts the bag of money from between the rafters
He puts it inside another thick yellow plastic bag, which he ties tightly with string
David opens the water tank
Alex's voice can be heard throughout
(continued; calling from below) Will you come down now
It's not safe up there
Are you listening to me
Security and insanity are not the same thing
Shit
Juliet sits drinking coffee, while Alex sands in the doorway looking up towards the trapdoor
Leave him alone
He can't stay up there
He'll come down
Leave him alone
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he
You think he'll come down for that
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it
Juliet looks through the door from a small office out into the main waiting area in the casualty departmet
It is busy and there are rooms of people nursing injuries waiting to be seen
More file past the door while she watches with no enthusiasm
The trapdoor opens
David's head appears
He looks around and listens carfeully
' Lumsden answers his telephone
David speaks on the telephone
It's my mother, sir, she's very ill and  think  need to be with her just now
don't know
The doctors aren't sure
It could go either way
Yes, sir, 'll certainly stay in touch
David shaves carefully with a safety razor
Bacon and eggs fry in a pan
David attends to them while drinking from a large tumbler of orange juice
Sister hands Juliet a casualty case sheet
Juliet reads it
Painful groin
What does that mean
don't know
He wouldn't show me
Juliet draws back the curtain of a cubicle
Alex is sitting on a trolly
Boy, am  glad to see you
What are you doing here
We have to talk
Your painful groin
She turns and walks away
Alex chases after her
Later
But first -- him
David
Exactly
Now 've been thinking -- Oh, good
He won't do anything for me, but for you -- Forget it
He isn't safe up there
If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe
And the money
We could put it somewhere
Where he can't get it
Now you thought of that, not me
Forget it -- he'll come down
Juliet walks away
The hall is empty and the flat is silent
We see the trapdoor
David sits in the darkness
crack of light penetrates beside the trapdoor
Alex and Juliet sit at the table, eating in silence
The doorbell rings
Alex and Juliet look at one another
Expecting anyone
No
Oh
Alex resumes eating
Aren't you going to answer it
Well, 'm not expecting anyone either
Juliet glares at him
Alex approaches the door and is about to open it
At the last moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole
Tim and Andy stand outside the door
Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening the door
As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as the security chains break off
Tim and Andy enter the flat
In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into the living room and bind them up with cord
There are no words apart from slightly muffled cries
At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a crowbar
Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's shins
Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into Alex's mouth
For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly again, he takes the crowbar out
It's in the loft
The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat
Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor
It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool around the opening
Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness
It is David
He stands perfectly still
There is a hammer in his right hand
Tim's head appears through the trapdoor
Cautiously he lifts himself through and balances on the beams
The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor
Suddenly there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing heavily on and across some beams in the loft
David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before
Andy has heard the single thud
He strains to hear anything else but does not
Slowly he backs away to the door of the living room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so
He looks back and up towards the trapdoor
Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor
Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering into the darkness
Carefully he stands up and moves out of the light and steps across the beams
His foot strikes something and he looks down
Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him
He looks up
To one side of him is the brass light switch
Andy lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on
Sparks pour out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only centimetres from his own
Alex and Juliet are bound together as before
There is a loud thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps
Then Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet
Andy takes one agonal breath and dies
Blood trickles from the side of his mouth
Tim's body lands on Andy
David drops himself from the hatch to the floor
David takes a large knife from a wooden block
Back in the hall he kneels, holding the knife, beside Tim
Noticing something at the top of tim's neck, he uses the knife to lift away Tim's -shirt
tattoo covers Tim's neck
David looks at it, then stands up
He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still bound, watch him approach
He looks at them for a moment, then extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place
In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen
He stops and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above his head
The van is silhouetted against a rising sun
The tools and the yellow sack slide about in the back of the van
David is driving
Alex and Juliet are huddled silently away from him
David seems quite at ease
thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition
Juliet observes them
David sits still in the darkness
Alex sits at his desk fidgeting, about to write something but unable to start
On the screen of his word processor is a page mock-up with the headline   '
As the telephone on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts it fractionally and replaces it
' Hunched over a , the Salesman is offering Juliet a range of flights
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds
Seven six five
That sounds fine
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five
Five six five
It's up to you
Catering important
What
Air France
Glasgow
Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds
That's nine one two
It's up to you
Yes, the first one's fine
Heathrow direct
It's up to you
Air Patagonia
New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot No catering
Four hundred and eleven pounds
Four one one
Good value, but refueling at Bogot is variable
The first one was fine
Well, it's up to you
Seven six five
How will you be paying
The hall is empty but we can hear David's footsteps on the beams above
Alex sits watching The Wicker Man on televison
He can hear the footsteps above
He turns the sound up on the television so that he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as though he expects to hear them or see somwthing
Eventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's silence, the footsteps start again, back and forth, then stop
Alex looks up
Without warning there is the sound of an electric drill
The blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then withdrawn
Alex is shocked
Other drill holes appear
Holes are drilled in the ceilings
Rods of light penetrate up from the holes, interrupting but not obliterating the darknes
David sits back, pleased with his work
' Juliet sits at her desk
Alex stands in the doorway
He is about to speak
Juliet raises a finger to her lips
They both look at the ceiling
Establishing shot of Alex and Juliet in garden
The trapdoor is open
' David is searching through Alex's desk, looking through letters and folders, then shoving them back into drawers
No, definitely not
And that's that
refuse to discuss it further
It's the only way
refuse
You're frightened
No, 'm not frightened
little terrified maybe
Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that
They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference,  mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing
It wasn't difficult to spot
He killed them both: he cut them up
' David is now searching through Juliet's desk
He picks up a large brown envelope and looks into it
Beneath it is the airline ticket envelope
The doorbell rings
McCall and Mitchell stand outside the door
David opens the door
McCall smiles
Good evening
'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is Mitchell
wonder if we could ask you some questions
What about
It's about the burglary
Burglary
Downstairs
Of course
Can we come in
David sits on the sofa while the two policemen sit on armchairs several feet apart
So  just heard her cries for help and all that, and when  went downstairs there were already those other people there, so  just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived  came back upstairs
And that's about all,  think
didn't actually see anything useful, don't think
did you hear anything before he cries
No, not that  recall,  was asleep
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days
No, nothing, sorry
Well, if you do, you'll let us know
Of course
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything
There are only two other people in the flat
McCall consults a notebook
Two
Who said there were four
We understood there were four people living here
Not always, of course, but now, four
No, three
Who said there were four
How strange
And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information
Only three people here
You're sure
Yes, absolutely
Take a note of that, Mitchell
Only three, rather than four
Write it down
You can use numbers or words,  have no preference
Which are you using
Both, sir
Excellent
Mitchell is a rising star, Mr
Stevens
Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade
see
doubt it
And these two other people, did they hear anything
No, they were asleep
They didn't even wake up
Yes
Why do you think you woke and they didn't
don't know
Maybe 'm a light sleeper
Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has underlined a short segment of it
In the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door, waiting to leave
McCall is kneeling at the door to Hugo's room, tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock
David looks on
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well
Someone lost the key
McCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall illuminates Hugo's room
Is this where no one stays
Yeah, that's right, that's it
David notices that Mitchell is writing this down
You'll wait in the hall
'll wait there
And if it sounds like 'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything
Everything
Everything
Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place
That's important to me
need to die misunderstood
Alex
What
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help
She hands Alex a Yale key
Alex stares at it
In the darkness, the sound of the lock being turned is heard
Alex tsands at the top of the ladder, holding the key in the trapdoor lock
All right, David, what 'm going to do is, 'm going to open this lock and 'm going to come up, and what's important is that you remain calm
There is one light on
Juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder
Having opened the trapdoor, Alex stops and listens, but there is no sound above his own breathing
Juliet throws up a torch, which he catches
He switches it on
It shines, then goes out, and he knocks it against the ladder, making it work again
Slowly he pushes the trapdoor open
The trapdoor opens
Below it, Alex crouches on the ladder, expecting attack at any moment
He looks back down to Juliet, who returns his gaze, then he slowly raises himself into the loft
He turns around quickly, darting the torchlight around into corners and squinting in the darkness, but he sees nothing
The torch goes out
Cursing, he knocks it against a beam and it shines again
Slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the loft, still turning around and worried about what might be behind him
Juliet stands waiting, braced for sounds of conflict
Alex is still looking but has relaxed a little, feeling les in danger
In one corner he notices David's pile of left-possessions and the mat on which he has been sleeping
He moves towards it
Juliet stands, still waiting
Alex stands in David's corner
With another sweep of the torch he can still see nothing
He calls to Juliet
He isn't up here
close-up of Juliet's face, just as David's hand slams across her mouth, gripping her tightly while his other hand clamps on the back of her head
David's mouth is right up against her ear as he spits a warning into it
Tell him to look for the money
Slowly, David relaxes his grip on Juliet
Look for the money
Alex, cheerful now, is looking in the rafters
Don't worry, that's what 'm doing
David holds Juliet across her face again
She is terrified and does not struggle
Expecting anyone
What
Were you expecting anyone
Tonight
No
Visitors
Some friends maybe
Someone you talked to
No one
promise
Who have you talked to
No one
If  think you're lying -- Alex stands gazing around the loft
(from the loft) Well, it's not up here
David pulls Juliet to one side
Alex is about to descend when he notices the water tank
He walks over and lifts the lid
His face breaks into a smile as he realizes what it holds
He dips an arm into the tank, raises the yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again
Alex steps back from the water tank
Alex appears at the top of the ladder
Without looking, he slides down as quickly as he can, calling out as he does so
Juliet,  have -- Alex reaches the base of the ladder
He turns around to find himself facing the blade of the battery-operated drill, held by David
Juliet stands off to one side
() -- a problem
David holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the centre of Alex's forehead and presses the trigger' to turn the blade slowly as he speaks
Alex does not move at all
You looking for me
Looking for you
Yes
What for
What did you want
The money
Was that it
We just wanted to speak to you
Alex's hands and sleeves are wet
few drops of water fall from his fingertips
Unnoticed by the other two, he slowly wipes his hands on the back of his jeans
Who else have you wanted to speak to
Maybe you thought they'd already got me
The blade os the drill scrapes Alex's skin
Who
Your friends
don't know what you're talking about
He doesn't know David
David holds the drill back slightly while he thinks
It could go either way
Well, maybe you don't -- David lowers the drill and smiles
() 'm talking about the police
' Alex has just woken up
He rubs his forehead
There is a nick in it, where the drill has scratched
He rubs at it and examines the drop of blood on the end of his finger
'
' Looking down from a hole in the ceiling, we see into Alex's room, where he is getting dressed
Alex leaves his room and enters the hall
Looking down from a hole in the ceiling, we see into Alex's room, where he is getting dressed
/ Looking down on Alex as he leaves the flat and closes the door
David scurries back across the beams to look down through another hole
He looks for several seconds
In the following sequence, Juliet's face is not seen until her comment on it
' Juliet lies on her bed
She throws the covers back
David is still looking down through the hole
' Juliet moves about her room
She is wearing a large, baggy - shirt
David still watching
' Juliet's legs are seen as the -shirt lands on the floor beside them
David sits back suddenly, recoiling from the activity
He scrambles back across to his mat, where he sits back down and closes his eyes
Then he opens them and scrambles back to look down again
' The room is empty
The sound of the flat door closing is heard
From David's point of view we see: / () /  () / () David's head appears beneath the trapdoor
He hangs from the hatch and drops down to the floor
David showers
David emerges from the bathroom and walks towards the kitchen
We follow him in
David takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a glass
He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that we cannot see
The expression oh his face does not change and his voice is impassive
thought you'd gone to work
() With a face like this
Juliet's face
There are bruises across it where she was gripped by David
/ In close-up we track along the following half-sentence: In the event of my death  want the following facts to be known:' -- The remainder of the screen is blank
Alex sits at his desk, deciding what to type next on the screen seen before
young Office Boy approaches his desk
The editor wants to see you
David sits while Juliet talks
She is now seated behind him
remember how things used to be here, and  see how they are now, and  don't know why it is
don't know how we let you become like this
We were your friends and we should have looked after you
' Alex sits nervously while the Editor sits on the side of his desk
Out in the woods
Three bodies
Decomposed
Mutilated
Beyond recognition
don't know anything about it
Of course you don't know anything about it
If you knew anything about it,  wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it
Cover it
Well
But there's no -- Animals involved
know, but you need a change
And besides, we're short
don't know
Don't know what
Well, 've got this story, it's really good, 'm working on, that is good,  feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible
Am  right, did you say beyond recognition'
David and Juliet are seated as before
'm sorry
should hope so
david turns towards her
He reaches out and softly touches her face
Maybe we can still sort everything out
Juliet takes his hand
We can try
They look at one another
Several police and unmarked vehicles, including one mobile incident room', stand on a rough track
Another car arrives at the end and is parkeed to one side
Alex steps out
From where he stands, Alex can see towards the site of the burials
There are a few policemen, uniformed and plain-clothes, and a small knot of journalists, kept at bay by plastic tape draped from tree to tree
Mounds of earth mark the site of the exhumations
Alex walks past the other journalists into the woods
He looks back towards the sight, then turns to look in the opposite direction
He finds himself at the edge of a golf course
From the green to the graves is hardly any distance
To one side, Alex sees McCall and Mitchell, hunched in earnest discussion
Mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches Alex's eye
/ The kitchen is empty
We track through the kitchen and out into the hall, stopping at the door to Juliet's room
' David and Juliet are seated on the bed
Among the junk on her bedside table is the Polaroid photograph of Alex, propped up against a tumbler
Juliet reaches out and turns it away before pulling David towards her
Several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs
Alex sits at the back, near the half-open door
At the other end, three police officers face them
They are a medium-ranking Uniformed Officer, and to one side of him Mitchell and then McCall, both of whom sit in silence
All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy facts of the day so far are as follows
Late yesterdat afternoon, forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a grave which appeared to have been recently dug
Further excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves, again containing human remains
Alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial site, now enclosed in a plastic tent
He continues to stare at it
While Alex is looking, the sound of laughter and Uniformed Officer's subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory of a sound in Alex's head: it is the noise of the saw going back and forth across the victim's limbs
() As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as identification, which will of course be passed on to you after informing, where possible, the next of kin
Alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van
Alex walks away from the incident room towards his car
He breaks into a run for a few paces
The noise of the sawing continues
As he reaches his car, Alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys
He is sweating and trembling
He drops his keys
As he bends down to pick them up, his foot slips on the wet grass
He falls to his knees, his forehead banging against the car door
He kneels for a moment, gripping the keys, his head resting against the door
The noise of the sawing stops
From behind, the arm of a Police Constable reaches out and his hand rests on Alex's shoulder
