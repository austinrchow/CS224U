"  Like modern demons
Grotesque
Disturbing
between details of their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws, broken glass teeth
-  - Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of sand and heat
; - violent   around, but through the sand we-can just make out a large, ominous building:  the  of William Nix
Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with
The "family" of  surrounds the doorway, guarding it , the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago" '  - We're at the front door now, which stands open
Leaning against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed , about sixteen
His name is
He's got a brooding, almost sultry look on his face
One of his eyes is black, the other milky blue
He's whittling something with a scalpel
Distantly, the sound of
Butterfield narrows his eyes
'
The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the house
(softly) Swann
He turns from the door
In his haste he drops the  he's whittling
He's been carving a '
'  -    - The house no longer serves any domestic function
It has become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic cult
As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse a little of what life here is like
The rooms are murky, and chaotic
The walls,  with scenes of cities and landscapes , and creatures from some unspeakable nightmare , , and helpless humanity
The atmosphere is joyless, and oppressive
The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his way to the heart of the house
Only  , set on the floor, light these claustrophobic corridors
Master
'  -   - dozen  sit cross-legged on the floor in front of their leader,
His black hair grows to his shoulders
His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice seductive
terrifying yet charismatic presence
All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives - wear the same simple -shirts, painted with the cult's
They watch Nix in adoration
As Nix speaks, he juggles a , passing it from hand to hand with casual ease
And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix, you're my instrument
From now on, you'll be called the Puritan
(murmuring) Puritan
You will find a few good men and women, and together, together you will cleanse the world
Yes
Butterfield enters
Master
Nix looks up
Swann's here
Nix rises, smiling
(to Cultists) We'll come back to this
Get about your business
As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into '  -  - place of nightmares
Hanging from the middle of the ceiling is another grotesque , three times the bulk of a large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and knotted rope
It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying, creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian
It is a perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony
From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft Hush
Nix goes to the
She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and presently in a state of mortal fear
She sits, bound, in a fetal position, her face soaked with  and , her mouth , her cheek
said hush
Please
Let me go
From the opposite corner the  of Nix's pet
Nix goes to it
The animal is large and lethal
(to Baboon) What is it
The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring its teeth as it screeches
(to Girl) think he's in love
He unshackles the Baboon
The animal pads toward the Girl, trailing its chain
Keep it away from me
Nix catches hold of its chain
Holds it back
The Baboon starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its catching her arms and legs, drawing
Please
please
Nix watches her terror dispassionately
(also watching, wide- eyed) Want me to shoot Swann
You don't like him, do you
He wants your magic
Maybe
Go fetch him
Butterfield exits
Nix advances on the Girl
What are you going to do
: '  -  - The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house
From the Thunderbird steps  , a nineteen- year-old with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes
He's not conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking
From the passenger seat steps  , a black man, studious and intense
From the bus emerges  , skinny and jittery, and  , a woman with a steely gaze
(to all three) Are we ready
(cool) Say the word
(very nervous) Look, maybe we should think this over
On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces of
We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as he slips them into his pocket
No
He's gone too far
So he took a child
He'll kill her
No he won't
(determined) He's not going to get the chance
Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt
If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy
So stay out here
Swann starts towards the House
Jennifer is the first to follow, with the other two on her heels
'  -  - Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside
He's expecting you
Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks
(to others) Look around
If you find 'the child, yell
She's got blonde hair, that's all  know
Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself
Swann follows him
'  - ""  - Quaid looks into a large circular room where (three men and two women) still sit
One of the women is breast-feeding a baby
1ST Hey, Quaid
thought you said you weren't coming back
changed my mind
1ST Come and join us
She smiles a crazy smile
Reaches out for Quaid appears from around the back of her neck
Quaid recoils
And now we see that there are snakes everywhere
In the Cultists' clothes and hair
Even on the baby
Quaid turns away
And - shock
- there's a  on the door frame, winding around his hand
He strikes it to the ground, and drives his heel down on its head
- (angry) Don't do that
The Snake-Handler gets up
Quaid retreats from the door
Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above his head, dribbles its  onto his face
'    -   ""   - Jennifer enters a gloomy room
She goes to a mattress where a   lies with her bare back to us
Don't be afraid
The Blonde Girl, , turns over
She has a dirty cloth pressed to a wound between her breasts
It is not the Girl, of course
She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged
'm not
want to see
She pulls the cloth away
She has carved the cult  into her
The   lies beside her
Jennifer retreats to the door, and exits back out into -- '  -  - Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a
He is ashen with terror
Jennifer snatches the crucifix from his white-knuckled fingers
He's going to kill us all
Where did Swann go
Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room
'  -   '  - Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to his belt, to check the  tucked out of sight at his side
He turns the door handle
'  -  - Swann steps inside
Nix's chair has its back to him
The folds of Nix's robe are visible, however
Swann hears a muffled  from the far side of the room
On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth
Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible
As he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching
He reaches for his gun
The chair topples
The Baboon, half dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann
Swann  at it
The bullet blasts off half its head
'  -  - On Quaid, who draws his  as three  appear in the passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum
Stay the fuck away
(yells) Pimm
Get over here
'  -  - from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he struggles with the Girl's gag
He has laid his gun on the ground beside her
You're going to be okay
Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings round
Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque altarpiece
The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder
Terror crosses her face
Swann turns
knew you'd come
He reaches down to Swann
've got so much power to give you, Swann
All you have to do is
beg
Fuck you
You don't think 've got it to give
No
Suddenly
Nix swoops down on Swann
apparently defying gravity
You're wrong
He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back against the wall
could eat your fucking soul, Swann
'  -  - Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum
Butterfield steps from the shadows
His  flashes as it strikes Jennifer's hand
Fuck
She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand
'  -  - Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his fingers against Swann's temples
Working, working, like a psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient
You want to know what the world really looks like
Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold
And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt
Want to see flesh with a god's eyes
Swann  as Nix's mind-hold seizes him
'  -  - Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the Sanctum door
Jennifer is at Quaid's side
(
) Aah
Get away from the door
Butterfield shakes his head
Quaid
The bullet
strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head
He retreats, growling like a rabid animal
Quaid kicks the Sanctum door open, and enters
'  -  - Swann
(to Quaid) Here he is
Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his eyes blood-red
Take a look, Swann
These are your friends
On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and Jennifer
(
) What have you done to him

of Quaid and Jennifer
To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to be
Their humanity is
What's left is like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:

It's okay
Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his head violently

His face has an aura of pulsing light
Come here
Share the power

We don't see by whom
The trigger is pulled
The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest
, staring at Nix
'
of Nix, as the aura of light dies
Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses something else
out of Nix's features with waves of  emanating from the middle of its forehead
Swann covers his eyes
(raging, terrifying) Swann
Swann
Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly , and drops to his knees, clutching the
As he falls, he reveals the ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking
(a roar) Help me
Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind- control
Jesus- '  -    - Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists
1ST (with distressing confidence) You can't kill him
2ND He'll just rise up again
'  -  - On Nix, doing just that:  rising up
Right hand clamped to his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann
Help me
Quaid  at him again
Strikes his shoulder
And again
Strikes his leg
Nix collapses to the ground, Quickly
They have come prepared for this
Swann now takes from his jacket the three strange pieces of
There are in then all
(seeing) Swann
What are you doing
Binding you
He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's
It fits like an eyeless mask
Nix thrashes and
Swann lays his hands on the side of the mask, and    -- his touch makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching
runs from the screw-holes
Fuck you, Swann
Fuck you
Now the second piece, over his
Sw He's silenced
The piece screws itself into-his head, like the first
And now comes the third and final piece:  over the nose and into the ears
Again, it screws itself into place
Swann has done all he can
He retreats from Nix's body, as it continues to convulse
We go from face to ashen face, as each man and woman watches and waits
Why won't he die
And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes diminishes
Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies
(quietly) Is it finished
It's finished
'  -  - The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix had upon them has disappeared
Then they start to retreat, their confidence and courage gone
Pimm steps into the Sanctum
'  -  - The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's body
Swann has his arm around the Girl
Dead
Dead
What now
We bury him so deep no one will ever find him
: '
-   - The wind has died away
It's eerily calm
Butterfield dashes towards camera, then halts
, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp into the back of Murray Pimm's bus
Butterfield
He watches, with a feral look on his face
-  - The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking some fantastical metropolis
This, for all its smog and congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments
, the words:  "  -   " - The facade of this small  off Hollywood Boulevard needs a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but it has a certain charm
-  - large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby
At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands '
He is having difficulty getting the pretty but vacant  at the reception desk to comprehend his name
How'd you spell that again
'Amour
Harry 'Amour
'Amour
Right
Isn't that French for something
, approaching Harry from the front door
Mister 'Amour
(to Blonde) Yeah
It's French
For love, right
Mister 'Amour
(to Blonde) Right
(grinning) That's so cool
Mister 'Amour
Harry turns
He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t- shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses
He's handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile
Yeah
You haven't paid the cab
He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him
How much
Thirty-five bucks
Tell him he can keep them
The Bellboy looks puzzled
Just kidding
Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar bills
've got my life in there
'   - On the suit-case, which is now on the bed
Harry flings it open
Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and destruction
, as he heads into the bathroom
Turns on the shower
Starts to undress
- Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the sun
Squints
Puts on sunglasses
Hello,
Have a nice evening, Mr
'Amour
You bet
- Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a classy restaurant
It's
, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window
Tapert makes a joke (unheard)
The woman laughs
, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape recorder
Nine-eighteen p
m
Tapert's either got a great sense of humour or he's paying her to laugh
(looks at hamburger in disgust) Jesus
On Tapert, as he rises from the table
(into tape recorder) He's finished
Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street
Harry tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car
'  -  - Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it up and gets in
'  -  - (into tape) Nine twenty-six p
m
He's off again
He turns the key in the ignition
: '  -  - In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window
It reads:       - $15 , as he hurries across the street, and through the door beside the store window
the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far side of the street
Harry gets out of the car
Stares at the sign in the window, puzzled
Superstitious
He starts across the street
Suddenly: (
) Oh my God
Tapert emerges, his face white with terror
He stumbles to his car, and he's away
Harry freezes, caught between the need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity
He gives in to the latter, and steps inside
'  -  - An illuminated  points up the stairs
Harry ascends, past faded  of Caspar Quaid with famous faces
At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees
Harry halts, and takes out his
There's a strange   approaching from round the corner
Harry chances a look
There's a short length of passageway, leading to an open door
From the threshold a rolls towards Harry, -
This is the source of the rumbling
Harry stops the ball before it falls down the stairs
Dead silence
After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open door
He pushes it open
Inside, chaos
The fake antique is splintered, the   slashed
'  -   - There are two offices
In the front, a Waiting Room, into which Harry now steps
Beyond it, through a door that stands narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room
From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a
(
) Ahh
Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for his gun
Suddenly, a nightmarish  leaps from the shadows
His name is
He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth sharpened, eyes wild
Nix's  is tattooed on the middle of his forehead
He  the  from Harry's hand and goes for his throat
Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's and  it on Miller's skull
Miller reels back
Harry makes a dash for the door to the Fortune Telling Room
Fuckhead
'  - -  - mysterious, candle-lit space
In the middle of the room, a table
At it sits Quaid
thirteen years older
He has been tortured close to death
Several small  protrude from his chest and neck
His life is ebbing away
On the table in front of him, a fan of  , -
Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room
What the fuck
Harry picks up the
It's dead
Miller charges at the door
Shit
Harry  the door in Miller's face, and locks it
As he does so, the candles
Harry looks up looms from the darkness behind Quaid
He's in his late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight
His long hair is drawn back into a pony-tail
His mismatched eyes - one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield
His hands are , and he carries one last
(to Butterfield) Don't touch him
" Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek
Quaid sobs in pain
What are you going to do about it
Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the other side
His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock out
Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through
(to Harry) Ever watched a man die
If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping
And if you're very quick, you can catch it
Please
Butterfield
wasn't there
Ask Pimm
Pimm's dead
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared
They knew the Puritan was coming home
As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to   against it from the other side
It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room
He looks around for some means of defense
There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the table
Behind it a
So do you
You've seen the future
Haven't you
Yes
And are you afraid
Yes
Suddenly, Harry steps aside
The door's flung open
Miller in
Harry catches hold of his arm, and  him against the drape
The window ; the drape comes down around Miller
Amber  floods in
Butterfield is momentarily distracted
Harry  the scalpel from his hands
Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes
Harry lands a solid  to the man's belly
Miller is  back against the cracked window, which

Harry goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the stairs
You need an ambulance
(in pain) Too late
Why are you here
Did you cone
up here for a reading
Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand
Quaid stares at Harry's
Fascinated, he momentarily forgets his pain
He traces the lines with bloody fingers
(quietly) My God
What
You've taken some strange journeys in your life
Yeah
You could say that
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over
And it's drawn to you
(looks at Harry) You don't like that
Not much
You can't change it
You have to walk
(coughs) walk the line between Heaven and Hell
It's your destiny
Accept it
Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip
Quaid winces in pain
Hold on
'm not afraid to die
There's something terrible
coming home
The Puritan
Yes
Who is he
Quaid shudders, and dies
(softly; sadly) Shit
He looks away, down at the
All have been turned over but
He turns it
The card is the Ten of Swords which pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by all ten swords
An image of death and desolation
'  -    - The flashing  of two patrol cars illuminate the scene
, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry
He's midway through taking Harry's statement
There are already two examining the drapes
We can't yet see the body
(to Harry) What were you doing up there
'm a private detective
was hired to follow somebody for a few days
guy called Tapert
Insurance fraud
(writing) Tapert
So, now 've got Tapert, Butterfield
Tapert's got nothing to do with this
He came here to get his palm read
What makes you so sure
(shrugs) got a file on him two inches thick
He's a petty fraudster
This is something else
Ever heard of someone called the Puritan
New one on me
(to Officer) Okay
Let's see him
#l shakes his head, and opens up the drape
Broken drops from the folds, but that's all
Miller has gone
Where the fuck is he
He got up and walked
(looking up at window) After that fall
He must have broken half his bones
, as he stares down at the drape
don't think he'd have given a shit
: '  - The rooms are spartan
Nothing on the walls
Nothing on the floors
Very little furniture
Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his long hair
There is something feminine about him now:  his voice a whisper, his stare distracted
If we didn't guess it already, we're in the presence of a madman
Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of out of his torso
It hurts, but he's enjoying himself
'Amour
'Amour
Why do  know that name
know him
saw him
He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass, sighing with pleasure
saw him on
Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life
He's a priest
No
He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit
(a beat
smirk) Like you
long beat of silence
Butterfield combs
Miller digs for glass
don't want him getting in the way
He won't
Another silence

What do you mean, "all of us

've signed on for them all in my time
Hindu
Catholic
You can't have too many saviours
Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann
She wears a wide-brimmed hat
Who is she
Swann's wife
: sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book
He glances up
Harry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in conversation
want you to help me help my husband
know he's in some kind of trouble
And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered
Did your husband know Quaid
Yes
They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards
You don't
think we make our own futures
Harry makes an approving
What's the connection
(covering now, but well) don't exactly know
Philip doesn't like to talk about the past
Why not
Dorothea stops talking
Takes off her sunglasses
Her gaze is troubled, but direct
There is an attraction between the two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue
He's a secretive man
And you don't ask questions
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do
Does that mean
We haven't slept in the same bed for years
But obviously you still care what happens to him
We wouldn't be having this conversation if  didn't
Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive
Harry, frowns
You don't believe me
He's an illusionist
It's not exactly brain surgery
Dorothea stares at him
Sorry
You asked
No
You're right
He could have been something more
Maybe a lot more
But people get lost
Even good people
Too much fame
Too much money, Where do  sign
Dorothea  lightly
Will you take the job, Mr
'Amour
Harry
Harry
'm no bodyguard
That's not what 'm asking for want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards
And stop it from happening
When do you want me to start
Come to the show with me
Tonight want you to see him with an audience
They love him
Do you
The question catches Dorothea off guard
didn't marry him for love, Mr
'Amour
Tonight
Sure
Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away
Harry watches her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her departing figure
: '   - Harry's talking on the phone while he dresses for the theatre
You're not listening to me, Loomis
: '  -   - , a slob of a man, is in his office, eating pizza
The case is closed
Harry
Tapert's given us a full confession
Get your ass back to Mew York
No
'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry
What's going on
got to go
'm late
Call me tomorrow
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis
Yeah
But not as cheap
Call me
couple of weeks
One question
What
Who is she
Harry can't help but smile to himself
thought so
'Night, Harry
Click
Harry puts down the phone
Glances at himself in the mirror
Raises a rueful eyebrow
: - from a looming  of Swann, perched above the theatre marquee
rake the skies
The sidewalk below is jammed with  , - and This is a flashy, prestigious event are disgorging scantily- dressed  and smiling ; a   is interviewing audience members as they file in
The atmosphere is noisy and excited
Amid the throng, Harry
He makes his way inside
-  - The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a conventional stage show
Security people with walkie- talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely controlled hysteria
Harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage
star-lit covers it
Six rows from the stage is Dorothea, already in her seat
She smiles lavishly, happy to see him
'm glad you could make it
Harry takes a seat beside her
Hey, this is a big deal for me
You know what seats like this cost in New York
-  - Center-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for the opening of the show
buzz around him like flies
Valentin
Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the  that is waiting there
(irritated) Valentin
'm here
The guy with Dorothea
Is that who think it is
Valentin nods
, his expression unreadable
He's young
strikes up
dramatic, Wagnerian chord
Valentin hurries away
Swann's expression becomes very focused
1ST (to Swann) Ready
Ready
Swann rises up into the flies
1ST How the fuck does he do that
2ND It's wires, man
1ST never seen no wires
2ND (sarcastic) So what is it
Magic
-    - The  are
Harry glances across at Dorothea, whose gaze is intent
The  go
The  , and the  fly apart
spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to blast our senses
Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride into mystery
(
) Ladies and gentlemen
You are standing on the threshold of a miracle
vortex of  and  swirls in the middle of the stage
The vortex  -- And suddenly Swann   out of the flies, as the floor of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor toothed  emerges in a cloud of
Swann raises his hands above his head and a miraculously appears in his grasp
He descends on the dragon
It's a classic image:  St
Michael smiting the Devil
Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon
The theatre  at its dying
Then the head cracks open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily dressed , male and female
Swann throws down the spear, and where it strikes the stage his  appears
of  from the audience
Swann's plain white tunic falls away from him as he descends
By the time his feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot
The  licks his hand in welcome
The  comes to a crescendo
The  freeze in their erotic dance
In the sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper
My friends
come with me
into the Great Beyond
barrage of  and  erupt
The   wildly
and Dorothea
He's good
You haven't seen anything yet
-  - The doors  as a gust of  blows through them
Butterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted of  and
Then he offers his ticket to the - and steps inside
-    - new musical motif hangs in the air:   announcing danger
The  watches intently, nervously
and
(a whisper) This is the new illusion
, Swann is bound to a spinning , while the , dressed like Boschian , cavort around him, somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow
It's a scene from Daniels Inferno
Above him
a dozen glittering  - six feet long - are descending
He struggles to free himself
The  gets more exciting as the wheel spins faster and faster
Suddenly, a sword
It falls between Swann's outstretched legs, skewering the wheel
Then , close to his head
He's tense
Excited
Swann is free   He throws off the last shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the wheel
There's a theatrical  of white-hot
The wheel slows
He starts to step off it, as another of the the swords
The
Swann smiles, and
As he , the sword runs through the middle of his back, carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning him there
Some of the  continue to cavort
Some stop
More  from the audience
, having a -- :  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card
The scene on the stage is that image coming to life
There's something wrong
Swann, as a second sword , skewering his thigh, and a third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth, until   have entered his body
, not certain whether this is a trick or not
The  has stopped
In the silence, somebody nervously
couple of  break into , but it dies away in a matter of moments
No
, Swann raises his head and looks out at his wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death
He reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead
There are  now from the audience
Murmurs of disgust; sobs of horror
1ST What happened
2ND It's a trick
3RD Somebody help him
The curtains start to close
Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes
(to Harry) 've got to get to him
The  is rising now, as the horror of what they've seen sinks in
There is panic
few people have fainted
One or two are even praying
Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea against the flood of the exiting crowd
Out of the way
Out of the way
He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so she can duck beneath it
-  - Chaos
running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing watching
Valentin is already at the body, with the at his side
(to Stage Manager) Get then out of here, for God's sake -- You heard him
It's not a fucking show
He starts to physically push the crowd back
Harry grabs his arm
Who are you
Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the out of Dorothea's way
She goes to Swann's body, which has been removed from the wheel
-  - The audience is clearing now
But Butterfield is coming towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face
Is he enraged
Or puzzled
Or both
Psst
Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage
Butterfield enters
-  - Dorothea kneels at Swann's side
few yards from her, Harry examines the mechanism of the wheel
(softly) Swann
appears
'm a doctor
Let me through
The Doctor checks Swann's body
(to Dorothea) 'm sorry
Harry has discovered a  snaking down beside the device
He's suspicious
He slips round to the back of the mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the cable as he goes
-   - It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the  that are used in the show, including the  we saw at the beginning
From above we hear  and , muted and echoing
The cable ends in bare wires
Whatever was here has been taken
, behind Harry
He swings round
Sees a shadowy ducking away
Hey
He gives chase
Loses the man in the shadows
Stops and listens for movement
Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of wood and smashes it into Harry's face
Harry reels back
Falls to his knees,  running from his nose
Miller pulls Harry's  out of his jacket
Got you, fucker
Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed
And now, out of the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield
Who did this, 'Amour
Who killed Swann
Harry is barely holding on to consciousness
You did
(a beat) Didn't you
Why would  do that
Beats me
Butterfield is a foot from Harry now
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you
Deep shit
Butterfield hits him
Who did this
told you -- Butterfield hits him again
Who did this
(raises his hand) All right
It was
Butterfield comes a little closer
(feigning a near collapse) it was
Butterfield leans in
And Harry grabs him by the balls -- literally -- rising as he does so
Aah
Harry  Butterfield aside
Butterfield hits the ground in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun
He  once, missing Harry by inches
Harry catches hold of a  underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who backwards into the mouth of the dragon
The again, the bullet   the dragon's Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the dragon's steel teeth
He has Harry in his sights
-- something
He looks up
The dragon's jaw is closing,
He starts to scramble to his feet
Too late
The teeth   on his body
Sudden death
Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the shadows
Then he's gone
Harry looks down at Miller's , which is pooling around his feet
Deep shit
- '  - Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised
Eddison has just finished taking his statement
And this Butterfield guy-- --vanished
(frustrated sigh) Another fucking magician
Jesus
Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea being taken into another office
Are you finished with me
For now
Are you planning to go back to New York
(watching Dorothea) No
Not yet
-   - Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall
Harry enters
Are they treating you okay
(nods) heard what happened
It looks like somebody murdered him
'm sorry  got into this too late
But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look
don't know where you'd start
Well
how about some of the other illusionists
They won't tell you anything
can be very persuasive
(a beat) Yes
think you probably can
(another beat) We'd need to talk about your fee
Forget the fee
If  find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money
If  don't
(he shrugs) my gamble
Either way get to spend some time
here
The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean
, it means near -Dorothea
And by the tiny smile on her face, it's also plain she knows it
: -
- Noon
Bright sun
Busy street
Harry, now wearing a bandage on his cut face, enters
- wonderland for illusionists
Books, props, masks, tricks, etc
Two or three  browse
Harry glances at them all, then targets a  in late middle age, who is browsing through books, one-handed
His other hand constantly manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen ways
He doesn't even look at his hand
His name is Harry stands beside him
Scans the shelf
Where'd you learn that
What
(points) That
At birth
don't know you -- Harry 'Amour
know all the kids coming up
Got to stay ahead of the game
But don't know you
'm in from New York
came to see Swann
What a tragedy
It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business
Was he taking a lot of risks
You don't know the half of it
'm Walter Wilder, by the way
Not the Walter Wilder
Walter beams
The one and only
He hands Harry a card
Want to try
Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the rest of this conversation
You know Vinovich
(not a clue) Sure
Vivovich
He knew Swann way back
He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit
'd love to
you know
hang with some of you guys
People are pretty cagey
Who do you know
For what
For an introduction
Well
nobody
Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude
(magnanimously) You do now
- The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm
Harry and Walter wander towards the front door
Harry is knotting a newly-bought tie
only wear ties for funerals
You don't get in without one
It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists
Except most of us aren't gentlemen
-  - The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with illusionists' posters
Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms where illusionists are performing close-up magic for audiences of well-heeled patrons
Walter nods and waves to half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the stairs and towards the bar
Are they all in the business
It's not a business
Harry
It's a vocation
Wilder points to a locked door
That's what they call the Repository
Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room
Have you been in
No
There's only three keys
Vinovich has got one, of course
(beat) He's a little crazy, by the way
And he's a mean drunk
Otherwise, he's a real charmer
-  - Later
drunken  is holding court
He's in his 40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and fake) middle-European accent
At the table - besides Harry and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend ; an Asian-American illusionist called  ; and two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown, overdressed female illusionist -   - and a thin, waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the
In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group
It's more than entertainment
We're opening people's heads up
Putting miracles back into their boring little lives
But they're fake miracles
Houdini believed he had spirit guides
You believe that
think we walk a narrow path, between
between
Heaven and Hell
Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether he's being sarcastic or not
Trickery and divinity
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real
No
'm saying they were always fake
The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists
So could you walk on water
(deadly serious) could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation
What about Swann's miracles
The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies
Furtive glances are exchanged around the table
Only Billy Who makes a tiny smile
They weren't worth a damn
(goading) heard he was the best
If he was so good why's he so dead
Vinovich begins to look suspicious
You tell me
No
thought you'd maybe have a theory
Oh, 've got plenty
'd like to hear them
Vinovich rises
'm not saying another word
(to Wilder) You damn fool
He's a journalist
Just tell me about Swann
Or are you too scared
He was a freak
Everything he did was tainted
Harry rises
Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated
With what
Evil
He was evil
(to Laura) Come on
She rises
(to the rest) Say nothing to this man if you wish to keep my company
He stalks away
Harry calls after him, across a now- silenced bar
Great accent, by the way
Is it Brooklyn
(pure Brooklyn) Fuck you
-   - Harry heads to the car
(
) Harry
Harry turns
Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see that he's not being watched
gotta be careful
If Vinovich sees me talking to you
He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole
They go together
(lowered voice) 've heard a name
Someone they talk about in whispers
Who
Nix
Nix
Like in nothing
Nobody
Nix
Who is he
think maybe he taught Swann
(hands Harry a card) This is me
See ya around
Billy hurries away
: '   - Harry lies on his bed, dozing
The    on him
(
) want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards
Harry frowns in his semi-doze
: - ' Ever watched a man die
The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid
Please
wasn't there
Ask Pimm
Pimm's dead
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared
: '   - Harry is still asleep
: - ' 'm not afraid to die
There's something terrible
coming home
long silence
, a telephone
: '   - sits up, shocked awake
Shit
He picks up the receiver
This is 'Amour
: '  - '  - She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing else, drinking a , talking on the phone
The primary source of illumination is the massive
set in the wall opposite the bed
Harry
know it's late
There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange
Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms
Each aroused by the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and touch them
That's okay
As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed
How did it go today
went up to the Magic Castle
You were right
He didn't have a lot of fans up there
: '  -  - Valentin, on the kitchen , is listening in
(
) They were jealous of him
(
) Why
Because he had you
: :  -  - He
didn't have me
told you- You didn't marry him for love
' She's a little uncomfortable now
So why did you marry him
That's my business
Harry
Just curious
(a beat) Back to business
Ever heard of a man called Nix
(silence) Dorothea
Yes
'm here
And no
don't know the name
What about Jennifer Desiderio
It doesn't ring a bell
have to go
Okay
'll keep digging
(uneasy) Yes
You do that
She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch
She's shaking
She gets up
Paces the room
Then she picks up the phone again
'   - On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by Harry's doodles
The phone
:  The room is empty
/
'  -  - The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now
Harry heads up the stairs, past the , to the door of Quaid's Waiting Room
It has been locked and taped by the police
Harry has come prepared
He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the locks
'  - /   - Harry enters,  on
He crosses the Waiting Room and enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died
On the -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's , Miller's , and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the blood-spattered table: (
) If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping
Harry is spooked
He starts to search the room, opening cabinets and drawers
Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac are stashed everywhere
Boxes of crystals, religious statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc
He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged in a niche at the base of the drawer
He pulls the drawer out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it
Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart
It has a false bottom
(smiles) Yes
In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book
He flicks to "
" (') Desiderio
There it is
Jennifer Desiderio, and an address
He pockets the book
Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing -- -- Valentin
(') What the fuck are you doing here
Looking for you
tried the hotel
Why'd you come here
You're a detective, with no clues
Where else are you going to look
'm going to keep this brief
(he takes out an envelope) Here's thirty thousand dollars
What for
ticket home, You didn't hire me
She did
If she wants me off the job, want to hear it from her
She doesn't want to see you
She's had enough pain
Enough churning over the past
She wants it all left alone
Left alone
Somebody's been murdered
Yes
It's regrettable Fuck regrettable
want to know why
What for
You need to stay busy
(a confession) like to know why things happen
Why people die
(shakes his head) Give it up, 'Amour
Go home
No
Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin
Don't try and see her, 'Amour
Just leave her alone
Let her heal
He glances back at Valentin
Lock up, will you
: ' ,  - , in Harry's hands
Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a building, the sign on which reads, "St
Luke's Sanitorium"
'  - The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings
Nothing disturbing
Harry is talking to
- black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor
Mister Quaid
Right
And he's dead, isn't he saw it on the news
Jennifer doesn't know
And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told
won't say anything
'  -    - Toffler excorts Harry through -the place
There are distressing scenes on every side
Nothing melodramatic no screaming, no fits
Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair
Blank, empty  in blank, empty rooms
Jennifer's been with us four years
She was coming on nicely
But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever
What's her problem
She has no real grip on reality
(a joke) Does anybody
(deadly serious) Oh yes
We have to agree what's real and what's not
That's what holds us together
And what does Jennifer think's real
They've come to french windows, which are wide open
Sitting outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us
(quietly) Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming for her
(louder) Jennifer
Jennifer turns
She looks terrible
'  -  -   - Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance
Throughout the scene we  the  of earth being dug, which steadily gets louder as they walk
Have we met before
No
Only  forget
They give me pills, you know, to keep me
even
and
forget things, Well, you didn't forget me
just came because  wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield
Maybe
don't
What about Philip Swann
knew Swann
(sudden vehemence) He's a fucking liar
saunters past, carrying pipes
Why's that
He said he knew how to protect us
But he didn't know anything
He made us think it was over and done with
What is
(tears nearing) don't want to think about it
If think about it he'll hear me
He'll find me
Swann
Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole, laying pipes
The  doesn't focus on this action, but we're aware of it
told you
don't -- She stops
Looks ahead of her
Her face is suddenly ashen and clammy
Harry follows her gaze to: The hole
Somebody is in it, digging
Earth emerges in shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole
(') (screaming) God no
Oh God no
She backs away from the hole
The Nurse grabs hold of her
Calm down
She delivers the Nurse a backhand
The Nurse is flung back
He's not going to get me
She races down towards the street
Harry goes after her
(') He's not
He's not
Who's not
He catches up with her
Nix
Nix
Is he the Puritan
Yes
Yes
And he's dead
No
He's coming back
He's digging his way out
The Nurse appears behind Harry
'll take care of her now
Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip
Let go of her, Mr
'Amour
The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away instantly, racing towards the street
Jennifer
She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the top
There's a  of brakes, then the smashing of metalwork and glass
Harry gets to the wall before the Nurse
Hoists himself up onto it
Looks down
' Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the wheels of a car
The  is out, and yelling incoherently
Jesus
He slips back down the wall, and leans against it
He looks towards the hole
The Workman has stopped digging
His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from a grave
Harry closes his eyes
(very quietly) Jesus
- The sun is setting, the city giving way to night
'   - Harry's on the phone
want to speak to Dorothea
(
) 'm afraid she's not in
When will she be in
'  -  - Valentin on the phone in the study
Who is it
Valentin puts the phone down
Crank call
'll get the number changed
No word from 'Amour
Valentin shakes his head
It's better he's gone
He would have done more harm than good
Harm to whom
Me
don't think, so
Try him again at the hotel
left three messages already
Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion
She turns and leaves the room
'   - ' , in Harry's hand
(on phone) Billy
It's Harry
Suppose wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle
: -   - :
' ,
You've done this before
've had my moments
-    - Harry's manipulating the lock
'm sure they'll have this place rigged
How
It'll be something hokey
The door opens
Houdini'd been proud of you
-  - Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and posters in every direction
(impressed) Whoa
On the wall, plaster -
In glass cases, the tools of the great magicians:  , , , , even an Billy is in awe
He wanders around wide-eyed while Harry scans the shelves
The dialogue runs as they investigate
hear Mrs
Swann's quite a babe
You heard right
You ever been married
Yeah
She was killed in a car crash
Her lawyer was driving
She was filing for divorce
Why
My life was too weird for her
(grinning) love weird
Harry has seen a small  carved onto one of the shelves
Billy
This was on Miller's forehead
Any idea what it is
Nope
Harry presses it
The entire bookcase opens up,
What did  tell you
So fucking hokey
Inside, there is a small shelf
On it,  and
What have we got here
Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess
And -- two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm
Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from skewering Billy's flesh and bone
He keeps them open, his sinews straining
Grab the files
Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files
As he steps out of range
Harry lets go and the gates close with a Jesus
He slams the files down
He's trembling
could have lost my fucking hands
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle
(he studies the files) Which was presumably the idea
(a beat) These are about Nix
Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy
You go through these
Go on
Reluctantly, Billy does so
Harry picks up a faded of the doorway to Nix's  (with the sigil painted on it) and  the child standing in the sun
There are other  standing around
And in the -- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for that) - is
Wait a minute
He stares at the boy's face
The eyes are clearly different colours
That's Butterfield
(points to nan in) doorway) And who's that
, staring at the ambiguous presence
of the shadowy figure
At a guess
The Puritan
Nix
Billy picks up an , water-stained and dirty
It shows a horror we recognize:  a man's  pressed into the of another man's
Take a look at this
(looking at it) Nix specialty
Billy is getting subtly spooked now
He puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series
We glimpse them as he does so
In one, a  regurgitates a serpentine form made of
In another, a  stares at his own  which is
There is no bone beneath
Only a form of solid blackness
In a third, we see a  with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating don't know any of these tricks
Harry studies the etchings
(a slow burn) Maybe they're not tricks
(mystified) mean, there's no instructions-- (realizes what Harry said) What do you mean, they're not tricks
What did Vinovich say
Something about walking a path between -- Trickery and divinity
Yeah, he says that all the time
That's because he knew
He'd seen these files and knew
Knew what
Out of the corner of his eye
Harry sees a motion between the book-stacks
Billy frowns
Harry puts his fingers to his lips
Gestures for Billy to take cover
Billy backs away
Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion
Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed
Harry takes out his gun
Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks
Harry goes after the apparition
The  is completely silent
Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy
It looks up, its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile
It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who backs away
Harry
Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the shelves
Where the fuck are you
Harry appears, and puts his gun to the ' head
Okay
Hold it right there
The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made of smoke
Harry waves his hands through it
It's completely ethereal
But it's still terrorizing Billy
(in mortal terror) Get it off me
Harry glances around
Sees a  flickering between some books
at it
The light goes out
The "Psycho" vanishes
Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground
Hokey enough for you
'm out of here, man
Are you coming
Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file
'm coming
Billy is already out of the room
For a moment
Harry pauses to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked gates
As he does so -- -- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the "Psycho" appears -- - at Harry's shoulder
Ah, shaddup
He  at the projector a second time
On the   -- : - Billy and Harry are parting
Thanks, Billy
Hey, anytime
(a beat) Actually, no
This was enough
They shake, and part
'  -   - Harry waits on the doorstep
Valentin opens the door
(quietly) can't let you in
(stepping in) Yeah,  know
You want more money, is that it
Harry pushes him aside
'  -  - Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors
Dorothea
He sees candle-light through a partially open door
Starts towards it
Leave her alone -- Shut up
He pushes open the door
'  -   - The room is a museum of Swarm's career
Posters, and memorabilia everywhere
And in the middle of the room, Swann's sealed , surrounded by flowers and candles
Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed
This is the way he wanted it
no autopsy, no embalming
Nobody meddling with his body
Harry approaches, slowly
Flesh is a trap
That's what he used to say
Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free
(a beat) Why did you come back
didn't leave
was just digging around
Dorothea looks up at him
(uneasy) What did you find
Jennifer Desiderio, for one
(he watches her for a response) She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon
Dorothea can't disguise her distress
Oh Christ
(a beat) Why don't you tell me the truth
' - -- - Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the and the  from the repository on the table
Nix ran some kind of cult, right
Some kind of Charlie Manson deal
It was more than that,  think
He was the real thing, right
Swann said he could do stuff, yes
Stuff
He could get into people's heads
Make them see things
Terrible things
And he could levitate
Juggle fire
He taught all this to Swann
Some or it
'  -    - Valentin is listening at the door
' - -- - So Swann was performing magic
not illusions
(Dorothea nods) And what
You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions
told you -- Too much fame
Yeah,  guess that'd turn anybody's head
Including yours
No
You said you weren't with him for love
wasn't
What then
was grateful to him
owed him my life
And he loved me
He couldn't always show it, but he felt it
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he
Dorothea is pouring herself another drink
The glass slips from her hand
It
Harry goes to help her
They stoop together, very close
The sexual attraction is almost palpable
Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass
Shit
They are very close to each other
(reassuring) It's okay
No it isn't
You can't help me
(tenderly) 'm here, aren't
He kisses her
She kisses him back, hard
Nothing's going to happen to you
(seductive) Nothing
(smiles) Nothing you don't want
They kiss again, passionately
'  -  - Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross the darkened lobby and head upstairs
Then Valentin crosses to the phone and dials
'  - '  - room of illusions
Walls lined with mirrors, and warm, flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor
It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling
/
'  -  - Valentin opens the front door
There's a wind blowing
The palms churn against the night sky
Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies of Harry and Dorothea
'  - '  - Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor
(whispers) was so afraid
Don't be
Nix can't hurt you now
Are you sure
'm sure
(kisses her) He's dead
know
'm the one who shot him
He's startled, to say the least
was twelve
Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him
(realizing) And they all came
Yes
Quaid and Jennifer-- And Pimm and Swann
Only Nix was ready for them
There's a  downstairs
(nervous) What was that
It's okay
Harry slips out of bed
'  -  -  - Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which is all he wears)
He has his gun
Valentin
Dorothea appears behind him
Harry
Wait
Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now
Across the hall, in a passageway, an eerie
We can make out no detail of clothing or face
What the hell-
Suddenly, the shadowy  comes at Harry
of bursts against Harry's face
As it breaks against his skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's skull
(in pain) Aah
Harry  at the figure
The shadows fold up around the Stranger like an origami puzzle
He's gone
It's him
It's Nix
Harry goes out into the passageway
Valentin
Get some lights on
As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white erupts behind Harry
He swings round to see the Stranger "unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and physiology to do so
The  is at his feet, like a serpent writhing on the ground
It comes at Harry
Harry  at it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's leg
He retreats, the  racing after him
He makes for a door, and flings it open
He's in -- '  -   - The  follows him across the ground and  his hand
Harry drops the
Looks up to see the Stranger in the doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on
But then, he hesitates
Harry glances round, and sees that the Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at the
Somebody you know
Dorothea appears behind the Stranger
Sees Harry, burned and sweating, cornered against the casket
Oh my God
The Stranger looks round
Harry snatches up the , supporting his burned hand with -his good hand
Levels the gun at the Stranger
The  raises its head, like a cobra
Which goes first
My face or your heart
The Stranger draws a deep breath
The Fire-Serpent withers and dies
Who in God's name are you
She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone into darkness
The  blows through the house, masking his exit
Are you all right
Find Valentin
Find him
Get him in here
Dorothea disappears
Harry takes one of the candle-holders and jams it under the casket lid
Wood splinters
He starts to force off the lid
Valentin and Dorothea enter
What are you doing
This is sacrilege
He starts towards Harry
Dorothea goes after him and catches hold of his arm
Her expression is a mingling of fascination and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and pulls
Inside, Swann's corpse
Are you satisfied now
No
Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger into the corpse's mouth
Harry
It's all right
It's not hurting
He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw
It cracks -- -- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex
plaster doesn't bleed
He tosses the jaw to Valentin
(to Dorothea) It looks like you're not a widow after all
'  -  - Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea binds Harry's hand
You rigged the illusion to fail, right
Yes
You paid off the doctor
You set up the fake body
Yes
Yes
And then
because  was getting too close to something -- (at Dorothea) --or someone, you called Swann tried to pay you off
Was that Swann's idea
No
It was mine
didn't want any more bloodshed
That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter
He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe Nix's resurrection is plausible
want to see Swann face to face
Why don't you leave this alone
Let everybody think it's over
What about me
Nix was never interested in you
It was always Swann

(to Dorothea) Maybe Valentin's right
We should let it alone

) He went to all that trouble to be dead
Maybe we should let him stay that way
The  carries over into - from a high angle on a , surrounded by The graveside service has just ended, and the Mourners are beginning to disperse
Dorothea is there amongst them, of course
So are several faces we recognize: Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his Dancers, his Technicians
There are also several members of the , and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom, to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists
Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden) from the doorway of a mausoleum
His eyes are on Dorothea as she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of condolesence
- The standee of Swann is being demolished by two
They are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces
-  - The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium in darkness
Swann's equipment - including the partially dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage
Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann "died
"  He stares down at the  on the stage

We don't see who

Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit
Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums

On Harry, as he gets into his

Looks up
Who's there
He reaches into his jacket to draw a
There's a
He swings round
Too late
Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat
He kicks Valentin to the ground

On Valentin, staring up in terror
Valentin's
- of Butterfield, upside down, above him, the scalpel glittering
To be able to heal with one little cut
On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek, just beneath his eye
No
Let's say those eyes of yours were giving you trouble
Please
could scoop them out
Don't
So tell me where Nix is buried
don't know
Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin
, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by Butterfield's body
Wait
On Valentin again
There is a small cut beneath his eye, but that's all
'll tell you
You'll do more
than that

Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with barbed wire
He peers through the bars
Harry's
of the  from the funeral disappearing into the building
He glances back towards the street
We get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat
Harry slides out of sight
Waits until the Stranger has gone inside
Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed wire
--  - It's been a hospital
Now the echoing corridors and wards are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering
Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies
Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of the Stranger
He enters a shadowy room
Birds fly  into his face
As he retreats, another , a little distance from him
in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into -  -   - Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded equipment
Eerie
Disturbing
Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room
knew you wouldn't be able tn stay away
Silence
Harry notices the beard and glasses on the operating table
You had to see who wept for you the most
Silence
lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive
(
) They'll never find out
Harry looks up
Svanrt is hovering in the air above him
The veins in his temples bulge and throb
This trick requires a lot of concentration
Look, Ma, no wires
You shouldn't have followed me, 'Amour
How the fuck do you do that
Now 'm going to have to kill you
don't think so
You need me alive
Why
So you can fuck my wife
Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun
Be careful
Funerals make me trigger-happy
Swann stops, inches from the ground
You know, it's such a fucking waste
You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick
Illusionists get
Las Vegas contracts, 'Amour
Magicians get burned
Or murdered, like Nix
He deserved it
Maybe he doesn't see it that way
Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now
That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it
did it for Dorothea
Oh yeah
Now that 'm dead, the spotlight's off her
Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth
Now they're face to face
Eye to eye
Swann, for all his posturing, is afraid
So Nix won't come looking for her
It's me betrayed him
And she shot him    think that'd piss me off if  were Nix
(despairing) don't know what else to do
Help me
On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear
Listen
If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god
And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are
And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history

Harry's car pulls into the lot
Swann gets out, his disguise back on
Heads into the store
Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him
- Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap brandy
Is this the best brandy you've got
If that's what's on the shelves
Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air
Can you change a thousand for me
(amazed) You're shittin' me
Can we go

Oh Jeez

Who's there
Silence
Then, Valentin speaks behind her
She jumps

Jesus
Valentin
What did you do to your face
(
) It was me
She turns
He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back against the wail
Guess who we're going to see
'  - Harry drives
Swann takes a throatful of brandy
Then he stares at Harry
You think 'm an asshole
Didn't know you read minds
(a warning) can do a lot of shit, 'Amour
But you know that
(an apology) So  like playing games with people
Gives them something to wonder about
Is that all
distract them from their banality for a few minutes
It's like a public service
It doesn't mean much in the end
They're all going to die
And you're not
Silence for a moment
Oh,  was going to discover the secret of the universe
That's why liked Nix
He promised me all these explanations
And he didn't have them
He had something
He showed me how to bend the rules
little levitation
few fireworks
Is that all
No
(a beat) At the end
when we had him cornered, he got into my head
He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone
Jelly
Shit
And you believed him
saw it with my own fucking eyes
See, that's his best trick
No illusions
Just the truth
(he looks at Harry) Are you ready for that
Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann
Hey
Harry drinks
Thought not

'  -  - Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom
Dorothea
Now he's on the landing
Swann's below
She's not here
Harry spots Valentin's  on the carpet
Did she know where Nix was buried
No
Who else did
Did Valentin
Yes
Jesus
- Butterfield's  crosses the desert, under a sky full of stars
'  - Valentin drives
Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back
Dorothea is handcuffed
He has a bag open at his feet
One by one he takes out a series of extraordinary instruments
Dorothea looks on, confounded
Like the look of these
made them myself, to set him free
Why did you wait so long
didn't have the skill to resurrect him
had to teach myself
And that took time
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years
If he was just a man like me, then no
But he's not
What is he
Maybe he'll show you
, terror in her eyes
'  - Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house
Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp
There is a low, ominous  floating from the house
It has no words, but it is steadily  in intensity
We  towards the front door
'  -  -   - Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room
Inside,   kneel in a circle
They are all , and throwing it into the  that blazes in the centre of the circle
They hack indiscriminately, with ,  and , their eyes wild

He will come

The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness, illuminating the dig
Valentin is in the grave, digging
Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole, watching the work
Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him
Anything

) Not yet
Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close

this is the place Swann told me about

Five more minutes
Hear me
And you'd better not -- behind him
Butterfield wheels round
On the ground beside the open car door, the instruments
What the fuck are you playing at
He goes to pick them up
Dorothea steps from behind the door, with the sharpest in her hand
She slashes at him
Opens a  across his arm
Aah
He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her hand, and slamming her against the car
He hits her
Once
Twice
Then -- (
) Butterfield
Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin
(blinded) In the corner
The beam goes to the corner of the grave
mummified  is sticking out of one of the walls
(to Valentin) Keep away from it
Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand
The  is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath
He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers
Closer
Closer
He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the mask rolls into view
Oh Christ
Oh Christ
(reverentially) It's him
it's him
On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair
: '  - The car is static; the engine still running
They got here before us
Looks that way
'  - Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave
' Harry reaches the grave's-edge
It's totally dark
He peers in
On his heel, as the ground  beneath his weight
Harry slides into the grave
Shit
He's in darkness now
He gets to his feet, and starts to try and scramble out
Swann
Swann
Silence
Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder
Harry swings round
It's Valentin
He has been badly cut up
'Amour -- Shit
Help me
He collapses into Harry's arms
Swann
'  - Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not to help
(
) Swann
He decides
Gets out
'  - Swann goes to the graveside, terrified
Give me a hand
got Valentin
Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and lay him in the blaze of the headlamps
He's got Dorothea
And Nix
Him too
We've got to get you to a hospital
Don't bother
Shut up
We've lost enough lives already
'm sorry, 'Amour
What about
Looks like you're going
to lose
one more
Valentin dies
(despairing) no
He's better off this way
(furious) Nobody's better off this wav
You don't get it, do you
We're shit
'Amour
He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body
It rolls back into Nix's grave
That's where we're all going
In my time, and nobody else's

The doors
The retreat
The grave is left to
'  - The house is silent now
'  -  - We  through the house
The , all Seventeen of them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum
Butterfield emerges
He is wearing now
Do you wish him to be amongst us
Yes
Will you come to him on your knees
Yes
Be ready
Now we see that the Cultists have  in their hands
With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they  the bottles to the ground at their bare feet
Then they pick up , and  them, littering the ground with razor sharp pieces of
Butterfield, smiling
He steps back into the Sanctum
'  -  - ,   of the room, as Butterfield approaches the of Nix
It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of
Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs
Beside its head, Butterfield's  are laid out
Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part  screwed into Nix's face
He works with surgical precision
Listen
You've got everything you want
You don't need me
piece of the mask comes away from the cheek
subtle plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely
We   to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude
No, but he will
After what you did to him
He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth
He'll want vengeance
Simple that
'  -  - The bottle-breaking has ceased
The Cultists stand, breathless with anticipation
'  -  - On Nix's emaciated mouth
The lips
On Dorothea
The  moves around her
And Nix
On Butterfield,  in his eyes
Oh my Lord
He's coming home
'  -  - The whisper runs through the congregation: He's coming home
he/s coming home
'  -  - Dorothea, eyes wide
Christ in Heaven
Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils
His withered flesh starts to ; his veins start to Butterfield is watching the process in amazement
Nix's move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is still screwed over his eyes
He's with us
'  -  - He's with us
He's with us
'  -  - Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea gets to her feet and creeps away to the door
Very quiet Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes coiled around his face and fingers
Oh God
Butterfield looks up
Hold her
On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face
It comes away with a moist,
At last, we see his eyes
'
The candle-lights blaze,  his sensitive eyes
(fury to agony) Aaarrrgh
He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over all the lights but two
Then he strikes Butterfield to the ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking him unconscious
It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal display of instant physical superiority
Throughout, he literally  in rage
'  -  - The Cultists  in sympathy, letting out years of repressed frustration
Many of them are dancing on the shards of glass now, crazed
: '  - Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house
He is getting out
Swann stays put
The  of  is carried towards them on the wind
(spooked) Jesus
what the hell's going on in there
At a guess
they just resurrected him
Fuck
Harry starts towards the house
After a beat, Swann gets out of the car and follows
'  - - - On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot
Butterfield is out for the count
On Nix, as he stops screaming
His face is grotesquely disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted
The  of the Cultists is dying away
Children
'  -  - The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction
Will you suffer to come unto me
One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees
We never see flesh pierced by broken glass
But we  , and see the agony on the Cultist's faces
They start to sob
Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow
've come back to share the wisdom of the grave
Will you hear it
Yes
yes
Follow me then
He steps out of the doorway
The Cultists let out sobs of adoration
Nix locks at Dorothea
Do  know you, child
He reaches for her
Pulls her close to his body
Dorothea keeps her self-possession; but only just
Oh yes
do, don't
No gun this time, child
(a beat) Where's Swann
don't know where he is
Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground
He'll come
We've got unfinished business, he and
Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the wounds he's receiving
The Cultists follow
'  -   - Nix strides into the middle of the room
(whispered to Dorothea) Something terrible's going to happen
But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer
The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands
(to Cultists) Are you ready for my wisdom
Tell us
tell us
'  -  - Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in
Swann follows
He is frozen by the memory of what happened here
, as the  fills with eerie  of that terrible event
Nix's
The -
The sound of the   into Nix's flesh
(in terrified awe) This is where we killed him
(looking at table) You didn't try hard enough
can't
can't go any further
Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked grip
He crosses to the door
Suddenly
Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and catches hold of Harry's leg
throwing him to the ground
He has one of the  in his hand
He  at Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs
'  -   - Here is my wisdom
He stamps on the ground
spread from his foot in all directions
, amazed by this manifestation of power
Show us
Puritan
Yes, show us
Show us
Show us
With a , a  four or five feet across opens up beneath Nix and Dorothea
Nix  over it
It's utterly dark; perhaps bottomless
Dorothea
'  - - - Hearing Dorothea's , Harry looks back towards the passageway
Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the ground and stabs at Harry a second time
But Swann catches hold of his arm
(to Harry) Whatever he's doing to her, stop him
And Harry's up and away -- '  -  - -- he dashes over the glass -- '  -   - On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him
He  as he floats over the chasm below then
(to unseen Cultists) You see,  escaped the grave
So have to give something to the grave in return
On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their eyes
in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in the library), and from it comes a
As Nix , the darkness  the  around the Cultists
At first they don't realize what's going on
They think this is some kind of bizarre blessing
Then the ground starts to  beneath them
What's happening
have to give something back
So 'm giving you
They're starting to  now as they sink into the ground
They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry for them
They are dragged down,  as they
(sobbing) Why
Why
You're not worthy
None of you
Only Swann was worthy
You just waited like lambs
Harry appears in the doorway
Nix, still swinging round, has his back to Harry
Well 'm not your shepherd
Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him
The ground is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up out of the dirt
The scene has a surreal beauty to it despite its horror
locked in the solid ground
the same
Harry starts towards Nix and Dorothea,  levelled
So far, he has avoided Nix's gaze
'  -  - Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle
They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was resurrected
It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann is stunned
Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments and  at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of time
The  catches him in the arm, however
Aah
Go on, bleed
(he slashes at Swann again) Go on
Go on
Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a wall
He  out a serpentine , which races across the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face
(screaming) No
He falls backwards, his face
Swann doesn't wait to watch him die, but races out into the passageway, running from his wound
'  -   - Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses the still-sticky ground
He's a yard from the edge of the pit now
Nix swings round
You're not Swann
Who are you
(a beat) ) Oh
know what you want
He lets Dorothea slip from his arms
Harry flings himself towards the hole and   of Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss
His goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door leading to the passageway
Oh God
Hang on
Nix reaches down to torment Harry
But before he can make contact (
) Nix
Nix looks up
There you are
Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea
He steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone suddenly conversational
've had a lot of time to think about you
Where  went wrong
With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the chasm
And
should have been honest with you, right from the start
wasn't born to show people the error of their ways
was born to murder the world
, as he leads Dorothea to the door
Harry glances back into the room
You could still help me do that
Why would  want to
Because you've got nothing else to live for
Not true
The woman has a new love in her life
Your friends are dead
Nobody's left to save you, but me He lays his hands on Swann
Draws him into an embrace
and Dorothea
(to Dorothea) 've got to help him
You can't
Nix has got to have a weak spot
Everybody's got a fucking weak spot
He turns, and suddenly -- Butterfield is there
His face is horribly burned, but he's still very much alive
Bastard
He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the ensues, carrying them out into the Passageway
Nix has Swann in a bear-hug
Will you help me
beat
Then Swann nods
Yes
Nix lets him go
You know 'll kill you when we're done
have to
Yes
But until then
it's you and me
the way it always was
Yes
Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange
Swann's eyes flicker towards her
Nix turns
Wait
you still feel something for that bitch
No
Liar
Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall, pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground
Will
You
Never
Learn
With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them, they have the force of terrible blows
One to the ribs
They
One to the face
It
One to the legs, one to the arms
They all
Then Nix turns towards Dorothea
She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy
'll show you
He moves towards Dorothea
Swann falls to the ground, broken
Harry
'  -  - The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues
(
) Harry
Stop him
Harry looks up
Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and running off into the darkness
Butterfield comes at Harry again
Harry's got no more time for this creep
He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe, and Butterfield lands face down in the glass
We don't see the impact
it's enough
Harry looks down at the body
Then -- (
) Where is she
Harry turns
Nix is on him like a luoaernaut
treading on Butterfield's body as he comes at Harry
Where did she go
Nix  hold of Harry's head with one hand and  the fingers of -the other hand against Harry's
He struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful
Nix's fingers slowly   the skin of Harry's temples
As before, there's no blood
You've got Swann's disease
You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right
Wrong
His fingers slide all the way in
Oh God
Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away
His eyes are -
Nix is a few yards behind him
Tell me where she is
and 'll make it go away
Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare
'
The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move
face blossoms
, verging on insanity
Oh God
oh God
'
Harry sees a , wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of some glistening, barely visible
We can't see her face
Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her devourer
as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted
Reaching out for the image
'
The Woman reaches for Harry
Help me
as he touches the wall
Dorothea
He starts to  out the plaster on which the image is painted
Dorothea
Dorothea
'
Darkness swallows the image of the woman
She is still screaming when she disappears
'  -   - , dragging his broken body to the door
'  -  - literally beating his head against the wall
No
No
No
(
) Harry
Harry stops
Dare he believe this is truly her voice
It's not real, Harry- Harry turns around
Dorothea is there
'
For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is
, relief flooding his face
Then -- '
-- the image
Dorothea's beauty is replaced by primeval muck
, appalled
Dorothea grabs hold of him
Harry
Listen to me
Whatever's good between us, believe it
Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring
He's fighting the delirium
Or doing his best
oh
God
'm here, Harry
yes
Yes
Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry
(to Dorothea) There you are, child
Harry starts to look round
Don't look
have
to
Come on, child
want Swann to see you die
Harry turns and looks at Nix
'
Nix's face darkens as it
And the flesh in the middle of his brow , revealing a dark, pulsating
(to Harry) What are you looking at
, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room and now slips inside
, staring up at Nix
, re-emerging from the Meditation Room
In her hand, Harry's
Harry looks round at her
(points to his brow) There
there
, as he looks up at Dorothea
, as she raises the
She
The bullet  Nix's
He sinks to his knees, pouring down his face from the hole where his third used to be
, as Nix's mind-hold falters
He leans against the wall, shaking
Harry
'm okay
'm okay
Harry opens his eyes
Looks up at her
'
The last of the  fades
He sees Dorothea as she actually is
Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they embrace
Suddenly, a  from Nix
They look towards him -- -- it isn't over
One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he kneels in the
His sallow flesh is running in up his body towards the   in the middle of his forehead -- One
last
illusion
-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of the bullet wound
Oh my God
Harry and Dorothea start to get up
Nix is no longer human
He is a shape of gleaming , stripped of features
He opens his mouth, the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an utterly inhuman
(
) 'Amour
Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room
Swann is on the threshold
Nix  now
He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form
He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into the Meditation Room
'  -   - The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor
Dorothea is backed towards it by Nix
When Nix , his voice is not remotely human
It is am the purest of the pure
am the darkest of the dark
Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix
Harry
You can't kill him
Harry crouches beside Swann
(whispers) He did something with the ground
Yes
Can you do it
don't know
Try
She's a couple of yards from the pit now
(
) 'm beyond Heaven
'm beyond Hell
Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs
Nix topples
, who puts his hands on the ground
Closes his eyes
wave of  runs through the ground from Swann's broken fingers -- -- the Cultists' bodies  in the softening ground, like corpses in surf, and  towards the pit, their dead faces resurfacing -- Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over the edge of the pit
(to Dorothea) Get out of here
The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit
So's Harry, of course
Nix tries to get up, but he's too late
The corpses weigh him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper hold, and Harry still clings to his legs
No
No
No
He's at the edge of the pit
(
) Harry
Harry looks round
Dorothea's behind him, risking the flowing ground to offer him a hand
Nix starts to fall into the pit
At the last minute, he reaches for Harry, as -- -- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea
Together they stumble to  , where Swann still lies
They look back to see , as he goes over the edge of the pit and
At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head
He's dead
She closes his eyes
: What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his- death by any villain in the history of cinema
Nix is falling through rock
Still
He against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to smithereens
And as he falls -- '  -  - Is it finished
think so
No it's not
Nix keeps falling, breaking through another layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the earth
And now
there's a hint of   below
He's approaching
'  -  - Come on
She puts her arms around him
Kisses him, sobbing with relief
Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, , he disappears
of dark, roiling  erupts from the spot where he sank, and starts up the pit -- '  -   - The room
There's a  in the earth
'  -  - What the fuck
Harry-
Out
Out
They race for the front door -- -- the wave of , like a howling, dark , ascends at a breath-taking rate '  -  - Harry and Dorothea race for the open air, as '  -   - The   from the pit
'  -   - Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night -- '  -  - The  howls from room to room,  the images off the walls,  out the doors,  all the resurrection equipment in the Sanctum -- '  -  - Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car
They look back at the house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down
, as it peeps over the desert horizon
'  -  - The  creeps through the rooms as the  settles
'  -   - The hole in the floor  , and is reigns
'  -  - Harry and Dorothea get into the car
Harry glances back at the house
Nothing
(quietly) It's finished
'  -   -  - and the  , virtually destroyed by tine
