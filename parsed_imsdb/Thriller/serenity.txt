Written by Joss Whedon April 18, 2004 - It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed
They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them
The tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage
People walk about and vehicles glide quietly overhead
utopian vista
Now that the war's over, our soldiers get to come home, yes
Some of them
Some will be stationed on the rim planets as Peace Enforcers
don't understand
Why were the Independents even fighting us
Why wouldn't they look to be more civilized
That's a good question
Does anybody want to open on that
hear they're cannibals
That's only Reavers
Reavers aren't real
Full well they are
They attack settlers from space, they kill them and wear their skins and rape them for hours and hours -- (in Chinese) () It's true that there are
dangers on the outer planets
So let's follow up on Borodin's question
With all the social and medical advancements we can bring to the Independents, why would they fight so hard against us
3
We meddle
River
is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand and "typing" with the other
(Typing consists of holding a long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen
) She is a good two years younger than the other kids
People don't like to be meddled with
We tell them what to do, what to think, don't run don't walk we're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right
We're meddlesome
(gently taking her ) River, we're not telling people what to think
We're just trying to show them how
She violently  the stylus into the girl's forehead - And we   to the actual present: a 16 year old sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a technician
second monitors her brain patterns
The lab is cold, blue, steel
Insidiously clean
2ND She's dreaming
Nightmare
2ND Off the charts
Scary monsters
Let's amp it up
Delcium, eight- drop
is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for that matter
cold man, and more than a little satisfied with himself

Behind him stands a  , observing
And making him a little nervous
The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates -- no substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand
() See, most of our best work is done when they're asleep
We can monitor and direct their subconscious, implant suggestions
River starts convulsing, mewing in misery
The Inspector starts forward, slowly
() It's a little startling to see, but the results are spectacular
Especially in this case
River Tam is our star pupil
The Inspector steps into the light
He is rigid, cold, staring at the girl with no emotion at all
His name, as we will very soon learn, is
've heard that
She's a genius
Her mental capacity is extraordinary, even with the side-effects
Tell me about them
Well, obviously, she's unstable
the neural stripping gives them heightened cognitive reception, but it also destabilizes their own reality matrix
It manifests as borderline schizophrenia
which at this point is the price for being truly psychic
(moves toward her) What use do we have for a psychic if she's insane
5
don't have to tell you the security potential of someone who can read minds
And she has lucid periods -- we hope to improve upon the
'm sorry, Sir,  have to ask if there's some reason for this inspection
() Am  making you nervous
Key members of Parliament have personally observed this subject
was told their support for the project was unanimous
The demonstration of her power -- (turns back to her) How is she physically
Like nothing we've seen
All our subjects are conditioned for combat, but River
she's a creature of extraordinary grace
400 Yes
She always did love to dance
He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor
: As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade), flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room, flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out
Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her head and swabs her, whispering: () River
Wake up
Please, it's Simon
River
It's your brother
Wake up
She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic beneath
6
River is suddenly next to him
He jumps a little
Simon
beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion
() They know you've come
- As a guard looks at a monitor
He mostly resembles a secret service man -- more bureaucrat than thug
second man rolls into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen
- Simon walks River through the corridor
They approach a pair of double doors
We can't make it to the surface from inside
Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at them from the other side of the doors
4wo () Find a -- But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support
The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing the lone orderly
Passing right under River
- It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet
Goes a long way up and a long way down
One wide hinged window looks in on the hall inside
Simon and River approach with quiet haste
They slip through the window
Simon shuts it, wedges his baton into the handle as the
They fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect
Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small patch of daylight visible ten stories up
Sees the sky blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them
V0 7
:   is floating over the grass of rolling hills, the city gleaming far beyond
This facility is well hidden
gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship
It comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly
Get on
He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is right behind him,  the window with all his might
Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as the Security Agent cracks the glass
The two are whisked up in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her holding one of the cables -- (
) Stop
The action freezes
(0
) () Lovely
Lovely
Backtrack
The action , taking us back to the moment of Simon and River on the gurney just before it rises
f t o (
) () Stop
There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event
The Government's man
We'll just call him
He is thoughtful, a little removed
Wire-rimmed glasses, a suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual wear
He is in: - -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair
The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers
Biograph
Simon Tam
:  ' 8
As Simon's history files down in print and pictures -- graduation, security photo from his medical internship -- over one lens of the Operative's glasses
() Remarkable children
Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from the opening) and a nervous young female intern following
Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last
Excuse me
No one is allowed in the records room without my express permission
(over this, quietly) Enter the doctor
(to Mathias) Forgive me
prefer to see the event alone, without bias
Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is
need to see your clearance
You're right to insist
know you've had security issues here
He places his hand on a screen as he says it
Mathias looks at the readout, and drops the bluster
Apologies
An Operative of the Parliament will of course have full cooperation
(looks at screen) 'm not sure what
see no listing of rank, or name
have neither
Like this facility,  don't exist
The Parliament calls me in when
when they wish they didn't have to
Let's talk about the Tams
assume you've scanned the status logs
9
River was your greatest success
prodigy --  phenomenon
Until her brother walked in eight months ago and took her from you
It's not quite so simple
'm very aware of that
He came in with full creds
He beat the ap-scan, the retinal
There was no way  could -- No, no
Of course
The boy spent his fortune developing the contacts to infiltrate this place
Gave up a brilliant future in
medicine as well, you've probably read
Turned his back on his whole life
Madness
Madness, no
Something a good deal more dangerous
Have you looked at this scan carefully
At his face
Mathias looks uncertain
() It's love, in point of fact
He loved his sister and he knew she was in pain
So he took her somewhere safe
Why are you here
'm here because the situation is even less simple than you think
(eyeing him) Do you know what your sin is, Doctor
10
would be very careful about what you -- () It's pride
He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating: Key members of Parliament have personally observed this subject
was told their support -- (shutting it off) Key members of Parliament
Key
The minds behind every diplomatic, military and covert operation in the galaxy, and you put them in a room with a psychic
She was
she read cards, nothing more
It's come to our attention that River became much more unstable, more
disturbed, after you showed her off to Parliament
Did she see something very terrible in those cards
Whatever
secrets she might have accidentally gleaned
it's probable she doesn't even know she knows them
That they're buried beneath -- But they are in her
Her mind is unquiet
It's the will of the Parliament that  kill her
And the brother
Because of your sin
11
(continuing; moving to his briefcase) You know, in certain older civilized cultures, when men failed as entirely as you have, they would throw themselves on their swords
(fed up) Well, unfortunately  forgot to bring a sword to -- The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword
The Parliament has no further interest in psychics
They represent a threat to the harmony and stability of our Alliance
would put that down right now if were you
Would you be killed in your sleep, like an ailing pet
Whatever your failings,  believe you deserve better than that
The agents move
He slices the throat of the one behind him with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out his gun and pinning his hand
moment, and the dying agent reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm
The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as quietly as the first
Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall
He bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine
Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile
The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace for a moment
Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point tilted toward the doctor
The Doctor stares at it in horror as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it
The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door
V0 12
() Young miss, 'll need all the logs- on behavioral modification triggers
We'll have to reach out to River Tam, and help her to come back to us
No matter how far out Simon has taken her, we can -- He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame, slowed suddenly by the sword
It squeaks down the blade, the Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him: () This is a good death
There's no shame in this, in a man's death
man who's done fine works
We're making a better world
All of them, better worlds
Mathias is dead
The Operative pulls the sword out as the body rolls over
As he wipes the sword down: () Young miss,  need you to get to work now
think  may have a long way to travel
40 She goes
He approaches River, very close, staring
() Where are you hiding,,little girl
The noise is sucked suddenly out of the room as we black out
M0 10 13
becomes the name painted on the side of a spaceship, with the same in Chinese behind it
,    "" - We move away from the ship
The name is on the nose, under the bridge
It sticks out from the body of the ship like a craning neck
The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines on either side and a giant glowing back
There are two small shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines
It's not the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure
As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears
Camera comes around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see the Captain,  '' , standing and watching
At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes flying past the window
- [Note: the following sequence will take us through the ship in one extended  shot
] The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a tangle of wires and machinery all about
Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old Independent
Gun at his hip
He's not unlike the ship -- he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at least, weathered
Right now, though, he's mostly startled
What was that
He's addressing the pilot,
Flight gear and a hawaiian shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old soldier, but just as startled
Whoah
Did you see that -- The ship bucks -- Was that the primary buffer panel
It did seem to resemble -- 14
Did the Primary Buffer Panel just fall off my gorramn ship for no apparent reason
Another buck -- Looks like
thought Kaylee checked our entry couplings
have a very clear memory of it -- Yeah well if she doesn't give us some extra flow from the engine room to offset the burnthrough this landing is gonna get pretty interesting
Define "Interesting"
(calm suggestion:) "Oh god, oh god, we're all gonna die
" (hits the com) This is the Captain
There's a little problem with our entry sequence; we may experience slight turbulence and then explode
(to Wash, exiting) Can you shave the vector -- 'm doing it
It's not enough
(hits com) Kaylee
Just get us on the ground
That part'll happen, pretty definitely
15
- The camera leads Mal down
On either side of the hall are ladders leading down to crew's personal quarters
The hulking mercenary  is coming up out of his bunk as Mal passes
He carries a number of rifles and grenades
we're gonna explode
don't wanna explode
Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing
You only got the two arms
just get excitable as to choice, like to have my options open
don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job
Well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar
No grenades
(Jayne groans) No grenades
First Mate  enters from the lower level
Her mode of dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's
Are we crashing again
Talk to your husband
Is the mule prepped
Good to go, sir
Just loading her up
(to Jayne) Are those grenades
Cap'n doesn't want 'em
16
We're robbing the place
We're not occupying it
All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the: - It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy
There is food left lying on the table
Mal swipes a dumpling from a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor
(calling out) Kaylee
He enters: /  - (still calling) Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at
The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine room
Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic,
She passes Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the doorway, raising his voice above the din
() We got the Primary Buffer Everything's shiny, Cap'n
Not to fret
You told me -- () You told me the entry couplings would hold for another week
() That was six months ago, cap'n
My ship don't crash
If she crashes, you crashed her
17
Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up
He turns to see Simon behind him
Simon is more seasoned than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in dress and manner
He is implacably proper
Also pissed
() Doctor
Guess  need to get innocked 'fore we hit planetside
Simon nods, the ship jolting again
() Bit of a rockety ride
Nothing to worry about
'm not worried
Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc
This isn't fear
This is anger
4 () Well, it's kinda hard to tell the one from t'other, face like yours
imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider
'll look for that next time
You're not taking her
(brushing past him) No no, that's not a thing 'm interested in talking over with -- She's not going with you
That's final
18
(turning back) hear the words "that's final" come out of your mouth ever again, they truly will be
(turning away again) This is my boat
'all are guests on it
He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to: - Simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs
Guests
earn my passage, Captain -- And it's time your little sister learned from your fine example
've earned my passage treating bullet holes, knife wounds, laser burns
Some of our jobs are trickier than others -- And you want to put my sister in the middle of that
Didn't say 'want'
Said 'will'
It's one job, Doc
She'll be fine
The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the ship shares
Except, of course, for the sterile blue of: - Into which the two men step
She's a seventeen year old girl
mentally traumatized sevente-- 19
She's a reader
Sees into the truth of things; might see trouble before it's coming
Which is of use to me
And that's your guiding star, isn't it
What's of use
() Honestly, doctor,  think we may really crash this time anyway
Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm
Do you understand what 've gone through to keep River away from the Alliance
do, and it's a fact me and mine have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves
Are you threatening to -- got one purpose here: keep this boat in the air
take the jobs get -- which is less and less, case you ain't been keeping track
He starts away, Simon still keeping pace
() Every year since the war the Alliance pushes just a little further out towards the rim
Makes it a chore for naughty men like us to slip about -- and keeping you two on board means working twice as hard to avoid the law
Means turning down a score of honest jobs
20
- They enter the biggest space on the ship
Giant doors sit at the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering ramp
Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to the foredeck hall
We've come all the way through Serenity
So here is us, on the raggedy edge
Don't push me and  won't push you
Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him: () Things get gritty  will keep her from the fray, but she's coming
Best you get her ready
As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling
Jayne and Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it
() Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this boat out before we get flattened
Like a downy feather, sir
Nobody flies like my mister
The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on the catwalk, and track with them to find: River
She's lying on her side, looking straight at us
loose summer dress draped over her small frame
know
We're going for a ride
--   - Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens
- The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship
The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to River in the back: 21
Now, River, you stay behind the others
If there's fighting you drop to the floor or run away
It's okay to leave them to die
River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother
'm the brains of the operation
We should hit town right during Sunday worship
Won't be any crowds
If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll, this could look to be a sunny day for us
() Captain, 'll ask you one last time
Doctor, 'm taking your sister under my protection here
If anything happens to her, anything at all,  swear to you  will get very choked up
Honestly
There could be tears
He peels out, leaves Simon fuming
Kaylee sidles up to him
Don't mind the Captain none, Simon
know he'll look out for her
It's amazing
bring River all the way out to the raggedy edge of the 'verse so she can hide from the Alliance by robbing banks
It's just a little Trading Station
They'll be back 'fore you can spit
(as he stalks off) Not that you spit
22
Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn
- We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in
The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build with
Right now the streets are mainly empty
- The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak: What are we hoping to find here that equals the worth of a turd
Alliance payroll
There's peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant
Can't use credits out here -- they got to pay their boys in cashy money
Which once a month rests here
Something about stealing from the Alliance just warms a body like whiskey in winter
(cocks his gun) Shiny
Let's be badguys
Mal turns back to River
You ready to go to work, darlin'
There's no pattern to the pebbles here, they're completely random
tried to count them but you drove too fast
Hummingbird
(never mind) Right
Great
Let's go
- We are in a camera's eye view, right above the door
23
The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking
Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with "Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's blown to bits
There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers, farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids
It's a combination post-office, general store, bank, and most other things
Hands and knees and heads bowed down
Everybody, now
Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others
Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks
Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very much new in design
The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a great idea
Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and
-- bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold
() 'all wanna be looking very intently at your own belly buttons
see a head start to rise, violence is gonna ensue
The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else
Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform
Looks like this is the place
He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front door
She does, and River steps in
: '   -- walking slowly among the hunched- over customers as Mal addresses them
You've probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we are after is not yours
So let's have no undue fussing
As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office, finding the small vault locked
1410 24
She's locked up
River suddenly looks around, perturbed
: a young tough
River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the young man
He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt
He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek
You know what the definition of a hero is
It's someone who gets other people killed
You can look it up later
He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor
Mal moves to the Trade Agent
Hauls him up, tosses him toward the vault
Zoe and Jayne follow
This is just a crop moon, don't think you'll find what you -- (in Chinese) 140 The old man punches in the code
What opens is a tiny wall safe
Bundles of bills, some scattered coin
Unimpressive
Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in
At last
We can retire and give up this life of crime
Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming metal and blue light
Zoe smiles
Jayne peers down as Mal addresses the Trade Agent
Is there a fed down there
Be truthful
() 'all are Browncoats, hey
Fought for independence
25
War's long done
We're all just folk now
(calls down) Listen up
We are coming down to empty that vault
The voice of a young Alliance  comes up from below
(
) You have to give me your authorization password
Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into the hole
beat
(
) () Okay
Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into: - Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is already opening
Behind that door, a few bags of the real deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed
- We move in on River as something crosses her face
Worry
- carrying a bucket and her nine year old  are looking at the trading station a few buildings away
Repeater
Did sound summat like gunblast
Maybe you aught run tell Lawman
She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man
Mostly
He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self- mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning
His clothes are rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness
blade blurs through frame
26
- River  and flops onto her back, pinned by revelation
Others look at her, concerned, as Jayne makes his way to her
What the hell is up
You all right
What's goin' on
He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed
Reavers
- Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the guard, holding his gun at him: Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary organs
was thinking more of a graze
Well you don't want it to look like you just gave up
(
) (to himself) Every heist, he's gotta start yelling my name -- (barreling in) Mal
Reavers
The girl's pitchin' a fit
They're here or they're comin' soon
He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly
(to Zoe and Jayne) Get on the mule
(to the guard, pointing to the ) Does that open from the inside
27
Whah -ah- yes
You get everyone upstairs in there and you seal it
Long as you got air you don't open up, you understand
-- Buh  -- Mal is in his face, dark and huge: - The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal behind with River in hand
She is freaked, in her own space
Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on -- Zoe take the wheel -- You see 'em
Anybody see 'em
1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands River up to Jayne's care
As the craft powers up, slowly moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule
Take me with you
Get in the vault with the others -- can't stay here
Please
It's too many
Drive, Zoe
Reaver craft  over their heads
It's nearly the size of Serenity
Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war
Predator, pure
It disappears over the rooftops
28
Drive
Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust
As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows and grab the young man
Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun
He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back
Mal fires twice
The young man takes both bullets in the chest, slumps down dead
: As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street, right abreast of our gang
: We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines to swarm into it
- The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain
The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic fire and it swings away
There is sporadic return fire
How come they ain't blowing us out of the air
They wanna run us down
The up- close kill
River is squashed down on her back, being very small
They want us alive when they eat us
Boy, sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don'tchya think
Mal says nothing, keeps firing
Wash, baby can you hear me
29
:  - Wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping, prepping for take-off
We're moments from air
You got somebody behind you
We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point: - Reavers
() We're not gonna reach you in time
Just keep moving, honey
We're coming to you
- As she lifts off and starts heading toward the others
- Zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the air from the skiff and }
Goes through Jayne's leg
The harpoon grips the leg and pulls -- Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter -- Grab on
Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol
won't get et
You shoot me if they take me
Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne -- () Well don't shoot me first
30
Mal fires
Again
Steadies himself for one more
The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot
V0V The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground
Mal hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room
() Rutting pigs
Where's -- And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it
- Serenity rushes across the desert floor, not much higher off it than the smaller crafts
(to Zoe) Get some distance on 'em
You come to the flats,  want you to swing round
Gonna try a Barn Swallow
- Wash hits the com
Simon
Open the loading dock
- Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front, hits a couple of buttons
The doors pull open, as the huge ramp beyond them opens down, letting in a rush of wind and light
- The mule reaches the flats, away from the rocks
(
) (in Zoe's ear) Okay, baby, we've talked this through
Talkin' ain't doin'
She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about, fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff
(
) Don't slow down

: As it heads for the mule -- : As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up behind it -- The Mule swallowed by the bigger ship -- - And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as it flies backwards into the bay, narrowly missing Simon and smashing back into the staircase, sparks and people flying -- - Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the oncoming skiff, tearing it apart -- - flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor
Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then runs to the mule
The C02 stops and he finds River sitting in her seat, completely unharmed
Zoe is climbing painfully out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown
River
swallowed a bug
Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is
She goes to Simon
Are you okay
Is he okay
bloodied Reaver  into frame from under the skiff-top
He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth -- Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe both fire at the same time
The freak takes too long to go down, but down he goes
Dies sitting against the s i op
4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other
32
(
) We all here
What's going on
Hello
r
/ (moves to the com) No casualties
Anybody following
- Nice flying, baby, and that's a negative
Clean getaway -- Out of atmo in six minutes
- Set course for Beaumonde
(to the others) First thing,  want these bod -- Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain
() You stupid, selfish, son of a whore --- 'm a hair's breadth from riddling you with holes, Doctor -- "One simple job
She'll be fine
" She  fine
Except for bein' still crazy, she's the picture of health
Wasn't for River, we'd probably be left there
She felt 'em coming
Never again
You understand me
33
Seems  remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat
Well sleep easy 'cause we're off your boat
Just as soon as River gets her share of the "bounty"
Well let's not do anything hasty
No, shiny
'm sick a' carrying tourists anyhow
We'll be on Beaumonde in ten hours time, you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry
Meantime you do your job
Patch up my crew
beat
He didn't lie down
They never lie down
She is looking at the Reaver
Everyone does, for a moment
- Mal and Zoe enter from below
No,  think things'll glide a deal smoother for us without River and Simon on board
but how long do you think they'll last
Doc made his call
They's as babes in a basket when we took 'em in; we sheltered 'em plenty
Man has to cut loose, learn to stand on his own
Like that man back in town
They stop by Mal Is room
had to shoot him
What the Reavers woulda done to him before they killed him
34
know
That was a piece a' mercy
But before that, him begging us to bring him along
vo, We couldn't take the weight
Woulda slowed us down
You know that for certain Mule won't run with five shoulda dumped the girl
Or you
Or Jayne
() Well, Jayne
Coulda tossed the payload
And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our mitts, tell 'em "here's your share"
They'd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril
We get a job, we gotta vo make good
Washenters from the bridge
Sir,  don't disagree on any particular point, it's just
in the time of war, we woulda never left a man stranded
Maybe that's why we lost
She's not happy with the reply
Mal climbs down to his room as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her
'  - Once alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show
He pulls off his holster and drops it over a chair
Kicks the toilet closed and sits on his bunk
The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and clutter, ancient maps on the walls
35
Mal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides out
Hits the floor and starts moving: it's a snapshot-movie : - ' We're close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused exasperation
Behind her is an opulently dressed little shuttle
Kaylee, are you ever gonna put that capture down
(0
5
) We gotta have records of everything
bona fide Companion entertained clients on this very ship
In this very bed
The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending over and sniffing curiously
Inara is packing things up
(
) () For one sweet second, we was almost classy
4 You promised to help me pack
(
) Honest, Inara, why do you have to leave
Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the picture freezes, goes back to the beginning
During all this, Mal has picked it up
He looks at it a moment, tosses it aside
Looks around at nothing much
(
0
) do not get it
How's a guy get so wrong
- We see the doors in the floor slide open, a second set below
Pan to see, for a moment, the dead Reaver's face
Kaylee is opening the doors with a keypad on a cable
Jayne drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continues: 36
Ain't logical
Cuttin' on his own face, rapin' and murdering -- mean, 'll kill a man in a fair fight
or if  think he's gonna start a fair fight, or if he bothers me, or if there's a woman, or 'm gettin' paid -- mostly only when 'm gettin' paid
But these Reavers
last ten years they just show up like the boageyman from stories
Eating people alive
Where does that get fun
He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing
Shepherd Book said they was men that reached the edge of space
, saw a vasty nothingness and just went bibbledy over it
Hell,  been to the edge
Just looked like more space
don't know
People get awful lonely in the black
Like to get addlepated ourselves, we stay on this boat much longer
Captain'll drive us all off, one by one
You're just in a whinge cuz that prissy doc is finally disembarking
Me  says good riddance
He never belonged here, and his sister's no saner than one of them Reavers
That ain't even so
River's a dear heart and a boon to this crew
You just don't like her 'cause she can read your mind and everything you think is mean
Well, there is that
37
Her and Simon could have a place here
Now they're leaving us
Just like Shepherd Book
She looks up toward one of the shuttles
() Just like Inara
- And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes half closed in passion
She settles on a cluster of brocaded pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss
Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in saris, on their knees
Two handsome young men with shaved heads in the back, also on their knees
Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up
She speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step
'  (
0
) They love you
410 - Inara looks out at the mountains
The space she's in resembles a Tibetan monastery, if slightly more opulent
Widen to see she is with , a somewhat older Companion, the woman whose voice we heard
She hands Inara a drink
The girls
They've learned more from you these last months than the rest of us could show them in two years
They're very sweet
But they're not Companions
() You've no hope for them
Junk the lot, start anew
38
On Sihnon we started training at twelve
Years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure was even mentioned
Most of these girls -- They're all of good family, the highest academic standards -- Control
Was the first lesson
And the last and these worlds are not like the Central Planets
There is barbarism dressed up in the most civil weeds
Men of the highest rank who don't know the difference between a Companion and a common whore
It's unsafe
All the more reason the girls look to you
You came out here alone, before the Alliance ever thought to establish a House this remote
You've seen so much
You're a figure of great romance to them
4d Great romance has nothing to do with being a Companion, Sheydra
You should know better
'm not the one who had a torrid affair with a pirate
Inara nearly spills her drink
who
With a what
() It's the talk of the House
The girls all trade stories in the dorms at night
didn't
have a pirate
39
In one of the stories you make love in a burning temple
think that's my favorite
() This is unbearable
Captain Reynolds is no pirate; he's a petty thief
And he never laid a finger on me
All he ever did was rent me a shuttle and be very annoying
(mutters in Chinese) year on his shuttle and he never laid a finger on you
No wonder you left
() left because -- go away
We're no longer friends
You're a stranger to me now
104  do love to watch you boil
Don't worry
The stories will fade
And your Captain Reynolds has probably gotten himself blown up by this time
(looking away again) Yes
That would be just like him
:   - Serenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of other, equally disreputable ships
The place is filled with every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable
/
- The ramp is open and everyone is filing out, ready to hit the town
Kaylee is talking to Simon, who has River in hand
Don't talk to the barkers -- only the captains
() 40
(cont'd) You look the captain in the eye, know who you're dealing with
40 a  wish there was
Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on: You shouldn't aughta be so clean
It's a dead giveaway you don't belong, you always gotta be tidy
Don't pay anybody in advance
And don't ride in anything with a Capissen 38 engine, they fall right out of the sky
Kaylee
She turns and heads off
Simon starts in the other direction, but River looks after her and the others
() River
do you want to stay with them
4 It's not safe
No,  fear it's not safe anymore
He's heading off and doesn't hear: For them
- We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report
On the screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed, now half of it a smoking ruin
(
) that it was a band of Reavers remains unconfirmed
The only survivors of the massacre apparently locked themselves in the Trade Station vault until -- 40 41
During this we come around to see that the screen has a blinking light behind it, come  the wiring of the back to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the corner
Every screen is a camera, even down here
40 We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar
Cutting away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and booths and a second screen playing in the corner
It's not my fault the Doc's got no stomach for Rim living -- It is entirely and for all your fault
If you'd given Simon a moment, just a moment where he didn't think you were gonna throw them off or turn them in, he might've -- What
Swept you into his cleanly arms
Made tidy love to you
They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have already checked their guns
It works like a lunch automat: Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively
(as they continue ) Don't you dare joke
You know how much  pined on Simon
And him fair sweet on me,  well believe, but he's so worried about being found out -- Captain didn't make 'em fugitives
But he coulda made 'em family
Steada driving them off
Steada keeping Simon from seein'  was there, when  carried such a torch and we coulda -- goin' on a year now  ain't had nothin' twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries
40 42
Oh god
can't know that
40  could stand to hear a little more
If you had a care for anybody's heart you woulda -- () You knew he was gonna leave
We never been but a way station to those two
And how do you know what he feels
He's got River to worry on but he still coulda shown you
if  truly wanted someone bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in the 'verse could stop me from going to her
Tell that to Inara
For a moment, Mal is too shocked to react
Kaylee storms out
4 Domestic troubles
is young, tough -- somewhere between a gangster and a fur-trader
Sounds lower-class British, or something like it
Domestic troubles
moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is Mingo's identical twin
Apart from slight differences in dress, they are indistinguishable
'Cause we don't wanna interrupt
man should keep his house in order
(greets them each) Mingo
Fanty
14 43
(pointing at his ) He's Mingo
,do He's Fanty
You're Mingo
Ghahh
How is it you always know
Fanty's prettier
(pulling out a chair) Feel to do some business
(re: Mal Is gang) Bit crowded, isn't it
As you see, we come unencumbered by thugs
Which means at least four of the guys already in here are yours
All's one
'll just keep Jayne with me
Sir, are you sure you don't -- Go
Go get yourselves a nice romantic meal
Those are my two favorite words
(to Zoe) Honey
"Meal
" (to Zoe) It's business
We're fine
They leave and the four remaining men sit
Fanty tosses a few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance
:   '  of the men is conveniently blocked by her little dance
Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot
Quite a crew you've got
44
Yeah, they're a fine bunch of ruebens
How you keep them on that crap boat is the subject of much musing tween me and Fanty
We go on and on
So 'm noticing
Is there a problem  don't know of
You got 25% of a sweet take kissing your foot, how come we're not dispersing
Our end is forty, precious
My muscular buttocks it's forty -- It is as of now
Find anyone around going cheaper
Find anyone around going near a sorry lot like you in the first instance
:  has entered, is looking about
Jayne sees her, nudges Mal, who looks and turns back to business
We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter of the bar, vaguely listening in on Mal's deal
() You're unlikable, Mal
You got no respect for us above you, you got enemies in every quadrant, and your ship's older than the starting point of time
You's charity cases to such as us
45
Well here's a foul thought conjured you two were incompetent; sent us out not knowing there were V0 Reavers about
Now 'm thinking you picked us out because you did
That were a sign of faith, boy
And it doesn't affect our forty per
Danger is, after all, your business
Reavers ain't business, double dickless
This is all background noise to River, who has moved to the screen, on which is a commercial
It's animated, goofy, cartoon animals and anime-style Asian girls all transforming to insane fantasy figures as they sing about: , ,      , , ,
-- ,
We push in, the light from the  on River's face, pushing to , all noise but the jingle fading out, finally that as well, just the hum in River's ears
And she whispers: Miranda
She turns and looks back at the crowd
What happens next happens very fast
She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as -- people are turning, just registering that this girl -- kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a bottle off it behind her -- the bottle hits a man behind her square in the face, a man she never even looked at -- people are rising, fleeing or pushing forward -- V0 46
River
V0 Whuhuh
She's taking out a group of four, high kicks and perfect precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above her head, using his momentum to stab the other one -- Mal fights to get back to the gunrack
The bouncer reaches her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls the rod at her head, knocks her cold
She's everywhere
On tables, chairs, under your legs, using the room itself to take out every single person there
One man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg around the corner and nails his face
Jayne grabs her from behind -- () Gorrammit, girl, it's me
She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm, V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table -- Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut -- Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with his, they are pointed right at each other -- Eta Kooram Nah Smech
And River drops to the ground, fast asleep
There is a beat
Mal looks around the bar
He and Simon, who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing
He looks down at River
She lies unconscious, helpless
think maybe we ought to leave
10 47
- We see two sleek warships glide silently into frame, followed by a third, bigger ship
This is the operative's vessel, and 10 it is everything Serenity is not: sleek, predatory, icy cool
'  -  - The operative is looking at the Maidenhead security feed -- and River is staring right at him
() Hello again
Yes, it's me
'm glad you've finally asked for me
An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor: We got a pos on a retinal -- man carrying her out is Malcolm Reynolds, captains a Firefly-class transport ship, "Serenity"
Bound by law five times, smuggling, tariff dodge
not convicted
Nothing here that would -- The ship
The name of the ship
10 () Crossref
Malcolm Reynolds
Serenity
He looks over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on his lips -- as his glasses are covered by text
Sir
Serenity Valley
Bloodiest battle of the entire war
The Independents held the valley for seven weeks, two of them after their high command had surrendered
68% casualty rate
Of course, Sir,  just didn't -- There
48
His glasses stop scrolling and Mal's military file opens, a picture of Mal in one lens
140 () If the feds ever bothered to crossref justice files with war records
Yes
Our Mr
Reynolds was a sergeant, 57th Overlanders
Volunteer
Fought at Serenity till the very last
This man is an issue
This man hates us
First Mate Zoe Washburn, formerly Corporal Zoe Alleyne, also in the 57th
Career army, looks like
She's followed him far
Give me the crew, registered passengers -- Our Captain is a passionate man, no room there for subtlety
He's bound to have some very obvious
:   of his glasses
On it is a slowly moving picture of
-40 (continuing) weakness
- River is still asleep, Mal finishing chaining her wrists
She lies on her side, breathing evenly
Mal stares at her a moment, then: - He exits to find the whole group waiting for him, sans Wash
May  see her
She's still napping just now
And believe you've got some storytelling to do
49
() We're out of atmo, plotted for Haven
No one following as of yet
Haven
We're gonna see Shepherd Book
() We got to lay low
And  could fair use some spiritual guidance right about now
(to Simon) am a lost lamb; what in hell happened back there
Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety pound girl
'Cause  don't think that's ever getting old
Do we know if anyone was killed
It's likely
know she meant to Ad kill me 'fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work anyhow
Safeword
() The people who helped me break River out -- they had intel that River and the other subjects were being embedded with behavioral conditioning
They taught me a safeword, in case
something happened
Not sure  get it
phrase that's encoded in her brain, that makes her fall asleep
If  speak the words, "Eta -- 50
(jumping back) Well don't say it
moo It only works on her, Jayne
Oh
Well, now  know that
"In case something happened
" What
You feel to elaborate on what that something might be
mean they taught you that fancy safeword, they must've figured she was gonna, what -- start uncontrollably crocheting
They never said what -- And you never did ask
Mal grabs him and throws him against the wall, in his face
() Eight months
Eight months you had her on my boat knowing full well she might go monkeyshit at the wrong word and you never said a thing -- brought her out here so they couldn't get to her,  don't even know how they -- My ship
My crewi You had a gorramn timebomb living with us
- River's eyes open
V0 51
- What if she went off in the middle woo of dinner, or in bunk with Kaylee, did that give you a moment's pause
Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him
thought she was getting better
And  thought they was gettin' off
(off looks) Didn't we have a intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore
We couldn't leave them now
No, now that she's a
killer woman we ought be bringin' 'em tea and dumplings
(to Mal) In earnest, Mal: why'd you bring her back on
Mal looks at Jayne, at all of them
Doesn't have an answer
May  see her
Mal steps aside
Simon enters the locker
She goes woolly again, we're gonna have to put a bullet to her
- River mouths the next words right along with Mal: - It's crossed my mind
Can  make a suggestion that doesn't involve violence, or is this the wrong crowd
52
Honey
V0 Fanty and Mingo might be coming hard down on us, or the laws
or maybe nobody could be bunged about a little social brawl
We need to get our bearings
think we need to talk to Mr
Universe
- The camera swoops in at a sparking ion cloud, then through the cloud at a barren, metallic satellite moon
Then further in to reveal a sprawling -- and completely empty -- communications complex
Giant satellite dishes everywhere
'  - Inside, we find an unkempt young man
Also sleep-deprived, over-caffeinated and kinda sweet
This is
He is alone but for his mannikin-like Love-bot, Lenore
He's surrounded by screens, computers, feeds -- machinery that looks both ultra-modern and long neglected
All the screens play different images -- it's a mediaverse
- A0 As he watches the security feed of River's fight his image becomes a vidscreen
He's addressing Wash, Mal and Zoe
We intercut between the two spaces: Oh, this is good
This is
() she's beating up all the burly men and 'm having a catharsis, it's happening right now, you guys always bring me the very best violence
You think you're in a hot place
That's what we're looking to learn
Is there any follow up, a newswave
53
There is no "news", there's the truth of the signal, what  see, and there's the puppet theatre the V0 Parliament's jesters foist on the somnambulant public
Monkey taught to say the word "monkey" -- lead story on 32 planets
But the slum riots on Hera, not a -- What about this
Did this make the
puppet theatre
No sir
And no lawforce flags, either --  hadda go into the security feed direct
You can do that
Can't stop the signal, Mal
Everything goes somewhere and  go everywhere
Security feeds are a traipse to access -- and  wasn't the first one in, this has prints on it -- oh
Look at her go
A0 Everyone is getting bruises and contusions
Contoooosions
(to Mal, over that) So somebody else has been fed this
That doesn't like me too well
Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling in love with me
You're just gonna embarrass yourself
have a commitment to my Lovebot, it was a very beautiful ceremony, Lenore wrote her own vows,  cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby
(re: screen) And she falls asleep
Which, she would be sleepy
54
Can you go back
See if anybody spoke with her 'fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her
Mr Universe works the screen
The image rewinds and stops on River coming up to it, looking at it
She whispers the word, "Miranda", and starts to move away
() Miranda
Go back further
No
He pulls another screen close, starts working that one
Matching timecodes, he pulls up the commercial
Um
please
Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as (-) well -- and it starts breaking down, bursts of code showing through
As he does so: Friends and potential lovers, 4DO have good news and  have the other kind
Good is you're very smart
Someone is talking to her
The oaty bar
Subliminal
It's a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her
() been seeing this code pop up all over, last few weeks
And cannot crack it
It's Alliance and it's high military, so here then is the bad
Someone has gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend
And found her they have
Mal, Zoe and Wash look at each other
40 55
() Do you all know what it is you're carrying
- River stares at us, impassive, as the camera pulls away from her to reveal Simon, who is cleaning blood off her face
They're afraid of me
'm sorry
They should be
What  will show them
Oh God
She starts tearing up, breathing faster
Simon runs his hands through her hair
It's okay, it's okay
(somewhere else) Show me off like a dog, old men covered in blood, it never touched them but they're drowning in it
so much loss
don't know what 'm saying
never know what 'm saying
You said something
When you were triggered, do you remember
The Captain saw you say something on the feed
Miranda
Miranda
(laughs bitterly) Ask her
She'll show you all
40 56
Show us what
Who is Miranda
() Am
talking to Miranda now
Nwi12 She shoots him a look
'm not a multiple, dumbo
No
Right
But  think somehow when they triggered you it brought this up, this memory -- It isn't mine
The memory didn't bring it and  shouldn't have to carry it, it isn't mine
(:) Don't make me sleep again
won't
Put a bullet to me
Bullet in the brain pan, squish
Don't say that
Not ever
We'll get through this
She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately
Things are going to get much much worse
Well, the Captain hasn't tossed us in the airlock, so 'd say we're -- He has to see
More than anyone
he has to see what he doesn't want to
River
What will Miranda show us
She thinks
57
Death
Whose death
And she starts laughing
Quietly at first, then louder, then almost uncontrollably, screaming in his face: '
: Black Silence
- It's pitch black here, til Serenity's lights throw a hard relief on the rocky wall
She flies in after, slow and steady, revealing herself to be in a huge mineshaft
(
) Lord,  am walking your way
:   lowers to reveal Shepherd , a working- class preacher and former crew member
He smiles as they come out to meet him: (
) () Let me in, for my feet are sore, my clothes are ragged
- We see the camp: a few shacks and a working mine, as our group come down to it, greeted by a few miners, including an eight year old boy that rushes to Kaylee
:   mounted at the edge of town
The guy manning it sees them arrive, also goes to greet them
- We see the gang sitting and eating
Comfortable, even laughing a bit
Jayne presents Book with a couple of cigars
Kaylee hoists the boy on her lap
(
) Look in my eyes, Lord, and my sins will play out on them as on a screen
Read them all
58
- Mal approaches Book on the edge of a rise overlooking the town
Mal has a bowl and chopsticks
Book is finishing: V0 Forgive what you can, and send me on my path
will walk on, until you bid me rest
Hope that ain't for me, Shepherd
(lighting a cigar) It's prayer for the dead
Then  really hope it ain't for me
It's for the men River might have killed in that bar
Weren't River that did it, you know that
Somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take, fenced it right Vd up
You got a plan
Hiding ain't a plan
It'll do you for a spell, and the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin
but they'll be coming
Alliance is after this girl with a powerful will
look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment
V0 59
You won't
(off Mal's look) This isn't a palms-up military run, Mal
No reports broadwaved, no warrants
much as they want her, they want her hid
That means Closed File
Means an Operative, which is trouble you've not known
coulda left her there
- As he continues, we see an image of him watching over the sleeping girl, his mind, racing
(
) had an out -- hell,  had every reason in the 'verse to leave her lay and haul anchor
- Not your way, Mal
V0 have a way
() Is that better than a plan
You can play the thug all you want, but there's more to you than you're ever like to 'fess
You just think that 'cause my eyes is all sorrowful and pretty
Only one thing is gonna walk you through this, Mal
Belief
Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd
ain't looking for help from on high
That's a long wait for a train don't come
1490 60
When  talk about belief, why do you always assume 'm talking about God
(Mal has no response) They'll come at you sideways
As he continues, we see: - Inara stands waiting, her back to us, in front of the very vista we first saw her before
The operative comes slowly up the staircase, stands before her
(
0
) It's how they think: sideways
It's how they move
Sidle up and smile, hit you where you're weak
- Sorta man they're like to send believes hard
Kills and never asks why
It's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world
wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal
Have to tell me about that some time
(looking out) No  don't
He walks away, offering this: () Sideways
Mal watches him go, thinking
40 61
- The Teacher from the very beginning is standing in front of River, whose desktop screen depicts a single, dark planet
River
Eight-year-old River is working away, not paying attention
() River, you look tired
think everybody's a little tired by now; why don't we all lie down
River looks up, scared
All the other children wordlessly get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to them
() little peace and quiet will make everything better
She starts to lie down herself, right on the grass
No
Vao River
Do as you're told
It's going to be fine
Lie down
- River starts awake
'  - Mal does too, shirtless on his bunk
Whuh huh nuhwhat
(0
) (for the third time) Mal
You up
Got a wave
'm a bounce it down to you
He pops up, turns to the screen as the white noise becomes: 1400 62
Inara
: Inara on Mal's screen
We see her from about chest level up
She, presumably, sees the same
Mal
uh, is this a bad time Good as any
Please tell me you're wearing pants
(slight grin) Naked as the day  come cryin'
How's your world
Cold
It's autumn here
Still at the Training House
Right where you left me
remember it as nice enough
picturesque
It is that
What about you
Still flying
So what occasi the wave
Not that to see you ain't
well you look very - watching both Mal and Inara on two Zoe and Wash are secretly at their formal shyness
different screens, smiling Jayne enters, wondering what's up
63
'  - Oh
Thank you,
guess we have something of a problem here
With the locals,  thought maybe
You could use a gun hand
'm hoping not
But if you were close at all, you -- the crew -- could take your ease here a while
and there'd be payment
Payment is never not a factor could sound out the crew
This pot like to boil over soon
Soon
Not right away
Well, it would be,  mean  would like to
Kaylee's been missing you something fierce -- - There is a general groan among the audience, which now includes Kaylee as well
Oh they're so pathetic
'  - miss her too
even miss my shuttle, occasionally
Yeah, you left a
got some of your stuff in a trunk, never did get a chance to drop it off
Oh
didn't look through the
stuff
just sundries  expect
64 Inara smiles blandly, nods
An awkward beat
() Well, it's kind of late where 'm at
'll send a wave as soon as can
Thank you
She disappears
Mal thinks a moment
- Mal comes up in, buttoning his shirt
Inara
Nice to see her again
So, trap
Trap
We goin' in
moo It ain't but a few hours out
Yeah, but, remember the part where it's a trap
If that's the case, then Inara's already caught in it
She wouldn't set us up willing
Might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels
We go in
How can you be sure Inara don't just wanna see you
Sometimes people have feelings -- 'm referring here to people
'all were watching,  take it
Guilty glances
65 Yes
140 You see us fight
No
Trap
- The ship moves gracefully over the mountains
- We're about seventy miles from the Training house
And nobody on radar
if the Alliance is about, they're laying low
They're about
Find us a home
'll take the shuttle in closer
Zoe, ship is yours
4dO He starts out, turns back to Zoe
() Remember: if anything happens to me, or you don't hear from me within the hour
you take this ship and you come and rescue me
What
And risk my ship
() mean it
It's cold out there
don't wanna get left
- She is nestled in a gorge, overhanging rocks all but burying her from view
The shuttle on the right lifts off from the side of the ship and glides off, keeping low
66
- line of young trainees files by in robes and red shawls pulled over their heads -- one trainee a good deal larger than the others
'  - She is kneeling in front of a statue of Buddha, lighting a few incense sticks
The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle where she entertained men, but still beautifully furnished and draped
lace curtain hangs in front of the light, casting its pattern in shadow over everything
Including the rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside Inara
Dear Buddha, please send me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and -- Mal
What are you doing here
You invited me
never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come
Well that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it
You knew my invitation wasn't on the level -- Which led me to the conclusion that you must be in some trouble
'm fine
'm
giddy
For a woman schooled in telling men what they wanna hear, you ain't much of a liar
Mal, you cannot handle this man
-40 67
() have to say, 'm impressed that you would come for her yourself
lwi12 And that you would make it this far in that outfit
() can be very graceful when  need to
've no doubt
Mal sheds his shawl and robe
Inara kneels at the alter, picks out another incense stick
What are you doing
'm praying for you, Mal
That's very thoughtful
But mean it when  say you're not in any danger
Speak your piece
think you're beginning to understand how dangerous River Tam is
She is a mite unpredictable
Mood swings, of a sort
It's worse than you know
It usually is
That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship
She's an albatross, Captain
68
Way  remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck
til some idiot killed it
(to Inara) Yes, 've read a poem
Try not to faint
The Operative moves further into the room
Whenever he moves, Mal counters
've seen your war record
know how you must feel about the Alliance
You really don't
Fair to say
But  have to hope you understand you can't beat us
got no need to beat you
just wanna go my way
And you can do that, once you let me take the girl back home
Give me the opportunity to help you
All  gotta do is let you take one more thing away from me
've had a lot of things taken in my time
And it may just be that this is one too many
This psychotic, potentially murderous girl who can't have the slightest awareness of your protection
This is where you "draw the line"
Well 'm a whimsical soul
There's a number of lives that hang in the balance here
Lives under your care
Are they as whimsical as yourself
69
got no notion that 'm being heroical at all
Any more than think you're really just a harmless bureaucrat come to help me out
You move like a killer
The Operative is stopped by this
Unhappily, he continues: have a warship in deep orbit, Captain
We locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo
can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location inside of three minutes
Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all around it, and tosses it to the Operative
You do that, best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord
Pulse beacon
Advice from an old tracker: you wanna find someone, use your eyes
How long do you think you can really run from us
Oh, a jack-rabbit, me
'Sides, never credited the Alliance with an over-abundance of brains
And if you're the best they got
Captain Reynolds,  should tell you so that you don't waste your time: You can't make me angry
Oh please
Spend an hour with him
Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey
" 70
need her, Captain
River is
my purpose and  will gather her to me
The brother as well
Whatever else happens is incidental
In the greater scheme
Why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great
want to resolve this like civilized men
'm not threatening you
'm unarmed
Great
He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest
The Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway
The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind
am of course wearing full body armor
'm not a moron
He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts, but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds
Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying
Mal gets to his feet and they square off
Mal breathing hard, nose dripping blood
The Operative perfectly poised, waiting
No back up
We're making an awful ruckus
They'll come when they're needed
'd start whistling
Captain, what do you think is going to happen here
They come at each other
The Operative is the much better trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly
40 71
Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's precision is wearing Mal down
Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara, breathing hard
He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara places her hand on his arm
The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out his sword
His face has taken on that remote kind of fascination as he looks at it
() Nothing here is what it seems
know
He's not the plucky hero
The Alliance isn't some evil empire
This isn't the grand arena
And that's not incense
He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like a fuse -- and  in an explosion of light and sound
40 It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz
The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders
Mal and Inara are gone
He motions for the men to follow them
Just a flash bomb
Go
Go
- Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps and along a corridor
The sound is still tinny and weird
had him
What
(deafly loud) think that  was winning
72
,  '  - Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain
They look to see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by V0 it
Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking grenade out of his pocket
Pops the top and hurls it over at the foursome
:  , as a series of bars of light go out one by one, counting down -- Grenade
Everybody dives for cover
The moment they do, Mal and Inara race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as the last light goes out and nothing happens
One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the door shuts on him and Inara
- Inara pushes into the pilot's seat
Hang on to something
4 You sure you remember how it -- He nearly falls over as: - The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out
- Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the controls
Mal is gone
told you to hang on
(
) (in great pain) 'm fine
- We are below Serenity as her bay doors are closing, six little objects floating out of her belly like roe
73
These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly
They all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect and burns away from us
- The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple
(into a com) Forget the pulse beacon, there has to be another way to track the ship -- get a read on the nav sat
It's a registered transport, you must be able to locate -- (
) Sir
Have you found a nav sat trajectory
(
) Sir
we've found seven
The Operative looks more unhappy than angry
(to himself) Does he think this is a game
- The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle- holes in her head -- makes her way through them
Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen
On it is the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and planets
She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes in to one system, one planet
She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see: - Her  is of the lab
There stand some five older men in formal dress
They stare at her, impassive
We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face -- 00 74
- And River awakens
moment to get her bearings, then her eyes narrow with intent
(
0
) We have every reason to be afraid
- Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal
That ain't so hard -- He didn't beat me up -- Because he's a believer
' , As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs
Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters
(
0
) He's intelligent, methodical and devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do
- honestly think the only reason we haven't been blown out of the air is that he needs to see her
Needs to see her why
'm uncertain
would say to be sure of the kill, but
just know he'll kill us all to get to her
So no hope of a reward, huh
Did he mention a deal of any kind
75
(looking at Simon) Give the two of them up
Go my way
Which you was all ready to do not a day ago
What went sour
Cutting them loose ain't the same as handing them over
That so
'Cause the corpse 'm about to become is having trouble telling the difference
(to Inara) Did he say anything about a "Miranda"
What is that
Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind
Conjure it might be the reason he's after her
You think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance
Do we care
Are we caring about that
You dumbass hogs, the only people she's a threat to is us on this boat
- River is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split again, feet against the walls
There is a wire mesh cover to the light, and she has bent part of it out, is working it inside the lock of her shackles
76
- Look, we get back to Haven in a 'r/ few hours time -- Hiding under the Shepherd's skirts, that's a manful scheme -- You wanna run this ship
Yes
(small beat) Well you can't
Do a damn sight better job'n you
Getting us lashed over a couple of strays
(to Simon) No offense, Doc,  think it's noble as a grape the way you look to River, but she ain't my sister (to Mal) and she ain't your crew
Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless
So where's it writ we gotta lay down our lives for her, which is what you've steered us toward
didn't start this
No, the Alliance starts the war -- and then you volunteer
Battle of Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here, how many -- (Mal turns away) -- 'm talkin' at you -- how many men in your platoon came out of there alive
Mal stares at him
(dead cold) You wanna leave this room
77 You're damn right  do
He stalks upstairs
There's a quiet moment
This isn't the war, Mal
Mal turns, eyeing her
Are you telling me that because you think  don't know -- You came to the training house looking for a fight
came looking for you
just want to know who 'm dealing with
've seen too many versions of you to be sure
start fighting a war  guarantee you'll see something new
Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over: We'll get off
River and 'll get off at Haven and find some -- Nobody's saying that
Nobody besides Jayne is saying that
- Inara tries to catch up to -- Mal
10 78
() got no answers for you, Inara
got no rudder
Wind blows 40 northerly,  go north
That's who am
Maybe that ain't a man to lead but they have to follow so you wanna tear me down do it inside your own mind
'm not trying to tear you down -- But you fog things up
You always have -- you spin me about
wish like hell you was elsewhere
was
- Jayne is looking at the storage locker door
beat
He moves to the aft hall, shuts and locks the door
Goes 40 back to the locker and starts to unlock it, pulling his gun
() No trouble now, little crazy person
we're going for a nice shuttle ride -- He opens the door and she is on him in an instant, whip blow to the throat, the nose -- he fires wildly as she jumps on him, wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back -- - The crew enters, drawn by the shots
Mal is first -- can't open the door
Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne
The other way
Find her and-do not engage
Everyone piles out the other way
Simon remains, to look in the window
10 79
: ' : There is Jayne, not moving -- and River pops up right in front of us
He starts, then waits as she opens the door
It's gonna be oka -- She elbows his throat viciously
He drops to his knees, shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground
He doesn't move
She looks at him a moment, then takes off
- Mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the upstairs
He gives up, looking around
She's sealed off the bridge
do not like her there
Cap'n
She tosses him a bolt remover
He starts pulling a bolt out of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe: Check the shuttles
She coulda 40 snuck in
He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires
/ - floor panel hinges open, Mal pulling himself up
He moves quietly to the bridge, gun drawn
He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates on a big Cortex screen she's pulled out by the copilot's seat
She whips Jayne's gun at his face, never looking at him
moment, and Mal lowers his own gun
The government's man, he says you're a danger to us
Not worth helping
Is he right
Are you anything but a weapon
've staked my crew's life on the a - person-,-- - actual and whole, and if 'm wrong you'd best shoot me now
(she cocks the gun) Or we could talk more
40 80
(pointing to screen) Miranda
WIt's a planet
Matches the one from her dream
- Everyone has gathered
Wash is piloting now, as they are in atmosphere
River is by Simon
She moves restlessly, upset
How can it be there's a whole planet called Miranda and none of us knowed that
Because there isn't one
It's a blackrock
Uninhabitable
Terraforming didn't hold, or somesuch
Few settlers died
(to Simon) had to show them
didn't know if you were going to make me sleep
(hoarse whisper) You could've asked
10 (re: planet) Wait a tick, yeah
Some ten years back, before the war
There was call for workers to settle on Miranda, my daddy talked about going
should've recalled
But there's nothing about it on the Cortex -- History, Astronomy
it's not in there
Half of writing history is hiding the truth
There's something on this rock the Alliance doesn't want known
That's right at the edge of the Burnham Quadrant, right
() 10 81
(cont'd) Furthest planet out
(Mal nods) It's not that far from here
Whoah, no, no -- (moving to the screen) That's a bad notion -- Honey
got it, baby
Show them the bad
She hits some commands on the screen, pulls back to reveal a couple of other planets near Miranda
This is us, see
And here's Miranda
All along here, this dead space in between, that's Reaver territory
They just float out there, sending out raiding parties -- Maybe a hundred ships
And more every year
You go through that you're signing up to be a banquet
'm on board with the run and hide scenario -- and we are just about
He looks at his monitors, looks ahead
() - The ship swings around a mountain to come into view of the camp
s 82
It is a world of fire
Every building burns, some blown right apart
Bodies litter the scene, not one of them moving
There's a grounded Alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down
- We see Mal's face as the sight hits him like a gut-punch
- The crew pours out even as the ramp lowers, going off in all directions, calling out to people
Kaylee heads for the burning church
Shepherd
Shepherd Book
She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple
There is the body on the ground, face down
The child she played with at dinner
Kaylee stares, at first uncomprehending
: , moving in the other direction, approaches the cannon, Jayne behind him
He stops and sees: Book, lying by the cannon, torn up badly from the waist down
4 (to Jayne) Get the Doc
He moves to the Shepherd, grabs his searching hand
() Shepherd
Don't move
Won't go far
Shouldn't've been you
'm so sorry, it was
they should've hit us
They should've hit me
That crossed my mind
() shot him down -- seen
83
killed the ship
that killed us
Not
very Christian of me
You did what's right
(not unkindly) Coming from you, that means
almost nothing
Ah, 'm long gone
Doc'll bring you round
look to be bored by many more sermons 'fore you slip -- don't move -- Can't
order me around, boy
'm not one of your crew
Yes you are
Book coughs up blood, grabbing Mal
Urgent, almost angry
You
it's on you now
all this death, this shit
you have to find a course
This can't mean nothing
River
you have to
Come on, keep it up -- Book grabs Mal's face, talks as though replying to something: don't care what you believe
Just
believe it
Whatever you have to
His breathing becomes laboured
Hitched
Stopped
His hand slips away, his blood leaving a distinct print on Mal's face
Jayne and Simon run up,Simon slowing down -- going to the e he's-dead
----Zne -aza r
7-1, ;,,,r them as Jayne looks around him, Mal still fixed on Book
84
How come they ain't waiting
They know'd we was coming, how come they only sent one
Zoe realizes the answer, turns to Wash
Get on the Cortex
Wave the Sanchez brothers, Li Shen -- anyone whose ever sheltered us after a heist
Tell them to get out
Get out now
: - Silence
Every Cortex screen is on, each looking at a different place
Every one shows fire, destruction or the snow of an interrupted signal
Mal stands alone amidst the screens, saying nothing
After a long moment, all of the screens hitch, the images replaced by identical images of the Operative
He looks solemn
V0 'm sorry
But  cannot let you hide and  cannot let you run
Things become
extreme
And we wish for another way
Don't talk at me like a righteous man
You are a killer of children
When God wanted Pharaoh to release His people from bondage -- you know the story
He didn't ask
He sent his plagues down upon Egypt
That's me, Captain
The path to peace is paved with corpses
It's always been so
So me and mine got to lie down and --- world
85
'm not going to live there
How could you think -- there's no place for me there, any more than 40 there is for you
Malcolm, 'm a monster
What  do is evil, 've no illusions about it
But it must be done
Why
Do you know why
It's not my place to ask
You will never see River Tam
'm telling you this
Maybe not
But you'll keep her close now, and when  blow Serenity out of the air, this will be ended
You're so terribly out of your depth, Captain
Your old boat can't take the pressure
She ain't buckled yet
And the 40 only reason you're talking such a lot is you can't get a fix on us
Yes, your scrambler's code is too old for our seekers
You love that, yes
The small triumph over modernity
You really are the noble savage
Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble
But that's what's going to kill you, Malcolm
Nobility
It confuses your text, which is self-interest
And sin
Only- many--know-who still --bel i-eved- in sin just died by your hand
What do you believe in
40 86
Not a solitary thing
If that were true, you'd be nothing more than a Reaver
Something changes in Mal's expression
() But then, maybe you're not that far from -- Mal flicks a switch and every screen goes dark
- Mal comes striding out, where the crew have been gathering bodies, laying blankets over them
Get these bodies together
We got time for gravedigging
Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope V0 'em together
Five or six of 'em
want them laid out on the nose of our ship
Are you insane
What do you mean, the bodies
Kaylee,  need you to muck the reactor core, just enough to leave a trail and make it read like we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us
These people are our friends -- Kaylee, you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it
() 14 87
(cont'd) (turns from her) Jayne, you and Wash hoist up that cannon mount
Goes right on top
Piece or two of the other ship, stick it on
Any place you can tear hull without inner breach, do that too
(looking around) And we're gonna need paint
We're gonna need red paint
(getting it) Sir
Do you really mean to turn our home into an abomination so we can make a suicidal attempt at passing through Reaver space
mean to live
mean for us to live
The Alliance won't have that, so we go where they won't follow
V0 God's balls, there's no way we're going out there
And everybody (save River) is talking at once: What's the point of living if you sink to the level of a savage -- Please, we should talk this over -- ain't takin' orders from a man has lost his brainstem -- , -Mal pule-s-his- in his face, steps back, hand on his
V0 88
This is how it works
Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore, this is your port of harbour
There's a lot of fine ways to die
'm not waiting for the Alliance to choose mine
He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the Alliance fighter
Struggling to get out is the badly wounded pilot
He sees Mal coming and raises his hands in surrender
Mal shoots him in the head, turns back
() mean to confound those killers, and take my shot at getting to Miranda, maybe finding out what all 'm dying for
That's my theme now
So  hear a word out of any of you that ain't helping me out or taking your leave  will fucking shoot you
He grabs a body -- drops it at Zoe's feet as he heads toward the ship
() Get to work
- as they , flames passing over them and suddenly flickering out as dark falls
They are patches of leathered flesh stretched over bone -- monsters, screaming soundlessly in the nothing of space
We arm past them to the windows of the bridge, looking in at Mal, watching, with Zoe behind and Wash at the helm
And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the first time: It is hardly recognizable
Charred corpses on the nose, Cannon atop with a space-suited corpse draped within, long scars, welded-on parts and war paint
the trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor
It looks, for all the world, like a Reaver ship
- Mal comes down the stairs to the catwalk
He hesitates, then steps into the shuttle
i12Mo 89
- It's dark in here
Mal stands with his back to the door, no light on his face, shaking
Not crying, but overcome
Mal
He looks up: she's in the corner looking through that trunk of hers, hands on a long oilcloth wrapped around something
Didn't see you
figured that
Anything of use in there
Maybe
She puts it down and crosses to the bed
He sits by her
You don't have to stay in the shuttle, you know
There's empty rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile
You think anyone's set to sleep
Simon's portioning out overdoses of morphine, just in case
Cheerful fellow
(looking around) Did you really miss this place
(rueful smile) Sometimes
Not so much right now
beat
He doesn't look at her when he asks: Why did you leave
Site does lo9}-at-- t -m- Why didn't you ask me not to
90
Dissatisfied, Mal rises
, uh, 'd better go check on the crew
See how the inevitable mutiny is coming along
They both want to say more
They don't
He goes
- Serenity flies, silent
/ - The group make their way toward the bridge
Those close enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked -- those already on the bridge are stock still
Pressed up against the glass of the window is River, just staring
- Reverse to see: an armada
The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them
Most of them hang still in the air
Some move swimmingly about
Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around
Vd
- They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada
- And arrive, moving slowly through the ranks of ships
Serenity passes a large, bizarrely shaped ship
It turns, as though watching her
But lets her pass
Another minute, and Serenity is through the Armada, headed for the small planet just beyond
'  -  - The Operative stares blankly at the Ensign
Define "disappeared"
The Ensign just looks uncomfortable
91
:  - Kaylee, Simon and River have left the bridge
The clouds fog the windows, so nothing below is visible
Every reading 'm getting says normal
Oceans, land masses
no tectonic instability or radiation
Yeah, but no power, either
Nothing at all
Wait
Something
Might be a beacon, but it's awful weak
Find it
- As she touches down, filling the frame
After a moment Mal, Zoe and Jayne emerge from the airlock in full suits, armed
Zoe reads a handheld scanner
V0 Gravity's Earthnorm
02 levels check, pressure
if there's anything wrong the scanner isn't reading it
Mal pulls off his helmet
Breathes, looking around him
Well something sure as hell ain't right
: They're in a
Gleaming metal, spread out for miles in every direction
Portions decimated by fires long since cold, others overgrown with weeds, but mostly intact
But silent, as if trapped in amber
--ai-n-lt the settlement- 10 92
We flew over at least a dozen cities just as big
Why didn't we hear about this
A0 Beacon's up ahead
- Out of their suits now, Mal, Zoe and Jayne take point as the entire crew walks along the street, looking about them
Ho
She moves rapidly, gun out, to: : Face-down on the ground, clothes tattered
She examines it as Mal approaches, waving the others back
() No entry wound, fractures
Poison
A0 (
) Got another one
:  is by a downed hovercraft
Inside are three skeletons: two grown-ups and a small child
Clothes in better condition, and again no sign of violence
They's all just sittin'
Didn't crash
:  is quietly becoming more and more upset
:  walks in front of an office building, staying away from the cars as she hears: (
) Couple more here
0 0 orpse _of_aman is pressed up against the glass wall right behind her
Mouth open, skin dead blue, terribly skinny
a thing to haunt
14 93
(seeing it) Kaylee
Come this way
Come here
Don't -- But she looks -- GAAAAaaoh God -- -- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach
It's an office
About half the employees are there, in chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first fellow
We see  of the corpses as the gang evaluates
How come they're preserved
Place must've gone hermetic when the power blew
Sealed 'em
(very upset) What're they doing
What's everybody doing
There's no discoloration, nobody's doubled over or showing signs of pain
There's gasses that kill painless, right
But they didn't fall down
None of them
They just lay down
More than anything, it looks like starvation
Anybody want to bet there's plenty of food around
They just lay down
They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening
She drops to her knees, clutching her head
94
As she speaks we see, as she sees, : bodies
In homes, in piles: an entire world, gently dead
, make them stop, they're everywhere, every city every house every room, they're all inside me, can hear them all and they're saying nothing
, , please God make me a stone
() She's starting to damage my calm
Jayne -- She's right
Everybody's dead
This whole world is dead for no reason
Let's get to the beacon
- It's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying vehicles
At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged, is an Alliance Research Vessel
The gang makes its way towards it
- It's a mess, doors pried open, signs of violence but no bodies
The gang walks through it, looking around
River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined
She approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object
She turns it slightly -- hologram squawks to life amidst them all
First we see images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses, everywhere
We hear and then see   standing exactly where she was when she recorded this message
(As she speaks, we see angles of everyone watching, taking it in
River silently mouths every word
) ,two 95
-- just a few of the images we've recorded, and you can see it isn't
it isn't what we thought
There's been no war here, and no terraforming event
The environment is stable
It's the Pax, the -32 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors
It's
(tearing up) well it works
it was supposed to calm the population, weed out aggression
Make a peaceful
it worked
The people here stopped fighting
And then they stopped everything else
They stopped going to work, stopped breeding
talking
eating
(trying for control) There's thirty million people here and they all just let themselves die
They didn't even kill themselves
They just
most starved
When they stopped working the power grids, there were overloads, fires -- people burned to death sitting in their V0 chairs
Just sitting
There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts, gathers herself
() have to be quick
There was no one working the receptors when we landed, so we hit pretty hard
We can't leave
We can't take any of the local transports because
The bang again
() There are people
they're not people
about a tenth of a percent of the population had the opposite reaction to the Pax
Their aggressor response increased
beyond madness
They've become
() 96
(cont'd) they've killed most of us
not just killed, they've done
things
V0 () Reavers
they made them
won't live to report this, and we haven't got power to
people have to know
(loses it here) We meant it for the best
to make people safer
to
God
She whirls, grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her own head - but a Reaver is on her, knocks the gun away and bites her face -- She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting at her and tearing at her clothes, at her skin
() Turn it off
Wash does, nobody saying anything
10 Mal walks outside
- He takes a few unsteady steps away from the vessel
Inara appears behind him, follows -- he holds a hand out behind him, seemingly to make her stop, but then he grabs her shoulder, holds her for support
She puts her hand over his
seen so much death
been on fields carpeted with bodies, friends and enemies --  seen men and women blown to messes no further from me than you
Mal
But every single one of those people died on their feet
Fighting
() V0 97
(cont'd) Or, hell, running away -- doing summat to get through
This is
40 Mal,  need your help with this
need you to help me, because can't -- He looks at her, folds her into his arms
Brings her face to his, not kissing but touching, pressing into each other with the urgency of pulsing, necessary life
- River falls to her knees, vomiting
Simon goes to her, puts his hand on her back, lets her ride it out
River
'm all right
She looks at him, wet eyes full of clarity
() 'm all right
V0 Wash pulls the recording cylinder out of the console
-   - The cylinder is on the table
Mal stands at the head, looking at his crew
This report is maybe twelve years old
Parliament buried it, and it stayed buried til River dug it up
This is what they feared she knew
And they were right to fear, 'cause there's a universe of folk that are gonna know it too
(touches the cylinder) They're gonna see it
Somebody has to speak for these people
He pauses
Everyone waits
V0 98
() You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all V0 come to the same place
So now 'm asking more of you than  have before
Maybe all
'Cause as sure as  know anything  know this: They will try again
Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground, swept clean
year from now, ten, they'll swing back to the belief that they can make people
better
And  do not hold to that
So no more running
aim to misbehave
There is a beat as he eyes them all
My grandma always told me: if you can't do something smart, do something right
By way of emphasis he loudly cocks his big-ass rifle
Mal takes in the fact that Jayne has spoken for them all
That the same grandma told you 4 there was an evil dwarf spirit living in your well
() She was a fun grandma
Do we have a plan
Mr Universe
We haven't the equipment to broadwave this code, but he can put it on every screen for thirty worlds
He's pretty damn close, too
Based on our orbital trajectories, he reached optimum proximity just before our sunset
If we make a direct run within the hour we're only 67,332 miles out
At full burn we'd reach him inside of three- hours
99
She doesn't notice the reactions to her sudden clarity -- she's still somewhat in her own world
Still got the Reavers, and probably the Alliance between us and him
It's a fair bet the Alliance knows about Mr Universe
They're gonna see this coming
No
He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly
() They're not gonna see this coming
: One of Serenity's jet engines, as it  up
- Serenity is taking off, leaving the dead place behind
'  - He's talking with Mal and Wash again, very animated
It's no problem
Bring it on bring it on bring it on
From here to the eyes and ears of the 'verse, that's my motto, or it might be if  start having a motto
( ) We won't be long
You're gonna get caught in the ion cloud, it'll play merry hob with your radar, but pretty pretty lights and a few miles after you'll be right in my orbit
( ) You'll let us know if anyone else comes at you
100
to see: The Operative and ten soldiers are in the room, visible to Mr Universe but not to the screen
You'll be the first
: the Operative's sword, as he unsheathes it
- We are amongst the Reaver armada
Serenity slices quietly through the ships, as we come around and see Miranda receding in the distance
Serenity drifts through the armada -- and suddenly another ship fires up, running next to her
The two ships pace each other, another vessel coming about as though staring at Serenity, who comes closer and closer to frame, till we see the suited corpse draped on the cannon
It suddenly moves: it's Mal
He swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them
It , fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into other ships, causing two smaller ones to blow as well
Mal swings around and fires at another ship
- In close orbit waits the Alliance force, at least fifty strong, and clearly with high tech firepower
We move in on the Operative's ship, in the middle of the cluster
'  -  - As the Operative waits with the others
'm reading activity in the cloud
(into com) Lock and fire on my command
(to himself) You should have let me see her
We should have done this as men
Not with fire
Sir
,Wd 101
- It's the Operative's : the swirling Ion cloud as Serenity breaks through and heads at us, fully Reavered out
'  -  - He looks confused, then smiles at the ruse
Hits the com: Vessel in range, lock on
() Bastard's not even changing course
- As Serenity get a bit closer,    suddenly burst from the cloud, also heading straight at us
'  -  - The Operative -- and everyone around him - goes big-eyed
That's not good
() Sir
Target the Reavers
(into com) Target the Reavers
Target everyone
Somebody
- Serenity suddenly lists hard to port -- until she's almost upside down -- the Alliance ships , missing Serenity but tagging a few Reaver ships, none of whom have slowed down -- - Mal is back on the bridge as we look out at the upside down Alliance fleet, missiles just passing us -- We're too close for them to arm -- This is gonna be very tight -- 102
() Hey look, we're upside down
V0 Zoe and Mal shoot a look at Jayne
(to himself) am a leaf on the wind, watch how soar
- Serenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and weaves between dozens more
The Reaver force hits the Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding -- The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around, and an air war begins, a frenzied, balletic ecstasy of destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and parts of ships fly at and past it
: She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet before a barrelling chunk of debris -- which is twice their size -- forces them to come hard about and remain in the fray
- Mal looks out at the chaos
Chickens come home to roost
They are suddenly  by a glancing blow from another ship -- Wash struggles to control her -- () The hell -- () It's okay
am a leaf on the wind
(also panicky) What does that mean
103
- Serenity makes her way past the carnage and heads down toward the tiny satellite moon
40 '  -  - As the vessel shakes, clearly breached, The Operative moves to a door marked:
He puts his thumb to a panel and the door slides up to reveal a standing, almost formfitting one- man cockpit
'  - The Dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface
As it moves from the Operative's ship, we see that a Reaver vessel has smashed into the main viewshield, and the ship is spinning, explosions popping silently all over it
- She continues down, the metallic expanse of Mr Universe's little moon complex sprawling below them
moment after Serenity blows through frame, so does a Reaver ship
It fires an electronic pulse at Serenity and sparks fly
- 4 We're fried
got no control
- Sparks -- and arcs of electricity -- are everywhere here
Kaylee jumps back as she is electrocuted -- Simon runs in and pulls her out, slams the door shut on the erupting fires
- Where's the back up
Where's the back up
He and Wash are frantically flipping buttons -- the ship whirs to a semblance of life - - Back up reads at 20%
(to Wash)- Can you get us down
'm gonna have to glide her in
40 104
Will that work
140 Long as that landing strip is made of fluffy pillows
(on the com) Everybody to the upper decks
Strap yourselves to something
- We can see it, a long strip, which halfway along becomes a kind of hanger
Serenity arcs at it uncomfortably fast
- Wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as Zoe pulls out a seat as well, straps in
- Jayne, Simon and Inara pull harnesses not unlike "Batman the Ride" seats from the ceiling, help the others in
/
/ - -40 And Serenity  the ground -- the landing gear folds and snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going, now inside the hanger, heading towards the entrance to the facility, slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian area, so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but the body of the ship is hidden from it
- There is a moment of quiet
am a leaf on the wind
Watch -- massive harpoon  through the windshield and impales him to his chair
It's as thick around as a telephone pole
Wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead
She moves to him -- 40 105
() Wash baby baby no, come on, you gotta move you gotta move baby please -- Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile slams through the window into the wall above them
- We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start out of it
second Reaver vessel enters frame from above, about to land next to it
- The cargo bay door opens -- just the little door housed inside the ramp -- and Jayne comes out with his biggest gun
He looks up, toward the edge of the runway, but no Reavers have arrived yet
Go
The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons
Head inside
V0 /  - small double-sized doorway leads to the "Black Room", which is the entrance proper to the facility
Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the sides  the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square hole getting bigger
The hall itself is smaller than the black room, but still has the arrows on the ceiling, that point to an elevator some fifty feet away
Come on
Jayne, rearguard
Zoe slows, looking around her
Sir
(he turns to her) This is a good hold point_ We all stay together -- 44 106 No
They have to come through here; they'll bottleneck and we can thin 'em out
We get pushed ,oO back there's the blast doors
can rig 'em so they won't re- open once they close
Then shut 'em and hide til -- We need to draw them til it's done
This is the place
We'll buy you the time
(to the others) Move those crates back there for cover -- and make sure they ain't filled with anything goes boom
Wait, Wash -- where's Wash
Nobody (but River) realized he wasn't there
Zoe is dead calm
,No He ain't comin'
Everybody takes that in, Kaylee's eyes welling up
Move the gorram crates
Come on
We hear savage  from the hanger -- they're approaching
Mal moves to the door, Jayne beside him
: Reavers rush toward them
He turns to Jayne
Tell me you brought 'em this time
Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the Reavers
107
It explodes in their midst, smoke and man-parts flying about
Mal rolls his a shorter distance, then slams the door shut
: 40 Explodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a catwalk -- right in front of the door
In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the explosion
Everyone takes positions behind the crates
Zoe stands calmly, her back to the door, loading her sawed-off
(continuing; moving back to Zoe) Zoe
are you here
She looks up at him
Do the job, sir
You hold
Hold till 'm back
He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look for as long as they can
Then he's in the elevator and gone
Jayne moves over to Zoe
10 Captain's right
Can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this
You really think any of us are gonna get through this
He looks back at their army:  companion, a doctor, a mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River
beat, and he looks back at Zoe with forlorn hope: might
'  - The elevator stops and Mal makes his way to the island of screens and machines in the center of the space
The first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has been destroyed
The second: 108
:   is lying dead, eyes open, half draped on his equally still lovebot
trail of blood shows he crawled from his chair
V0 Mal comes close
Nothing
He starts to move away again and the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible whir
She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness, and a warped, computery version of Mr Universe's voice
Mal
Mal stops
() Guy killed me, Mal
He killed me with a sword
How weird is that
got
a short span here
they destroyed my equipment but  have a back-up unit
bottom of the complex, right over the generator
Hard to get to
know they missed it
They can't stop the signal, Mal
They can never stop the signal
() Okay this is painful
On many levels
'm not -- A0 She turns back, powering down
Recording over
beat, and Mal takes off
- Inara is on her knees, unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her shuttle
River is in the corner, clutching her head
can't shut them up
It's okay
- They're all made up of rage can't
as a body slams against the door
Just stay low
'm right here
109
Jayne moves past them to Zoe, takes position by her
She picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us
(calls out) Jayne and  take the first wave
Nobody shoots less they get past our fire
Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as hell
The bangs on the door continue
Oh,  didn't plan on going out like this
think we did right, but
never planned
anything just wanted to keep River safe
Spent so much time on Serenity trying to find us a home  never realized  already had
She looks at him with soft surprise
140 () My one true regret in all this is never being with you
With me
You mean to say, as, sex
() mean to say
Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the door
Hell with this
'm gonna live
Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the door
Inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth: a bow and arrow, which she pulls back with focused grace
:   starts to come off its hinges
110
'  - panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the Operative drops down, having clearly entered from a different location
He looks around, carrying a laser-pistol
He moves past Mr Universe and Lenore -- (The Operative turns) Guy killed me, Mal
,    - Mal has reached it and surveys the situation
Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the generator shaft
It's miles deep, with machines rotating and grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it
On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console sitting behind a clear plastic partition
Cables and chains run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs
Hard to get to
That's a fact
- lwi12 The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to squeeze through and charge
Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head
He arcs back hard as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward the door -- Zoe
Gorramnit
But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots, each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo
The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the precision of military training still in her as she flips him, wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame, bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open and she's rushed from behind --- But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot, moving forward himself -- () Get yer ass back in the line
voi12 She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in his neck
Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly
,    - Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the ceiling just above him
He can almost get them -- one wrong move and he pitches into the jaws of death
laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he falls, mercifully, back onto the platform
The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot as Mal gets shakily up
(in pain) Shot me in the back
haven't
made you angry, have
s There's a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now
You have no idea how true that is
There's no wise-ass attitude in him now
They stand, facing off at ten paces
() know the secret now
The truth that burned up River Tam's brain and set you after her
And the rest of the 'verse is gonna know it too
'Cause they need to
You really believe that
do
112
You willing to die for that belief
V0 am
The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover
() Of course, that ain't exactly plan He drops out his cartridge and slams another in
The Operative hides behind some machinery
Tries to peek out at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover
Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can
The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's been ruined by Mal's shot
He looks over at Mal with death in his eyes
He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another
He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies 4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform
He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward the platform from above
/  - Jayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to the barricades
Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now, squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's shirt, checks the wound
Spine's intact -- Just gimme a bandage
Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering
40 113
There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades) from the Reavers
Jayne switches weapons, tossing another to Zoe and opening fire -- A0 Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh
Cheaters
He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing
River watches, the gun limp in her hand
Kaylee grabs it and starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like projectiles
She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as Zoe shouts: Everybody fall back
Fall back
Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor
Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from each side and above and below
Then, when the hole is maybe four by four, they stop
() Jayne
Grenade
Very last one
He tosses it through the hole
Zoe doesn't even flinch from the blast as she thinks
They're gonna get in -- Can close it
from outside
No one's coming back from that
She tries to stand, fails
() How much ammo do we have
We got three full cartridges and my swingin' cod
That's all
Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come
--- 40 114
Lift isn't moving
When they come, try to plug the hole with 'em
Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her
'm starting to lose some feeling here
think there's something in them darts they throwed at me
Lie still
'm gonna give you something to counteract the -- He stands, looking around him
His bag is over by Zoe
() My bag
and
, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air
River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make
Blood spreads from Simon's belly
Inara rushes to him, grabs cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it
Keep pressure here
My bag
Need
adrenaline
and a shot of calaphar for Kaylee
can't
River
She is by his side, takes his hand
She has a kind of serenity to her, like she understands something now
() River
'm sorry
No
No
The lights go out
Everyone looks about them
Jayne fires again, but all the sound has bled out save these two
115
hate to
leave
You won't
You take care of me, Simon
You've always taken care of me
She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face an unearthly glow as she looks down at him
() My turn
She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she through the hole in the doors, then Simon  her name, the scream following us back into the Black Room where River lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers
Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets the doors closing
She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the back of the head shakes her
She weaves around a couple of Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her
The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm over her
:   , as they shut with a shuddering
,    - Mal gets up the chain to the platform
The Operative is on Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes skittering over the edge into oblivion
There is a railing here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him
They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest, knocking over tools and computer parts
The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword gracefully from the holster under his jacket
Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver
He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets inside sword range and tries for the neck with the screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword point against the edge of Mal's stomach
Starts pushing slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin
116
Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides all the way through Mal's belly
Mal's eyes go wide
You know what your sin is, Malcolm
(shaky smile) Aw hell, 'm a fan of all seven
He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword
The Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it, gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin
The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword still in his belly
() But right now
He pulls the sword out, grimacing
Holds it over the Operative
The smile gone
() vao 'm gonna have to go with Wrath
He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound
- The gang is subdued -- because they are all of them injured and Simon is slipping away
Jayne looks at Zoe
You suppose he got through
Think Mal got the word out
(almost convincingly) He got through
know he got through
117
,    - Mal goes down hard, spitting up blood
He sees the sword, moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face
Picks him lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch
'm sorry
The Operative spins him and  his bunched fingers right into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias with
Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain
The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword
Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens
() You should know there's no shame in this
You've done remarkable things
But you're fighting a war you've already lost
He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way, grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward -- while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with staggering force
Iwo Well, 'm known for that
The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back, unable to make a sound
Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we hear his arms crack
Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his sword, saying: () Piece a shrapnel tore up that nerve cluster my first tour
Had it moved
He squats down, looks the Operative in the face
118
() Sorry 'bout the throat
Expect you'd wanna say your famous last words now
Just one trouble
He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the Operative's jacket through and shoves the sword through the fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position
() ain't gonna kill you
He moves to the console, starts prepping it
() Hell, 'm gonna grant your greatest wish
He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly
It hums to life
() 'm gonna show you a world without sin
He hits "send all"
The cylinder lights up and the broadcast V0 begins
Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative
There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the street, in homes and offices
image after image, jus
t as we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind
(
0
) These are some of the first sites we scouted on Miranda
There is no one living on this planet
There is no one
Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other side
He begins to cross
Never even looks back
On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror
- :  Reaver in
Face full of fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate
And a small hand smashes that face so hard that teeth fly -- the Reaver clearing frame to reveal: 119
River
She is bloodied, but not killed
She's as she was in the bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can, ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or above -- the mob
She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors -- and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her
,    - The Operative watches the end of the broadcast
We are on his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr
Caron -- and her screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth
- The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when the elevator doors open
Mal staggers out, holding his bleeding side
Sir
140 It's done
Report
Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a report -- and the doors start to open behind her
Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons, as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to reveal River, standing alone
She is holding two Reaver blades, is bloody but unbowed
And the only one alive
We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped completely away
Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang
Drop your weapons
Drop 'em now
Do we engage
Do we engage
120
Mal and the others tense up
River turns slowly to face the soldiers, blades still gripped
soldier levels his gun at her, sweaty and frantic
others still shouting
vp
,    - The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com: (
) Targets are acquired
Do we have a kill order
Do we have an order
- :  ' ,
- We are close on a gravestone
It is rounded, looks more like a bell than a headstone
It is topped by a jar built'into the stone
The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but glass in the middle
Inside the glass we can see one of those slightly moving photos
It is of Mr Universe and his lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the stone beneath
The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone, 40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial Book
The third is Hoban Washburne
Wash
The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it instead of a picture-jar
And fixing another slip of paper to it is River
She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise
They're flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves), Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand with Kaylee
He has a crutch supporting his other side
There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing
Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown, holding a burning taper
She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to the rocket fuse
Stands back with the others
The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky
They all watch its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series of fireworks
40 121
the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads
We are close on another explosion when it becomes: :   spitting sparks
Widen to see: / - Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash came through
- We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just above the engine room, replacing wires
Some of them run to a computer screen that she checks and adjusts
/   - Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it off the top of the ship
Close on Mal as he watches it go
: - t f o And here we see the whole ship for the first time, harnessed by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all over
The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly
- Kaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his head
moment looking at him and she can't help herself - she slides her arms around his chest
- On a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with elegant precision
- Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work completely forgotten
With nothing resembling elegant precision, they sink out of frame to the floor
V0 122
beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above, looking down at them with detached curiosity
/ - It's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair equipment
The camera moves around him, skirting the ground of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground, standing watching him from some twenty feet away
Mal stops, doesn't turn
Hand near his gun
If you're here to tell me we ain't finished
then we will be real quick
The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the ship, framed by the rain behind
Do you know what an uproar you've caused
Protests, riots -- cries for a recall of the entire Parliament
() We've seen the broadwaves
You must be pleased
'Verse wakes up a spell
Won't be long 'fore she rolls right over and falls back asleep
Taint my worry
can't guarantee they won't come after you
The Parliament
They have a hundred men like me and they are not forgiving
That don't bode especially well for you
giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt
told them the Tams were no longer a threat -- damage done
() 123
(cont'd) They might listen, but
think they know 'm no longer their man
They take you down,  don't expect to grieve overmuch
Like to kill you myself,  see you again
You won't
There is
(small, grim smile) nothing left to see
Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head inside
The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops to look up at the nose of the ship
: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in the rain
() "Serenity"
You lost everything in that battle
Everything you had, everything you were
how did you go on
Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as they slide together
Glances at the Operative, unimpressed
You still standing there when the engine starts, you never will figure it out
The Operative watches the door shut
moment, and he goes
- Mal stows the gear as Zoe approaches
(to himself) What a whiner
Sir, we have a green light
Inspection's pos and we're clear for upthrust
Think she'll hold together
124
She's tore up plenty
But she'll fly true
beat between them before: Make sure everything's secure
Could be bumpy
Always is
She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs
- Mal comes in and runs into Inara
Jayne passes through as they talk, heading down into his bunk
Pays them no mind
Neither do Simon and Kaylee, in the dining room stowing supplies
We're taking her out
Should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls
Right
(moving past her) You ready to get off this heap and back to a civilized life
, uh
(he stops) don't know
He looks at her, a smile in his eyes
Good answer
He turns and heads into the bridge
- Mal eases himself into his seat
Takes a moment to adjust one of Wash's dashboard dinosaurs, then looks to his left
125
You gonna ride shotgun, help me fly
V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the screens and buttons
That's the plan
Think you can work out how to get her in the -- She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship hums to life
- Her engines fire up and tilt
She lifts gently off the ground
- Mal looks slightly, only slightly nonplussed
Okay, clearly some aptitude for the
but it ain't all buttons A0 and charts,
You know what the first rule of flying is
Well,  suppose you do, since you already know what 'm about to say
do
But  like to hear you say it
He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens, taking her up as he says: Love
You can learn all the math in the 'verse, but you take a boat in the air you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as the turning of worlds
Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells you she's hurting 'fore she keens
Makes her a home
River also looks out at the sky
126
Storm's getting worse
We'll pass through it soon enough
- As we shoot up with her through sheeting rain, towards the top of the sky
- We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out of them, comes at us, flared by the sun behind the planet as she passes us, her Firefly effect lighting up, about to shoot off into the heavens -- There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at camera, blacking out the frame
