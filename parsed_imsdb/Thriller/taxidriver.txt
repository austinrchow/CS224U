href <b>// --> </b> by Paul Schrader : "The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence
" --Thomas Wolfe, "God's Lonely Man" , age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner
On the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere, lighting up his whole face
But behind that smile, around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness and loneliness
He seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants seldom speak
The head moves, the expression changes, but the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space
Travis is now drifting in and out of the New York City night life, a dark shadow among darker shadows
Not noticed, no reason to be noticed, Travis is one with his surroundings
He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, "King Kong Company 1968-70"
He has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex, lonely sex, but sex nonetheless
He is a raw male force, driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell
Then one looks closer and sees the evitable
The clock sprig cannot be wound continually tighter
As the earth moves toward the sun, Travis Bickle moves toward violence

Weather-beaten sign above driveway reads, "Taxi Enter Here"
Yellow cabs scuttle in and out

He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette

: appear over scenes from
The snow has melted, it is spring
rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre district
5
Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis
The high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them
The unremitting  of  and  play against the dull pitter-patter of rain
The glare of yellow, red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos
"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" - so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular night's activity
Only the taxis seem to rise above the situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please
Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering
The rain also falls on the street bums and aged poor
Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners, hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks
And the taxis service them too
All through the  the exterior sounds are muted, as if coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner
The listener is at a safe but privileged distance
After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife, begins to   on one particular taxi, and it is assumed that this taxi is being driven by
: Travis's yellow taxi pulls in foreground
On left rear door are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service"
We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave
The rain has not let up
An   climbs in the right rear door, crushing her umbrella
Travis waits a moment, then pulls away from the curb with a start
Later, we see Travis' taxi speeding down the rain-slicked avenue
The action is periodically accompanied by Travis' narration
He is reading from a haphazard personal diary

On seat next to  is half-eaten cheeseburger and order of french fries
He puts his cigarette down and gulps as he answers: Why should it be grounded
Listen -  mean  just saw the needle of the Empire State Building
You can't see it for the fog
Then it's a good guess it's grounded
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it
Do you know, or don't you
What is your number, cabbie
Have you tried the telephone
(hostile, impatient) There isn't time for that
In other words, you don't know
No

Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know
Pull over right here
(points out window) Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog

An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent coffee can ash tray

The columns are straight, disciplined
Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink
The handwriting is jagged

It is unusual, to say the least: ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall
The floor is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets maps and pornography
The pornography is of the sort that looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and clothesline
There is no furniture other than the rickety chair and table
beat-up portable  rests on an upright melon crate
The red silk mass in another corner looks like a Vietnamese flag
Indecipherable words, figures, numbers are scribbled on the plain plaster walls
Ragged black wires dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung
(
) They're all animals anyway
All the animals come out at night: Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal

He lowers his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends inside
He shakes a cigarette out of his pack of camels and lights it
:  books it at garage office
Old, rotting slabs of wood are screwed to a grey crumbling concrete wall
Each available space is covered with hand- lettered signs, time schedules, check-out sheets, memos
The signs read: ' 2-3410 Promptly 9 43

half dozen haggard cabbies hang around the office
Their shirts are wrinkle, their heads dropping, the mouths incessantly chattering

Travis hands his trip sheet to a  , nods slightly, turns and walks toward the door
,  walks pleasantly down Broadway, his hands in his jacket pockets
The sidewalks are deserted, except for diligent fruit and vegetable  setting up their stalls
He takes a deep breath of fresh air, pulls a white pill from his pocket, pops it into his mouth
Travis turns a corner, keeps walking
Ahead of him is a 24- hour
The theatre, a blaze of cheap day-glow reds and yellows, is an offense to the clear, crisp morning air
The permanent lettering reads, "Adam Theatre, 16mm Sound Features"
Underneath, today's feature are hand- lettered: "Six-Day Cruise" and "Beaver Dam"
Travis stops at the box office, purchases a ticket, and walks in
Travis stands in the aisle for a moment
He turns around, walking back toward the concession stand
plain dumpy-looking  sits listlessly on a stool behind the shabby concession stand
plaster-of-Paris Venus de Milo sits atop a piece of purple velvet cloth on the counter

The  of the feature drones in the background
Kin  help ya
Travis rests his elbow on the counter, looking at the Girl
He is obviously trying to be friendly - no easy task for him
God knows he needs a friend
What is your name
My name is Travis
Awh, come off it, Pal
No, 'm serious, really
Ya want me to call da boss
Huh

No, no, it's alright

) Come here, bitch

Male Voice yields to Travis' monotone narration
(
) Twelve hours of work and  still cannot sleep
The days dwindle on forever and do not end
: The Headquarters of the "New Yorkers for Charles Palantine for President Committee", located at the corner of 50th Street and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white and blue banners, ribbons and signs
One large sign proclaims "Palantine"
Another sign reads "Register for New York Primary, July 20
"
The smiling middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the bustling pedestrians
It is
variety of   joke and chatter as they labor through stacks of papers
The room is pierced with the sound of ringing phones
Seen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them - those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well- groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields of Massachusetts and Connecticut
, about 25, an extremely attractive woman sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several stacks of papers
Her attractions, however, are more than skin deep
Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen, though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material
Simple pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men
She is, in other words, star-fucker of the highest order
Betsy, putting down the phone, calls , a lanky, amiable and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk: Tom
Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special qualities which interest Betsy
He gets nowhere with Betsy - yet he keeps trying
13
Just another of those routine office flirtations which pass the hours and free the fantasies
Tom, come here a moment
(he walks over) think this canvas report is about ready to go out
Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county
(a beat) And don't forget to add the new photo releases
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets
Should we wait for that
Andy usually just sends those to the national media
The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until  and tell them anyway
think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program
Push the issues
(as if instructing a child) First push the man, then the issue
Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man
You forgot "sexy"
No,  didn't forget "sexy"
Just didn't get around to it, huh
Oh, Tom, please
14
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling
don't know what
cars
not issues
Have you ever wondered why  News has the highest ratings
More people watch it
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious, No, c'mon, 'm listening
was just
Just what
Kidding around
you know, fun
Betsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere
With who
Alright, now
You want to know why has the highest ratings
You their news is any different from ,
It's all the same news
Same stories
Same order usually
What, you thought they had good news for people, right
You thought that's why people watched
'll tell you why people watch
Cronkite
The man
You got it
Not the news, not the issues, the man
If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it
We are selling cars, goddamn it
Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees across the street
She puts on her glasses and looks out across the street again
15
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead
That's the last
The finish
Period
Some pople can learn
Some people can't
And you wonder why we never get serious---- Sure we could run him
You realize he's already of his block association
(looks across street again) Have you been noticing anything strange
No, why
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us
What taxi driver
That taxi driver
The one that's been sitting here
How long has he been there
don't know - but it feels like a long time
Travis' cold piercingly eyes Stare out from his cab parked across the street from Palantine Headquarters
He is like a lone wolf watching the warm campfires of civilization from a distance
thin red dot glows from his cigarette
Tom exchanges Travis' gaze
(determined) Well, 'll go out and ask him
As Tom walks toward front door Betsy's eyes alternate between him and the position where Travis sits
16
Tom strides out the front door and walks briskly across the street toward Travis' taxi
Travis spots Tom walking toward him and quickly stares up his cab, then squeals off in a burst of billowing exhaust
Tom watches the speeding taxi quizzically
Travis' taxi continues down Broadway
: ' He lies on his mattress at the ceiling
He is fully clothed and appears deep in thought
Near his mattress rest several medications:  large bottle of vitamin pills, two smaller bottles of pills, a bottle of peach-flavored brandy
(
) All my life needed was a sense of direction, a sense of someplace to go
do not believe one should devote his life to morbid self- attention, but should become a person like other people
- Travis' taxi is driving down Broadway with the "Off Duty" sign on
down Broadway
stops at Palantine Campaign Headquarters
few  remain in the office
Betsy's desk is vacant
- with crowded mass of  as they ooze through the sidewalks toward their various destination
Individuals are indiscernible: It is simply a congested mass
(
) first saw her at Palantine Campaign Headquarters at 58th and Broadway
She was wearing a yellow dress, answering the phone at her desk
17
Suddenly: Cut of the congested human mass, , appears the slender figure of  in a stylish yellow dress
The crowd parts like the Red Sea, and there she is: Walking all alone, untouched by the crowd, suspended in space and time
(
)() She appeared like an angel out of this open sewer
Out of this filthy mass
She is alone: They cannot touch her
' He is at the table, writing in his diary
- His stubby pencil rests on the word "her"
: It is 3:30    in a bacon-shaped all night The thick smell hangs in the air - fried grease, smoke, sweat, regurgitated wine
Whatever doesn't flush away in New York at night turns up in places like this
burly grease-stained  stands over the grill
shuffles from one side of the door to another
Slouched over the small four-person formica tables are several -  (too well-dressed for this time and place), a cluster of   and a lost who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last possession
The restaurant, brightly lit, perfectly conveys the image urban plasticity - without the slightest hint of an accompanying cleanliness
Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies: , a worn man about fifty, -, younger family man, , fourtyish Black
Wizard is telling Dough-Boy a story
Charlie
, his elbows popped against table top, is not listening
He stares silently down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing Forum
His eyes may not be open
First she did her make-up
You know,  hate it when they do that
mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge
18
- Not rouge
Blush-On, they call it
The kind with a brush
Travis appears at the door
He has to push aside the to enter without making physical contact - something Travis would not relish
He may be repulsed with these people and this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his feelings rise to the surface
Wizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave
Travis
Hey Wizard
Travis straddles a seat at the table
Dough-Boy gives Travis something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying: - Yeah, that's Blush-On
My wife uses it, (ironic) Ask Travis
He's the ladies man
Travis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee
(continuing) Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it
And then the spray perfume
You know, the real sweat kind - and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri- boro bridge - she changes her pantyhose
- No
Travis turns his head
He appears not to be interested, but is
Yeah
- Could you see anything
19
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know
But it was pretty obvious what she was doing
mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still
- What did you do
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - What do you think
(they laugh) What do  have to do
Draw you a picture
- Yeah
What was  supposed to do
was watching in the rear view
You know, just checkin' traffic
(to Travis) So howsit
(w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up
Just heard it on the radio
- Stick up
brings Travis' coffee and a glass of water
He asks for a cheeseburger
Sure
What do you think
She wanted to get out of the cab
said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge
" - You said that
Well,  said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge
" 20
- And what happened
Travis awaits Wizard's answer
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do
but she stiffed me real skunk
- real skunk
Wizard realizes Travis and Dough-Boy may not have met
(paternal) Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie Charlie
nods sleepily
Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy
- Yeah
We went to Harvard together
(laughs) We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars
He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey
- Look who's talking
(gestures around table) Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour
Travis sips his coffee
Charlie
's eyelids slip shut
(to Travis) So howsit
(w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up
Just heard it on the radio
- Stick up
21
No, just some crazy fucker
Cut have his ear off
- Where
In the jungle
122nd
Travis' eyes turn toward the restaurant's other patrons
:    sitting at a table
One , stoned, stares straight ahead
raggedly attractive rest her head on the shoulder of the other, a heavily bearded   with a headband
They kiss and tease each other, momentarily lost in their separate world
Travis watches the hippie couple closely, his feeling sharply divided between cultural contempt and morose jealousy
Why should these people enjoy the love and intimacy that has always eluded him
He must enjoy these schizoid emotions, because his eyes dwell on the couple
- (changing the subject) You run all over town, don't you, Travis
(referring to 122nd St
) Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is
Travis turns back to his companions
Huh
- mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh
(catching on) have
- You carry a piece
You need one
Nah
(a beat) suppose not
22
Waitress slaps down smudge-marked glass of water, and a cheeseburger plate that looks more like a shrunken head on a serving platter
- Well, you ever need one,  know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal
Lotsa shit around
The cops and company raise hell they find out
Travis drops two Alka-Seltzer into his glass of water
- Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand
But this guy don't deal no shit
Just quality
If you ever need anything,  can put you in touch
For a fee
- For a fee
never use mine
But it's a good thing to have
Just as a threat
- (getting up) well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of hares outside
And 'm gonna hustle 'em
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy
- Support my kids
Can you dig it
(pause) nice to meet ya, Travis
So long, Wizard
Say hello to Malcolm  for me
(nods to Charlie
) Charlie
remains unmoved: He is sleeping
23
Dough-Boy exits
Travis smiles perfunctorily, then looks back at Wizard
They really don't have much to talk about, and the Wizard doesn't care to manufacture any more conversations
Travis scans the greasy spoon: The scene is unchanged
: - Traffic passes
Tom and Betsy are talking
She takes out a cigarette
He takes out matches to light it
Try holding the match like this
This is gotta be a game, right
(putting on glasses) This  gotta see
(burning fingers) Ouch
(giggling) Oh, are you all right
'm great
Always set my fingers on fire
If you want to see another trick
do this thing with my nose
No
just wanted to see if you could light it that way
The guy at the newsstand can
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr
Asbestos
He happens to be missing fingers first noticed when - 24
Is he Italian
No, why
You sure he's not Italian
He's Black,
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off
Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something
As  said, he isn't Italian
Besides,  thought they just killed them
Don't be naive
They can't kill everybody
They have different punishments for different things
Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body
It's symbolic
Why don't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary
don't know
Maybe they don't leave a canary
Don't be technical
What 'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief
First, he's not Italian
Second he's not a thief
noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change
Two of his fingers are missing
Just stubs
Like they were blown away
was putting my change in my purse when saw him get out a cigarette couldn't help watching
was dying to see how he'd light it
25
With the other hand, right
No, stupid
With the stubs
That's the whole point
know that guy
His hand looks like a paw
An old Black guy, the newsstand at - No, this is young - well, 'm never sure how old Black people are - but, anyway, he isn't old
That's for sure
Show me how he did that again
Travis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the Palantine Headquarters
He s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed
Under his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league tie
He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in
Watching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive
His deformities are psychological, not physical
He believes he is cursed, and therefore he is
Travis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward Betsy's desk
Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis ignores him
(at Betsy's desk) want to volunteer
As the  examines Travis' face more closely, one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient diet
(at Betsy's desk) If you'll come this way
Travis elbows Tom off
26
(to Betsy) No
want to volunteer to you
(under his voice) Bets
waves  off with a short gesture, indicating everything is
He walks away
(curious) And why is that
is on his best behavior
He smiles slightly: Because you are the most beautiful woman  have ever seen
is momentarily taken back, but pleased
' presence has a definite sexual charge
He has those star qualities  looks for: She senses there is something special about the young man who stands before her
And then, too, there is that disarming smile
He is, as Betsy would say, "fascinating"
(smiling) Is that so
(pause) But what do you think of Charles Palantine
(his mind elsewhere) Who mam
Charles Palantine
The man you want to volunteer to help elect president
Oh,  think he's a wonderful man
Make a great, great President
You want to canvass
Yes, mam
27
Betsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way: How do you feel about Senator Palantine's stand on welfare
This takes  back a bit
He obviously doesn't have the slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever
thinks a moment, then improvises an answer: Welfare, mam
think the Senator's right
People should work for a living
do
like to work
Every day
Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change
Betsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly Palantine's position on welfare
She remain intrigued by Travis
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed
You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging
'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker
(gesturing) if you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something
If you don't mind, mam, 'd rather work for you
Well, we're all working tonight
Well, Betsy mam,  drive a taxi at night
28
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do
(bolstering courage) If you don't mind, mam, 'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me
Betsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis
She is curious, intrigued, tantalized
Like a moth, she draws closer to the flame
Why
Well, Betsy mam,  drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day
And  watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and  say to myself, that's a lonely girl
She needs a friend
And 'm gonna be her friend
(smiles) Travis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows
It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm unknown even to himself
Betsy is completely disarmed
don't know
It's just to the corner, mam
In broad daytime
Nothing can happen
'll be there to protect you
(smiles) All right
(relents) All right
'm taking a break at four o'clock
If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie
Oh,  appreciate that, Betsy mam
'll be here at four o'clock exactly
(pause) And
ah
Betsy
29
Yes
My name is Travis
Thank you, Travis
Travis nods, turns and exits
Tom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo- standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy
His manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was doing
Betsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and says: 'm just going to find out what the cabbies are thinking
: Travis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the Palantine Headquarters
He checks his watch
(
) April 26, 1972
Four o'clock p
m took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee Shop on Broadway
Travis and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York Coffee Shop
They both have been served coffee; Travis is nervously turning his cup around in his hands
As Travis speaks
,  brings their orders: Apple pie for , fruit compote for
(
) had black coffee and apple pie with a slice of melted yellow cheese
think that was a good selection
Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish
She could have had anything she wanted
Betsy's conversation interrupts Travis'
: 30
We've signed up 15
000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far
The organizational problems are becoming just staggering
know what you mean
've got the same problems
just can't get things organized
Little things, mean
Like my room, my possessions
should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days 'm Gonna Organezizied"
Travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation, than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin
The very sight of it makes one's heart proud
Betsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin
Travis' contagious, quicksilver moods cause: (laughing) Travis,  never ever met anybody like you before
can believe that
Where do you live
(evasive) Oh, uptown
You know
Some joint
It ain't much
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night
had a regular job for a while, days
You know, doin' this, doin' that
But  didn't have anything to do at night
got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around
So decided to works nights
It ain't good to be alone, you know
After this job, 'm looking forward to being alone for a while
31
Yeah, well
(a beat) In a cab you get to meet people
You meet lotsa people
It's good for you
What kind of people
Just people people, you know
Just people
(a beat) Had a dead man once
Really
He'd been shot
didn't know that
He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out
What did you do
shot the meter off, for one thing
knew  wasn't goimg to get paid
Then  dropped him off at the cop shop
They took him
That's really something
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab
Especially when the moon's out
The moon
The full moon
One night  had three or four weirdoes in a row and looked up and, sure enough, there it was - the full moon
Betsy laughs
Travis continues: 32
Oh, yeah
People will do anything in front of a taxi driver
mean anything
People too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you
(a bitterness emerges) It's like you're not even there, not even a person
Nobody knows you
Betsy cuts Travis' bitterness short: Com'on, Travis
It's not that bad
take lots of taxis
know
could have picked you up
Huh
Late one night
About three
At the plaza
Three in the morning
don't think so
have to go to bed early work days
It must have been somebody else
No
It was you
You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks
Betsy, realizing Travis remembers her precisely, scrambles for a polite rationale for her behavior: You're right
Now  remember
It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late
The next day was completely bushed
It was unbelievable
If it wasn't for a drunk  would have picked you up
He wanted to go to the
33
The
South Bronx
The worst
tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so  had to take him
That's the law
Otherwise  would have picked you up
That would have been quite a coincidence
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare
People have patterns
They do more or less the same things every day
can tell
Well,  don't go to the Plaza every night
didn't mean you
But just ordinary people
guy  know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way
They got to talking
She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up
That's very romantic
Some of your fares must be interesting
See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet
Well, no
not really
had some famous people in the cab
(remembering) got this guy who makes lasers
Not regular lasers, not the big kind
Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know
Like a ray gun
Zap
(laughs) What hours do you work
34
work a single, which means there's no replacement - no second man on the cab
Six to six, sometimes eight
Seventy-two hours a week
(amazed) You mean you work seventy-two hours a week
Sometimes 76 or 80
Sometimes squeeze a few more hours in the morning
Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night
You must be rich
(big affectionate smile) it keeps ya busy
You know what you remind me of
What
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly ficition, a walking contradiction"
(smiles) 'm no pusher, Betsy
Honest never have pushed
didn't mean that, Travis
Just the part about the contradiction
(more at ease) Oh
Who was that again
The singer
35
Yeah
Yes
don't follow music too much
(slowly) Kris Kristofferson
Travis looks at Betsy intently and they exchange smiles
: Travis is walking confusedly around  ' at , obviously unable to locate what he desires
Travis is lost among the hip, young intellectual type that populate the store
He watches the stylish, attractive female help, unable to come right out and requests what he desires
young  sees his plight, walks over and asks if he needs any help
Travis  says a name to her, although the name is obviously Kris Kristofferson
The Salesgirl digs out Kristofferson's "Silver-Tongued Devil" album for him
Travis says something additional to the Salesgirl and she goes off to gift-wrap the album
Travis emerges from the  , the brightly gift- wrapped album proudly tucked under his arm
: lengthy   from Travis' vantage point behind the wheel
We see the city as Travis sees it
The front windshield is a little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right screen
The intercom crackles with  and
The light turns green; we take off with a start
short first gear - quick shift - a long second gear
The cab eases to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares
Our eyes scan the long lines of
The regular - bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies - they mean nothing now
They only blend into the sidewalks and lighted storefronts
Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head
36
In the next block there are perhaps three, four fares - quick gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply - check the action
The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let the next guy pick them up
Let the second go also, the third - there's a live fare
Middle-aged  : Short fare to the East Side, good tip
We pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in
It is a long wait - a Black   crosses in front of the cab
We focus on (as Travis would) a   embracing in the distance
As we travel, we hear Travis' random thoughts about selecting fares and tips: (
) You work at night, you get an instinct
You can smell them
The big tippers, the stiffs, the trouble makers
Quarter is good tip for Manhattan
Queens is better, Brooklyn is best
go for the guys with suitcases
The rich are the worst tippers, hooks are lousy
Spooks are okay, but they don't live at Park Ave after all
The meter is activated: $
60 registers
Tick, tick, tick quick glance shows the woman is now seated
She says softly, "192 East 89"
We take off with another jolt
Cross back up 9th Ave, then cut through the park
We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string together
Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back again
The meter is up $
90
It'll be a $1
40 fare
Now through the park and we're almost there
Check the numbers - 134 - 140
End of the block
Fare=$1
40
Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills
Two quarters and a dime change
Tip'll be either
25 or
35
The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip
Good lady
We take off again with a jolt
This is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen instantaneous decisions a minute
Are these people, are these objects
'  speed down darkened street
Travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza
37
(
) called Betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow
That's my day off
At first she hesitated, but called her again and she agreed
(pause) Betsy
Betsy what
forgot to ask her last name again
Damn
've got to remember stuff like that
Travis' thoughts are with Betsy, as   enter Travis' cab
He activates the meter and pulls off
' St
Regis Hotel
Travis checks the mirror
Scanning across the back seat, he recognizes the middle passenger
It is  , candidate for President
He must have left the Hotel shortly after
Tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks deferentially to Palantine: It's 12:30 now
You'll have fifteen minutes before the actual luncheon begins
Palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an earlier conversation
don't think we have to worry about anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from California
Travis recognizes his passenger
He puts out his cigarette
(interrupting) Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate
(only mildly irritated) Yes  am
38
Well, 'm one of your biggest supporters
tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you
(pleased; glances to check Travis' license) Why, thank you Travis
'm sure you'll win, sir
Everybody know is going to vote for you
(a beat) was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy
(pleasant) 'll tell you, Travis, 've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors
(joking) And in some other places too
Palantine, his Assistant and Tom all laugh
Palantine, quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to Travis: Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most
don't know, sir
don't follow political issues much
There must be something
(thinks) Well, he should clean up this city here
It's full of filth and scum
Scum and filth
It's like an open sewer
can hardly take it
() 39
(') Some days  go out and smell it then  get headaches that just stay and never go away
We need a President that would clean up this whole mess
Flush it out
Palantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in his tracks
He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries to give it some meaning
(after a pause) know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy
We're going to have to make some radical changes
(turning the wheel) Damn straight
' taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel
and  get out of the cab
stays in back seat a moment to pay
looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods goodbye to
Nice talking to you, Travis
(calling back) Thank you, sir
You're a good man, sir
Travis' taxi departs
and  walk up carpet to the St
Regis
on  as he stops, turns back and watches Travis' departing taxi
turns back and ascends the hotel steps with his 40
- , dressed to the teeth, walks brightly down the sidewalk
His face is frehsly shaved, his hair combed, his tie straightened
He pauses in a store window to check his appearance
Under his arm he carries the gift-wrapped Kristofferson record album
, smartly dressed, waves goodbye to another and walks out the door to greet him
,  and  are walking down Broadway toward Times Square
does not let their bodies touch as they walk although  contemplates edging closer to her
Betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record - or, rather, Travis' sentiment behind giving it
Travis looks around himself with pride: This is a moment in his life - one of the few
You didn't have to spend your money -
(interrupting) He'll, what else can  do with it all
Betsy notices that the seal on the record has not been broken
Travis, you haven't even played the record
(evasive) Yeah, well my stereo player is broke
But 'm sure the record is
Your stereo broke
God,  could hardly stand that
live on music
41
don't follow music much
'd like to though
(second thought) Honest
(pointing to album) So you haven't heard this record yet
No
(sly smile) thought maybe you could play it for me on your player
Betsy's face backtracks a bit
Maybe she was wrong to go out with this fellow she doesn't know
She makes a polite laugh
Travis and Betsy are in  , turning the corner from Broadway to 42nd Street
Travis carries the album under his arm
They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual"
The box office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with explicit publicity stills
Offending portions have been blocked out with black tape
Travis steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets
Betsy, befuddled, watches him
She doesn't know what to say
Travis returns with the tickets
Betsy still has not fully comprehended what is happening: What are you doing
(innocent) bought a couple of tickets
But this is a porno movie
No, these are the kind that couples go to
They're not like the other movies
All kinds of couples go
Honest
've seen them
42
Travis seems confused
He is so much part of his own world, he fails to comprehend another's world
Compared to the movies he sees, this is respectable
But then there's also something that Travis could not even acknowledge, much less admit: That he really wants to get this pure white girl into that dark porno theatre
Travis makes an awkward gesture to escort Betsy into the theatre
Betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at Travis
She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the turnstile
She thinks to herself: "What the Hell
What can happen
" She's always been curious about these pictures anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent - she's been raised not to offend her date
perverse logic which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like these
Travis escorts Betsy to an empty center row
Travis was right
Couples do go to films like this
There are at least six or seven other  with their bewigged ""
Travis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch
Betsy looks curiously from side to side
, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in a happy marriage
Subtitles translate her words
Then, without warning, there is a direct  to a couple copulating on a sterile table-like bed
Travis watches intently
The color, however, is slowly draining from Betsy's cheeks
One thought fills her mind: "What am  doing here
" (to himself) Damn
What's wrong
forgot to get the Coca-Cola
That does it
Betsy just looks at him for a moment, then gets up and starts to leave
Travis, confused, hustles after her
He follows her out of the theatre
43
Travis catches up with her
Where are you going
'm leaving
What do you mean
Betsy looks at Travis, trying to understand him: These are not the kind of movies go to
Well,  don't follow movies too much
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to
The   watches expressionlessly from the booth
This is sort of high class
mean porno movies
(hesitant) Well
mostly
My God
We can go to another movie if you like,  don't care
got money
There's plenty
Travis gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees, but is interrupted by Betsy: If you just wanted to fuck, why didn't you just come right out and say it
44
Travis is flabbergasted by Betsy's blunt language
His arm still gestures toward the marquees, his lips continue to move, but words do not come out
Unable to respond to Betsy's question, Travis picks up where he left off: there's plenty of movies around here
haven't seen any of them, but 'm sure they're good
No, Travis
You're a sweet guy and all that, but  think this is it
'm going home
(interrupting) You mean you don't want to go to a movie
(a beat) There's plenty of movies around here
No,  don't feel so good
We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all
(puzzled) Huh
It's very simple
You go your way, 'll go mine
Thanks anyway, Travis
But
Betsy
'm getting a taxi
She walks to the curb
(following her) What about the record
Keep it
Can  call you
45
Betsy looks for a cab
(tender) Please, Betsy,  bought it for you
Betsy looks at his sad, sweet face and relents a bit
All right, 'll accept the record
Betsy accepts the record, but quickly turns and hails a taxi
Taxi
taxi quickly pulls up
Travis feebly protests to no one in particular: But  got a taxi
Betsy gives instructions to  , looks briefly back at Travis, then straight ahead
Taxi speeds off
Travis looks around helplessly:  cluster of  on the crowded street has stopped to watch the argument
Travis looks back at the woman in the porno theatre box office who has also been following the argument
: ' Travis is sitting at the table
There are some new items on the table: His giant econo-sized bottle of vitamins, a giant econo-sized bottle of aspirins, a pint of apricot brandy, a partial loaf of cheap white bread
On the wall behind the table hang two more items:  gag sign reading "One of These Days 'm Gonna Get Organezizied" and an orange-and-black bumper sticker for Charles Palantine
(
) May 8, 1972
My life has taken another turn again
The days move along with regularity
of notebook: Travis is no longer sitting at the desk
The pencil rests on the open notebook
46
:  has pulled his straight-backed chair around and is watching his small portable , which rests on the upright melon crate
cereal bowl partially filled with milk rests in his lap
Travis pours a couple shots of the apricot brandy into the bowl, dips folded chunks of white bread into the mixture, and eats them
Travis is watching early evening
background Charles Palantine is being interviewed somewhere on the campaign trail
(
)() one day indistinguishable from the next, a long continuous chain, then suddenly - there is a change
Betsy is walking down a midtown street when Travis suddenly appears before her
He has been waiting
Travis tries to make conversation but she doesn't listen
She motions for him to go away and keeps on walking
Travis, protesting, follows
: - Travis speaks intensely into a wall pay phone
(
) tried to call her several times
We hear Travis' Voice on the phone
(smoking a cigarette) you feeling better
You said you didn't feel so good
(
) But after the first call, she would no longer come to the phone
Travis holds the receiver in his hand
The other party has hung up
across interior lower wall of '
Against the stark wall there is a row of wilted and dying floral arrangements
Each one of the four or five bouquets is progressively more wilted than the one closer to the door
They have been returned
47
(
) also sent flowers with no luck should not dwell on such things, but set them behind me
The smell of the flowers only made me sicker
The headaches got worse  think 've got stomach cancer
should not complain so
"You're only as healthy as you feel
" drama is acted out at  : Travis, groggy and red-eyed from lack of sleep, walks into the campaign headquarters about
Betsy is standing near the rear of the office; she ducks from sight when she sees Travis enter
Travis' path is cut short by Tom's large-framed body
There is no live sound
(
) realize now how much she is like the others, so cold and distant
Many people are like that
They're like a union
Travis tries to push his way past Tom but Tom grabs him
Travis says something sharply to Tom and the two scuffle
Tom, by far the taller and stronger, quickly overcomes Travis, wrenching his arm behind his back
Travis kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door
Travis' efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby Travis quiets down and walks off
: Travis is again making his way through the garish urban night
He stops for a  on
middle-aging professorial executive
: His face is expressionless
The  makes himself comfortable in the back seat
Jackson Heights
Travis has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights and coming back with a fare
48
'm off duty
You mean you don't want to go out to Jackson Heights
No, 'm off duty
Then how come your "Off Duty" light wasn't on
switches on the "Off Duty" light
It was on
(gesturing toward top of taxi) it just takes a while to warm up
Like a
doesn't budge
curses to himself and exits cab
Travis takes off
as Travis' eyes dwell on the young   coming out of a East Side movie house
,  pulls over for a young (mid- twenties)  wearing a leather sports jacket
eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror
471 Central Park West
' taxi speeds off
, ' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of Central Park West
Travis checks apartment numbers
Just pull over to the curb a moment
turns the wheel
Yeah, that's fine
Just sit here
49
waits impassively
The motor ticks away
After a long pause, the  speaks: Cabbie, ya see that light up there on the seventh floor, three windows from this side of the building
on 417 Central Park West:   to the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right
(
) Yeah
young  wearing a slip crosses in front of the light
(
) Ya see that woman there
(
) Yeah
(
) That's my wife
(a beat) But it ain't my apartment
(a beat) nigger lives there
(a beat) She left me two weeks ago
It took me this long to find out where she went
(a beat) 'm gonna kill her
' face: it is devoid of expression
What do you think of that, cabbie
's face: it is gaunt, drained of blood, full of fear and anger
Travis does not respond
Huh
(a beat) What do you think of that, huh
Travis shrugs, gesturing toward meter
50
'm gonna kill her with a
44 Magnum pistol
returns to
Woman is standing in the light
(
) Did you ever see what a
44 can do to a woman's face, cabbie
(pause) Did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy, cabbie
Travis says nothing
(
) 'm going to put it right up to her, cabbie
Right in her, cabbie
You must think 'm real sick, huh
real pervert
Sitting here and talking about a woman's pussy and a 44, huh
on Travis' face: He is watching the woman in the seventh floor window with complete and total absorption
It's the same glazed-over stare we saw in his eyes as he watched the porno movie
: - Travis stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans, western shirt and army jacket
He pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews
An "Off Duty" taxi pulls up to the curb
Travis gets in
Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel and greets Travis as he enters
- Hey Travis
This here's Easy Andy
He's a travelling salesman
In the back seat, beside Travis, sits , an attractive young man about 29
He wears a pin-striped suit, white shirt and floral tie
His hair is modishly long
51
Hello Travis
Travis nods as the taxi speeds off
Dough-Boy slows down near an economy hotel
Not a flop house, but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the privacy of their rooms
This is fine, Dough-Boy (to Travis) Pay Dough-Boy here
Travis pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to Dough-Boy
20 bucks
- (takes bill) Yeah
Hey thanks
That's real nice, Travis
Travis and Andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel
Dough-Boy pulls away
As they enter the hotel, they pass a , stoned out and spread-eagled across the hood of a derelict old blue dodge
Travis follows Andy up the worn carpeted stairs and down the hallway
Andy unlocks the door to one of the rooms
The   is barren and clean; there's no sign anyone is staying in it
The fire escape is appropriately near
Andy locks the door behind them, steps over to the closet, unlocks it and pulls out two grey Samsonite suitcases - the kind you can drive a truck over
Dough-Boy probably told you  don't carry any Saturday Night Specials or crap like that
It's all out of State, clean, brand new, top-of- the-line stuff
Andy places the suitcases on the white bedspread
The suitcases are equipped with special locks, which he quickly opens
52
Andy opens the suitcases: Stacked in grey packing foam are rows and rows of brand new hand guns
You got a
44 Magnum
That's an expensive gun
got money
Andy unzips a cowhide leather pouch to reveal a
44 Magnum pistol
He holds it gingerly, as if it were a precious treasure
Andy opens the chambers and cradles the long eight-inch barrel in his palm
The
44 is a huge, oversize inhuman gun
(admiringly) It's a monster
Can stop a car -- put a bullet right into the block
premium high resale gun
$350 -- that's only a hundred over list
Easy Andy is a later version of the fast-talking, good- looking kid in college who was always making money on one scheme or another
In high school he sold lottery tickets, in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand guns
Andy holds the Magnum out for Travis' inspection
There's a worshipful  of the
44 Magnum
It is a monster
Travis hefts the huge gun
It seems out of place in his hand
It is built on Michelangelo's scale
The Magnum belongs in the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver
Travis hands the gun back to Andy
could sell this gun in Harlem for $500 today - but  just deal high quality goods to high quality people
(pause) Now this may be a little big for practical use, in which case 'd recommend the
38 Smith and Wesson Special
Fine solid gun - nickel plated
Snub-nosed, otherwise the same as the service revolver
Now that'll stop anything that moves and it's handy, flexible
() 53
(') The Magnum, you know, that's only if you want to splatter it against the wall
The movies have driven up the price of the Magnum anyway
Everybody wants them now
But the Wesson
38 - only $250 - and worth every dime of it
(he hefts the
38) Throw in a holster for $10
Travis hefts the nickel-plated
38, points it out the window
(') Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on
Nothing beats quality
(pause) You interested in an automatic
want a
32
Revolver
And a palm gun
That
22 there
That's the Colt
25 - a fine little gun
Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil
Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere
'll throw it in for another $125
Travis holds the
32 Revolver, hefts it, slips it under his belt and pulls his shirt over it
He turns from side to side, to see how it rides in his waist
How much for everything
The
32's $150 - and you're really getting a good deal now - and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty-five for four pieces and a holster
He'll, 'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal - a good one
How much to get a permit to carry
54
Well, you're talking big money now
'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out
The way things are going now $5
000 is probably low
You see,  try not to fool with the small-time crap
Too risky, too little bread
Say 6 's, but if get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building
Nah, this'll be fine
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit - so why bother
Is there a firing range around
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card
They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle
Travis pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills and counts off eight
You in Nam
Can't help but notice your jacket
(looking up) Huh
Vietnam
saw it on your jacket
Where were you
Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there
Travis hands Andy the bills
Andy counts them and gives Travis a twenty and five
Yeah
was all around
One hospital, then the next
55
(through counting) It's he'll out there all right real shit-eatin' war
'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns
The market's flooded
Colt automatics are all over
(pockets the money) (intensely) They'd never get me to go back
They'd have to shoot me first
(pause) You got anything to carry these in
(gestures to pistols) Travis is like a light switch: For long periods he goes along dark and silent, saying nothing; then suddenly, the current is turned on and the air is filled with the electricity of his personality
Travis' inner intensity sets Andy back a bit, but he quickly recovers

Too much sitting has ruined my body
Twenty-five push-ups each morning, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred knee-bends

Travis, still bareback, passes his stiff arm through the flame of a gas burner without flinching a muscle
(
) Total organization is necessary
Every muscle must be tight
The   of rapid-fire pistol shots fills the musty air of the firing range
The walls are heavily soundproofed, and sawdust is spread over the floor
Travis stands rock solid, firing the
44 Magnum at an arm's length
With each blasting discharge from the Magnum, Travis' body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each recoil from the giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity
Travis fires the Magnum as quickly as he can re-set, re-aim and re-fire
The Magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks up the
38 Special and begins firing as soon as he can aim
After the
38, comes the
25: It is as if he were in a contest to see how quickly he can fire the pistols
After all the guns are discharged, he begins reloading them without a moment's hesitation
Downrange, the red and white targets have the black outline of a human figure drawn over them
The contour-man convulses under the steady barrage of Travis' rapid-fire shots

Out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc jockey blather
He is the complete asshole;  don't know who is currently performing this function in New York, but in Los Angeles his name is Real Don Steele
Freshingly, fantastic, freaked-out dance time
Can you dig it
Dig on it

He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his inner forearm, whereby the Colt

He has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden
He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly
He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide all the handguns he wishes to carry

(shy) Hello
You looking for some action
Well
guess so
(eyeing him) All right
(a beat) You see that guy over there
(nods) His name is Sport
Go talk to him
'll wait here
Travis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport, standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket
Travis walks toward him
Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a black pimp
His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snapping
He sings to him self, "Going to the chapel, gonna get married
" His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and venal
He could only seem romantic to a confused underaged runaway
You name Sport
Sport immediately takes Travis for an undercover cop
He extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed
Here, officer, take me in
'm clean
didn't do it
Got a ticket once in Jersey
That's all
Honest, officer
Your name Sport
Anything you say, officer

freezes, not saying anything
He turns back toward 'm no cop
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already

Funny, you don't look hip
(laughs) walks back to
motions for  to follow her and he does
and  turn the corner and walk about a block, saying nothing
turns into a darkened doorway and follows her
At the top of the dark stairs  and  enter a dimly lit hallway
On either side are doors with apartment numbers
turns toward the first door, No

This is my room

At the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge
His face is obscured by shadow
is about to enter the room when the   speaks up: Hey cowboy
turns his head toward the   who has stood up and is advancing toward him
(motioning to ' jacket) The rod
(a beat) Gimme the rod, cowboy
hesitates a moment, uncertain what to do
The reaches in ' jacket and pulls out the

This ain't Dodge City, cowboy
You don't need no piece

enters No

looks around ' room: although dimly lit, the room is brightly decorated
There is an orange shag carpet, deep brown walls and an old red velvet sofa
On the walls are posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda
Neil Young album is playing on a small phonograph
This is where  lives: it bears the individual touch of a young girl
lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places it in an ashtray on the bedstand
Why you hang around with them greasers
girl needs protection
Yeah
From the likes of them
(shrugs) It's your time mister
Fifteen minutes ain't long
(gestures to cigarette) That cigarette burns out, your time is up

sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and coat
She takes off her blue-tinted sunglasses--her last defense
Without the paraphernalia of adulthood, Iris looks like a little girl she is
About 14, 15
What's your name
Easy
That ain't much of a name
It's easy to remember
Easy Lay
What's your real name
don't like my real name
(insistent) What's your real name
Iris
That's a nice name
That's what you think
unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic breasts -- two young doves hiding from a winter wind
is unnerved by her partial nudity
Don't you remember me
Button your shirt
buttons only the bottom button of her shirt
(examining him) Why
Who are you
drive a taxi
You tried to get away one night
Remember
84
No
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you
don't remember
It don't matter
'm gonna get you outta here
(looks toward door) We better make it, or Sport'll get mad
How do you want to make it
(pressured) don't want to make it
came here to get you out
You want to make it like this
(goes for his fly) pushes her hand away
He sits beside her on the edge of the bed
(taking her by the shoulders) Can't you listen to me
Don't you want to get out of here
Why should  want to get out of here
This is where  live
(exasperated) But you're the one that wanted to get away
You're the one that came into my cab
musta been stoned
Do they drug you
85
(reproving) Oh, come off it, man
tries to unzip ' fly
This only unnerves more: sexual contact is something he's never really confronted
Listen
Don't you want to make it
(a beat) Can't you make it

He bats her hand away

is getting increasingly panicked, but  only thinks this is part of his particular thing and tries to overcome it
(catching on) You can't make it, can you

lowers her head to go down on
, seeing this, jumps up in panic
stands several feet from
His fly is still open, and the white of his underwear shows through his jeans
He is starting to come apart
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
(confused) You can do it in my mouth
Don't you understand anything
says nothing
After a moment,  again sits on the bed beside
She no longer tries to make him
86
There is a moment of silence
puts her arm around his shoulder
You don't have to make it, mister
rests a moment, collecting himself
Finally, he says: (slowly) Do you understand why  came here
think so
tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away
Don't you want to go
can leave anytime  want
But that one night
was stoned
That's why they stopped me
When 'm not stoned, got no place else to go
They just protect me from myself
There is a pause
smiles and shrugs apologetically
looks at Iris' cigarette
It's burning down to the butt
Well,  tried
(compassionate) understand, mister
It means something, really
(getting up) Can  see you again
That's not hard to do
No,  mean really
This is nothing for a person to do

Oh, Iris
Yes
My name's Travis
Thank you, Travis
So long, Iris

closes the door to No

The   slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway with '
38 in his hand

88
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the familiar crumpled $20 bill
He makes a big show of stuffing the wrinkled bill into the  's hand
The doesn't understand the significance of it
(restrained anger) Here's the twenty bucks, old man
You better damn well spend it right
turns and walks away
says as  walks down stairs: Come back anytime you want, cowboy
But without the rod -- please

: Palantine, Tom and Palantine's Assistant are seated in garishly decorated suite
Well, at least it wasn't chicken
It wasn't
thought it was
It tasted like chicken
'mon, Senator
That was a class dinner
The St
Regis is a class joint
That was veal
Was it
It sure tasted like chicken to me
(a beat) Lately, everything tastes like chicken to me
Everything
Got to watch your gut
What about it
took 20 off before we started this thing
89
And you've put ten of it back on
Ten
don't think so
You really think so
Ten
Those  cameras do
caught the rally on
You looked a little paunchy
don't think  gained ten pounds
Palantine gets up and walks over to the window
Its bars form a cross-sight on his head
He thinks to himself: (weary) Jesus Christ
He looks at the crowded traffic on Fifth Avenue eighteen floors below
It is a mass of yellow
: Travis' cab pulls away from the yellow mass and heads downtown
: Travis' cab is parked near a neighborhood Bickford's
: and  are having late breakfast at a middle-class It is about 1:30
is dressed more sensibly, wearing jeans and a maroon sweater
Her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out
Seen this way,  looks no different than any young girl in the big city
of the coffee shop most likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother
They are both having an All-American breakfast: ham and eggs, large glasses of orange juice, coffee
90
Outside here environment, Iris seems the more pathetic
She seems unsure, schizy, unable to hold a subject for more than thirty seconds
Her gestures are too broad, her voice too mannered
We sympathize with Travis' paternal respect
This girl is in trouble
and after that Sport and  just started hanging out
Where is home
Iris removes her large blue-tinted sunglasses and fishes through her bag for another pair
got so many sunglasses couldn't live without my shades, man
must have twelve pair of shades
She finds a pink-tinted pair and puts them on
Where
Pittsburgh
ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place
(voice rising) Why do you want me to go back to my parents
They hate me
Why do you think  split
There ain't nothin there
But you can't live like this
It's hell
Girls should live at home
(playfully) Didn't you ever hear of women's lib
There is a short, quick silence; ' eyes retract
He goes on: 91
(ignoring her question) Young girls are supposed to dress up, go to school, play with boys, you know, that kinda stuff
Iris places a large gob of jam on her unbuttered toast and folds the bread over like a hotdog
God, you are square
(releasing pent-up tension) At least  don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy
don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies
motions him to lower his voice
Who's a killer
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me
He never killed nobody
He's a Libra
Huh
'm a Libra too
That's why we get along so well
He looks like a killer
think Cancer's make the best lovers
My whole family are air signs
He shoots dope too
What makes you so high and mighty
Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror
You don't get eyes like that from
92
He's worse than an animal
Jail's too good for scum like that
There is a brief silence
Iris mind continued to whirl at 78 rpms
She seems to have three subjects on her mind at a time
She welcomes this opportunity to unburden herself
Rock music died in 1970, that's what  think
Before that it was fantastic
can tell you that
Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore
Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know
It was unbelievable
Rock Stars everywhere
That Airplane--that's my group, man
All Libras
But now everybody's split or got sick or busted think 'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know
That's where all the smart ones went
stayed here
never been to a commune
don't know
saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me
Why don't you come to a commune with me
Me
could never go to a place like that
Why not
(hesitant) don't get along with people like that
You a scorpion
That's it
You're a scorpion
can tell
Besides, 've got to stay here
93
Why
've got something important to do
can't leave
What's so important
can't say -- it's top secret
'm doing something for the Army
The cab thing is just part time
You a narc
Do  look like a narc
Yeah
breaks out in his big infectious grin, and  joins his laughter
God,  don't know who's weirder, you or me
(pause) What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard
Just leave'em
There's plenty of other girls
You just gonna leave 'em
(astonished) What should  do
Call the cops
Cops don't do nothin
Sport never treated me bad, honest
Never beat me up once
94
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls
You should get rid of them
How
(shrugs) don't know
Just should, though
(a beat) Somebody should kill 'em
Nobody'd miss 'em
(taken back) God
know where they should have a commune for you
They should have a commune for you at Bellevue
(apologetic/sheepish) 'm sorry, Iris
didn't mean that
You're not much with girls, are you
(thinks) Well, Iris,  look at it this way
lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful
And figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out
And they hate it
So  figure the best can do for them is not bother them at all
So  don't say a thing
pretend 'm not even there
figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it
It takes  a moment to digest this pure example of negative thinking:  am loved to the extent  do not exist
Do you really think  should go to the commune
95
think you should go home, but otherwise  think you should go
It would be great for you
You have to get away from here
The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it
Mumbling something about her "shades" again, Iris fishes through her bag until she comes up with another 99 pair of sunglasses and puts them on
She likes these better, she decides
Sure you don't want to come with me
can't
Otherwise,  would
sure hate to go alone
'll give you the money to go don't want you to take any from those guys
You don't have to
want to -- what else can  do with my money
(thinks) You may not see me again--for a while
What do you mean
on
of : My work may take me out of New York
: '  - Sport stands beside the bed
What's the matter, baby, don't you feel right
96
Iris is wearing her blue-tinted shades
It's my stomach
got the flu
Sport puts his hand on her hips
He is slowly, carefully, smoothly manipulating her
It's the stone black hustle
Oh, baby, there ain't no flu
You know that, baby
Honest, Sport
Sport puts some slow soul music on the stereo
You're just tired, baby
You just need your man
am your man, you know
You are my woman
wouldn't be nothing without you
Sport slowly grinds his hips to hers
Iris starts to move with him
This is what she really wanted
Her man's attention
know this may not mean anything to you, baby, but sometimes  get so emotional, sometimes  think, wish every man could have what have now, that every woman could be loved the way  love you
go home and  think what it would be without you, and then  thank God for you
think to myself, man, you are so lucky
You got a woman who loves you, who needs you, a woman who keeps you strong
It's just you and me
'm nothing without you
can go like this for ever and ever
We can do it, baby
You and me
Just you and me
Sport slowly rubs his crotch into her
Iris smiles
She is happy
The music rises

Quickly reloading, he fires again

His western shirt is open, exposing his bare chest

There never has been any choice for me

down midtown sidewalks in
There we see: , walking in  , young couples, middle- aged couples, old couples, hookers and johns, girlfriends, boyfriends, business friends -- the whole world matched up in pairs, and  left wandering alone in the night
Others would notice the breasts, the asses, the faces, but not : he notices the girl's hand that rubs the hair on her boyfriend's neck, the hand that hangs lightly on his shoulder, the nuzzling kiss in the ear

: , his shirt fastened, stands beside table
: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table
We read it
Dear Iris, This money should be enough for your trip
By the time you read this  will be dead
Travis stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an envelope

Everything is neat and orderly

The mattress is bare and flattened out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and pills put out of sight

His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting glasses
His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips are pursed and drawn tight
He looks from side to side
One can now see the full effect of ' lack of sleep and sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail
Even though it is a warm June day,  is bundled up in a shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom
Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper torso to look larger than it should
He is slightly hunched over and his hands shoved into his pockets

We tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in New York to pick up Iris, but you were still in a coma
There is no way we can repay you for returning our Iris to us
We thought we had lost her, but now our lives are full again
Needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household
'm sure you want to know about Iris
She is back in school and working hard
The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine, but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again
In conclusion, Mrs
Steensma and would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts
Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again to thank you in person, or we surely would
But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home
Our deepest thanks, Burt and Ivy Steensma : - Four cabs stand in the waiting line in front of the hotel
