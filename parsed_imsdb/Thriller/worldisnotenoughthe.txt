( 19) -------------------------------------------------------------- , an unnaturally clean city that melds old Europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source
- An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the "private banking institute" within
-  - , dressed impeccably as ever, is being  by three  in Armani suits
They remove   from inside his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them on the desk that separates Bond and
an extremely well-groomed gentleman
Behind him, three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr
Bond, but you understand, a man in my position
Which is neutral, no doubt
Lachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped
Gestures for Bond to sit

She pushes a cart
On it are a  and a box of , which she offers to Lachaise and Bond
It wasn't easy, but  retrieved the money
No doubt Sir Robert will be pleased to see it again
The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond, setting it in his lap and opening it up

In the current exchange rate, minus the fees, of course, and certain unforeseeable expenses
Here is the receipt

Lachaise nods
Bond can have his glasses
He puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt
an odd number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny: 3,030,303

It's all there
Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his
then, he removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise

The report you sold him was stolen from an -6 agent, who was killed for it
He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk
did not get the report from an -6 agent
Who did you get it from
am just a middle man
am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss
(controlled fury) Your last chance
Take the money
Your last chance
Give me the name
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me
He nods
An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun
Perhaps you failed to take into account my
hidden assets
Bond's mouth edges into a smile
flicker of doubt on Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the tiny arm of his glasses and
The pistol on the table
blinding those around, they cover their eyes, stagger back
it is a brief effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his opening
He -  #1 unconscious, taking his gun
Kicks  #2 in the face and throws #3 just as they're getting their bearings
Now he nestles the barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's cheek
The name
can't tell you
(Bond cocks the gun) Alright, alright
But you must protect me
And he freezes
The handle of a   is sticking out of his neck
Bond looks up, catches sight of the as she vaults out the broken window and onto
Bond rushes to the window
-  -  - She swings on a  across to another roof, quickly disappearing into shadows
Bond can hear sirens approaching
He returns to
he grabs the money and moves fast for the door, casually slipping that cigar into his pocket
Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in hand
He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a appears on his chest
another window  as a bullet zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart
Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out
-  - Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by the elevator
Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the stairs
Hears the elevator cage start from below
Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into the lift shaft, watches the elevator  as it comes down
Almost nonchalant, he steps out
/  - As the cageful of police rises, Bond is now standing on the counterweight,
- Lunchtime
Faceless business crowds heading for their brief moment of freedom, among them we spot
one of them, with a briefcase and a suit and tie

Edgy, she approaches a   standing on a balcony overlooking the city

The man turns
Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut
There is a raised, red scar of an   at his temple
It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression, like an insect living just beneath his skin
One  seems slightly drooping, deadened
The other eye is sharp and black as anthracite
It is a frightening face
This is
What's his name
Our friend from -6
James Bond
One of 's more accomplished tin soldiers
He could identify me

He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two glasses of wine

He passes through countless security procedures, watched by an attentive staff
Bond scoops the money out of the suitcase
Three million sterling in tightly bundled hundreds makes quite a sight
He flicks his finger through the last wad, tosses it down wistfully
blue light scans it on three axis
The money is bundled into a clear plastic bag, put on a tray and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into the Bond hands the suitcase to a

' , -6 - Bond enters
is perched on the edge of 's desk
Two glasses, a bottle of scotch open
Sir Robert King, James Bond
King moves toward Bond with an easy, patrician smile
Bond notes a   in his lapel -- like the glass eye of a stuffed snake
Thanks for getting my money back --never expected to see it again
You're the kind of man  could use
Though  won't offend certain parties by asking you to join King Industries
King looks to , smiling
Construction's not exactly my line
Quite the opposite, in fact
She couldn't resist
King smiles at Bond
As he goes, he gives  a respectful kiss on the cheek
The door closes turns
Old friend
Since Oxford
knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world
He's a man of great integrity
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds
picks up the report from her desk
Bond notices it is in Russian, with a  from a Russian military agency in the corner:
It's a report on weapons security in the former Soviet Union, which, as you know, is shaky at best
He's had several instances of sabotage at the pipeline, and he's understandably concerned
He called me the moment he realized its sensitive nature
She pours a scotch for Bond
He drops some ice in, thoughtful
Someone was watching over me in Geneva
guardian angel with a laser sight
He stops, rubs his thumb and forefinger together -- a strange where he touched the ice
Realization sinks in
King

Elektra
Excuse me
She walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her delicate figure
She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks back toward her father's grand house

The vehicle swoops through the epic countryside of the Scottish Highlands
Elektra

She's not a girl anymore

Eyes his sling

Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose
Bond gives her a look

The money was dipped in urea, dried, and packed tight
In one note the metal strip had been replaced with a combustible magnesium circuit -- in effect a tiny detonator
King always wore a pin in his lapel, an heirloom called 'the Eye of the Glens'; but someone switched it for a copy, a ceramic micro- circuit emitting an electronic signature

He hangs back in the shadows, watches Tanner mime the pin moving to the note: When he came within range of the money -- boom
Ingenious

The most expensive of the pipelines, but the one supported by every Western leader

: Elektra interviewed; bruised, emotional

Can you describe him
He shouted
He shouted all the time -- Bond touches Elektra's face, freezing her tears
His eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand: $5,000,000
thought forms
He takes out his wallet, opening it and removing: The strange figure, in pounds: 3,030,303

Bond taps some keys
The words   appear on the screen

He enters '3,030,303

'  He stares at it

-   (-6 ) - Bond opens the door on  who stands alone by the window, looking out at the long shadows on the moors
Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra King
She turns, her brow furrowing
Who told you to look at Elektra's files
took the initiative
You haven't been given an assignment in this case
was the one who brought that money in
'm well aware of your stake in this, 007
If you have a point, get to it
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra
He hands her a slip of paper
Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man who killed her father
looks at the paper, a long time
It's a message
He wants us to know he's back
Who
Claude Serrault
(this is serious) Renard
: ,   (-6 )- ,  3-   '  floats in the centre of the room

Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own
resources, at first
When Elektra's ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me
(measured) advised against paying the ransom knew it was Renard
played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist
How many deaths is he responsible for
How many innocent people
You may only get one shot at a man like Renard
Same circumstances, 'd do the same again
She turns to the hologram
We sent 009 down to kill him
Before he could, Elektra escaped
week later our man caught up with the target
Put a bullet in his head
(beat) That bullet is still there
Bond moves toward the ghostly Renard
We now see He survived
The doctor who saved him couldn't get it out, so Renard killed him
When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation
Effectively, he's a dead man
She presses a button, the hologram turns
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch
He feels no pain
He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man
'That which does not kill me makes me stronger
' Now Robert is dead
He got his revenge
He's not through yet
Renard doesn't blow up five million dollars unless he knows there's more coming in
He's working for someone
Someone who wants to stop the pipeline
And they hired the perfect killer
One with a vendetta against King
and you
with a file, which she hands to
looks over the file: his medical report
see the good doctor gave you glowing testimonials
'Exceptional stamina'
He's always been good at oral exams
Moneypenny disappears out the door
is all business
Get out to the pipeline
Find the insider who switched the pin
If your instincts are right, Renard will be back
He hasn't completed the job
The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that

They exchange a look

She gets up, turning her back to Bond, hands on her hips
Would you excuse us, Davidov
Davidov nods and leaves
Elektra still keeps her back turned, but he can see her physically change, her shoulders sag, her arms cross in front of her
When she finds her voice, it has a gravelly sound of emotion

Yes
haven't been able to recall a single moment of that day

Funerals aren't exactly memorable
God no
All those horrible loved ones and relatives

Partially, yes

Gabor glares at Bond before he leaves
Who is he
My bodyguard
He follows me everywhere
He's decisive, vigilant
And he makes an excellent omelette
How long has he been with you
Since the kidnapping
Why do you ask
Bond takes something out of his pocket, he opens his palm, shows it to her
Does this look familiar to you
It's my father's pin
He wore it everyday of his life
She swallows back emotion
Looks in his eyes, with a sad half- smile that unsettles him
Are you trying to break my heart
Or is it just your way with women
It's not the pin your father wore
It's an exact duplicate
Inside is a tiny electrical detonator
We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company
If you've come here to look after me, Mr
Bond, thank you, but no thank you have two bodyguards,  don't need a third
She starts to walk out
He follows her
- The killer doesn't want to see this pipeline continue, doesn't want to see you take over
That's every man within a five mile radius
Including you
(off his look) That's why you're here, isn't it
You think  can't do it
You think 'm going to screw up
Or get myself killed
think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone
Especially King's daughter
You are wrong, Mr
Bond
In fact,  am the only person who can do it

Bond is beside her, cold-weather gear in the back
They're following a huge pipeline, passing a blighted petrified forest of twisted iron:  derelict oil derricks

Before Bond can stop her, Elektra gets out, moves toward the tribesmen
The stoning ceases
They know who she is
She begins to speak quietly -- in their own tongue
,  - stunning pre-Byzantine chapel hewn from the rock
Flames illuminate beautiful mosaics and paintings on the cavern wall
proudly shows Elektra about, jabbering in his mother tongue
She answers in his language
Bond watches her, impressed
-   , : We hear the click of high-powered electronic binoculars, zeroing in on Bond and Elektra as they return to the survey team
This can't be Davidov's view, as the helicopter has settled down below
,    - Bond is edgy
Someone is out there
He's sure of it
He sees Davidov and Gabor scanning the area as well
Elektra speaks to the foreman
Send the pipe around
It will take weeks, cost millions
Your father approved this route
Then my father was wrong
The first time Elektra has asserted her own authority
The foreman is surprised, angry
But he doesn't question her
She moves toward the helicopter, says to Bond: have to check the upper lines
Gabor will drive you back
Always wanted to see the upper lines
You don't take no for an answer, do you
No
She shrugs, mischief in her eyes
Alright then
Do you ski
Bond just smiles
've been known to
/
- The chopper swoops over
It reaches a mountain peak, hovers
The wind is strong, buffeting
Elektra and Bond are both now in ski suits, Bond wearing a sleek black jacket
Can't land
Wind's too strong
Just hold her steady
(to Bond) You wanted to see it
She steps into her skis, opens the door
Wind rushes in
- Without a moment's hesitation, Elektra leaps out of the chopper and falls fifteen feet, landing on the move
/
- Unbelieving, Bond quickly dons skis and leaps after her
- Below him on the mountain, she is already a way ahead
Her skiing is fearless
Bond likes a challenge
They wind down the slope, competitive, testing one another, enjoying it
- After an exhilarating run, she stops on the edge of a huge drop
Bond joins her
They look down at the snowy valley below
line of survey  visible through the middle
We're building from both ends
This is where they'll meet
Fifteen hundred miles from the Caspian to the Mediterranean
Bond and Elektra stand on the mountainside, feeling like the only two people in the world, when they hear: - They see   falling out the back of the aircraft
As the objects plummet silently toward the earth, they , their fall slows and then, as Bond and Elektra watch in disbelief
echoes out from the black shapes, now visible as , low-flying, sleek, deadly snow vehicles
- Bond turns to Elektra, he has to yell over the sound of the approaching machines
Head for that gully, 'll lure them into the trees
He points her off to one side, where a shallow gully offers cover
she skis off to shelter and he skis where the paraskis trail after him
He streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him, firing
He makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees, whipping in and out of sight as  #1 tries to follow, sinking lower and lower until
catch on some over hanging branches
the Paraski is  into a tree and
- Coming in to pick up the pursuit of Bond is Paraski #2, firing down at Bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind him in the snow
The other two paraskis  and eject their chutes, now     on the ground
Bond looks behind him, sees them gaining
he zigzags through the trees and suckers Paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit another and wipe out behind
But the remaining predator on the ground, Paraski #4, is gaining on him
Bond bursts out of the trees and finds himself heading toward
He cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the edge
Paraski #4 isn't so lucky and     to a hundred and fifty foot drop
(smiling) Should have stuck to snowboarding
But the smile is wiped off his face as deploys from the back
The Paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for him
Bond skis for his life, away from Paraski #4 when  #2 appears in front of him
guns blazing
One ahead and one behind, Bond turns back
he has nowhere to go but
He sails through the air and lands on the Paraski #4, slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow, where he lands on his skis
Paraski four, the chute tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward #2: both of them having set their course for Bond, they are now on a collision course with
Bond meets up with Elektra as above them
The two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above and tumbling down, end over end
Bond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain down on them
Then
silence
An eerie silence
Are they gone
All of them
Bond nods, ripping from his pole a     he slashed and wiping his face with it
he looks at the piece of fabric in his hand
He sees: undecipherable to us
but there is a look on his face, a look of recognition as
grows above them
Bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski-suit as he turns
The exploding Paraskis have triggered   on the slope above
/  - They try to outrun it -- riding the sliding hill -- but they haven't a hope
the rest of the snow is catching them, they're going to get swallowed
/  - The ground shudders, the
Their ankles are soon covered, Elektra falls
Bond stops, pulls her up
They're about to die
He pulls her to him
Hold on to me
She's confused and frightened but does as she's told
They hold one another tight as -- here it comes -- the white fury hurtles over them, burying them
At the last moment, just as their heads vanish from view
The  slams open
The snow covers it and them
More and more snow slides over
: - Darkness
The
Light emanates from Bond's watch
In the shadows he pulls a knife, punctures the air bag
It deflates, leaving them cocooned in an icy tomb
Elektra looks around, staring, unbelieving
Oh my God
we're buried alive
We're alright
But her breath is coming in short, irregular bursts
can't stay here
You're not going to
Bond takes a knife from a sheath around his ankle
Flicks open the small blade
He starts to cut a hole in the snow above their heads
She stops him
No
It will cave in
It's the only way out
The snow  eerily, she gasps, terror mounting
can't breathe,  can't breathe
Bond grabs her, holds her tight
She resists, bucks
Elektra, look at me, look in my eyes
(she does) You're alright
Everything will be alright
Trust me
Finally, arrested by the strength in his eyes, she calms
- beautiful expanse of smooth virgin snow
All is quiet
Bond's fist  through the white
He pulls the snow away, climbs out
Leans in, lifts Elektra out
Bond and Elektra stand, lone figures in the perfect white
They hear a sound
Rescue on its way
: '  - An establishing shot of Bond's  parked outside the ornate villa on the shore of the golden Caspian
, '  - Palatial
Hallway dominated by a   of a bearded man in traditional Turkish garb, sitting proudly on a horse
Davidov, Gabor, waiting, pacing
Bond is sits in a chair,  , writing something over and over on a small pad of paper
on the parachute fragment
comes down the grand staircase
The men stand
She's fine
Contusions
slight strain to her ankle, but otherwise, fine
(to Bond) She wants to see you
'  - Bond enters
Elektra is standing by the window watching the golden ball of the sun sink into the sea
She wears nothing but a silk embroidered robe; the sun shows through it, outlining her naked body in soft, shadowy curves
Are you alright
He nods
He is wound tight, she senses it
can't stay
know
moment
need to ask you something
And  need you to tell me the truth
He waits
Who is it
Who is trying to kill me
Bond looks at her; vulnerable, fragile, trying to be strong
He cannot tell her the truth
don't know
But  will find him
She stares at him, sensing he is withholding something
She turns back to the window
He approaches behind her
After the kidnapping
was afraid to go outside, to be alone, to be in a crowd, to do anything at all, until realized
(pause) There's no point in living if you can't
feel alive
She looks out at the fading sun
can't huddle in the shadows
can't let fear run my life
won't
She turns to him
The way  acted, in the snow
you must think 'm a coward
think you're one of the bravest people 've ever met
She looks up at him, into his eyes; they are so close
All she has to do is tilt her mouth upward
she kisses him
His hands come up across her back, pressing her toward him, her body melting into his, and then
He pulls back
Has to physically step away from her
What is it
you should rest
That was exactly the wrong thing to say
He sees the rebellion flair in her eyes
James
have to go
Then take me with you
No
You'll be safe here
don't want to be safe
have to go to work
He starts toward the door
Now who's the coward
He stops, his back up
then heads out the door
He passes Gabor, standing faithfully outside
: -
',  - Elegant, mysterious
modern day Casablanca
',  - Bond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino
He takes out the  glasses, slips them on, surveys the room -- - He can see all the  carried by the players
All sizes of pistol, even the odd grenade
The obvious side-effect of this view -- he can see through clothes
His eyes alight on two girls walking away from him
One of them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display
She returns Bond's smile
Her friend turns to look
Bond's smile grows:  she has a small pistol concealed over one breast
',  - He looks over the lenses -- and spies someone on the fringes
His old adversary, ex-,  , talking to some suspicious types
Zukovsky looks across
Bond walks toward him
Valentin Zukovsky
BondJamesBond
What brings you here
You, of course
need some information
Bond, 'm a civilian
This is my place
Used to be the royal family's, now it's mine
run my little business,  stay out of trouble
(looking about) Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world
nice little rat's nest
(offering hors d'ouevres) Have some of the rat's nest caviar
From my own fishery
They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House
He turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy
Let me introduce you to a former colleague of mine at the
Dmitri Palov, you may know him as
the Boa
The Boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands
The great 007
For years  have dreamed of closing my hands around your neck
Boa
Have you had any therapy since Perestroika
Why am  suddenly worried 'm not carrying enough insurance
The Boa leaves, glaring all the while
See
You're upsetting my customers
What do you want
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons
What
This is not possible
Bond takes from his pocket the fragment of the
Zukovsky examines the letters
If  remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division
Where did you get this
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me
Zukovsky shakes his head
Sighs
The Russian Army, they spend millions on flying skis, but they cannot afford to pay the soldiers
The men, they do what they have to do to feed their families
In this country, for the right price and a pack of cigarettes, you can get anything you want
He notices Bond watching
a dark alcove of the casino, where slinky  flatter the guests
That too
Everyone does what they can to survive
How high up does this
arms dealing go
Bond
If someone wants you dead, it is Renard
Our government has nothing to gain by killing you
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King
And stopping his pipeline
This hits Zukovsky
He closes down
chill between them
Poor Bond
The cold war is over
What have you got left
Economic espionage
Murder in the boardroom
So dull
Bond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino
:
more vibrant than we have ever seen her, living up to her name
She is impossibly glamorous in a sparkling dress that fits like second skin
Her hair is full and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild
Oh, you'd be surprised
Bond starts toward her, but she tosses her head, defiant, and turns away, making her way to the Roulette tables
Bond follows her across the casino
They are like two cats, moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and sexy, all eyes on them
He takes note as she passes $100, then $500, $1000
She finally stops at the 'No limit' table
Crowded with the nastiest and richest of the high rollers, Armenians, Turks, South Americans, a computer nerd American and a Russian industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink
is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the center
We've kept your father's chair free
And his account
You have a credit line of a million and a half
He gestures to the Dealer, who pushes ten towering stacks of toward her
is right there to take her order
Vodka martini
Two
Shaken not stirred
He leans in, smiling his charming smile as he says: What the hell are you doing here
(smiling right back) Someone wants to kill me, 'd rather die looking him straight in the eye
(lightly) What are you doing here
Looking for a woman a little more your type
How about that one
She points to a   in a feather headdress and pasties
If this little show is for my benefit, 'll take you home right now
You had your chance, James
Now 'm looking for a bigger thrill
She pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them stand on her bet
The whole table exhales
Then, it starts: bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival
Bond scans the room, vigilant, nervous
He zeroes in on Davidov, sidling off, away from the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this way and that
he looks suspicious as hell
Bond watches, his blood running, and then
Davidov slips into the
is soon wrapping herself around him
After a few words, she leads him off toward the back
Bond returns to the game, shaking his head
He watches as : - small room
Lit by sconces that sport
Tacky- luxurious, a refracted Eastern reflection on an old west whore house
Davidov undresses in the little bathroom alcove
He faces a small ornate mirror over the sink, in which he can see behind him, on the bed
You want to be
on top, or not on top
On top
She slowly pulls a pair of   out from her bra and Tied up, or not tied up
Davidov smiles, struggling with his belt
He looks down, gets it, looks up
his heart stops
it is not the hooker in the mirror but
'
Davidov spins
Renard's henchman stands by the door, an automatic rifle cocked at Davidov
Dead, or not dead
: - Elektra with black king showing
seven beneath
understand it's normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end
Really
And with a smile she scratches her cards on the table for a hit
The Dealer gives her an eight
She reveals her cards
Bust
He rakes in her chips
But Elektra is undeterred
She pushes another pile forward as the next deal commences
like the deep end, James
: The  holds Davidov against the wall with his huge fist around his neck
Near his head, the live flame of a hisses, burning blue and yellow, drawing their fuel from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it
The , obviously one of Renard's gang, has finished donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun onto her shoulder
Renard looks distastefully at the room
Is this how you spend the money  pay you
And with the rest you hire fools who shoot like blind men
(croaks out) Bond
Should be dead as well
Your failure today is astonishing
It is a disgrace
He approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming near his head
Do you know why the color is blue at the wick
Davidov starts to sweat
Because that is where the flame is the hottest
Renard touches the glass well of oil
The temperature is close to five hundred degrees
Renard uses his knife and  the seal from the lamp, removing the well of oil
a  of the hot oil and    in an instant
Renard does not even flinch
Davidov starts talking, trying to placate
The plane
it's all been arranged
Then you are completely unnecessary
Renard raises the container of oil over Davidov's head: have the documents, the landing authorizations, the security passes
Renard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour
His dead eye
has it drooped further since we last saw him
seems to glitter in the light
Bond is suspicious
We are moving sooner, tonight
We understand each other
Yes
yes
Renard lets a    drop onto Davidov's head
as his hair smokes and singes
Renard makes a motion, the  releases Davidov, who falls to the floor, clutching his head
: - Another deal
and others watch, as Elektra stakes even more
People move closer for a view
The Dealer shows a five
Elektra shows Bond her cards
Elektra is holding two eights
Dealer's up-card is a six
Stand or split them
She smiles
He holds her gaze
Surely you believe in living dangerously
Not at that price
Time to surrender
They eye one another a long while -- sex firmly in the air
She smiles
She moves    forward
Bond catches a look between the Dealer and Zukovsky: The House has no limit
General kerfuffle
Bond looks back toward no sign of Davidov's return
(to Dealer) Hit me
The Dealer scoops a card from the shoe
Tension
Everyone holds their breath
as he turns over
-- a six
Bust
The audience inhale as one Elektra stands
She has dignity in defeat
She turns to Bond, holding out a hand
Time to surrender
- Bond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them, trying to look like he hasn't been through hell
Bond notices the burn on his head
Davidov touches it self- consciously
little accident
night of burning passion
Davidov scowls at him
Bond leads Elektra away
: Someone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his
(
) What about Bond
and his henchmen, watching
Renard seems mesmerized by the sight of Bond's  on the small of Elektra's back, their easy sensuality as they both get into the car
Sir
Sir
(seething) will take care of Mister Bond
: '  - Bond and Elektra emerge from the
Behind them, Gabor and Davidov get out of her car
Bond watches as Davidov slams his door and marches off, angry, toward the   at the side of the house
Bond and Elektra walk to the front door, anticipation thick in the air
Gabor opens the door
Elektra sweeps through
, '  - Bond pauses just inside the open doorway
Two figures in the cavernous entrance hall, Elektra having a brief word with Gabor, before he turns and exits, leaving only
She starts upstairs, Bond's eyes locked on her body, and then: just once
But it says everything
She continues upward
Bond taps the front door closed with his foot
, '  - Half-light
They're entwined between the sheets
This is something slow, languorous, not to be rushed
We can't make out the mechanics, but they're beaded with sweat
Her fingers trace the contours of his torso
Linger on his bruised collar-bone
You knew when you first saw me
You knew it would be like this
Shush
Her hand dips in an ice bucket beside the bed
She rubs a slither of ice down her chest, shudders with pleasure
It's a move Bond hasn't seen before
Now she brings the ice to his shoulder
Poor shoulder
Looks painful
She kisses his purple flesh
Licks
needs constant attention
She slides her tongue back and fore along the groove above the tendon
And he pulls the ice from her hand: Enough ice for one day
Tosses it across the room as passion takes over
, '  - puddle of water where the ice fell
Post-sex on the bed
He traces a hand down her naked back
The sweat glistens off the curve of her spine
She turns
The light glints off her jewelled earlobe
he touches it
You never take this off
Elektra looks at him
Why do men always want to undress the one part of a woman's body she doesn't want to reveal
She reaches to the large, diamond-encrusted earring and gently plucks it away
Pulls her lush hair back
The lower half of her ear is gone, reduced to a misshapen clump of scar tissue
It is the only mark on her perfect body
physical reminder of her ordeal
It breaks his heart
How did you survive
used my body on the guards
It gave me control
got to a gun and  took my chance
(beat) 've never told anyone that
They are looking at each other, both suddenly feeling something dangerously close to real connection
It is not what Bond expected
Do you ever stop, James
Do you ever think about
another kind of life
He holds her gaze for a long time before he looks away
can't afford to
She frowns, slightly
Settles into his chest
Don't worry
know who you are
He holds her, eyes full of conflict, staring into the dark
-  - The lights of a car pulling up at the security office by the perimeter wall of the property
- Bond's car, several of Elektra's vehicles, all parked around the security office
They have been joined by: , a Russian make, with a familiar painted on the door
we've seen it before, the seal on top of the stolen report at the beginning
Miratom
Out of the driver's seat steps
He carries a briefcase from the car to the front door of the security office
He looks around furtively before he disappears inside
The parking area is dark and silent and then: sits up in the driver's seat of his
- Bond sticks his key in the ignition and activates the car's various systems
Davidov is a shadow in the office window
Bond flicks a switch
-  is directed from the  to the window of the office
He can  a synthesis of Davidov's voice
(
) 'm running late
no, no, 'll make it
how will they know 'm your man
romashka
romashka
alright
Bond hears the click of a phone hanging up
He flicks another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system activates in his
He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large which he carries to the car and loads into the
He goes back inside
gets out of the
He moves stealthily to the Russian vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the lock on the trunk
It pops open
Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and something beneath them
he moves the objects aside: is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet blood
Bond tips the head back, revealing Bond leans in and plucks a  from his white shirt pocket
It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and Cyrillic:   -
On the corner of the badge
Miratom
The one from the report
Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it
Davidov is coming out
Bond     and crouches behind the car
Davidov pauses to lock the door
He walks toward the Russian car
he is actually  a happy tune and then
He has heard something
He draws his gun
He walks the entire car
When he gets to the rear
Bond is not there
No evidence he ever was
Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car
: - The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared airstrip
Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded area
Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and opens the trunk
He removes the briefcase
Then the duffle bag
He looks down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before
but something is different, the clothes not quite right and then: , the head turns, Davidov gasps
It
Problem, comrade
Davidov pulls his   from inside his coat, but Bond is quicker
With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the head
One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes go wide and he crumbles, dead
Bond climbs out of the trunk
Crouches to examine Davidov
Old habits die hard
He straightens
Picks up the briefcase
It is locked
He searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket
He opens the lock
:
Documents headed with the official crest of Miratom
new security tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's name and picture
some hologrammed (blank) security tags -- and a polaroid-type camera
He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the camera
Points at himself, takes a shot
Punches in 'Davidov' on the
Out comes a brand new pass
Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but
is approaching
Russian military jet appears over the trees, flying low, its red landing lights blinking
- door opens on the sinister-looking plane
hydraulic step unit folds out of it
with a machine gun waits in the doorway
, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge and picks up the briefcase
He has   what he's walking into
Here goes nothing
He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to the plane
He starts up the steps: Says something to him Bond pauses
And then, thinking, says: Romashka
The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon
Four soldiers
The first guy and a moustachioed  and two young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a big, thick-necked tough
They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or do
what
He decides to take the lead
He opens the briefcase and hands over the
The Pilot passes it out
But that isn't the end
They still stare at him
The Pilot says something   that sounds like
"where's the rest
" Bond swallows
Thinks, without showing it
He decides to He looks inside
Pauses, then reaches in and takes out
The thin soldier smiles
That's the ticket
Bond hands out shoes to the rest of the guys
: -  - red dawn
Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly- shaped rocks
To one side, an airstrip
The plane approaching
- The three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat amongst themselves
Bond sits in the rear of the plane, which is dominated by heavily buffered receptacles, clearly awaiting some deadly cargo
There is Russian writing everywhere, and one symbol he clearly recognizes:   -
Bond looks out of the window
Beneath a huge , a huddle of low buildings
They come to a stop near the end of the runway is driving out to them
One of the soldiers throws something to Bond
An that says Miratom on the breast
He catches it
(subtitles) You have fifteen minutes
//  -  - Bond, in the orange overalls and wearing his  tag, is driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley - cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side of the hill
-  - They turn the corner and see trucks marked , several Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around, (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and personnel quietly going about their business
vast protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building
'' -   -  - ( ') : The sound of breathing , we're looking from inside the visor of a protective suit
It's hard to tell what's going on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue plutonium from inside a corroding
- An officer eyes Bond's pass
(subtitles) You are late
The transport documents
Bond shows him the case
Akakievich examines the documents
(subtitles) They are waiting for you below
It should be ready
Check with the physicist
He points toward the "bubble
" Inside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited finishes placing a blue   into a box
As Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit
Moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a is mid-twenties, shortish hair, hot right now
In one movement she unzips and steps out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off shorts, heavy duty boots
nasty-looking hunting knife strapped around her hips
She has a deep tan and an incredible figure
She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles
Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly, also unable to take his eyes off her
He spits on the floor and speaks in , so Christmas can hear
Not interested in men
Take my word for it
Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker
Bond offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away
Christmas approaches
He notices her  tag -- and an incongruous   just above her hip
She's checking him out as well
You new
(Russian accent) Yes
Viktor Davidov, Miss
Doctor
Jones
Christmas Jones
No jokes, 've heard them all
Don't know any doctor jokes
She is wary
It's been a long time since a man this attractive stepped onto her beat
They walk toward the building
What happened to Len Tashka
Couldn't make it
Splitting headache
The soldiers may give you a hard time
Whatever
If we weren't around, they'd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun
Bond looks at the ominous radiation
Will  need protection
She squints at him, taken aback
There's no radiation danger down there
Bond turns to go, knowing he misstepped
Christmas then speaks to him, asking a question,
(subtitles) Where is this stockpile going
Bond turns, answers
(subtitles) To the nuclear facility at Penza 19
She nods
Watches him disappear into the building
- Bond descends, going down deep
/ - The elevator creaks to a halt
He slides the elevator doors revealing
waiting for the elevator
Bond shows them his (subtitles) See the corporal, at the end of the chamber
The soldiers get into the elevator and disappear, leaving Bond completely
Dead silence in the shadows
Bond's in his element, that alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings
long, dark corridor
leading off to a more open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming there
Bond starts down the passageway
- Ahead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a suspended over a pit
Blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring equipment
Bond is alone with the bomb
An eerie moment
Then, he comes to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in Russian Army fatigues
Corporal
The man turns
He smiles
see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty
Indeed
Renard starts toward him
Bond draws his gun
Don't come any closer
You can't kill me
'm already dead
He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a beginning to lower it into the pit
Go ahead
Shoot
My men will still steal the bomb, and the shot will bring them directly to you
Renard gestures into the pit
'
'  in the pit, unaware of what is happening above, working directly with the bomb
One of them is using a manual , the Miratom seal in the corner
Bond aims his gun at Renard's head
Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline
Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless
To die by a man who can't even grasp what he's caught up in
Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove a   from inside the bomb
It is the size and shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on it
the man slips it into his pocket
Revenge isn't so hard to fathom
What's clever is getting someone else to pay for it
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune
Bond cocks the pistol
Who is it
You think  fear death
welcome it get on my knees and pray for it
You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no
(closer now) She's beautiful isn't she
You should have seen her before
Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed
Bond's eyes flare in fury
He shoves Renard into the wall and presses the gun to his temple
You will never touch her
You will never get near her
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva
Consider me ungrateful
It's  who should thank you -- for taking that money back to -6
So distressing for
An explosion inside her lair
She'll get over it
You even brought the plane for us
We really couldn't have done it without you
Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol
Renard drops to his knees
He touches his temple, looks at the blood curiously, feeling no pain
man tires of being executed
As Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun: But then again
There is no point in living if you can't
feel alive
Bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before , just a beat, but it is enough
, the noise of footsteps --  , with and two armed soldiers
We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard -- classic execution stance: (to Bond) Drop your gun
Keep away, Colonel
The soldiers' guns are trained on Bond
He is an impostor
(clutching a printout) There's no Davidov at Miratom
Here's your imposter
He's paid off the men on the plane outside
They're not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they're flying it wherever he tells them
Christmas is listening, but Akakievich cocks his rifle
(to Bond) said drop it
And he means business
Bond delays
but has no choice
He pulls the clip from his gun, tosses it down
(to Christmas) Well done -- he would have killed us all
suppose you (to Akakievich) were you the one who allowed him down
Colonel Akakievich looks suitably stung
But Renard is looking past him now, as with a quiet , the  raises into view on a trolley
Renard's team is ready to move
(to Akakievich) Take him away,  don't want him around as we move the bomb
(whispered, to Bond) You had me
knew you couldn't shoulder the responsibility
And Renard jams his hand onto Bond's shoulder, squeezing his collar-bone hard
Pain jolts through Bond, he drops to his knees in agony
He shoves Bond down
Bond's hand goes to his shoulder, his mind now racing -- how did he know to hurt him there
Renard's men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving passageway
It's all too much for Colonel Akakievich: No -- the bomb does not go anywhere until am satisfied
All of you to the surface, now
Renard stops and turns
Bond sees him nod to two of his men: one quietly slopes off down the tunnel
The other innocently opens a container
Camera shows the  of the container's lid; the man releases a false lining to reveal several
- (urgent now) Very well, Colonel
We will all go up
One of Colonel Akakievich's men gestures with his gun that Bond should get up
Knowing it's now or never, Bond him away, yanks a  from his holster,  Christmas, down into the bomb  just as '  open fire
Akakievich dies straight away
So do two of his men
The gunfire  around the chamber and ceases
Renard hangs back
His radio crackles a message: (nods, into radio) Shut them
Right next to the
He turns a switch that activates two sets of red buttons and two sets of green
He punches one green button
Heavy doors close all exits but that to the tunnel
Bond and Christmas know they are being sealed in
Melt-down doors
If he gets them closed, they won't be opened again for forty- eight years
Bond peers over the edge -- sees Renard and his men working the nuclear device into
If Bond doesn't get through now, they're trapped forever
He points his wrist watch toward the cat walk above and presses a button

Bond uses the rope to and into Where he     Renard's last man
They fall , it  behind them
The man swings his machine gun at Bond -- it hits the wall next to him, breaks apart
Bond grabs a broken section and kills him with one strike
He pauses at his dead body and reaches into his jacket, retrieving

Christmas looks around, desperate to help
Using Bond's wire, she climbs up to the
She pries open a panel next to it and reveals complex
Up ahead of Bond, the bomb disappears down the passageway
He can see it is attached to   above, helping the men to move quickly, Renard, pulling, the two men pushing Renard signals one of them to drop back to cut off Bond
Machine-gun fire turns the wall next to Bond to dust -- Bond dives to a recess
An overhead
His section of the tunnel darkens
- ' Bond looks up at the broken
Takes careful aim at the next one along
It disintegrates
Again
- ' The other guy answers with another spray of bullets
Watches uneasily as Bond takes out light after light
funnel of darkness coming to swallow him -- concealing Bond's approach
Nervous, he fires, muzzle flash and sparks illuminating the void
To keep it lit, he keeps firing
as the bullets cease with a loud

He moves

Bond rushes for the door -- but he's shocked as the man he shot lunges

Bond hits him away, he  for the cart blocking his way and       just as it almost closes
Bond squeezes through
Renard is getting in the
Sees Bond made it, fires
Bond rolls into a corner
We have our fireworks
Now you can have yours
And he machine-guns some barrels
Rocket fuel spills out
He digs a finger into one of the holes, effortlessly rips the metal so more fuel cascades out
: Christmas cuts some wires together and with a hum, her Bond fires at Renard, hitting his shin
looking down at his shin, noticing the blood
Inconvenienced but not in pain
He shuts the cage doors
Pauses only to fire off half a clip at the
Shreds it
Bond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing -- gets to the elevator as Renard disappears upwards with a smile
He underneath him
Bond looks down
makeshift explosive device
sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set to explode Eyes wide, Bond looks back to the doors -- then to the switch panel -- now just a chaos of sparking wires
The pipe bomb ticking
Bond is trapped
He looks up
He jumps up, grabbing it, just as
The bomb ignites the spilled oil,   shoots along, scorching after Bond, who is     , the force of the blast sending him hurling down the passageway
heading straight for: which miraculously begins to  as he Ahead, the next door is  as well
He sees  on the other side
Bond hurtling toward her, ahead of a Close the door

But before she can, two of the    through the closing iris, clattering into the pit, starting a fire below
Flames licking up the sides of the pit toward them
Bond looks up, sees the     , stretching upward toward an old  t the top of the ceiling
He and Christmas scramble up the robot arm, walk along the spider-like web that supported the bomb and find
powered by a hydraulic system
They get in
hear the rumbling of the fire below
the old elevator moves slowly
the rumbling grows louder
Shame you had to spot  wasn't the real thing
So who are you
Bond -- Bond    at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and
shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as Fire shoots up
Bond lunges to cover Christmas
As the smoke clears: (finishing) James Bond
: -   -  - Christmas and Bond climb out of the duct
Through a cloud of dust he can see people running about, panicked
There's been some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground
Bond looks past them to a plane coming this way
The plane
It roars past, level with them
He follows it with his eyes, helpless as it gets smaller and smaller
They won't get far
Every warhead has a locator card
Miratom device
Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies
We can track the bomb
With this
Bond removes the locator card from his jacket and shows it to her
It flashes in the sun
Christmas shakes her head, disgusted
170 - 172 : ,   (-6 ) - Busy
Analysts huddle over monitors showing satellite images, trying to track the plane
Do we have the range of Renard's plane
Anywhere in this circle
Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan
Marvellous

Elektra King is calling from Baku

It's a video line
Put her on the wide screen
The face of  materializes on a large

'  -  - Elektra works in her father's , illuminated by a halo of light from a single desk lamp
Pictures of her grandfather and father stare down at her from the walls
The wind open
She gets up, crosses the room, shutting the window
She stands there, listening to the silence and then
strange, unsettling thud
She listens, a long time, to the silence

She goes to the door, opens it
it whines on its hinges
She steps into

Three french doors lead out to a balcony

James
She stares at him, shocked, hesitant
You look surprised
She moves to Gabor, gets down to help him
He stirs, he is alive, but unconscious
Elektra looks up at Bond
What's wrong with you
Are you crazy
little
Does it matter
After all, what's the point of living if you can't feel alive
Isn't that right, Elektra
Isn't that your motto
What are you talking about
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard
what
We had a run-in, he and
He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me
Elektra stands
she begins to tremble
Are you saying
Renard is the man who's trying to kill me
You can drop the act, it's over
don't know what you're talking about
think you do
He walks toward her, threatening
At -6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome
It's common in kidnappings
young impressionable victim
Sheltered, sexually inexperienced
powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, in manipulation
Something snaps in the victim's mind
The captive falls in love with her captor
At the word "love," Elektra explodes
She  an unsuspecting Bond hard across the face
How dare you
How dare you
That animal
That monster
He disgusts me
You disgust me
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it
You had a sling on your arm at the funeral
didn't have to sleep with you to find that out
He used your exact words
You knew
You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied
You used me, you used me as bait
You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike
He has no answer
He can't deny what she says
The phone rings, cuts through the tension
Bond and Elektra staring at one another
She lets it ring
Then picks up
Listens, looks to Bond
He's struck again
(beat) Five men are dead at the pipeline
He moves toward her
'm coming with you
You do what you have to do, but 've called in
She's en route from London even now

Bond accompanies  and Tanner toward a clutch of offices
All around, ,  personnel,  scour the area

She nods acknowledgement to
Tanner senses that Bond wants to talk to  alone: 'll see how they're coming with the power
They watch him go
turns to Bond: You had your hand on the bomb and you let Renard get away with it
He draws her away, to a small alcove
Takes something out of his jacket
The report King bought
It's a manual
Renard's men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection
They're getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons
can't help thinking

The inside man
Is maybe

But before he can speak,  calls out, gesturing to flashing on a console in front of her
That's not right
Technician comes over
Tanner too, followed by Bond and
What is it
It's an observation and repair rig
Travels along the pipe, checks for broken seals
But it's not supposed to be there
(thinks) Stop it
The Technician flicks two switches
The light continues to flash
Confused, he tries others
No change
don't understand
Where is the rig
Harried, the Technician activates the wall schematic of the pipeline
pulse of light travels along the line
And with it, a sense of horror descends
The parcel's in the post
It's heading for the oil terminal
Where it can do the most damage
My God
(to one of her men) Have the terminal evacuated
The man gets on the phone
(to Tech) Speed
Full on
Seventy miles an hour
He punches buttons
Christmas has come, stands next to Bond
One hundred and six miles from the terminal
(quick) It'll reach the other end in seventy- eight minutes
(to Tech) Any more of these rigs
The Technician checks his records, looks up, nods
There's one parked in the passageway ahead of it
Decisive, Christmas heads for the door, turns to her team: 'll need some help
Her  colleagues look sheepish
Bond moves to her
Come on
For just a moment, Christmas looks wary: Unless you'd like to see my  first
She almost smiles
nods to Tanner to follow them
Bond doesn't look at Elektra
But she watches him go
: - The -6 helicopter swoops along the pipeline
Tanner is beside the pilot
Bond and Christmas in the back
They look at one another, the danger ahead melting the frost between them
- Bond and Christmas climb through an access hatch down onto the electric
Its lights blaze fifty yards into the tunnel
Then darkness
Christmas takes the driver's spot, Bond the rear, nearest to the approaching
Tanner leans in: (sealing them in) Good luck
Bonds nods, checks his watch
Christmas looks nervously down the pipe
Be one along any minute
And she starts the machine off
-  () It quickly picks up speed, its lights flooding the seemingly endless pipe before them
Christmas looks behind, apprehensive
Waiting for the lights of the explosive rig
It's tense
They travel along, expectant
When this is over we should bury the hatchet
Celebrate
champagne dinner
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens
Alright then, brunch
His lightness relaxes her, she appreciates it
-    - Elektra, , and others
The room is crowded with concerned personnel
watches the two blips on the schematic getting closer together
One of her  approaches, a radio in his ear
Tanner reports Bond is headed for the rendezvous
Excellent
Evacuate Miss King and the others
You can evacuate my workers, but 'm not going anywhere
looks at her, then nods, impressed by her courage
() - Bond and Christmas waiting expectantly
Tense silence
Finally, a  ,
Lights appear behind, reflecting on a bend, then
here it comes, the rig tearing through the pipe
Bond looks over his shoulder at Christmas' speedometer
she's only at fifty
Faster
Get our speed up
Christmas presses forward
Bond turns, his feet  toward the approaching rig
the lights getting closer
closer
Bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact
He cushions the blow with his feet
Both rigs moving together now, he Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across
The bomb sits there, daunting, deadly
Tactical fission device
Low yield
They look at one another, then set straight to work
-    - The room is quiet, tense
and her two men, Elektra, Gabor, the King  and three armed security guards at the doors
They are the only ones left
Going down with the ship
if it goes
and Elektra watch the two lights now together on the console
tense silence
Everyone's edgy
Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest
She exchanges a glance with Gabor
-  () - :  the timer
1:45
Bond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're attempting
The digital clock ticks down
1:30, 1:29
217-218 - The rigs speed through the tunnel
Nothing to see
But As the rigs hurtle past
-  () - The pipe suddenly dips
They cling on as the machine bucks like a rollercoaster
Back on a straight
Her brow furrows
The plutonium is missing
They've taken the core
Then it's no longer a bomb
(back to work, urgent) It's a bomb alright
We're still dead if the trigger charge goes off
Bond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel
He stares at the timer:  0:44, 0:43
Makes a decision
Let it blow
Christmas shoots a look, astonished
But we can stop it
Taking her arm
Let it blow
She can't believe what he's saying
His eyes shoot to an the lights illuminate up ahead
Trust me
Leave it
He grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb
- The rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking her with him
They tumble along the pipe
Agile, Bond springs to his feet, pulls her up
They run like hell for the hatch, into the darkness
- The pipeline
long beat, then
section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in every direction
As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has been destroyed
223 - On the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from the point of impact, emitting one, monotone
The watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked
Gabor, a radio earpiece in his ear, reports information
It wasn't nuclear
the bomb was a dud
The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline
And Bond
An agonizing beat
The alarm beep sputters and dies
Nothing
and Elektra share a look
Do you think he's dead
can't answer
She shakes her head
We just have to wait

The hi-tech room is eerily lit by the pulsing red lights on every screen, showing the explosion

Something that belonged to my father
He would have wanted you to have it

Perhaps this isn't the time
Please

unties the ribbon
He often spoke of how
compassionately you advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping

It is
the heirloom pin, the original
It's very valuable, you know
just couldn't let it explode with the rest of him
looks up, horrified, when: ' point blank, cold blood
The men fall
looks back at Elektra, a blood-curdling glare
(to her men) Take her to the chopper
- From on high we follow the snaking pipeline
until it disappears in a ,
Beyond, the pipeline continues unperturbed
Two   on the banks of the crater
Bond and Christmas, very much alive
She's angry
What the hell were you doing
You nearly killed us
did kill us
She thinks we're dead
And she thinks she got away with it
What the hell are you talking about
It's part of some plan
She dresses it up like a terrorist attack
The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium
Who's she
Elektra King
Elektra King
Are you insane
This is her pipeline
Makes her look even more innocent
(skeptical) What would she want with weapons grade plutonium
was hoping you could tell me
Christmas stares at him
Wheels turning
You steal an old bomb, small by today's standards, about the size of the one that destroyed Nagasaki, take the plutonium core out of it, intending to use it
(beat) To make a bigger, better bomb
They're both chilled by the thought
have to get after that core
This is my ass
She starts fiddling with the radio
Suddenly there's a Tanner to 007, do you read
Bond grabs the radio
Loud and clear
have to speak to
She's gone
What
She's disappeared
And two of our men have been killed
It impacts on Bond
His eyes harden
What is it
She just upped the stakes
All her chips are on the table now
And 's life is part of the bet
He looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly snake with the world for its bed

They enter the tower

Pillars, iron lattices, velvet drapes and flowers embroider the huge room
As they enter, Elektra swoops across the floor and into Renard's arms
He holds her
She pushes him away
You're hurting me
He senses something different between them
She tries to hide it
Brought me something
He smiles, grabs a case off one of his men, opens it up, pulls out a sphere of cobalt blue metal
She looks at it with wary fascination
Go on
It's safe
Touch your destiny
She traces a finger along the metal
flicker of wonder: Warm
(pointed) Is it
She's sensitive to his buried frustration: 've brought something for you as well

The other side is divided off by a   , creating a cell which now contains: The cell is bare, except for a camp bed in the corner betrays no fear
quiet defiance burns in her
Just as  promised
Renard steps forward
Bars separate him from
My executioner
Over-praise, 'm afraid
But my people will finish the job
Your people
Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me
You and my father
He didn't think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market
Your father
Is nothing
His kingdom he stole from my mother
The kingdom  will rightly take back
Elektra leaves
Renard is left alone with
She's insane
Is that what you did to her
No
'm afraid it is what you did
He crosses close to the bars
When  took her she was
promise itself
So clever, so vibrant, so
full of life force
And you left her there, at the mercy of a man like me
You ruined her
For what
To get to me
She is worth fifty of me
For once,  agree with you
He shakes his head, amused by her pluck
So she used all that brilliance to get revenge on her father, on me
No
wanted you
wanted you for myself
He takes something out of his pocket
small
He sets it
Since you sent your man to kill me, have been watching time tick slowly away, marching inevitably toward my own death
Watch these hands,
At noon tomorrow, your time is up
And  guarantee you will not miss
You will die
Along with everyone in this city and the future of the West
He places the clock on a tall stool, just out of reach through her bars
He leaves

At their feet lies one of Zukovsky's workers
What are doing, Bond
Trying to impress this innocent thing
She's no innocent
This is my nuclear consultant
Ah,  see

Hands held clear of his body, Zukovsky enters, his evening dress decidedly out of place here
Really Bond, couldn't you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears

Zukovsky sinks alarmingly -- he talks rapidly, staccato: Alright, alright
Sometimes  smuggle machinery for her
Russian stuff
And the payoff on the tables
special job
a
a submarine
What
To haul some cargo
My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet
Where's the sub going
No
Get me out
This is too big for even you
Where is it
This is a family matter
If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing
Now get me out
But he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger
No
Bond
(alarmed) Bond
Bond fires
Zukovsky  as the
It takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him
He clings to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to safety
Commander Bond, you are dangerous, unpredictable, and a hothead
He just looks at her
But then again, explosive devices are my specialty
Zukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind him, walkways , teeter, and  into the sea
So
My way
No -6, no Interpol
Just you, me and my people

/'  -  - Beyond iron balustrades we see one of the most fabulous views in the world -- on one side the still waters of the Golden Horn, on the other, the dancing waves of the unsheltered Bosphorus -- and in between, the tumbling roofs, soaring minarets and crouching mosques of the Pera district

Twelve hours to go
She crosses her arms
Returns to pacing
Puts her hands in her coat pockets: She feels something
Takes it out
Black and shiny, with two copper terminals on one end

She looks back out
: - '  -  - Renard and Elektra
She is on the bed, Renard stroking her, worshipping her skin
So beautiful
So smooth, so warm
How would you know
It stings him
Elektra sits up, pulling a robe around her
Why are you like this
Because Bond is dead
It's what you wanted
(beat) Of course
Renard gets up
Paces the floor
He was a
good lover
What do you think
Renard leans against her desk, closing his eyes, squeezing out the images
After a moment, he    through the hand-painted wood
Elektra looks up
huge splinter of wood juts out of Renard's hand
Renard looks at it, curious, unfazed
Nothing
Elektra comes to him
Leads him to the bed
Sits
Gently removes the splinter
Then, she takes an icecube from the bucket
Runs it along his wound
What about this
And she runs the ice down his cheek
He shakes his head
Tormented
Nothing
Now she runs the ice down her neck
But surely
her fingers becoming wet, she runs the ice down between her breasts, leaving a trail
Teasing
You can feel this
She's moving the ice lower on herself
We see her lips open, enjoying the sensation

As she does something else

Her arm is stretched out through the bars
She is using her high-heeled shoe to try to  the leg of the stool and drag it toward her
She can only jut tap the leg with the tip of the heel
She swipes out at the little three-legged stool, tapping it, tapping it
It scoots toward her a little
she taps it again, gets her shoe  on the leg of the stool and starts to drag it when
The rickety stool hits a bump on the ancient stone floor and the clock    and  across the stones, coming to rest   , on the floor near the window

Street vendors are the only people about, moving their carts into place, getting ready to place out their wares
We hold on a
- multi-levelled, rickety old building full of colourful fabrics drying high overhead; the light shafts through them casting pools of different coloured light
It is a working factory, bolts of fabric and vats of dye, but it is also: Pushed to one end of the large room are stacks of radio equipment, old consoles, audio equipment and radar screens
Once a high-tech surveillance center, it has gone to seed
There are men and women here, smoking, using the equipment, slightly dissolute, very sinister, where the only membership card is an old
Zukovsky is here, leaning behind a Any luck reaching Yevgeny
Negative, comrade
He moves to   , pouring over a large spread out on a table
(to Zukovsky) What is this place
Former  surveillance post
The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit
Bond notices   in the corner with some others
Your old friend Dmitri
Zukovsky nods to his old friend
Today, you are glad to have the Boa  on your side
Zukovsky looks at the map
In the good old days, the  had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing
But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo
What class sub does your nephew run
-class
Nuclear
Not just nuclear
Powered by a nuclear reactor
(the penny drops) He's not loading any cargo
They want the sub
The sub itself
Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub's reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown
Made to look just like an accident
Mother of God
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea
But why
Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years
cloud of radiation the size of Europe
(chilled) Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines
There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world
The King pipeline
Elektra would control it all
If what you say it true
it may be too late for Yevgeny

Something is disturbing a large expanse of water

The submarine's hatch opens

Captain
Sir
We are ready to load your cargo
We only have a few hours before we'll be missed
You came with a skeleton crew
That's all we can afford these days
Of course
We are grateful for your efforts
One of his men comes forward with several bottles of brandy and other food
We have brandy and other refreshments for your men
The Captain nods, pleased
Bond and Christmas and Zukovsky watch as the radio operators scan the airwaves
If we're not in time and something has happened to him
you must let me kill them
Bond stares hard at him

Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky
They have

An empty glass of brandy on the floor, just near the hand it fell from
The dead face of Yevgeny, poisoned
Others of his crew around, also dead
Renard and his men tour the grisly scene
Take them up and throw them in the sea
As they drag Yevgeny away, his  falls on the ground
Renard picks it up and
We'll be underway in two hours
Use that time to re-familiarize yourselves with your stations
Then ponder how rich you'll be
The re-breathers for the escape are already on board

Renard takes the box as if it weighs nothing
Stronger then ever

To be locked away, to wonder if they're coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you
Someone will come

Bond is dead
Elektra walks to the window
She looks out
Somehow,  find that strangely disappointing
watches her, her heart beating
Elektra
What time is it
Elektra picks up the little clock
Walks over to the cell bars
Time for you to die
And she reaches through the bars and
The two women's eyes meet
The reactor is secured
She turns, sees  in the doorway
She crosses to him and     behind her

This is the end
No
It is the beginning

Tries to mask his sorrow
It will be yours, and yours alone

He takes the coordinates over to the map and across it
The rest

Bond draws another line across the map
At the point at which the intersect
a small island in the Bosphorus
The Maiden's Tower
How appropriate
'd heard there were some renovations there
no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years
Suddenly Bond's instinct are aroused
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees   set something on the ground and move slowly
Bond looks at the pack he left on the ground
He grabs Christmas and
rips the place apart
In half a second the air is thick with coloured dust and drifting clumps of burning silk
Bond stands
Christmas is stunned, but okay
He looks around at the others - few dead, all out for the count, among them, Zukovsky
Bond heads for the door after the Boa
Zukovsky
If  don't get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden's Tower,  is dead
Bond runs out, into - Teeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots climbing a ladder alongside a building to
Bond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the top of the roof
Boa has now been joined by
One attacks Bond as the Boa and the others move away
Bond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof, gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and through a thatched roof where he falls
Into the market below
Christmas, just coming into the square, sees the body falling
she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond
But the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth
She turns and runs
the thug gives chase
Bond is following Boa and the other two men as they  from roof to roof
He sees them jump off onto the roof of
Motoring rapidly away from him
He makes a spectacular leap to a wobbly   that swings him toward the bus, dropping him on the roof before it  , into the overhead    and setting off sparks
Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him
They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus speeds through the rickety old streets
He throws the guy over
The thug desperately
Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has climbed back on and is about to      with his gun when
onto a new street
Thug Two's gun is caught up in them
he is instantly Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond time to slug him hard across the face and Thug two's body goes     of a fast moving van
through the back doors of said van and tumbles out onto the street where it is
Bond turns back toward
Now it is just the two of them
The bus is hissing to a stop
The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck
Bond rushes forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi
The taxi jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to the street
He springs to his feet
Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for traffic
The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley
-  - The Alley leads into a small  where  smoke water pipes and drink coffee
The Boa is nowhere to be seen
Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his leg so as not to alarm the civilians
He steps into the cafe
-  - Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the back
He looks inside - just a few children  at play
Bond is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which brings him to his knees
He struggles to bring up his gun - but the Boa knocks it out of his hand
The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from behind
Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail
He glances down to his right -   - just out of reach
Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it
Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across the room
He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear
For years  was told  could never take the great James Bond and his Walther
What good is your gun now, Bond
Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim
He slumps forward, his left hand touches something hot
It's the iron basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite
Bond's fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top
He grabs it and with his last reserves - Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side of the head with the The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of his face
Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying to clear his head
The Boa runs out the back door
Bond finds his gun, holsters it and follows
-   - Bond comes out into a side street crowded with Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the crowd to
-   - taking on cargo
Bond enters square in time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian steamer
As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom
- Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck
He lumbers across it but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck house
The Boa goes sprawling
As Bond comes for him he scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and swings at Bond
But Bond is ready for him
He wards off the blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate
He traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks in the solar plexus
He Boa stages back to the railing final kick from Bond sends him over the side
, Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his neck broken
Bond sighs, turns
is there
Gun trained on him
Welcome aboard, Mr
Bond

thug steps into sight below, holding hostage as well
'  - magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the Bosphorus
An innocent-looking launch coasts up to it
tarp is raised and Bond and Christmas are revealed, hands bound
They are helped out, led inside by a number of henchmen
'  - Elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open
Kisses Bond on the cheek as she eyes Christmas
James Bond and his amazing resurrection
If only you'd kept away, we might have met again in a few years, become lovers once more
Christmas eyes Bond anew as Elektra leads him to an ornately carved chair, covered in silk
(to guards) Take her to Renard
Bond and Christmas exchange a look as the guards start her towards some steps
Elektra indicates for him to sit
Behind him, the whole of Istanbul is visible through a large curved window
Pretty thing
You had her too
Bond ignores her
could have given you the world
Not interested
This cuts
She casually reaches behind his neck, flips up a wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar
They were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases
They also found this
(meaning the garotte) think we ignore the old ways at our peril, don't you
Bond recoils as she fastens the collar
She steps back
(ignoring her) Where's
Soon she'll be everywhere
Bond keeps his cool: All this, because you fell for Renard
Five more turns and your neck will break
She moves to the back of the chair, twists the screw The effect on Bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts into the back of his neck, tilts his head back
Since  was a child, 've always had a power over men
When  realized my father wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, knew  had to form a new alliance
(realizing) You turned Renard
(smiling) Just like you
only you were even easier
She pulls the jewel from her ear, reveals the ugly scar: told him he had to hurt me, he had to make it look real
When he refused  told him  would do it myself
She turns the screw again
So you killed your father
He killed me
He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom
flicker of emotion
Bond is getting to her
Was this all about the oil
It is my oil
Mine and my family's
Her eyes are shining
She moves toward the view, gazing out at this spectacular cradle of civilization
Bond works his wristbinds feverishly
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood
'm going to redraw the map
And when  am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather's name, the glory of my people
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident
She eyes him, impressed that he's worked out her plan
Tightens the screw again
Her confidence amazing
They will believe
They will all believe
Tightening the screw again: You understand
Nobody can resist me
Now she straddles him
She puts the jewel back on her ear
All the time, he's working that wristbind
Know what happens when a man is strangled
Elektra, it's not too late
Eight million people needn't die
She smiles, twists the screw again
nasty, grinding sound
Sweat trickles from his brow
She licks it away
You should have killed me when you had the chance
But you couldn't
Not me woman you've loved
She pushes her hips into his
Turns the screw
The bolt is jammed right into the back of his neck
His face is angled upwards
Breathing is difficult
He glares up: You meant
nothing
to me
She fingers the bolt
Prepares to turn it the last time
His hand strains at its binding
One
last
screw
(kissing his ear) Oh James
She begins to turn the screw
when   are heard outside
Bond is on the edge of consciousness
Elektra freezes
Gets off him
Moves to a window
'  -  - : Big, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of his men
Two bodies in his trail
He's on course for Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire
'  -  - Elektra moves to her gun
Just then, Gabor crashes through a stained glass window, neck broken
appear from below stairs as the doors burst open
Zukovsky stands there
bloody giant
They open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder
Right now, he's unstoppable
shocked silence after the shooting
He eyes Bond in the chair
To the room: 'm looking for a submarine
It's big and black, and the driver is a friend of mine
Then his eye falls on the  Renard had brought up from below
He knows at once what it means
Bring it to me
She picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun beneath it)
She proffers the hat
What a shame
You just missed him
-- she fires through the hat
He staggers back
Stares
Slumps down
Lowers his head to the ground
She walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down, smiling a half-psychotic smile
The gun is pinned
Zukovsky is dying
But he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already pointing at Bond
Elektra looks surprised, then amused as Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger:  he's going to shoot Bond
Bond stares back
Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for extreme accuracy
The  hits the binding at Bond's wrist
Splinters the wood there
stares at Zukovsky
She didn't see where the bullet went, just that it missed Bond
She watches his head slump further, staring at Bond
look passes between the two men
Comrades in arms
The merest of smiles
Then the light fades from his eyes
Dead
turns back to Bond
Smiles
Excuse me
She picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it: Everything's under control up here
Are you ready
(filtered) Yes
Au revoir
Lost for a moment, she breathes heavily
She glances at Zukovsky's corpse
Slightly puzzled, to Bond: Zukovsky really hated you
(beat) Time to say goodnight
And she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer twist
One super-fast movement: Bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight
He holds her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls her backwards, her hand scratching at his face
Ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet
Moves to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his fingers
Turns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs
moment's dilemma:  should he race below to the sub -- or up to Elektra
He takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset
: -   (' ) - The submarine's engines roar to life
- rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading to the various balconies of the minaret tower
/'  - Bond stalks up after her
through the intertwined stairs: James
You can't kill me
Not in cold blood
But Bond isn't wavering
Clutches Zukovsky's bloody wet gun
He heads up in the semi-darkness -- and suddenly swings to his right, at an unexpected but familiar Voice: Bond -- Bond kicks open a door and enters
' He fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her
Turns to go, heading upward, after Elektra
Go after the submarine, forget the girl
Bond
/'  -  - Elektra has reached a balcony
It affords a spectacular view of Istanbul
Bond appears, has her cornered
Call him off
He holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth
won't ask again
Call him off
She looks at him seriously
He's giving her a last chance, willing her to save herself and the city
(into walkie-talkie) Renard
Bond waits
(to Bond) You wouldn't kill me
You'd miss me
And her face breaks into a perverted grin and -- (into walkie-talkie) Dive
Bond -- Bond shoots her
She staggers back, shocked at her own mortality
never miss
He looks out: - Sees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half submerged
The hatch is still open
/'  -  - He stares at her dead body a beat
And then, he crouches
He touches her cheek, just once, before he goes
Behind him, unbeknownst,  has seen it all
'  -  - He moves to the ledge
Composes himself -- and to the water
Amazing
,  - He surfaces close to the exiting sub
Grabs a ladder, pulls himself up
The hatch is closing
He splashes through the water flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor shutting the hatch
him with the hatch
Gets inside
Closes it
Milliseconds before the hatch slides under the water
- Bond down below
Renard's crew are spread throughout the sub
He creeps through
Approaches one man working some levers, smoking
Bond holds his gun to his head
How do you want to die
(re:  cigarette) That
(re:  gun) Or this

It opens and Bond lets the now unconscious man hit the deck
That was his head banging
(stunned) James
He takes her by the hand, they move through the shadows of the sub
- man is operating the tanks
Through the intercom: (filtered) Flood tanks 4 and 5
The man does as told
When he's finished -- Bond knocks him out with the butt of his gun
- Several men occupy the central control room, Renard at their centre
Beyond, on the other side, the outer chamber of the reactor
-  - From the other end of the control room, Bond and Christmas, so near and yet so far -- they can't get to the reactor because there are so many men in there
Keeping behind cover: Is there another way
We go down to the torpedo bay
,    - Bond and Christmas get attacked
vicious, silent fight
Then the radio set sparks into life -- Open the tanks
Bond is throttling the man with the cable
Speaks into the handset
(disguising voice) Tanks open
But the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm: The
- Renard looks up
(to self) Bond
He flicks a switch; (into mic) Bond
You have decided to join me on this historic voyage
Welcome to my nuclear family
: : His voice fills the control room
You're really going to commit suicide for her
Renard responds, into the microphone
In case you've forgotten
'm dead already
Haven't you heard the news
So is she
Renard's face screws up in pain more searing than any he could feel in his skin
he
The scream, like a wounded animal, echoes throughout the doomed craft
, gasping, spent
You will die for this
He strides through to the Jams shut the hatch behind him
Now moves through to the Where he picks up the
Moves back into the Sealing the other door behind him
And now he opens up the cover of the glaring
,  - Christmas sees a panel light up: The cover is off the reactor
Bond reads off more lights
He's sealed himself in
He's going to insert the plutonium
Thinking fast, Bond moves to some controls
Hits switches
Do you know what you're doing
Like riding a bike
,  - The air tanks immediately filling with water
,  - Christmas and Bond shift to the side
Everything not screwed down starts sliding
-  - The submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose dropping down and down
Pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a submarine hanging vertically, nose down
,  - Renard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the nearest wall
,  - Bond and Christmas hang on too, get a grip
He helps her up
What kind of bikes did you ride
Just wanted to put him on edge
,  - Renard is disturbed by the sub's position, but only momentarily
He moves to an intercom: Open the torpedo tubes
- Bond hears a creak, turns to see the tubes open -- water gushes up toward them at an incredible rate
Climb
He pulls Christmas up and they ascend to the next level
No chance to seal the chamber though, the water is already through the hatch
Keep moving
- Renard now struggles back up to the reactor, stares into the violet blue heat
He hits a button
slowly rises out of the reactor
- Bond and Christmas are ahead of the water
They have reached a level where various systems are operated from
There's one chance
He punches buttons
,  - High up on the sub, a hatch opens
Water floods into an escape hatch
An inner door stops it getting into the submarine itself
- Renard slowly inserts the plutonium rod
Immediately the light around him becomes a deeper blue, a horrible luminescence
The staccato click of a distant Geiger counter intensifies
- As Bond opens the inner door of an  , he points out a cabinet on the wall to Christmas
Re-breathers
She opens the box to find the - are ripped to shreds
No-one was ever meant to get off the sub
She shows Bond
Never liked those things anyway
He climbs into the escape chamber
Count to twenty
When you get to twenty open the hatch
It can only be opened for a few seconds or we'll sink
But what if
Count to twenty
'll be there
She moves over and seals the door, wrenches a lever which immediately floods the chamber with water
- Inside the chamber, Bond holds his breath as water seeps in
The most claustrophobic thing you've ever seen
- green light comes on and Christmas punches a button
,   - The   opens
Bond burst out and starts the long swim up the
- Christmas is counting
One, one thousand, two, one thousand
- It's dark out here
It would be very easy for Bond to get disoriented
He peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast vertical whale he's swimming up
Passes the conning tower
Fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one thousand
- Bond is running out of air
And then he sees it -- the open hatch of the rear escape door
He gets inside, yanks it closed
- Christmas, shivering in the rising water
Twenty
She presses a button
( )  - The hatch opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water
The hatch closes
The whole world is at a crazy angle here
Bond looks down at the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses
- Bathed in the horrible light of the over-heating reactor, Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of the door
-
The door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond
Bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard, now a crumpled heap in the corner
Bond moves down to the next door, opens it: Christmas
And there she is, struggling, the water level way below still rising
He lowers an arm, pulls her up
They clamber up to the reactor: ' : in the intense glow inside -- the overheating rod, protruding slightly
We have to get the rod out of the reactor
Bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick
Christmas comes up level with him: Melting down
4000 degrees, the Zirconium casings on the rods crack
5000, the plutonium melts
In ten minutes, a hydrogen explosion
4500
He starts toward the reactor when suddenly ,
grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life
4700 struggle
Both slamming into switches and buttons
: 314-316 - 4900,    -- 5000
Meltdown imminent
He looks down the sub -- more water racing upward
Back to the pile
Scans the scene, searching for an idea
Sees a , compressed air escaping from a fissure
Thinks fast
Grabs the hose, snaps it free
is recovering, has found a   near him
Raises it to Bond
' in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from 5000), we see Renard approaching from behind us
jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down -- as the air blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past -- impales Renard in the heart, just before he could shoot
Renard stares at Bond in horror
Bond calmly takes the flare gun off him
She's waiting for you
And he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water
Christmas looks down at the floating corpse
Bond watches the gauge -- as it edges  from 5000
The nuclear disaster looks like it's averted
But suddenly water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's shell; it's going to sink
We're sinking
But she won't come
As water courses over them: Help me
We have to seal it
She moves to the reactor, closing the cover
Bond uses his strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place
Bond climbs upwards, dragging Christmas with him
We've got to get out
We can't
- They clamber into the next chamber up
,  - The submarine is slowly sinking, nose down
Air is escaping from the many seams that are creeping apart
We can hear the metallic  through the water
Bond and Christmas crawl into
Bond reaches out, setting a timer to
The clock ticks down
-   - The Torpedo doors open and Bond and Christmas are , streaking through, as behind them
in spectacular fashion
,  - Bond and Christmas reach the surface
Look around them
No boats coming to the rescue
They wave to a tourist boat passing
The boat heads over to pick them up
: 324 - -6 - The damaged wing is being repaired
- Tanner overseeing things, and then
walks in
Efficient and steely as ever
All eyes turn to her
She looks at everyone
makes the briefest of nods
That is all the sentiment allowed as business resumes
She scans the machines: Any word from him

,  - magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul
Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger
explode above
They clink glasses
He looks out at the cityscape

The satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a side street
We can just make out Bond's
He must be nearby
comes over
The image moves from the car, closes on the garden rooftop
The thermal image is multi-coloured, difficult to decipher

They all look back to the image
The figure is turning , almost glowing
It's getting redder
Tanner,  and  realize as one that this is an image of two people, one atop the other
And getting hotter
Bond
switches the screen off, clears his throat
Could be a premature form of the Millennium Bug
,  - It's dark, we can't really see them
You know James
think Christmas is coming early this year
