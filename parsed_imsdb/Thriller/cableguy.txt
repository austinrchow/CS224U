The Cable Guy by Judd Apatow Based on a Screenplay by Lou Holtz Jr
Shooting Script October 31, 1995 (White) Revised Pages November 13, 1995 (Blue) Revised Pages November 14, 1995 (Pink) 1	  - Credits begin
The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint image of a television program
Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly image
The camera pulls back very slowly
We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch television
The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote control
The hand changes channels frantically
The camera pulls back into its final position and we see  , thirty years old, sitting on his couch
He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception
Unfortunately for him  his cable is not hooked up
(looks at watch) Jesus, where's the cable guy already
1A
'  - It is a stylish old apartment
There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor
Steven has just moved in
The phone rings
(into the phone) Hello
2	 - We see Steven's best friend  standing in the middle of a busy newsroom
He is a rough looking, cynical local news cameraman
In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television set
- An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air
graphic on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update
" How's the move going
3
'  - Steven unpacks as they speak
The phone call intercuts between the two locations
Horrible
The cable guy is missing in action
Apparently he's going to be here sometime between eight  and my death
You haven't called Robin have you
Please tell me you didn't call her
(sarcastically) No, 'm giving her space
(beat) can't believe she's doing this
You never should have asked her to marry you
You're the mad smotherer
All she had to do was say no
She didn't have to kick me out
feel like Felix Unger
You forced her to evaluate the relationship
If you didn't propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was
don't want to talk about it
So what time are you going to come by
can't
'm working double shifts the rest of the week
It's my first night here
Don't do this to me
The other camera guy pulled out his back
Besides,  spent the last two weeks with you on my couch
Isn't that enough
Fine, fine
One piece of advice
Slip the cable guy fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie channels for free
Even the dirty ones
couldn't
'm not good at that stuff
What if he says no
'll feel like an idiot
None of them say no, believe me
'll talk to you later
Steven hangs up, and waits
: 4
'   - Steven continues unpacking
He is very neat
He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his ex-girlfriend
He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display
He puts it back in the box
4A
'   - Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties
moving truck pulls into a gated side garage
5
'  - Movers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs
Steven directs them as to where to put them
- 3:52
6
'  - Steven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception
He changes channels
Still nothing
He pulls it off frustrated
7
'   - Many of the boxes are gone
Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting
He is unable to fill his day without cable
Where the hell is he
8
'  - Steven paces back and forth across the room
He stares at his watch frequently
- 5:12
9
'  - Steven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen
He looks at the clock
It says five-thirty
He picks up the phone and dials
machine picks up
() Hi, this is Robin
Leave a message
If you are trying to reach Steven he can now be reached at 555-3837
Steven hangs up
10
'  - Steven does sit ups
He looks at the clock
- 6:48
(to himself) Forget it
Idiots
He gets up, and walks into the bathroom
11
- Steven gets undressed
He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in
He tries to lose his tension by letting the hot water engulf him
He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair
(annoyed) Oh great
Steven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door
Don't leave
'm here
'm here
12
'   - Steven runs to the door
() Hello
Cable Guy
Steven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole
The   is walking away
'  / - Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy
(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) Hey, wait
The Cable Guy turns back
Well, look who decided to show up
was just gonna go collect my retirement pension
The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he speaks with a slight lisp
This lisp gives him a child-like quality
You were supposed to be here four hours ago
Was
So 'm the tardy one
Good to know
Yes
had to go to the Bed 'n Bath place, but now it's closed
(turns to leave) Maybe  shouldn't have come at all  jerk off
(turns back smiling) 'm just joking
Let's do this
(looks around) Oh, the old McNair place
never thought they'd get the floors clean after what happened here
What happened
(long beat) They had a lot of cats
They walk into Steven's living room
Hey, this could be a cool pad
Here is a comment card
He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him
Please mail it in when  am done
These go to your boss
No, they go to me
'm a perfectioniss
perfectioniss
(he strains to lose his lisp) perfectioniss
t
Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with
The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space
Come on baby
Come on baby
Talk to me baby
Tell me where you like it
That's it baby
He zones in on one wall
He fells the wall in a sensuous manner
Here's your sweet spot
He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling
So your lady kicked you out
What
In preparing your service  noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut
Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris
Smells like heartbreak to me
really don't want to talk about it with you
Could you please just install my cable
'm going to get dressed
No sweat
Steven walks away, into the hallway
moment later the Cable Guy runs to him
Hey, 'm going to go to the hallway so can access the floorboards
Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you
Okay, whatever
Steven walks toward his bedroom
Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be channel surfing in no time
The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke
13
- '   - - from   broadcasts from their studio
(to camera) So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood
The twins were stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four
video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages
Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble
" Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad
We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs
(to camera) Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program
Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out
frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called "The Brotherhood of Friends
" Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam
burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin
need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth
And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of "Twin Envy
" Steven re-enters the room
The Cable Guy is watching television
How's it going
The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet
" His eyes never leave the
Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee hope they fry this bastard
Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television
The  is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room
All furniture faces the , making conversation impossible
(looks around) What happened
(jumps to his feet) The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception moved a few things
Cleared it right up
Is that cool
(non-confrontational) guess so
You programmed
(off of Steven's look) Then let me slave your remotes
He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other
As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him
Ooh, maybe we should leave these two alone
So after this 'll only need one remote for everything
You know you're pretty good at this
You could be a cable guy yourself
(he finishes) Now let me check your levels
With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc
Then he clicks through the channels
music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court
The Cable Guy watches emotionless
All right
That about does it
just have some paperwork for you to fill out
Sign here
Steven does
That gave me power of attorney over you
(beat) Joking
Steven laughs
The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long
As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment
The Cable Guy does not want to leave
'm about finished here
(beat) Okay
feel good about this
Cable Guy walks to the door
One thing
(turns back immediately) Yeah
uh
have this friend and he said he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels
Have you ever heard of anything like that
(deadly serious) You mean illegal cable
Uh
yes
Who told you that
want his name
Forget it
You're offering me a bribe
What you have just done is illegal, and in this state if convicted, you could be fined five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility
Please
that was dumb
was just making conversation (laughs) 'm just jerking your chain
Wake up little snoozy
'll juice you up
All it is is a push of a button
He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door
Oh, great
How much
Don't worry about it
couldn't charge you
Your girl just booted you
Consider it one guy doing another guy a solid
That is so nice
Hey, you're a 'nice' guy
You'd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit, like 'm a god damn plumber or something
(hands him a card) Here is my personal beeper number
It's just for my preferred customers
Never call the company, they'll just put you on hold
Thanks
Really
(holds up comment card - jokes) You're gonna get some good marks here
Maybe some day 'll take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works
It's really incredible
Sure
We should do that one day
How 'bout tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow's not good
What are you going to do, sit home and stew about your ex
No
(insulted) Oh, okay
guess  crossed the line
Sorry
(guilty) You didn't cross the line
No
Cool
'll pick you up at six-thirty
On the flip side
The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider
Steven cannot believe he just got roped into that
(End Revision - Pink) 14
-   - Steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers
His boss,  , looks impressed
Steven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex
There are twenty-four classrooms; each can be converted into a 1400 square foot home
The facility has two tennis courts, an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform "Oklahoma
" Everyone laughs
Steven is very good at his job
The kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers
And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure
If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this thing
There is a pause, then everyone applauds
Mr
Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm around him
They speak as the meeting breaks up
Great work Steve-o
So you're feeling good
Yeah
Did  hear something about you having some troubles at home
Robin and  have been having a difficult time
moved out, but  really think it's only temporary
Gotcha
love this project, but it's a big mother
Know what  mean
If it fails, corporate's going to have my ass
've got confidence in you, but you hear where 'm coming from, bro
Absolutely
Now 've got more time than ever
It's a good thing
(laughs) know  can pull this thing off
(playfully) Then what are you doing talking to me
You've got a lot of work to do
Get to it
Thank you
will
Hal goes down the stairs to his office
Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, 'll be right back
14A
- Steven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office
15 16
'     - , an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine
" Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet
There are papers spread all over her desk
On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has written
Steven peeks his head in her door
Hello
Robin's face drops
Steven, what are you doing here
was just in the area
Thought 'd pop by
How's work
How'd the big teen crush article come out
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) They liked it
(beat) thought we agreed we weren't going to see each other for a month
know, it's just Daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse
That's wonderful, congratulations
know 'm breaking the rules, but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate
don't think we should
Come on, this is the biggest day of my career
Don't put me in this position
What position
want to share this with you
(feeling pressured) love you, but  need to take some time on my own to see how  feel
You agreed to this
mean
this is exactly why we broke up, because you never listen to me
What
Now we're broken up
What happened to 'trial separation
' can't get into this now
If you haven't noticed, 'm at work
Sorry to disturb you
He turns to leave
(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) (sincerely) Steven
Congratulations
know how much this means to you
You deserve it
Thanks
He leaves
17 17A
'  - -
Steven is watching television
He looks lonely and depressed
He clicks around in a daze, never stopping for more than a second
He hears a horn honking outside
() Steven
Stev-ey
Let's go
-  commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant
Steven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in his window honking the horn
Steven
(waves) Hey buddy
Come on down
Steven waves and then steps back from the window
He doesn't know what to do
He looks at the television
- The local news
Coming up next a special report, "Loneliness, America's Silent Killer
" Steven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come down
(begins walking to the door) What the hell
18
'   - Steven walks from his apartment to the customized van
On the side of the white van it says, "The Cable Company - Get Wired Today
" How's it going
Howdy partner
Climb aboard
Steven gets in
19
- The van drives onto the main boulevard
Thanks for coming out
You know most people think cable is just a simple co-ax that comes out of the wall
They never take the time to understand how it works
Where exactly are we goin
We're going to take a ride on the information superhighway
20
- Birds eye
, shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city
It all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod Electronics, created the first cable television system
The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, overlooking the entire city
went to Lansford once
It's the Cable Guy's Mecca
It was very emotional
21
- Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail
come here to think sometimes
To clear my head
They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them
It is enormous
Next to it is a one-hundred and fifty foot antenna
Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's controls are located
There she is
Right now she's sending entertainment and information to millions of satisfied citizens
That's pretty impressive
See,  knew the moment  met you that you would appreciate this
The Cable Guy runs to the dish
few seconds later he appears inside of it
(with wonder) The future is now
Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer
You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another
You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam
There's no end to the possibilities
(waves to Steven) Come on up
What are you waiting for
22
- The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky
Sometimes 'll sit here and imagine that there are billions of bits of information surging through me
've watched a lot of  in my life guess 've always taken it for granted
When  was a kid my mom worked nights
Never met dad
But the old  was always there for me
know what you mean
My dad was there, but he might as well have been gone
My mom is a stewardess
She was always out of town
(moved) That's tough
You must have a lot of abandonment issues
Reality isn't "Father Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on Saturday night
But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right
(tentative) You know my brother's a speech therapist
The Cable Guy sits up
He looks angry
So
There is a long silence
Steven doesn't know how to react
Never mind
The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it
(beat) So, you're pretty love struck about your lady, huh
miss her
asked her to marry me, and she asked me to move out
hate that
She said she felt pressured
Can you believe that
Women are a labyrinth
Can  be frank don't think you listen to her
think you try to tell her what she wants to hear
She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is
All the complicated splendor that is woman
When your love is truly giving, it will come back to you ten-fold
You're right
That is remarkably insightful
Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final thought on Friday's show
23
'   - The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building
You know what
Women are suckers for "Sleepless in Seattle
" It's on  this month
That's your bait right there
Robin loves that movie
They all do
Next time you talk to her tell her you're cooking yourself dinner, and watching it by yourself
Sound like you're happier than a pig in shit
She'll come running
Betcha
Then just play it cool
Maybe  will
Steven gets out of the car
Thanks a lot
'm embarrassed to say this, but  don't know your name
What is it
(touched) You really want to know my name
You do
Really
It's Ernie Douglas
But my friends call me Chip
'll see ya' Chip
Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes
Let's just remember right now
You know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend
(long pause) guess we're the lucky ones
(End Revised - Pink) '
- The Cable Guy is in slow motion
He blinks once
Uh
good-bye
Later buddy
'll catch ya' on the flip side
Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable
24
- Steven and Robin are talking
Robin does not look happy to see him
don't listen to you
pretend to understand but 'm really just saying what  think you want to hear
So from now on 'm going to try my best to listen more because  do love you and am interested in learning about every detail about the complicated splendor that is you
Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked
Oh
want us to get back together, but  can see why taking this time might be good for us
So, 'm not mad
After a long beat, Robin smiles
Sometimes time apart is healthy
You're right
Well, that's what  came here to say
Look, 've got to get back to the office
He starts getting up
So, are you doing anything tomorrow
'm just going to cook myself dinner and watch a movie
"Sleepless in Seattle" is on cable
Really
If you're around you should drop by and check out the new apartment
Okay, maybe  will
He exits the room
As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case
- Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table
is giving the news update
Today in the Sam Sweet case the prosecution played the 911 call that Sam Sweet made the night he murdered his brother
Keep in mind, he confessed one month later
The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call
The transcription is seen on the screen
(crying and babbling) Hello, please send help
My twin brother has been shot
911 Slow down sir
What happened
Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun four times
mean  think it was a shotgun
Who would do such a thing think it was an Asian gang or something
They were speaking some other language
Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear
Hmm
Who indeed
Coming up next, a rare interview with Michael Jackson's zoo- keeper
25
- Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends
It is a competitive, but friendly game
Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts
Here, here, here
player passes to Steven
Rick is covering him
Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up
(to himself) Shit
My fault
My fault
Not your fault
'm in the zone
There is no stopping me today
Play begins again
player named  takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who catches the ball, then drives to the basket
When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball
The ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym
We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it hits a man's sneaker
pair of hands pick up the ball
The camera tilts up the man's body
It is the Cable Guy
He is holding another ball
He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern
Hey, you guys play here, too
Cool was just in the neighborhood
Thought 'd run the court for a couple of innings
(gestures to injured player) Great
We need another man
This is
Chip Douglas
my cable guy
Rick smiles in recognition
We met about a week ago during a routine installation, but  feel like 've known him my whole life
Steven can't believe this is happening
Oh really
That's sweet
All right Chip Douglas, you're on shirts
Let's play
No,  want to be on Steven's team
'm skins
The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt
Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he is rippled with muscles
The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is scary
don't care, 'll be shirts
Let's just play
Wait a sec'
've got to warm up
The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines
Everyone stares at him until he finishes
Let's get it on
Are you any good
Feed me under the boards and you'll find out
Play begins
The shirts inbound to Jeff
The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible
He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc
He couldn't be more annoying
Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in
Rick and Jeff slap hands
(doing the traveling hand signal) Traveling
That's traveling
Yeah, whatever you say Chip
Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him
All right, so we're playing that type of game
Prison rules
get it
Steven takes the ball out
The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open
He criss crosses all over the court
Feed me the rock
Feed me the rock
'm open
Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the process
The ball goes in
(does the foul hand signal) And one
That's definitely a foul
(to Jeff) You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants
(to Cable Guy) What are you doing
Don't play from fear Steven
We can take these guys
-   - '
a
The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in
The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down
b
The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including Rick
c
Rick drives to the basket
On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor
Rick scores
The Cable guy helps Steven up
As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with Rick
d
The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down hard
Take it to the hole
Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up
Steven grabs his own rebound
When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him
Steven stumbles to the ground
The ball does not go in
Hey, are you okay
He pulls Steven up
Yeah
'm fine
Let's switch
'll cover Rick
The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare
Steven takes out the ball
He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball
(enraged) What the hell was that
That's it
've had enough
Everyone begins to exit the court
Thanks for bringing your "friend"
The Cable Guy runs up to Rick
Good game
(slaps Rick on the butt) You were tough out there
Your play brought me up to a higher level
mean that
(dismissive) Yeah
He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players
What are you doing
It was payback time
was protecting you
(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) You ruined the game
don't appreciate your tone Steven
That's not the way friends speak to each other
What are you talking about
don't even know you
Well let's fix that
Let me buy you a Heineken
No, 'm going home
Steven turns to leave
Well, uh,  guess we'll talk later
've got to go shower up and do some stuff
'll call you if  get a chance
Or you call me
or something
The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five
Steven slaps it halfheartedly
Then the cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee
And down low
Steven stares at it for a beat
The cable Guy waits
He'll wait as long as it takes
Finally Steven gives him a low five just so he can leave
(pulls his hand away so Steven misses it) Too slow
Have a good one
(as he walks away) Yeah, have a good one
26
'  - Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries
He is dressed for a date
He pulls out a bottle of wine
He opens the oven, and checks on dinner
It is almost ready
Then he checks his message machine as he prepares the meal
He begins chopping an onion
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) You have eleven messages
' (  ) Steven, it's mom
Give me a call
'm still your mother
' (  ) 'm getting on
Steven call your mother
(  ) Hey Steven
Just checking in
Give me a ring
'm at 555-4329
(beep) What's up Steven
'm at a pay phone
If you're there pick up
Pick up
Pick up
Okay, 'll be home later
'll talk to you then
Steven stops chopping
(  ) (beep) Okay 'm home now
Give me a buzz when you get in
'll be here pretty much all night
Bye
(beep tone) Hey Steven
Quick question, give me a call when you get a chance
(beep tone) was just taking a whiz, thought you might have called
Okay later
(beep tone) Sorry,  had call waiting, didn't get to it, thought it might have been you
All right, bye
Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this
He fast forwards through a sampling of the rest of the calls
(fast forwards) We're having ourselves quite a little game of phone tag here
You're it
(fast forwards) was just blow drying my hair and thought  heard the phone ringing
(fast forwards) you're a tough man to reach
(fast forwards) guess you're too busy to call your friends
(Revision Ends - Blue) Steven fast forwards the machine
All he hears is sighing
Then (  ) (long beat - then quiet and distant) Shit
The doorbell rings
Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door
It is Robin
She is dressed casually, but looks beautiful
Hey, good to see you
There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello
Come on in
What do you think of the place
She looks at the odd placement of furniture
You made some interesting choices laying out the room
(embarrassed) That's actually where the movers put the furniture
'm gonna change it, very soon
No,  like it
27
'   - The food is all eaten
Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation
So how's work
Work's good
How's Hal
Don't get me started
That guy has no vision
It's like working for Mr
MaGoo
He's just worthless
It's just great that you're getting to do it
It's a real step up
know
Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then could really get some stuff done
It's nice to see you doing so well
Well, it's nice just to see you
(looks at his watch) Hey, it should be starting
They sit on the couch
Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven
Steven turns on the television
The screen is filled with white noise
The sound is loud static
He changes channels looking for the signal
Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume
Damn cable is out
Son of a bitch
It's alright
We can watch it another night
No, no
We really should see it now
Now's a good time
He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back
It doesn't
Wait, wait
know what to do
He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet
He dials it, then presses the number in
The Cable Guy's a friend of mine
'll just page him
We'll have this fixed in no time
(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone
The moment he is finished dialing - Steven walks to the door and opens it
Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before
Steven is startled
That was
fast
Is there a problem with your service
Yeah
my cable went out
Steven pushes him out into the hall
Really
The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord
So you called me
Interesting how you call when you need something
Is that how you treat people
've been really busy
You've got to get my cable going, Robin is here
This is really important
He peeks in to get a look at Robin
They make momentary eye contact
Steven pushes him back out
But calling me back isn't
'm sorry
Please, you've got to help me
Why should  help you
gave you free cable
What have you ever done for me
Anything you want
Name it  quickly
Tomorrow night, we hang out
Fine, whatever you want
God bless you
You're too good to me
The Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven
(loud-normally) All set
So what's with the cut cord
(nonchalantly) That's for effect
See ya' tomorrow Steven
(conspiratorially) She's pretty
And don't kiss her
Don't even touch her
Fight the urge at all costs
It will pay off later with
He makes a motion which implies sex
Enjoy the flick
The Cable Guy walks away
Steven walks back inside
Who was that
Nobody
Steven sits down next to Robin
Robin moves next to him
Steven looks very happy
28 scene from the film "Sleepless in Seattle
" The camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van  alone
We cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we can tell that he lives there
29	( 29 ) 30
- The Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot
Steven has his eyes closed
Sorry about yesterday
was in kind of a weird mood
How'd things go with you
Keep 'em closed
Pretty well
We'll see
Look, about the other night
didn't appreciate you -- Don't peek
want this to be a surprise
really don't need to be surprised
Where are we going
Only the best restaurant in town
They walk around a corner
Okay, here we are
Open sesame
Steven opens his eyes
The camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which says "
" Medieval Times
know what you're thinking
Don't worry, 'm buying
31
- The Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table
All the seating overlooks a large, circular arena, the kind a rodeo is held in
The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed decor
All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc
(Revision Ends - Pink) Funny
never thought  would ever come here
love this place
come here twice a week
Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by
The Cable Guy is transfixed
Oh man, that's my look
love big butts
Ow, that hurts
He grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself
There oughta be a law
Man she is hot
It's just not fair
(gestures to him squeezing his crotch) Please don't
You know what  need right now
Pooooon tang
And 'm not talking about the place in Vietnam
Good to know
They sit down
The  walks over
She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not enthusiastic about her job
(flatly) Welcome to Medieval Times
My name is Melinda
'll be your serving wench
May  get you something from the bar keep
(too into it) Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate
He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King's thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust
(uninspired) 'll be right back my lord
The Cable Guy puts something together
There you go
He hands Steven a paper crown
They both put theirs on
Thanks for the help
The Cable Guy sees something
His eyes widen
Steven, don't turn around, but there is a woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasn't eaten in a week
Steven acts like he isn't interested, but he is
Really
What does she look like
Shoe's a hottie
wish she was checking me out
Man -- she is on fire
Total robo-babe
Are you serious
Don't look
've got to look
Okay, but play it cool
Just turn like you are looking for the waitress
Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress
He sees the woman
She is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life
Steven turns back to the cable Guy, annoyed
Ha-ha
'm just messing with your mind
But you fell for it man
You are one horny Indian Chief
(not laughing) You got me
So what did you want to rap about
The trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins
Hold that thought
Show's on
The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena
32	   -         " " Welcome to a magnificent journey into the past
This is Medieval Times
The entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds
Are you prepapred for a night of feasting and sport the likes of which ye will never forget
The audience applauds
charge you to stand up on your feet and cheer for your section's knight
- Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight
The Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match
Steven remains seated
Let the games begin
The Red Knight rules
Blue Knight
You're going down
Going down
An embarrassed Steven applauds politely
The Cable Guy sits down
33
- - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on horseback
- They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands while watching the show
(to the Watiress) Could  get a knife and fork
There were no utensils in Medieval Times, so there are no utensils at 'Medieval Times
' Do you want a refill on that Pepsi
There were no utensils, but there was Pepsi
Look,  have a lot of tables to get to
The waitress exits
(stands up - yells to the competitors) Spill his blood
Take his kead
Show no mercy
The two knights fight with swords
After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins
The crowd erupts
The Cable Guy goes crazy
(to Steven) Come on, get into it, we won
Releuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds
(halfheartedly) Way to go Red Knight
Good job of killing
Good work
Steven and the Cable Guy sit down
So, what were you saying before
(tentatively) How do  put this
've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but
That's why  became a cable guy
To make friends like you
Every time  walk up to a new door, that door is a possibility for friendship
When  walked in your apartment  knew there was something there
just knew it
(sotto) Oh lord
(tries to get back on track) want you to know -- The lights change
Trumpets play a fanfare
The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting Steven
We have reached the climax of our competition good people
Now, two noble men from our audience will battle to the death to resolve a grievance
Will a Master
(looks at his clipboard) Steven
Bartowsky and Lord Ernie Douglas make you way to the fighting pit
spotlight shines on them
Steven is shocked
What's going on
We're going to do battle
It'll be fun
Is this a normal part of the show
No, but  give all the Knights free cable
They said it would be cool if we just went at it for a little while
Two    from the show come and lead them away
Is this safe
That's what the armor's for
34
- Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs
The Cable Guy could not be happier
Steven is freaked out
What are we supposed to do
We've got to be careful we don't hurt each other
The Cable Guy doesn't answer him
He has his game face on
cannot listen to any of your instructions for you are my sworn enemy, and are about to meet your demise
Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare
Let the battle begin
Come now people, let me hear your voices
The crowd cheers
Music plays
The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to the center of the pit
The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position
He begins to circle Steven like a cat
Steven mirrors him, not sure of what to do
Just take it easy
The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword
In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head
The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air
The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and pokes him several times with his sword
Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his shield
(enraged) What are you doing
(matter of fact) 'm trying to kill you
The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon
Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield
Hey, watch it
The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven
Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the ground
This is just like when Spock had to fight Kirk on 'Star Trek
' Best friends forced to do battle
Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him
He swings at the Cable Guy with his sword, just missing him
The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air
That's the spirit
Let's give 'em a good show
Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly
It is a real battle now
He bangs away at the Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands
The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on the ground
By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt
So that's how it's gonna be, huh
All right
If you want to play rought, Daddy can play rough
The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield
He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, sending him to the ground
The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy silver blade on the end of it
He swings it in circles like a Japanese master
Steven grabs a similar weapon, and then begin to circle each other
Chip, this isn't funny
Will you stop it
The name is Spock
If we don't battle to the death, they'll kill us both
Good-bye Jim
He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style
The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek Battle Music" as they fight
This isn't 'Star Trek
' : They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position
The Cable Guy pushes Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade
The Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle
They continue to swing and roll in a vicious battle
Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block
The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection
(looking down) Jesus
The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance
There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves
moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick
The show's host runs up to Steven
Quickly, muster a top your steed
(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character) Get on the god damn horse
don't think he's kidding
Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust
The host smacks Steven's horse sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy
Don't do this
Jim, we have no choice
Oh my god
They run toward each other
horrible game of chicken
Neither gives in
When they reach one another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick
The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back
Steven rides to him
Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet
(concerned) Are you okay
The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him
Well done good sir
You are the victor, but we shall meet again
The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles
They carry him to the center of the arena in victory
The crowd cheers wildly
Steven feels the adrenaline rush
He holds up his arms in triumph, and smiles
: 35
'   - They are walking up the stairs
You've got a real warrior's instinct
've got to admit there's a real feeling of power holding that jousting stick
If Robin saw you tonight, she would be begging you to take her back
'm telling you these knights get laid all the time
We should go again next week
Easy there Lancelot
Steven opens the door to his apartment
36
'  - Steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine
You have zero messages
Nobody loves ya
(grabs a beer from the fridge) Hey,  think  left my staple gun in the living room the other day
Could you be a pal
Steven walks to the living room
36AA
- Steven turns on the lights
What do you think
Steven's entire stereo system and  have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system
All top of the line
What is this
took the liberty of updating your in home entertainment system
got you the big screen, plus  quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants
You went in my house when  wasn't home
How else was  supposed to get the stuff in here
Magic
How much did this cost
Practically nothing
have a connection
Preferred customer
hook him up, he hooks me up
Look,  can't accept this
wouldn't feel right
Yes but you give me something so much more valuable
friendship
And you've given me friendship, so we're even
(beat) Really, don't take it personally, but you've got to take it back
(sadly) Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck works all week
Is it all right if leave it here till Saturday
(guilty) Sure, no problem
And don't get me wrong
really appreciate the gesture
Mm-hmm
(beat) Staple gun
Oh, right
Steven picks up the staple gun
The Cable Guy pulls out a leather pouch
Steven drops the staple gun in the pouch
The Cable Guy never touches it
36A
'  - Steven dials the phone
On his computer screen a graphic reads "  - " (into the phone) Robin, it's Steven again
'm still trying to reach you
Okay, 'm at work
Call me
He hangs up
He is getting frustrated
The door opens
Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not enter
How's it going
Good
(long beat) Good good
Great
Good
Keep it up
He leaves
The phone rings
(through the intercom) Robin on line two
Steven lights up
He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone
Hey,  had the best time the other night
When am  going to get you on my couch again
36B
- The Cable Guy is driving around
He speaks on a cellular phone
Well tonight's not looking too good
How about tomorrow
Chip
knew 'd get you on the phone that way
Listen, that equipment will be history the day after tomorrow
It sure would be a pity to leave that karaoke machine a virgin
What do you mean
Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke jam
No ifs ands or buts
Well maybe a few butts
Later gator
37
'  - -   '    "
" We pull out to reveal we are in Steven's living room
It is populated with about twenty odd looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music
Among them we see Rick looking very uncomfortable
37AA
- Steven is on the phone
He is dressed up
Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the fridge
Hey Robin
What's up
Did you get my message
37A
- '  - The scene intercuts between the two locations
Robin is dressed up, and on her way out
Yes
You left me five messages
It king of freaked me out
Sorry
've been trying to reach you 'cause 'm having a party
You've got to come over
(listens for a beat) can't
'm going to dinner with someone
Dinner
What, like a date
Not really a date
You've got a date
thought things were going well between us
They are
So why are you going out on a date
made it before we got together the other night
knew you would freak out
'm not freaking out
Yes, you are freaking out
'm not
just can't believe you would do this
'm not doing anything wrong
'm allowed to date
It's not like we're back together
We had a good time the other night, and you're already pressuring me
(pissy) Fine, enjoy yourself
Have fun
will
Fine
Bye
Steven hangs up the phone
The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer
This is just a sign that you need to live a little
She's having fun, and you should too
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) You're probably right
Damn right 'm right
Oh,  got you a little something
He hands a box to the Cable Guy
thought you said we were even
You're breaking the rules
So shoot me
He opens it
The box says, "Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days
" The Cable Guy is so moved he cannot speak
My brother said it might help with your lisp
The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard
Words cannot express
(he is too moved to finish his sentence) It's no big deal
Yes it is
He stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable
Now 'm on a mission
This has got to be the best party ever
Let's rock
37B
- They walk into the living room
sad looking   is singing "Superfreak
" Everyone's having fun
We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd
(Revision Ends - Blue) You've got plenty of friends
These people are acquaintances
They're not ride to the airport friends, like us
(sees something) Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock real barn burner
Don't look
You're playing with me again
No sirree Steven
This woman is all over you like a lamp-shade
Shut up
He turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits
When he looks at her, she smiles
He quickly turns back
Did it just get hotter in here
(grabs his crotch) Oh, that hurts
Who'd she come with
don't know, but she looks pretty available to me
'd strike while the iron is hot
He who hesitates, masturbates, know what 'm saying
nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick
He sure can throw a party
Chip's an incredible man
really admire him
Where do you know him from
He hooked up my cable
Didn't charge me either
That's the kind of guy he is
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) Steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman
Hey
'm Steven
Heather
Can  get you something to drink
Sure
'll have a shot of tequila if you will
Coming right up
37C
- - Steven and Heather are singing "You're the One that  Want" from "Grease
" They are both drunk, and having a great time
The Cable Guy walks over to Rick
'm glad you accepted my invitation
Steven invited me
The Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather
Look at him
Have you ever seen him so alive
He's changing, Rick
You've got to learn to live with that
don't know what your story is "Chip Douglas," but 'm going to find out
Oooh
How dramatic
The song ends
Rick walks away
He waves to Steven as he heads out
Steven runs over to him
'm getting out of here
(drunk) Why
This is a great party
This girl is really into me
You're whacked man
That guy is bad news
You don't even know him
You're just mad 'cause he kicked your ass in basketball
can't even deal
'm outta here
- At the karaoke area
He speaks into the microphone
Hello everyone
First of all 'd like to thank Steven for being such a terific host
Steven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud
Don't forget to kick in some spinach for the beer
Steven ain't made of money
And  expect some of you to join in the clean up crew
Sing something
Do a song
(false coyness) No
really couldn't
Come on
Do your song
Okay, just to stop that guy from begging
This number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house
He puts on a Janet Jackson type microphone, then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song "Bust Move," accompanied by elaborate dance moves
(rapping) (Lyrics to "Bust  Move
") During the musical break the Cable Guy begins to break dance
He knows all the moves
The robot, the spider, the crab
He looks like a deranged cast member or "Electric Boogaloo
" The guests go crazy
You sounded just like Olivia Newton John
've been practicing for years
(laughs) So what do you do
can barely hear you
Do you want to talk in the other room
Oh
okay
They walk into Steven's bedroom
(Lyrics to "Bust  Move
") 38
- Steven and Heather are sitting on the bed talking
She says she wants a break, and that's fine with me
think  needed some time also
Yeah
know what you mean
She leans in and kisses him
39
- The cable Guy has got all of the guests in a frenzy
(Lyrics to "Bust  Move
") 40
'  - Steven and Heather are kissing passionately
Suddenly the door flies open, and the Cable Guy dances into the room, takes out a Polaroid instamatic camera and    of them
Steven is disoriented
Behind the Cable Guy in the hallway is everyone from the party
(Lyrics to "Bust  Move
") He continues to rap, dance and flash pictures of everyone as he dances out of the room
41
'  - Steven walks into the living room looking a little disheveled
The Cable Guy is cooking him breakfast
Good morning sleepy head
hope you don't mind,  crashed on the couch
Bacon and eggs coming up
Where did Heather go
heard her slip out early this morning
What a night
That was just what needed
(Revision Ends - Blue) You look like a new man
feel like a new man
was getting so used to being rejected
really liked her
Hey, it was my treat
(taken aback) What do you mean it was "your treat
" You know,  bought this time, you buy next time
(getting concerned) Buy what
You know, the women
You mean Heather is a prostitute
Of course she is
Do you think a woman like that would hang out with us if we weren't paying
Don't tell me you didn't know
can't believe this
He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain
She's clean  assure you
tried her out last week to make sure she was top quality, and 'm as healthy as a horse
Not a drip
She's the best, ask any of my friends
Steven cringes
You've got to be kidding
Please tell me she's a friend of yours
You're just playing with my mind again, right
wish  had friends like that
Get out of my house
Don't be ashamed of yourself
know she was a working girl, but she kind of liked you
You might have been able to get a freebie
Out, now
don't ever want to see you again
(to himself) Robin is never going to forgive me
'll tell you how to handle that
Don't tell her
You want to get her back, 'll help you get her back
don't want your help
want you to leave
(gestures to the ) And take that stuff out of here
(calmly) Whatever
can take a hint
'll see ya'
The Cable Guy exits
42 43
- Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant
We move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van
He watches them from across the street moment later he heads inside
44
- The Cable Guy enters the restaurant
The  walks over to him
May  help you
No, 'm meeting someone here
He looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table
They are on a date
The Cable Guy looks angry
He walks to the restroom
45
- An    stands in front of the sinks
On the counter sits a variety of toiletries
washes his hands
The bathroom attendant hands him some paper towels
The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits
Most appreciated
The Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant
He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar bill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose
You've been working hard
Take a break
46
- Robin is talking to her date
He is handsome, and somewhat goofy
They have empty salad plates in front of them
My brother and  wanna start our own sun block company
But the twist is, it's only for skiing
SkiBlock
Or SunSki
We haven't decided yet
Maybe BlockSki
Do you think that sounds good
BlockSki
That sounds right
So, Gail told me you're just coming off a relationship
Well, not really
We're kind of in a holding pattern
He wants more of a commitment, but  don't think 'm ready
just want to have a good time for a while
Then we got to get you on a Skidoo
Skidoo
High powered snow mobile
It'll blow your mind
It flies over powder like it's glass
Their waitress passes by
(impatiently) Hey, how are you doing on that chicken
Have the eggs hatched yet
Thanks
Robin is mortified by his behavior
So, how's your work going
It's been crazy
They just hired a Hold that thought
have to use the rest room
Be right back
He leaves
Robin looks relieved to have a break
47
- Ray enters the restroom
The Cable Guy is now wearing the bathroom attendant's blue shirt white pants and a thin fake moustache
walks over and washes his hands
(to Cable guy) Towel please
My pleasure
The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them furiously
When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're dry
The man is aghast
Enjoy your meal The man exits
Ray walks toward the stalls
Good evening sir
Pleasant night, isn't it
(curt) Yeah
But  guess the weather's always pleasant in here
The winters are remarkably mild
He laughs at his own joke
Ray walks into the handicapped stall
() If you need anything, just let me know
Anything at all
(getting annoyed) think  can handle it
Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up
Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy is standing right behind him
He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him
'm here to serve you
Jesus
Get out of here
Most people never bother to take advantage of all my services, for instance The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around
Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong
can help you wash up
Cleanliness is so very important
He pulls his face out
Then once you're done  have a variety of skin care products which can make you look years younger
The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter
He grabs a bottle of lotion
This lotion is superb at removing liver spots
He slaps it onto Ray's face
This one is an excellent moisturizer
The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's about to put it on Ray's face
And one can never underestimate the effects of a good cologne
The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face
(sniffs) Mm
High Karate
And now a touch of powder
He takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him
(grabs a tweezer) Ooh,  almost forget, it's oh so very important to be properly tweezed
The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows
You're on a big date, you'll need fresh breath
He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth
Whoops, that's not mouth wash
But that reminds me
Proper hair care is a must
The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part
Looking good, now let's dry you off
He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer
It turns on
The Cable Guy puts his face right up next to the air
Now suck it
Suck the air
Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut experiencing heavy -Force
from this angle you look just like Neil Armstrong experiencing -Force believe you have the "right stuff
" The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket
Don't worry about the tip
But 've got one for you
(whispers into his ear) Stay away from Robin
She's taken
He tosses him out the door
47A
- The door opens, and Ray falls to the floor
47B
- Robin sits alone at her table
She looks at her watch
In the background the Cable Guy slips out
48 49
'   - Steven is watching television while eating a  dinner
- Here's a bizarre story from downtown, where a man was beaten in a restroom by an assailant disguised as a bathroom attendant
The victim has been unable to speak since the unmotivated attack
We see the image of a shaken up  being led out of the restaurant by two police officers
police sketch artist put together this drawing from witnesses' descriptions
We see a drawing which looks a little like the Cable Guy
In it he has a moustache and appears to be Hispanic
Steven looks carefully
Does he know that man
Nah
He changes the channel
- the  logo flies up, followed by a slick promo for a  Movie-of-the-Week on the Sam Sweet trial
(
) Tonight on Fox, the true story behind the trial that's captured the nation
We see   holding a shotgun, pointed at another scared
(
) The jury may still be out, but the chilling facts are in

Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris
(points) It's right upstairs
50
'  - There is a
Robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain
Who is it
The Cable Guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible
It's the Cable Guy
There's no problem with my cable
've got an upgrade order for one Robin Harris
The Rainbow package, that's every pay channel available
didn't order this
Apparently you've got a secret admirer
She unlocks the chain, and the Cable Guy quickly steps inside
Was it a man named Steven
can't tell you
Come on
No,  promised Steven  wouldn't say
He gave it away on purpose
They both laugh
Whoops,  slipped
Well you didn't hear it from me
51
- The Cable Guy is in the air duct
He is pulling cord
He reaches an area of the duct which opens up to a vent
He looks through and sees Robin changing in the bedroom
He tries not to look at Robin undress
He turns away
'm sorry Steven
'm just a man
He turns back and looks at her
He notices a birthmark on her back
52
- The Cable Guy is on his way out
That about does it
Enjoy
So, are you a friend of Steven's
'm proud to say  am
installed his cable recently, and we just hit it off
That's right
You fixed his cable the other night
(suspicious) So you guys are going out a lot
Not really
That man is devoted to you
You know 'm probably crossing a boundary telling you this, but he's really crazy about you
Did he say that
Only every five minutes
Quite frankly, 'm sick of hearing it
No, 'm just kidding with you
(looks her deeply in the eyes) He's a good man
He mentioned that you guys have had some problems
Well, it's a little complicated
It always is
You know  asked a woman to marry me once
She said she wanted to think about it
We agreed to take some time apart to re-assess our feelings
To give each other
(mockingly) space
(chokes up) Well, she is no longer with us
'm so sorry
Sometimes you don't have the time you think you have
Just promise me you'll never go bungee jumping in Mexico
promise
(embarrassed that he spoke too much) Anyway, 've got to go
He quickly departs
We hold on Robin for a beat
53
'  - The Cable Guy smiles, proud of himself
53A
- Establishing shot of the building
We hear Steven's cellular phone ring
53B
-  - Steven holds on a cellular phone as he walks down the long Gothic hallway of a half renovated school house
Around him construction workers go about their business
Hello
() love you
Robin
54
'  - Robin is on the phone
Yes
(surprised) love you too
That was so sweet of you
(playing along) Oh
well
You didn't have to do that
wanted to
Giving me free cable
Only you would do that
You got it
Great
Yes, your friend came by
My friend
The Cable Guy
liked him
He was kind of goofy, but nice
Thank you so much for doing that
'm
glad you liked it
've wanted to do something nice for you, but 've been trying to give you your space
Well,  don't think we should make rules anymore
Okay
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) Call me later if you're around
Sure
'll call you as son as  get home
Bye
Steven is elated
He can barely contain himself
(
) Steven, are you ready to go
Steven turns and sees Rick wearing a "Soundgarden" -shirt
(pained) The concert
Oh Jesus
What
Robin just called
think we're getting back together
(pissed) So you're blowing me off
can't believe this
This is the first time she asked to get back together
You do this every time
You only call me after a girl breaks your heart
"Oh Rick can  stay on your couch
Let's talk all night about how mean girls are
" Then as soon as a relationship starts again it's bye-bye Rick
don't know why fall for it anymore
55 56
'  - It is raining
Rick pulls up, and drops Steven off
Can't you get someone else to go
(Revision Ends - Blue) Maybe 'll take  cable guy
Steven gets out of the car
Rick drives off
Steven walks up the steps to his apartment
The Cable Guy appears from behind a corner
Pretty smooth work
set 'em up, you knock 'em down
What
Robin
got her back for you
juiced her up
How do you know we're back together
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac
don't want you messing around with my life
You've caused enough trouble as it is
know
felt bad about the other night, so  wanted to make it up to you
So what are you doing
Do you want to catch a bite
Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye
(sincerely yet curt) Look,  appreciate you helping me out with Robin
But you have to understand, 'm going to have to work extra hard to not screw this relationship up again
You're a great guy, but  just don't have any room in my life for a new friend
Do you understand
appreciate your honesty
You're a real straight shooter
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) So, you're okay
Hey, 'm a big boy
It's no big deal
Whatever
All right
well, take care
Have a good one
The Cable Guy walks away
Steven stands there feeling a little guilty about what he just did
57
'  - - Conan 'Brien is doing a monologue joke about Sam Sweet
Steven and Robin are kissing
Outside it is raining
There is occasional lightning and thunder
In the middle of kissing, lightning flashes
Steven looks up and sees a flash of the Cable Guy staring down at them, his faced pressed against the skylight
In the next flash he is gone
Was it real
Steven looks scared
Are you alright
'm fine
They go back to kissing
57A
/
'  - The Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone
As the conversation continues we slowly pull back and reveal that the Cable Guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole, dressed as a phone company employee
He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the telephone pole
Hey, it's Chip Douglas
Chip Douglas
Your cable guy
(Revision Ends - Blue) (surprised to hear from him) Oh, hi
What's up
feel kind of weird calling you
It's just
'm worried about Steven
What is it
Something isn't right
He hasn't been himself lately
Have you noticed anything
No, things are actually going really well
Good
Should  be worried
Nope
'm probably just being a nervous nellie
Let's just keep our eyes open
(nervous) will
Good-bye
She hangs up, then dials Steven's number
Steven Bartowsky please
57B
' '  - His secretary, , answers the phone
Sorry Robin
He's in a meeting
58
- dozen of the top employees of the company Steven works for are having a meeting
Steven listens intently as a   speaks to the group
The response to our initial offering has been remarkable
local investment group has decided to buy the entire complex and turn them into rentals
In retrospect  must admit we made one big mistake
Everyone hangs on his every word
We should have asked for more money
The entire room laughs
Mr
Daniels stands up
just want to put this out there, Stevey
You did it bro
You laid your cajones, and mine, out on the table, and you slam dunked it
Way to go
(nervously jokes) Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs ahead of me
All right, in other business
As Mr
Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door
(quietly) Pssst
Steven
Steven turns and sees her
She waves for him to come to her
He waves her off
(more urgently-quietly) really need to speak with you
Some people are beginning to notice this exchange
(curtly) It can wait
Right then two   storm into the room
Joan stands behind them looking concerned
Is there a Steven Bartowsky here
Uh
'm Steven Bartowsky
What's going on
You are under arrest
On what charge
Receipt of stolen merchandise
What
never Please put our hands on the table
Steven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer
The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his club
Steven groans, then leans over in pain
Please follow my instructions
Hands on the table
Steven puts his hands on the table
The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of everyone
It is pure humiliation
Hands behind your back
The other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around
#2 You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law
You have the right to an attorney
If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you
Do you understand
This is all a mistake
didn't accept any stolen goods
Just then it hits him
He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head
(
) (with echo) you're getting  quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants  cream in his pants
He pushes him toward the door
Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away
He tries to break the tension with a joke
Hey, relax
'm the one who's going to jail
Nobody laughs
He exits
59
- Steven is walked to a police car, and put inside
We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop
He is looking under the hood of his car
Apparently it has broken down
The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly watching Steven's humiliation
As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable guy and touches his nose
The Cable Guy touches his nose
60
- Steven is chained to a bench
He is speaking to his father , a stout man of sixty, and his can't believe you did this
didn't do anything
My cable guy gave me all that stuff as a present
stereo system and a big screen  as a present
You expect me to believe that
You know you're killing your mother with this
swear it's true
Why would you accept such extravagant gifts
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) don't know
shouldn't have
What is really going on here Steven
Are you on something
'm fine
didn't do anything
Please call my cable guy, his name is Ernie Douglas
Steven, the police looked into it, nobody named Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable Company
' You want to tell us the truth now (falling apart) That's got to be a mistake
Oh, this is not happening
Yes it is, and it's killing your mother
Did you deliberately want to ruin our fortieth anniversary party on Monday, Steven
Yeah, Dad,  did
It's all a big plan
(to the lawyer) When can you get me out of here
Unfortunately it's too late to get a bail hearing today
You're going to have to spend the weekend in county lock up
The entire weekend
61 (Revision Ends - Blue) 62
- Steven is now wearing prison blues
He holds a pillow and a set of sheets as he walks down the long corridor to his cell
Lining each side are cells filled with angry prisoners who throw things at Steven, and taunt him as he walks by
It is a nightmare
#1 New meat
Look at the pretty boy
#2 Nobody touches him, he's mine
You touch him, you're dead
#3 Is baby scared
Don't cry baby
They all laugh and scream at him until he reaches his cell
guard opens the door
Steven enters his cell
He turns and inside is an angry looking prisoner
The door is locked behind him
Ooh, looks like  won the lottery
63 64
- guard walks Steven in
His lawyer sits on the other side of the glass with his back to Steven
Steven sits down and picks up the phone, excited to hear any news
What did you hear
What did you hear
The man turns around
It is not Steven's lawyer, it is the Cable Guy dressed in an expensive suit
Hello Steven
came as soon as  heard
Steven's head sinks
Who are you
What's your real name
So many questions
Why are you doing this to me
didn't do this to you, you did this to you
You need to learn who your friends are
You set me up
taught you a lesson
can be your best friend, or your worst enemy
hope you'll choose the latter
mean, the former
You know what  mean
'll never be your friend
You need help
The Cable Guy absorbs the blow, then goes on the offensive
Right now  think you're the one who needs help
'm here to give you comfort
The Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass
Come on, touch it
Steven just stares at him
Come on
You need human contact
Touch it
will not touch it
The Cable Guy stands up, and begins unbuttoning his shirt
What are you doing
Stop it
Steven looks around frantically
know how you're feeling right now
The Cable Guy pushes his naked breast against the glass
Other prisoners are beginning to stare
(smacking the glass) Stop it
Stop it
'm here for you
(smacks the glass three times) Get off there
Are you trying to get me killed
The Cable Guy begins to laugh
(as he buttons his shirt) was just messing with your mind
That was from 'Midnight Express
' Awesome film
Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for the screenplay
Guard
Guard
Don't you worry about Robin, 'll make sure she's well taken care of
You go near her, 'll kill you
Steven lunges at the glass
Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit
Hey, this is the guy who framed me
The Cable Guy walks to his door
He turns to the guard at the door
(warmly) Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on Pay Per View
told you it's more fun when it's Free Per View
They both laugh
The door closes behind them

Robin is brought over to the table by a hostess
The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands up to be polite
He sits down in perfect synch with her
Hello
Hello
'm sorry we have to meet under these circumstances
Me too
Believe me
know we don't know each other very well, but we do have one thing in common, our concern for Steven
Well, you were right
Something's happening with him and he won't even acknowledge it
If he refuses to admit he has a problem, we may have to let him hit bottom
He's gonna need some tough love
(tentatively) You know his lawyer said that nobody named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company
(chuckles) Did he do a name search
'Cause  work under a pseudonym so the customers won't harass me at home
Kind of like a stripper
My real name is Larry, Larry Tate
And he's saying he received all the stereo equipment from you
( know, and 'm not mad
He's been cornered, so he's telling some wives tales
He doesn't mean to hurt me
just feel like  triggered this with him
It's not that  don't want to get married, it's just  felt like he wanted to get married just to get married don't deal well with pressure
Hey, welcome to the human race
We're not perfect
We all think we have to look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as witty as 'Seinfeld
' Give yourself a break
God  could go for turkey and mashed potatoes now
Comfort food
Bring it on
Exactly
She laughs
You've got a great laugh
Can  make a small request
'd like to hear it a little more often
She blushes

- - Hard Copy's  , sits behind his desk giving a news update
The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into chaos as a result of a videotape made a month after the killing
In this "Hard Copy" exclusive an apparently intoxicated Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his friends at a party
The judge has not decided whether this tape is admissible as evidence
We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party
The date and time are seen in the corner
Sam stands next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror
Sam gestures with a beer bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror
(to camera) Hey everyone
Look it's me and
(gestures to his reflection) my brother Stan
(waves at reflection) Hi Stan
It's so nice to see you
How are you feeling
(to camera) Look, he's alive
Sam punches the mirror, shattering it
(angry) Now he's dead
Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile
What
'm just goofing around
We pull back and reveal a group of police officers watching this on television
We pan over to Steven's father  paying bail
'm sorry dad
don't want to hear it
Do you know the pain you out your mother through
You're lucky she didn't die of a heart attack
didn't do anything
Just like you said you didn't steal that '-Men' comic book when you were eight
Then  found it in your underwear drawer
Will you ever stop mentioning that
This cost me a lot of money
You jump bail, and  swear 'll hire a bounty hunter to hunt you down
67
'  - Steven walks into his apartment, exhausted from his jail experience
He walks into the living room and sees several new frames on the wall
They are four foot blow ups of Polaroid photographs of Steven with his arm around the Cable Guy at the karaoke jam
The photos have been tinted in a stylish fashion
Steven angrily runs to the wall and takes them down

' '  - Steven and Robin are walking up the stairs to the front door
They are dressed up for his parents' anniversary party
(Revision Ends - Blue) Are you sure you're okay

You're not fine
When you say you're fine,  know you're not fine
just want to get this over with so can go home and get some rest
wanted you to know  invited your friend
He was concerned about you
Great

Bad
've been kind of blowing Rick off lately
He rings the doorbell
Not Rick
The door opens
Standing there, dressed to kill, is the Cable Guy
You can only come in if you came to rage
Steven is shocked
Robin walks in
When Steven walks in, the Cable Guy stops him
(to Robin) Is this guy cool
(to Steven) 'm just joshing
Come on in
They walk inside
70
' ' Steven turns to Robin
(enraged) What is he doing here
invited him
When did you invite him
At lunch the other day
At lunch
You had lunch with him
The Cable Guy walks over
Hello
You look great
She gives him a peck on the cheek
Steven winces
And you are a vision
Hello Steven
You're looking rested
Come here
He pulls the Cable Guy aside
Steven, what's with you tonight
'm getting some really weird energy from you
Maybe it's because  just got out of prison, where you sent me
should just drag you to the police right now
You can if you like, but 'd hate to have to show Robin this
He takes out a Polaroid of Steven kissing the hooker
You son of a bitch
The Cable Gut quickly puts it away
Come on Steven, let's just have a good time tonight
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) Robin, Earl and Steven's mother walk over
Steven, your mother and  had a long talk with your friend Larry here when he came over to screw in the cable
' (to the Cable Guy) Thank you again for that
(beat) We owe you an apology
didn't realize the seriousness of your problems
You're obviously going through some kind of personal hell and  need to be more understanding
We didn't get involved with things like that when  was your age
Steven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them
know we haven't been there for you lately but we're going to see you through this, 'cause we are a family
love you
He gives him a big hug
Steven grimaces
' You've got a good friend here
They walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre-dinner cocktails
Steven's brother  walks over to Steven
He carries a baby in a pouch
(winks) Hey buddy, we're with you
Keep your chin up
71
- As the Cable Guy charms Steven's family we pan across all of the guests laughing, and enjoying dinner
So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and he's chasing me, swinging like a mad man
'm yelling at him, 'hey, it's just a show
' (Revision Ends - Blue) ' He always takes things too seriously
Tell me something  don't know
This guy almost took my head off
Everybody laughs
The camera moves to Steven
He stares at the Cable Guy, his eyes filled with rage
'
The Cable Guy is talking and eating in -
- watching him
He is in normal motion
- eating in - - getting very irritated
What are you doing
As he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow motion
It's from "Goodfellas
" Remember the intro scene at the bar
'm Johnny Two Times
He moves in slow motion some more
Everyone laughs
, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun
/ Pow, pow, pow
You're under arrest
Everyone laughs
The Cable Guy starts running around the table
Tony makes chase, laughing all the way
You'll never catch me copper
The Cable Guy stops, grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose, and pretends it's a moustache
'm gonna wear a disguise
Steven looks at the Cable Guy and remembers something
'
- He sees the Cable Guy
The artist's rendering of the man who beat up Robin's date appears in front of the Cable Guy's face
Steven realizes that they are the same person
Steven gets a frightened look on his face
The kid points his gun at the Cable Guy and yells "pow
" The Cable Guy drops to the floor like he's been shot
Oh, you got me
The Cable Guy plays dead
The kid walks over to him
When he gets close, the Cable Guy lunges to grab him
(devil voice) Aaah
Nobody messes with me and lives
The kid screams with laughter and runs away
The Cable Guy chases him around the table and out of the room
Steven instantly fears for Tony's safety
He follows them
72-75 75A
- Steven walks around looking for Tony
Suddenly from behind a couch Tony and the Cable Guy pop out
/ Booo
Steven flies back, scared out of his wits
Tony and the Cable Guy start laughing hysterically
They have a grand 'ol time enjoying their little prank
Oh man, you should have seen your face
It was classic
Very funny
Tony, go to your mother
Tony immediately starts crying
He leaves
Look what you've done
know you beat up Robin's date
The Cable Guy's laughter stops on a dime
guess  did what you didn't have the guts to do
You stay away from Robin
(disturbed) Don't mess with me
'm feeling like a part of the family, and  like it
You should try it sometime
Steven's mother enters
' (looks at them) My, you two look like brothers
Come on back, we're all having coffee in the living room
Cable Guy quickly starts walking back to the dining room
(happily) Are you guys trying to fatten me up
'Cause if you are, you're doing a damn good job of it
He laughs, and exits
Steven slowly follows
76-78 79
- Everyone is sitting around having coffee
The Cable Guy is writing words on torn up pieces of paper
You guys have never played "Porno Password
" No, but  like the sound of it
It's the adult version of the popular television game show
Robin you're on my team
Steven, you're with mom
(to everyone else) You're the audience
The Cable Guy sits next to Robin
Steven and his mother sit across from them
The Cable Guy looks at the word, then shows it to the family so none of the contestants can see it
He whispers it in Steven's ear
(whispers) The password is
vagina
Steven winces
really don't want to play this game
(looks to his mother) Woman
Woman
' Uh
man
No
(to Robin) Pe-nis

Robin concentrates hard, but she can't figure it out
Peeee-nis

Vagina
(pumps his fist) Yes
He high fives Robin
Everyone laughs
(blurts out) thought it was going to be schlong
(covers his mouth - embarrassed) Whoops
Everyone laughs
They are all having a great time, except Steven
The Cable Guy looks at the next word, shows it to the family privately, then whipsers to Steven
The password is
nipple
Can  pass
Come on Steven, don't be a stick in the mud
Breast
Breast
' Tit
Everyone laughs
Steven's face is red

Everyone laughs
Steven looks like he might kill the Cable Guy
Center
Center
' Nipple
Everyone cheers
' can't believe  got it
was going to say areola
Everyone laughs except Steven, who is mortified
wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead
The Cable Guy shows the word to everyone, then whispers in Steven's ear
The password is
'm not sure how to pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or clit-oris
(snaps) can't say that to my mother
Hey, she's a grown woman
She can handle it
Come on Steven
We're just having fun
No, 've had enough
can't do this
This guy is ruining my life,  won't sit here and play -rated party games with him
Steven,  really think you're over- reacting
am not over-reacting
You're all being fooled by this guy
He's a felon for Christ sake
(to the Cable Guy) hate you
Get out of my life
'm sorry everyone
If  am a nuisance, will leave
would never stay where am not wanted
(to the Cable Guy) You're not a nuisance
Please don't go
(to Steven) Steven, you're being an asshole
Yeah, Steven it seems like you're the one with the problem
What
You have no idea what this guy is really like
'll just go
See what  mean
Steven, what's with you tonight
(gets close to Steven and whispers) Robin showed me that birthmark on her left shoulder
It's very sexy
Steven punches the Cable Guy in the facem sending him to the floor
All of the women, including Robin run to help him
(to Steven) can't believe you
The Cable Guy gets up
'm fine
Thank you for a delightful evening
(to Steven) forgive you
He exits
Everyone looks at Steven like he is the devil
You don't understand
Everyone walks away from Steven
The party is over
80
- Robin is venting her anger at Steven as they walk to the car
just think you were completely out of line
don't know what's happening to you these days
Steven gets fed up
Robin, this guy is a sociopath
He leaves messages on my machine night and day
He shows up wherever  go
He won't leave me alone
Sounds familiar
You know he was the one who beat up your date at that restaurant
That's right
And he gave you the free cable
It wasn't me
But you took the credit for it
That's what he wanted
He was manipulating me
It feels so good to be honest about this
We're finally communicating
've been wanting to tell you for so long, but he's been blackmailing me
Blackmailing you
How
With a photograph
Of what
Me with a
prostitute
What
He set it up
He invited this woman to my party and didn't tell me she was a prostitute
'm so glad we can talk about this
When did you have a party
When we weren't communicating
invited you
You were out on a date
And you were with a prostitute
She seduced me
That's what they do
They're professionals
And  didn't even know she was a prostitute
So that makes it better
That's not the point
The point is this guy has been setting me up
He's responsible
He didn't have sex with a whore
You did
Robin you don't -- don't want to hear it
Breaking up was the best thing we ever did
You have some serious problems, and it's not my responsibility to help you
am only responsible for my own happiness
Where did that come from
It was Jerry Springer's "final thought
" She exits
80A
- Rick is running to an editing bay
Steven follows him
'm sorry 've been blowing you off
You bet your ass you've been blowing me off
It's just, this guy is really doing a number on me
told you not to hang out with him
You're the one who told me to offer him money so  could get free cable
You didn't tell me he was a psychopath
(beat) 'll see if  can get my friend in research to track him down
What's his name again
Ernie Douglas
Ernie Douglas
Ernie Douglas
Why does that sound so familiar

'  - Steven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television
On the  - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman
Joan changes channels
The image changes to   interviewing regarding "the abuse excuse

(to his secretary) Did anyone notice 'm late
What are you talking about, you've been here for an hour
Thank you
Steven walks to his office
81A
'  - Steven walks behind his desk
He notices something which disturbs him
His computer is on
He clicks a button and a message comes on the screen
- "
' " Then an image comes on the screen
It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the computer format
The video is of Robin and Steven talking
It is the conversation they had before they watched "Sleepless in Seattle
" Work's good
How's Hal
Don't get me started
That guy has no vision
It's like working for Mr
MaGoo
He's just worthless
It's just great that you're getting to do it
It's a real step up
know
Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then could really get some stuff done
The sccene starts again
It is on a loop
Steven is aghast
He looks up and sees the scene is playing on every computer in the office
He gets a panicked look on his face
Is Hal seeing this
He runs out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this
81B	  - Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down
'
- He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office
- He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can

Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer
He looks up and sees Steven
Don't worry
didn't see it --- 'cause have no vision
Steven knows what's coming
82 82A 82B 82C
- Steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings
He has been fired
Suddenly a car alarm beeps
It's headlights flash
Then another, and another
Soon he is surrounded by screaming car alarms, and flashing headlights
He looks around in fear
Chip
Chip, this isn't funny
Where are you
Suddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through the garage
Steven runs to his car, and gets in
He drives up the ramp in a panic
From out of nowhere the Cable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights
He cannot stop in time
The Cable Guy is thrown into the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car
Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar of the luggage rack
Steven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him
As Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the hood, and stares at Steven through the windshield
Steven swerves around, almost losing control of the car
Leave me alone
have no job, no girlfriend, no family anymore
It's over
You won
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) (menacingly) Oh no
It's not over
It's just gettin' started
He turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car
The Cable Guy falls to the ground, rolling many times, then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll, and runs off, scampering like a supernatural bug

- - The local news
The jury has notified the judge that they are very close to reaching a verdict, and would like to keep deliberating into the evening hours
Rick is sitting at his desk
walks over, and sits down
There are five people named Ernie Douglas in this county
Two are African American
One is eighty-five years old
One is eleven years old, and the last one is in a wheelchair
So we're nowhere
Ernie Douglas
Ernie Douglas
She begins tapping her foot nervously
Could you stop that
Don't snap at me
'm doing this as a favor
He continues staring at her two-tone wing tipped style shoe
(has an epiphany) Wait, could you start that again
Start tapping your foot again
She begins tapping
Rick begins humming the theme to "My Three Sons
" She joins him
They sing louder and louder
They've broken the code
(Revision Ends - Blue) 96
'  - The
Steven runs in the front door, and picks up the phone
Hello
() Bingo
"My Three Sons
" Chip and Ernie Douglas
97
-  - Rick sits at his desk
The researcher is at his side
've got a list of every cable installer fired in the last four years
Every one of these guys has the same physical description as our friend
(reads from the list) Murray Slaughter, Brendan Walsh, Sam Malone, Alex Reiger
There was even a guy who liked to be called 'the big Ragu
' 97AA
'   - Steven walks in and looks for the Cable Guy's hidden camera as he speaks on the phone
Carmine from "Laverne and Shirley
" That's so sad that you know that
Anyway, the cable company in town fired a guy six months ago named Darren Stevens
He stole the truck and disappeared
That's our guy
Steven finds a small camera in one of the television speakers
He rips it out
So he doesn't even work for the Cable Company
97A
'  - Quick cuts of Steven bolting doors, and locking windows
() He was fired for beating up a customer who yelled at him for being late company in Denver thinks they might have a lead on who he really is
If  were you 'd lock down tonight
'll call you when  get some more info
98
'  - Steven is watching television
He struggles to stay awake
- Court
The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking
( ) Don't let your memories of these cute twins distract you from the fact that this funny star of a situation comedy killed his own brother in cold blood, then called the police and said he was killed by an Asian gang
There was no laugh-track on that night
The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep
99	  -
The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar
- We see the Sam Sweet trial
prosecutor makes a passionate final summation
We reveal that it is the Cable Guy
This man killed his own brother
Some people don't even have a brother
The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face
He looks to camera
do they Steven
Are you listening to me
Don't shut it off
Don't shut it -- - He shuts off the , and walks out of the room
100
'  - The entire apartment appears much larger
Steven walks down the hallway
He looks into the living room and sees Rick
Why do you keep icing me man
100A
- He opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom
The shower is steaming
The two eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky
He quickly closes the door
100B
- He continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he sees Robin's bedroom
100C
'  - Robin is in bed
man wearing a cable installer's uniform is smothering her with a pillow
The man turns -- it is Steven
He quickly closes the door
100D
- He hears someone pounding on the front door
He opens the door
Nobody is there
Then the Cable Guy pops into frame holding a cut cord
You owe me
Steven slams the door
Then looks through the peep hole
101 The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door
As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and more distorted as he come closer to the peephole
He hits the door
Then disappears from frame
moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs again to the door even faster
He staggers back into position again
He runs toward the door
102
'  - Steven runs away from the front door
The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him
Steven runs away down the hallway
The hallway appears to be a mile long
He tries to run fast but appears to move in almost slow motion
Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf
He looks back another time and the Cable Guy is gone
He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through
He becomes trapped at the end of the hall
Arms come out of the window behind him and grab him
Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides
just want to hang out
No big deal
Steven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room
103 104
- Steven runs in
The television is on
He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do
He puts his head down
When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set
The Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger
Steven, you're just like me
We're cut from the same cloth
We're one and the same
Then it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television
105
'   - Steven wakes up in a cold sweat
(panting) Oh my god
She's right
am a smotherer
'm just like him
The phone rings
Hello
() It didn't have to come to this Steven
We could have been blood brothers
Rick told me you were fired from The Cable Company
You're not even a real cable guy
106
- Close up of the Cable Guy's face
Do you feel good now that you've hurt me
Well now 'm going to have to hurt you
'm going to take away what you hold dearest in the world
() swear to God, if you touch -- Could you hold on a second, 've got call waiting
It'll just be a sec
He clicks over
Steven just sits there, waiting
Waiting some more
Then the Cable Guy clicks back
Sorry about that
Where was
Oh yeah
You're going to feel my wrath
107
'  - (pleading) Don't do this
There must be some way for us to work this out
108
- wish there was
(losing it) Oh Steven, 'm just so tired
So very tired
Let's talk in person
Where are you
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 'm close
So very close
The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down
Then the camera rises up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven
single beam of light shines across his face
As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his face
He never acknowledges it
You know,  don't think you're right for Robin
She needs someone who can be sensitive to her needs
Someone who understands her soul
You stay away from her
Aren't we the control freak
Looks like you're starting to sweat
got the camera
You can't see me
Steven begins to pick his face
Oh yeah
Then why are you picking your face
Steven throws the phone
When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on
He begins looking for the camera
He smashes his
- Steven tearing through everything in his apartment
You're getting closer
Steven overturns a  rack
Pity, such a nice  rack
You know sometimes the answer is right under your nose
Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax
He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out
He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing
Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face into the space in the floor
The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad man
He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole
Steven falls back
He hears the Cable Guy scuttle away
Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit
He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, then through the side walls, and away into the distance
When it clears he discovers a small makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace
There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards
One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing next to his mother
Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the Cable Guy's brother
The only other photo is of Jerry Springer
Steven sees a small television monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him
He looks at a cellular phone
Every speed dial on the back of the phone says "Steven" next to it
Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door
108A
'   - It is raining lightly outside
Steven is in his car
He pulls away quickly
109
'  - Rick sits at his desk
The
Hello
109AA
- Super Close Up - What the audience will think is Steven's mouth (actually the Cable Guy) speaking on a cellular phone
Hey Rick
need to meet with you right away
've got some information about this crazy cable guy
Me too
've got the whole story
That's great
Let's meet at the old school at nine-thirty
Why all the way out there
think he's been following me
Don't be late, buddy
109AB
'  - Steven's car screeches to a stop
He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking
Her opens her door
Be home
Be home
Go away
remember you
You're her obsessive boyfriend
She said you might come here
'm calling the police
She closers her door
He runs off
109A
- Rick drives up, then walks into the building
110
- Rick walks through the school looking for Steven
Steven
Steven
In the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows
Hey Rick
'm really excited to hear what you found out about this nut
hit the Holy Grail
This guy is deeply troubled
Only child
His mother was arrested for prostitution, and phone solicitation
Apparently she was some phone sex pioneer
No way
And get this, he was discharged from the Marines
He got mad at his Sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two using a Radio Shack computer
And that's not the half of it
As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp)
Really
Tell me more
Rick's face turns white
He stumbles backwards, trying to get away
'm very interested in learning everything  can about that wacked out cable installer
He turns and runs
He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy
The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy
He pulls out a staple gun, and fires
We hear but do not see Rick yelp, and fall
It sounds like he might hurt somebody
110A
'  - Steven is driving in his car
His cellular phone rings
He picks it up
(panicked) Hello
() (talks like a game show host) Nosey friends for two hundred
This supposed pal of Steven's is currently residing in the intensive care unit of Good Samaritan Hospital
Rick
() 'm sorry, you didn't answer in the form of a question
He hangs up
111 111A
- Steven's car pulls up
He gets out, and runs toward the hospital
112
- Steven flies through the swinging doors, and runs through the hallway of the hospital
He walks up to a
(rapid fire) Rick Legatos
He's a friend of mine
Where is he
Room 205
Can  see him
Yes
But he can't speak
He's in shock
113
- Steven enters the room
The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his rear end heavily bandaged
He is unconscious
Steven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end
He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and sees that his butt is covered with staples
The staples form the shape of a television with an antenna
Inside the  is the word "
" (perplexed) Ring
The phone rings
Steven jumps, then picks up the phone
Hello
() Poor Rick
Seems he had a little accident with the business end of a staple gun
(Revision Ends - Blue) You're not going to get away with this
The question is, are you going to get away with it
Apparently there was an anonymous tip placed to the police leading them to a staple gun at the crime scene with your fingerprints all over it
() All right, 'm ready
114-6	 (     106) 116A
'  -  - We reveal that the Cable Guy is at Robin's apartment
They are getting ready to go out
(non psychotic voice) Be right there
Was that Robin
(psychotic again) 've got to go
We're going to take a romantic stroll on the information superhighway
Steven drops the phone, and runs out of the room
116B
- Steven runs down the hall to the elevator
Before he reaches it the doors open, and the two policemen who arrested him at work walk out
Steven quickly turns left, but the policemen see him, and make chase
Hey, hold it
116C
- Steven runs out of the hospital
The two policemen run after him, about twenty feet behind
Steven jumps in his car, and takes off
The police follow in their car
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 116D
- Steven's car turns a corner, and flies down a busy boulevard
second later the police cars follow with sirens blaring
116E
- The Cable Guy and Robin are at the dish
He gives her the same tour he gave Steven earlier in the film
it all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod Electronics, created the first cable television system
116F
- The chase continues
116G
- The Cable Guy and Robin are now standing on the edge of the dish
The future is now
Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer
You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another
You can do your shopping at home, or play a game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam
117
- The chase continues
Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour
He weaves in and out of traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles
The police cars disappear behind him
On a dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights
moment later all of the police cars pass by
Steven pulls out and heads the other way
117A
- This is really fascinating, but  really think we ought to go now
knew you'd appreciate it
took Steven here once, and he didn't give a rats ass about my interests
'm worried about Steven
Maybe Steven should be worried about you
(beat) So, where was
118	 (    109AB) 119 120 121 122
- Steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road
It gets stuck in the mud
He gets out of the car, and begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence
He hears the sounds of horse hooves coming closer, and closer
The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight toward the fence
The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times
When he reaches it he smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through
The horse rears back on its hind legs
The horse runs full speed directly at Steven
At the last possible moment the horse jumps over Steven
When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat
(chuckles) Ichabod Crane
The Disney Channel showed it all last month
The Cable Guy rides toward him again
(like the Vegas announcer) Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble
(Revision Ends - Blue) This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him
They both slam into a puddle of mud
The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face
Where's Robin
This isn't about Robin, this is about you and me
Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy
Where's Robin
Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him
They are both covered in mud like warriors from the rain forest
Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head
Tell me
(nonchalantly) 'm sorry,  didn't catch the question
Steven brings down the rock
At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head
The rock slams into the ground
Steven you've changed
(beat - then impressed) like it
The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him
They wrestle on the ground
The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of his belt and turns it on
think it's time to make you cable ready
He slowly brings the drill down to Steven
Steven blindly reaches behind him
He grasps a large branch and bats the Cable Guy off him
The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven
They begin fighting in a fashion which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight
Last time we fought  let you win
Best two out of three
: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music
(crazed) You treat me like the
You use me, but you can't live without me
The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch
You can't shut me off with your remote control
'm not like Robin and Rick and Mommy and Daddy and brother and sister and cousin -- Steven smashes him in the head with the branch
got the point
The Cable Guy goes down
He appears to be unconscious
(in the distance) Steven
He looks to the dish, but cannot see her
123
- Steven climbs over the edge into the dish
Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled with several feet of rain water
Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish
is hanging by her bound hands from the center of where those wires meet
Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish
Help me Steven
In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at the top of the dish
Robin's eyes fill with terror
Steven
Look out
(mimics her) Yeah Steven
Look out
The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box
He slides down the dish, knocking Steven down
The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the water
(sweetly, like a girl) 've missed you
The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water
The Cable Guy dives on top of him
moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and speaks right into his face
(dramatically) "Dry land is not a myth, 've seen it
" Kevin Costner from Waterworld
don't know what the fuss was about, the movie ruled,  saw it six times
He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there
He pulls him up after a few moments
Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in this position
He pushes him under the water again
After a moment he pulls him back up
Steven gasps for air
Who would have thunk it
Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have knocked his jaw out of alignment
(without any lisp) You're gonna have to do better than that Steven
(realizing his lisp is gone) Steven
Hey, my lisp is gone
Steven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face
(lisping again) You stupid son of a bitch
The Cable Guy falls unconscious
Steven
Steven runs to her
124
- He runs to the side of the dish
He realizes he must climb up to release her
He climbs onto the and begins tightrope walking toward her
He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance several times
Hang on
: The opposite wire
The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it
He pulls himself up
(laughs maniacally) know what your saying
Who does this guy think he is, Jason
Stay away from her
Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire
saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony Curtis
He was just on "Life-styles of the Rich and Famous
" He still looks terrific
Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's landing makes Steven lose his balance
He falls over, but catches ont the wire
He is left hanging there
The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin
And the race is on
He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed
Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire
Robin sees this and joins him
The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance
(knows he's about to fall) This is such an anti-climactic way to end this
The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below
The Cable Guy has surely met his demise
125
- Steven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins
They are exhausted from their ordeal
They hold each other close
'm sorry  didn't believe you
love you
love you too
You're right
We shouldn't get married
've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you
We'll work them out together
They kiss
Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater
He looks frightening
Then he starts coughing uncontrollably
He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water
(between coughs) What just happened
Where am
(remembers) Oh yeah,  was trying to kill you
He leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock
He squeezes until Steven passes out
The he lays him on the ground
(to Robin) It's a sleeper hold
Hulk Hogan used it on Sly Stallone in "Rocky Three
" He should wake up in thirty seconds, so let's get going
He holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish
Steven slowly wakes up
He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the rdio antenna
He quickly gets up to follow them
126
- The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna
Steven follows them up from a distance
The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna
The Cable Guy holds Robin with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand
Steven climbs onto the platform
Easy
He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform
There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish below
police helicopter hovers in the air around them
It didn't have to be this way Steven
'm just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you mistreat people
Don't do anything stupid
You know this is just like that secen in that Clint Eastwood movie "Dirty Harry" -- (snaps) No
This is not like anything
This is not a movie
We're real people
You're hurting us
This is reality
The Cable Guy's eyes turn sad
This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch
Dazed, he lets go of Robin
She runs to Steven's arms
From below we hear the sound of sirens
pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna
The Cable Guy's expression changes
He begins to look like a scared little boy
If this is reality
(he climbs onto the guard railing) am outta here
The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna
Nooo
Steven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other hand
You're not going anywhere
The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish
Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved
Don't do this
You just need help
We all get lonely
Yeah, but  get really lonely
(beat) mean, look at me
You're gonna be fine
Just come on up
(a long beat) Steven,  think  sat too close to the television
Mommy was right
Steven can't hold onto his forearm any longer
The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto his hand at the last possible second
It's too late for me, but there's a lot of little Cable Boys out there who still have a chance
Say good-bye to the baby- sitter
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) The Cable Guy stops holding onto Steven's hand
He begins falling toward the dish below

By unanimous vote the defendant Sam Sweet

- The television shows white noise
Everyone screams at the
129 130 131
- The Cable Guy appears dead
The needle of the antenna sticks through his mid-section
red light blinks at the tip of the needle
Then, the Cable Guy's eyes open
Damn, that hurt like a mother
What the hell was  thinking
(looks at the needle) Oh man, that stings
Steven and Robin look relieved
little help here
132 133 134
- pasty white couch potato stares at the white noise, not sure what to do
He turns and picks up a book
As music crescendos he begins to read
135
- The Cable Guy is being taken away on a stretcher toward an emergency helicopter
Steven and Robin are covered in police blankets
Steven calls to a paramedic
Is he going to be all right
don't know
It's in God's hands
The paramedics put the Cable Guy on the helicopter
The helicopter flies away
- From the helicopter looking down on Steven and Robin holding each other, getting smaller and smaller until they disappear
136
- The Cable Guy lies in a stretcher next to the paramedic
He is barely conscious, struggling for survival
Hang in there buddy
Stay with me
Just stay with me
The Cable Guy's eyes slowly open
He motions for the paramedic to come closer
Am  really your buddy
137
- The helicopter flies away
