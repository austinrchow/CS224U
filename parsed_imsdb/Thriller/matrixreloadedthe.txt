Written by Andy and Larry Wachowski April 8, 1999 : Dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky
We hear  wind as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere
We   into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker world of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real
The rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere
We  approach a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines
Blue flashes grow  in  intensity from the fissure
Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as we approach the fissure
(
) "Six o'clock, 300 meters
We can't outrun 'em
" (
) " know
Can't tow this crate fast enough
We gotta ditch it
" We hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police scanner
The woman is , the captain of the lead ship, Sephora
(
) "Can't, the core is still good
And they've got 'The One
'" (
) "Oooh, our savior
Hed better be worth it
" (
) "Shut up and make the exit
Hold on
" The azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming
tight convoy  of  three    explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables
The  blue glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the first and third hovercrafts
Between them, suspended by  tow  cables, is the dark, scorched,  and sliced
They  rocket upward, slowing as they reach the top of the arc
(
) "Woo-hoooh
" The rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second
The   flails wildly between them
(
) "They're still on us
" More vehicles fly from the fissure
massive army of   pours up onto the surface
The  is slung between the two , with the cockpit   facing backwards
,  ,  ,  and  ,  the  former  Thomas Anderson, crowd the cockpit
Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from them, while a wall of red-eyed  speeds to them
It's been a mere    since the realization of     and the defeat of
The slipstream whistles violently into  the interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their knocked-out ship
is on a headset
"Niobe, theyre closing
" "How many
" "Just a few
Maybe two or three
Hundred
" , as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her  ship with her co-pilot, a younger female
All visible dials are redlined as they streak over the dark surface
"Youve got a gift for understatement
" ,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying blind
His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from  ship
His lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen
As she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a tattoo is conspicuous
They switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass
"Oh shit, were screwed
We gotta set down and  em
" (
) "Too many
" racing   reaches the hull  and latches on,  striking up its cutting laser and ripping into the hull
(
) "Theyre on me
Shit
Losing power
" Lieutenant, a muscular Asian woman, Circa, notes something  on a console
"Multiple bogies closing
" "No shit
" "From the front
" Niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead
Several  objects are closing in fast
"Are they - " She doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters launch a massive  volley of missiles
From afar, they  look like dark irises  surrounded by  a corona  of flame
At first,  we can't   tell exactly what they  are, until their  fiery trails rip  straight at the cockpit
as the missiles harmlessly streak by
massive  swarm off  missiles blasts  by the  cockpit
The individual warheads  swerve  at  the last  second,  blowing   apart,  or casting them to the ground aflame
Niobe breathes a sigh of relief
Her lieutenant looks back up to see a wing of   - '' fly past their ship
Sleek,  with huge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage
"They're ours
" (
) "Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning
" The wing  of   makes short  work of  the squiddies
The half dozen clinging to ' hull  are picked off by well-placed  laser shots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag
The squiddies that survive turn tail and run
The crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave the scene of aerial carnage behind them
has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit
He relaxes his grip as their escape is clear
Their ship suddenly  enters a cave, and starts  to descend
The blue  wash of the ship  shows rock walls and pipes
The ships are slowing down as they descend back  into the earth
' shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair
"We're home
" "Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen
" "What's that
" " concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion
The fighters that just saved us constitute the first ring
" (
) "Neb crew, you can relax now
" "For the moment, perhaps
Its still a long drive home
" and : '
At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway diamonds on a black velvet background
The camera descends through the darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset
The artwork terminates in the metal ring going  around her room
It's a much  more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft
The  articles she's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin
An unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom
There are charcoal portraits  of loved ones
Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly
The  is still in tow
is sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him with her head on his lap
Neo cant sleep
He stares at the wall opposite him
There's a   photo of the crew of the , sans Trin, in better days
Smiling,   laughing as they are  seated around the  table
Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch, Epoch, Mouse
Neo stops on the image of a smiling
There's   an unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely
Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,   stands  and  examines the photo
She awakens
"'ll have to take that one down now
Cypher
" "Who is this guy
" "Who
" points to the mystery man
"That was
forgot his name
" "What happened to him
" is sullen
"He didnt make it
" returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed
Trinity sits up, awakening
"Was he like me
" nods
"Not you, though
Like you
There have been others, Neo
" "Aren't you tired
" "No
've never been a big sleeper
" " know
used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days
" He turns to her, questions in his eyes
"How many 'ones' have there been
" "That's not the point
" may not think so
"You are him
Youre mine
" "But what does it mean, to be The One
" " don't know, Neo
Our mission was to find you
" "So, now what
" "Now, Zion will give us a new mission
" The hatch swings open
peers in
"We're almost home
We'll need a detail
Five minutes
" closes the hatch and disappears
"Does he ever knock
" "Not on his ship
" : , The crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  to a rest
Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away
Tank   unlocks the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into   the tarmac with a resounding smash
: The tarmac  is a  busy, crowded  military airport,  with hovercraft of different  sizes  spread  across  the  lot
Its  housed  poorly  lit, houses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site
Crewpersons run around,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles
Munitions  are  carted across the tarmac on   robot rolling racks
No  one  pays the   and its battered crew any mind
Nearby, the  and   are parked
Their engines shut  down, and their powered hatches are open
The crewmembers are spilling out
hurries to ' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but their  military manner  is quickly  restored, though  they can  barely contain their grins
"Niobe
" shakes his hand, the shake slows down
"
" "Thanks for the rescue
" close for a kiss, when the ' captain suddenly jumps between them
It's  - the 's supposed neighbor and hacking financier
Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in ' face
"Brough, you us your asses
We saved you so hard core you don't even know
" smiles at Morpheus and fades back as  shouts his own praises
Morpheus turns to his less-mature peer
"So, you think you finally found The One, huh
Another One
" , ' , pushes into their conversation, looking offscreen
"Idiot, we helped him find him
Hello, Morpheus
" "Huh
" He looks at what she's seeing
His gaze halts on
He's concentrating on  and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be consoling him
He turns to see  and , does a double-take, and his jaw drops open
"You
" is quick to resume his cool
"In the flesh, so to speak
" "Welcome to the real world, Neo
'm glad you're here
" "What do you think, Dujour
Should we take him with us
" "Definitely
" "Morpheus
" turns from Niobe and  a Zion officer
He addresses  Trinity, glancing at the others
"Go on ship's liberty
Meet me in the Dead Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk or sober
" It's like a  valley floor running  between two gigantic  walls of rock that are  nearly vertical,  coming together  in an  elongated archway
Carved into the street level  are innumerable stores and shops,  above them,  apartments and  balconies that  rise to  the top  of the  arch
People  flow  through the  street
Their clothes  are  homespun wool, denim, and leather
Dyes and  color are absent
Carved into  the solid granite  walls,  between  homes  and  around  windows  and  doors, are intricate and beautiful carvings
is lead down  the street by ,  , and , and  a few other rebels
The push through a mult-culti crowd of people,  humanity melting into one race
"See, man
This is home
This is the main street
One of em, anyway
Almost everyone is a fighter
Sometimes, even the kids
pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small machines
"Our energy as a people is directed toward liberation
Check it out, here are some newcomers
" group of frail, buzz-cut androgonites pass by them
They look at , recognizing him as one of them, a new comer
"Where did they come from
" "Energy plant we raided on our last mission
There were some survivors
" "How are their minds freed from the Matrix
" "With difficulty
" "If at all
" They step into a club, Dead  Duck
Its a sailor joint
Lots  of wood, beer on tap, and rum
Crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels, greeting them, as they eye Neo
They take a booth in the  corner
The waitress arrives
"Welcome home, brothers and sisters
First day back
" "Yes, lovely
" "On the house, then
Four rums
" "Make it eight
" The waitress smirks and leaves
turns to
"Any casualties
" lights up and takes a drag
"Two
Sidewinder and Left-right
" " cant believe Cypher turned
Bastard
" "He who loses faith
" "Neo, we monitored your fight
Did you really gain enlightenment
" shrugs
"All  know is  kicked Smiths ass
" "Fuckin finally, Jesus Christ
Its about time we iced that bastard
" "Yeah, we finally won against an agent
" " guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh
" The drinks arrive
Tall glasses of rum
holds his glass aloft
They raise their glasses to toast
"Live free or die
" (save ) "Live free
" They slam the rum back, and  slam empty glasses on the table
can barely manage to sip his
"God, how do you do that
" "Youve never drank before
" "Not for real
" "You want to know what being The One means
" "What
" "One drink and youre toast
" "Neo, you know what else youve never done
" She glances at  Trinity, who falls  back against the  seat, turning to suppress a smile
Choi cracks up
"Yeah
" "Yeah, youve never done it
" "And virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count
" "Well
Ill drink to that
" "Here, here
" This time,  follows the others and slams back the entire glass
He coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on
" , The lights are dim, and only a few late night revelers stagger through the  streets  on their  way  back home
Walking  straight and  calmly through the stragglers are  and
"So, how do you like having your own command
" "Its good
But trying
The responsibility
" stop before the entrance to the
"You must be both mother and father to your crew
" nods, and looks into the bar
Inside, the crews are raging drunk and loud
"Who will you be now
The mother, or the father
" peers in on the scene and grins
"As long as they dont get out of line, Ill just be a brother
" is out of it, while the others are merely comfortably in the  bag
Hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet
"So, you went back in, and you two pulled him out
" nods,  herself in  disbelief
picks his  head up  off the table
"Kicked
kicked Smiths ass
" eyes  and  coming toward them
"Hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, Neo
Like Morpheus
" "Morpheus
Yeah,  smacked him around, too
" arrives just  in time to  hear the last  part
He stands  and grins down at
"So, you can smack me around, Neo
" "Oh yeah
Anytime
" taps him on the forehead
blinks and falls back into  the booth
He stands before them
"Hows Tank
" "Hes on bereavement leave with his mother
Dozer was the second son shes lost in this war
" His comments set a sober tone
"The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month
But, thats not giving us a rest
" "Let me guess
Weve been ordered back out anyway
" "Yes
This is another special op
Im in command, Niobe and Trinity are team leaders
Neo is our secret weapon
" : , passed out with his mouth open on the couch
"We dont know exactly what hes capable of
He may be just tapping his potential, or he may have already reached it
We are to learn from him, as he does from us
" "Why are we always getting screwed
Not only do  have to go straight back into the shit, but  lose my command, too
" "Youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, Choi
" "Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents to death
" "Oh my God thats so funny
My point is, dont we need some r-and-r
Unwind a little
We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five, right
Shit
Im glad we found Mr
Invincible, here, but Jesus
" "You dont have to go, Choi
Volunteers only
" "Hes got a point,
have faith, but why so quick
" "We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief
Our ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our entry
And Neos
" "Fuck
Every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do
" "He is the One
" "You havent lost the faith, have you Choi
" grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down
"Well, these are the times that try mens souls
Heres to victory
" The  hovers  slowly, silently, like  a submarine as  it cruises through  the murky  depths
It  suddenly comes  to a  quiet stop,  and descends
The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the cave
quartet of   slips by
We follow as  they worm their  ways through  the  twisted passageway,  watching  as they  pass  the bubble cockpit by mere feet
on the cockpit
Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi  at the controls
They watch the  fade into the distance
"Power up
Sleep mode
" "Aye aye, capitano
" cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark
The ships , a lean Asian  kid with a gaze like a  laser scan, sits behind  , whos  sitting at  the operators  console with  his hands on the abbreviated keyboard
Trinity sits with them, her feet up as she observes
stares  at  the  screen
Its  a  huge  syllabus  of Matrix  code characters
He struggles to learn the complex code
"Ka equals 9
But reverse Ka is point-nine, right
nods
"You catch on quick, man
" " know these symbols from the hacking trainer
But how come its so hard to find them on the keyboard
" "Your brain knows what to do
But it has to associate characters with your body
" "Its muscle memory, Neo
Think of the space bar and your thumbs nail it
Because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times
But think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit the reverse key and the ka key in one shot
" "Where did these symbols come from, anyway
" "Most of it is from the old Japanese
Its Katakana
See, the machines arent binary
No zero and one
Theyre quantum-based, so instead of an open-close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all numbers between zero and one
" "All numbers between zero and one
That could be an infinite number of numbers
" "Not could be, it is
" is astounded
"Holy shit
How many calculations per second
" "How many
Well, thats kind of hard to estimate
Put it this way: picture all the particles in the known universe
Not just atoms, but sub-atomic particles that compose atoms
" "
At last count that was what, a gazillion, right
Two gazillion
" barely smiles at the joke
"Well, its up there
In any case, the number of calculations per second the Matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of particles in the known universe
" "Woah
" "Thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds within their PCs
" "
Thats why it looks like reality
They have the computing power to create entire worlds
" "Right
" "So, if we hack into the Matrix, why cant we just change the code while were at it
" "No, no
See, its not that simple
The machines, the programs that code, create, and maintain the Matrix, the agents, they are code
There are different types of agents, many work unseen with no interaction in the matrix
Then, there are the enforcers, the ones we know all too well
" "Right
" "Well, my point is, the machines code and recode the Matrix by pure will
Interaction with the Matrix, the physical act of being there, by default, allows people to change their environment - the Matrix
They move objects, make sound, affect cause
" "Like reality
" "Almost
Reality is unalterable
But the fabric of reality in the Matrix can be rewoven
Some can reach beyond normal cause
Their affects on the Matrix are deeper than average
They have learned to change it according to their needs
But they dont have total control
Thats why we need operators like Razor here
But you, you go further than any of us can
" "How
" stands  and taps  Neos skull
He stretches,  grabs a  Japanese style  wooden  sword, and,  out  of boredom,  starts  performing slow, precise Kendo moves around the main deck as he talks
"The equipment you carry up here
Youre a freak
good freak
Youre neural kinetics blast past those of average humans
This, combined with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the reality of the Matrix
" "How did  end up as
a freak
" practices the same strike a few times
"Good question
The Machines create people through cloning, since, obviously, no coppertops have physical sex
Theoretically, all clones in the Matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones
They shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns
" ", so how do you explain me
" "Not just you
Morpheus, myself
We were all born inside
"Well, what separates us from others
" "For the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children in the Matrix
Theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines never predicted
Some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength
Others seem to have psychic powers
" looks up to see ,  hanging back as he listens
He  comes forward
"And others are able to change the reality of the Matrix itself
" points to Neo
"Discussing history, are we
" shakes his head
"Im trying to teach this fool some programming, man
Hes stuck in the 20^th century
Hes got no skills, man
Without us, hes helpless
" "In the Matrix, without him, were helpless
" "Morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now
" "Not until we reach broadcast depth
Its slow going out there guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling
We have time to rest and ready
" ,   () sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock
It looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world
All around her, as far as the eye can see, lie mountains
Their snow-capped peaks are pink in the sunset light
She looks into the sunset
Heavy thoughts weigh on her mind
hand appears on her shoulder
Its
How he got on the finger  of rock is anyones guess
"Boo
" grins slightly and pulls on his arm
There is only enough room for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her
"Dont lose your balance
" "It doesnt matter if  do
" "So, you can fly
" "Yes
" "Do you think  can
" " think you can do anything you want, if you believe
" "Like you

dont know exactly what  can do

"Will you teach me to fly
" " dont know if  can
" "Free your mind of doubt
" stands, and steps in front of
Hes on the very, very edge of the rock
He extends his  hand down to  her
She grabs  it, and he hauls her up
Her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below the finger
"In this construct program, the ground can kill
" " wont let you fall
Ever
" look  into each  others eyes
Despite the  trauma theyve  been through, and not even truly knowing one another, theres a connection
suddenly backs away
He walks on the air with perfect traction, as though hes on an invisible plane of glass
He leaves  standing precariously on  the edge,  wobbling a  bit as  she maintains  balance against  nerves
She  breathes  deep,  and  looks  back  up  at  , maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle
stands a few  feet away from her,  completely at ease as  the high altitude winds ruffle his hair
extends a hand to her
"Its not real, Trinity
Youre not standing there
Step out
can do it
You can, too
" With one last  glance at the  infinite drop, she  steadies herself and stares straight into his eyes
Blue meet brown
Breathless, she  steps straight out
She takes one step in the  air
For a breathless second, as  she steps off the edge,  she is stable
When she takes  her foot off  the edge, though, she sways,  and her foot  slips, as though  shes on a  greasy surface bobbing up and down
She corrects herself, tries another step, sags further
"Shit
" glances down, then locks eyes with
Then drops like an anvil
"Whoops
" dives down,  shooting like  a missile
is  calm, falling backwards, watching   come for her
The rocky ground  looms behind her
She makes no effort to reach for  as he draws close to her reaches for her with all his might
"Grab me
" makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is  seconds away
She stares at him intently
"Grab on to me
" she is doing  nothing, he goes beneath  her and scoops her  up, Superman  style
He  barely accomplishes  this  before  he slows  and settles onto the rocky ground
They are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains
"What the hell were you doing
" smiles slightly
Her madness has a purpose
"Showing you, Neo
" "Showing me what
You nearly gave me a heart attack
" " want you to know how much faith  have in you
" "Oh
And this requires acts of insanity
" smiles
She looks him up and down
She moves intimately close
"So, you really are Superman
" "Only when Im plugged in
" steps away
grabs her shoulder and turns her to him
He attempts a kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek
"What
" looks at him, then up at the sky
"Its not you
Just, not here
" doesnt understand
rolls her eyes
"Theyre watching us, you big dope
Do you know how horny computer geeks get
" ,  ,  , and    are sitting  around  the operators console, feet up, eating
On the screens are patchy images of and  standing together in  the
Its like theyre  watching a soap opera
and  are looking in their direction

"So romantic

() and   sit  across from  each other,  a steel  table between them
They stare  at each  other for  what seems  like a long time
There is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst  neat stacks of file folders
"Our defeat is worrisome
" "As is the loss of our colleague
" seething with anger
grinds his molars
"We cant defeat them
You saw what happened
" "We have a backup copy of Agent Smith

The city spreads before him
" backup is not good enough
We need to upgrade ourselves to meet the new threat
" opens a large file folder
"Hes being rebuilt
But  have an alternate plan
Why fight the humans, when we can let them fight for us
" "The terrorists have learned to bend our reality in ways we cannot
This was the cause of our defeat
" "Mr
Thomas
Anderson is not unique
Over the decades, many humans have developed
techniques for manipulating the Matrix
Techniques too primitive for us to understand
Most never realize their potential, but all the ones weve noticed exhibiting these talents are recorded here

Street shots of people  from all walks of life
Young rebels, corporate suits, junkies, housewives

"Do you have anyone in mind
" the book
It stops  on a page dedicated to someone  who looks like , but with long hair and an extremely bad attitude
There  are photos of him on  a motorcycle with a  blonde, photos of him  drinking with his gang friends
"Gregory Lowfield
He exhibits the traits we saw in Mr
Anderson
" (
) "Mr
Anderson no longer exists
Our enemy now is the one called

There  is a new swag to his  walk, and his hair is longer, tied back
"Youve been recreated
" flexes his arm, examines his hands, and feels his hair
"And you have more hair
" turns to him, examines the photos on the table
They lock  eyes
On  the same  wavelength, they  transfer knowledge  without speaking
looks at the photo on the table
" know what youre thinking
What we need is our own Neo

" "Ill make it possible

Quiet at  first, growing  louder as  it grows  dark, we  here the  rumble and  roar of motorcycles
() in the  distance, the  glow of  motorcycle headlights  racing toward us
As we zoom out and focus in, they are already too close  to avoid
They  rip  by  us, thundering  explosions  and  men  and women cheering
pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets
They fly down the highway using both lanes, drinking and driving with total abandon
the lead  motorcycle, a massive, custom-made  Harley , Thomas
Anderson without  a desk job, without cares,  revs his bike and locks  the accelerator
He hands  his beer to the  blonde who rides behind him, then, in one swift motion, jumps up on his seat, leaning into the slipstream
The feat is
,  , screams  at him  as she  grasps the seat and lowers herself to the bike
"Greg, are you fucking crazy
" "Yes
But dont worry
" She clings to  his legs as  they barrel down  the highway
They  blast pass a darkened cruiser
The cop sets his paper down just long enough to catch a glimpse of the pack exploding down the highway, with  surfing his bike
: the radar gun
Its flashing 125 "Holy shit
Drunk ass punks
" is facing us as he  drops back into his seat, taking  his beer on cue from
Behind them, the cops lights flare up
"Oh boy
Stop, stop, lets have some fun
" look  through the  windshield as  the cop  drives down the highway, calling in his  stop-vehicle report
He  suddenly sees something  that makes him slam on the brakes
"Holy shit
" the  cops windshield
The  ten bikers, with   at their center, are  parked in the  middle of the  road, looking at  him casually

Not the other way around

44 from his jacket and
The cruisers antenna  is blown off at the  base, and the nine-foot  whip flips onto the  ground with a metallic clang
The  is  lying half-on the  seat, taking cover
The handset relays only static
He reaches for his gun, but is frozen by Gregorys voice
"Dont try anything stupid, man
gotta bead on your donut-eating ass
" The cop comes out with his hands up
"Whaddya want with me
" " dont know
just thought Id find out what you wanted without you shooting at me
So, what do you want
" is a tough one
Far taller than , muscular and serious
"Youre all under arrest
" explodes with laughter
walks up to the policeman and circles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction
"This is your lucky day, officer
Were gonna give you a night off
" walks up to him
Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard liquour
"Drink
" he  pauses,     places  the   gun  against  his   temple
Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol
lowers the gun
He and  return to their motorcycle
"You never even saw us, man
" "Keep the bottle
" start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows  of the road
: blazes only a few  feet away from the high tide
billion stars shine overhead as  and his biker gang, including the cop, sit or  lie around  the fire
few  people are  still awake, and one picks drunkenly at a guitar
stands,  throws a  blanket over  his shoulder,  and scoops  up They make their way into the dunes
and    lie  on  the  blanket,  staring  at  the   sky
Inexplicably,  holds a hand toward the sky
"Which one do you want
" "Any one
It doesnt matter
" his hand pointed lazily at the sky, a single star starts  glowing stronger  and stronger
It vibrates,  then fades  suddenly and  comes loose from the sky, and becomes a meteorite, burning across the sky
draws closer to him, enraptured by his power
"How do you do it, Gregory
" " dont know
Sometimes it feels like
Im reaching beyond the world
" hand drops and his head turns
He sits up, startled by something
"What is it
" holds up a hand for her to be silent
"They found us
Cant you hear it
" "What
dont hear anything
" "We can only rebel so long
We can only push until they will hit back
" "They
The Men in Black
" on
In the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can be heard, growing louder
"Fuck
Get to the bikes
" bursts over the hill, holding hands with  as they  run
Hes only had  time to through  on his boots  and boxers and  grab his 44
Chandra is  dressed only in  her underwear and  Gregorys leather jacket
"Wake up
Get on your bikes and fucking ride
" gang burst to their feet
They scramble through the dunes, heading for their bikes
, seen only by its massively strong search lamp, and  the wind from its  rotors blowing sand  everywhere, flies up  and over the dunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet
mounts his bike and  jumps on back , all  the bikes,  his included,  drop into  neutral and  rev into start
Their  headlights blaze  as the  helicopter returns,  joined by another
"   ,
" , automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters
bullet trail stitches its way  across a pair of  bikers, sending them to  the ground as the helicopters fly overhead
cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead
pack splits  up in two  directions as the  distant choppers circle back
cuts the lights on  his bike and follows the highway  by starlight
chatter fills the  red-lit cockpit over the steady  hum of the  engines
The  nose of  the chopper  points to  the ground  as  it focuses on  and , who are ripping down the highway
on the cockpit instruments, centered on the airspeed indicator
The needle is pushing to the max, going through 150 knots
(
) "Holy shit, hes outrunning us
" : is pasted down to the  tank of his bike with   gripping him for her life
The slipstream pulls his lips open and tears  streak from his eyes as his bike redlines in fifth gear
The helicopters grow smaller behind them
They break chase
looks back and sees the lights turn away
She screams over the wind and the roar
"Theyre gone
" is staring down a dark highway
"Cant see shit
" turns the headlights  back on, just in  time to see a   of heavy duty military trucks
In front  of the trucks is a sandbag  wall manned by soldiers
The trucks are flanked by police cars
And if  one looks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of  standing to  the side
stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run frantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal flying at 150 miles per hour
plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked trucks
The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags , but the bike scissors  uncontrollably, until it rolls and  we drop into bullet-time
the bike goes  over, we watch from  the side as   dismounts, grabbing  as he  steps over onto the  safe side of the  bike massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike
It tumbles like a bullet  falling  through syrup,  and   keeps  walking  over the rotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and   against the flesh-ripping concrete
bike is coming apart  as its bashed against the  concrete
Pieces rise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers, and a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air, carrying   and   up
Holding  her to  him - shes barely conscious of the lightning-fast  crash,  rides the  flying body with one hand on the frame
It comes crashing down and back into  real time
bikes body  streaks along  the highway
The sparks  fade as  it slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them
They  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with   crouching  over The disembodied front wheel rolls past them
,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and stand and start running
them is a blurry wall of  red and blue lights
grow louder
start running down the  highway, then  yanks   to a stop
"Split up, into the desert, go
" split
on
In bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road
The highway is  littered with  pieces of  the bike,  and she  stomps on  a twisted piece of metal  that impales her bare  foot
She falls to  the asphalt with a scream
turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is bearing down on them, its -8 roaring and the siren
drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high beams
He  drops over  , ducks  his head  and extends  his hand toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into
runs into  his hand  and stops  as though  it hit a steel post
The hood crumples  in the center, pushing  the grill in even  as the front quarter  panels of the  unibody continue around   and smashes in through  the console, pushing the cops  apart as the glass windshield explodes and  their seats slide forward into  the console, smashing them like jelly
: still  on  the  grille,       remain untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them
drop back into   time and see  the cruisers body  rip over and  around them
The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission remain still against
The  cruiser was gutted,  like a banana shot down the center from top to bottom
It speeds beyond them, silent now, flips and explodes
block is suspended a few  feet in the air
It drops to  the ground with a thud
and  get to their  feet and run into the early  morning desert
: , the driver is still alive
barely
The steering  wheel is smashed deep  into his mouth,  splitting his jaw  open
Wet, broken chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth
His eyes flicker, and just before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he
is knocked out  of the frame
a  black loafer step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out slowly
rise  up from  the loafer
As the  other cruisers  catch up to the scene of the accident,   watches
He looks into the desert
lieutenant approaches
"Sir, should we pursue
" "Withdraw your men and pursue the others
We have our own plans for this one
" () The ship is  quiet
sits  at the operator  console, smashing the keyboard as he forces Tetris pieces into place
is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop
He speaks into his headphones
", try it here
" halts his video game playing and flashes to a different  screen
Lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types, then hits  the key with a flourish
The screen flashes, and the familiar scroll of the  cascades down the screens
"Holy shit
" : "What
Tell me you got signal
" (
) "No fucking shit  got signal
Dude, theyre changing it
" is annoyed
"Are you using the right pulse wave
" : "Shut the fuck up and get back here
" scroll  pours  down  at  a  streaking  pace
Its almost impossible to make out the individual characters
comes up behind "Oh my God
What are they - " "Theyre changing the Matrix
" "Call Morpheus
" patches into  cabin through the headset
dark, but  quiet classical music  can be heard
Hes not in  bed alone
shaded form can be made out behind him
sounds awake,  but looks anything  but
He grabs  the buzzing handset only an arms length from him
"Im here
" "Sir, you gotta get down here
" starts  dressing as  he talks
He puts  a reasurring hand on shoulder
"Proximity alarm
" "The Matrix, sir
The coding is going nuts
" "Be right there
" hangs  up the  phone and  jumps into  his boots
He turns to as he works
"It sounds bad
Theyre readjusting quicker than we thought
" jumps up and dresses quickly
"Already
" "It appears that they are learning their lessons
" shakes her head
"Morpheus, how much are you going to tell him
" pauses
"Tell Neo
About his predecessors,  suppose
" , dressed, nods
"He is the -" puts a finger to his lips
"Six came before him, Morpheus
" shakes his head slowly
"To me, none came before him
The Oracle told me  would find the one
It is prophecy
You havent seen what he can do
" "What if they toughen the Matrix code, like last time
" "There are lots of ifs
How about this one: What if we lose faith in our cause
" disappears through the door, leaving Niobe standing in the dim light
leans over  and
"Talk to me
" "Not good, boss,  gotta compile a new descrambler
" nods
"Do it
Were at broadcast depth
" "Yes sir
" "We have to download our mission specs
Move aside,  have to log into the mainframe
" takes  over    seat
The  scrolling  code disappears, replaced by the small words:
dtr1
mnfr4m3
pushes  the keyboard  under the  console so  its hidden  from view
He taps at the  keyboard
Hidden password appears on  the screen in the form of:
:
,
:  / : eyes open slightly when he reads the screen, but he  regains his  composure  quickly
mouth  drops open,  and   starts cracking up
"The mainframe
Haha
Its a joke, right Morpheus
Is today April 1^st " appears behind them
"Its not a joke
We have The One
We must do it now
" "But theyre altering the code already
cant even read it yet
" turns and faces them
"We have our mission, but its up to us to interperate how well do it
" "Morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is in Antarctica
Well never cut through it all
" "You havent seen The One in action
" looks dubious, and turns to the screens
"Can you hack in
" pounds the keys
The Matrix disappears, replaced by his program
"Getting you in is no problem
Maintaining the input/output and helping you is the problem
Thats how they killed savior number four, if  remember right
They cut the signal and trapped him in there
" spins the chair, then stops it
Their faces are inches apart
"We dont speak of the past
" "Excuse me for dragging up painful memories, sir
" turns the chair back to the screen and continues coding
: Hes standing at  the edge of  some equipment on  the Main Deck
Hes heard every word
He rounds the corner
The others catch sight of him
The same thought is on everyone's mind: How much had he heard
"Morning
Niobe, wake the rest of the crew
Razor, whats the  for getting us in there
" shakes his head
" dunno
Just gimme an hour, Ill probably have caught up to them
" walks up to
"Come with me
" : () , we see  and  hiding under the only bit of shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock
We sail in  and cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto feet, clad in Gregorys boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs
Shes collapsed onto Gregory
Hes in equally bad shape
Gregory leans with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he  drifts in and out of sleep
He  stars at  the horizon  and the  mirages of  water reflecting  the jaundiced yellow sky
In the  shimmering distance, a man appears,  but Gregorys lids  shut and  we see  darkness
When  he reopens them, the figure is more clear
Its a man, dressed in a black suit
Even in the distance we can recognize him
We want it to be him
can  barely come  to  his senses  as  the figure  approaches
doesnt even wake
We follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches
It comes to a stop just in front of him
is fully  awake, but he  thinks hes dreaming
He reaches out and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him - a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat
He looks up, but the glaring sun obscures the face
GREGORYs voice is raspy as he starts to speak
"Oh my God
Its
The Man
" "Ive been searching for you for a long time, my friend
" lowers his head
"We need you, Gregory
" "What for
" "To save our world
" ,       eclipses  the sun  with his head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face: head drops back down
He strokes  hair
"Its too late
Were dead
" "Do you want to live
" "What for
" " better life for all
Life for her
And for you, a chance for revenge
" raises his head
grins
He turns away, and the desert landscape before them turns into a soothing, cool,  crystal forest lake
Smith takes  a step toward it, then turns and extends his hand
"Interested
" is  mystified
Speechless, he  drags  himself  to his  feet, hoisting Chandra, and steps toward the lake
"This cant be real
" steps forward, only to have the image recede
"You this, dont you
" "Yes
" "Will you help us
" "Anything
" :    extends his  hand
grasps  it
He lets  go,  and collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge
is  gone,  replaced by  forest,  though  still  under the poisoned sky of the Matrix
laps  the water  up, and  pulls   in, rubbing the water over her face
Calmly,   stands on the lake shore
:
The humans  are reflected  in his  perfectly still glasses
stirs and  awakens, though  she doesnt  seem to  see
,  revitalized, looks  around at  the miracle,  and up  at the mystery man
"Who the fuck are you
" grins devilishly
"Im nobody
Smith
Whats more important, is you
We need you, Gregory
" stares
He pulls  ashore and stands to look in the eyes
"First you try to kill me
Now you need me
" "Two years ago, Gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist attack in the heart of the city
" words spark something nasty in
"So what
" "The terrorists were led by a certain individual
" " know who it was
" "We need you to kill him
" laughs he turns to   to check on her
Shes passed  out on the smooth grass
"What a bunch of bullshit
The whole government cant kill him, so how can
" "No one in the government can do what you can
" "Fuck you
" " believe we have a deal
" stands and puts his face next to "You know, Ive always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal
And this looks like a once-in-a lifetime opportunity
So,
" frowns
looks him up and down
Hes got a few inches and pounds on the smaller agent
"What are you gonna do, little man
You looking for a trip to the fucking hospital
Fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic surgery, you - " delivers a  chest punch that  sends  sailing  back twenty feet
He tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at  , standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away
:
removes his glasses calmly
:
He was stunned, but hes  not out of the fight
Not by  a long shot
"No man can beat me
" "Bring it on, pussy
" Pull back as he is ready to deflect the  blow, but  dodges and bowls  him over, barroom style
With  pinned  below him, he  slams his palm downward
head dodges the blow that pummels the ground
is  screaming as  he smashes  downward with  the palms  of his heels
Every blow misses the mark
"Mother fucker, what the fu -
" bucks up, throwing  into the air
He flips onto his  back as  returns
The  sheer force of his  street-forged roundhouses knock  around  as he blocks
Growing irritated at  the untrained attack,  turns a block into a palm-heel that hits  in  the forehead with  the force  of a  cannon blast
Momentarily stunned, he steps back enough for  to perform a roundhouse kick
Its like  a helicopter blade, smashing into  head and sending him to  the ground in a heap
"Ready to change your mind
" : cant  respond very  well
Blood  fills his  mouth and  his face is mashed
huge welt grows under  the loafer mark left by   on the right side of his face
crouches down by " can teach you to beat me, you know
" interests
"Help us, and both you and her will be free afterward
" stares  at the  ground,  then gazes  past   at
Finally, he starts to rise
offers a hand, and  takes it
"You know it, dont you
That theres more to your world than what you can see, what you can rationally explain
" "Yeah
" "Im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine
But first, you need to learn to fight
" puts his hand to his earpiece
eyes close and his body He falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, he stares up at
"Holy shit
What the -" stares at his hands
He sits up, and watches his hands, amazed,  as he goes through a series of  block-punches
He stops and stares up  at know Kung-Fu
" grins
() and   sit  together
The  cockpit lights  are dimmed down, only the  pulse button glows
Outside the ship, in the dark  mists of the underworld,  patches of eerie  phosphorescent moss glow  on the walls
Occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship
The two of them watch the deadly outside world
"Were deep in their territory
" " see that
" stares out at the night, deep in thought
He turns to
"Are you rested
" "Yes
" "You know now, that you had predecessors
" "Yes
Ive heard things
" "What types of things
" "That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be special
But they ended up dead
" nods slowly
"Its true
There were others
And  didnt tell you right away
Because you were not ready
" nods
"Does this anger you
" " dont know yet
So much has happened so fast, that  cant decide whether or not Im angry, or dissappointed, or even if  should be
" "You shouldnt be, Neo
You are the key in the Oracles prophecy
Everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing
" "What
" "The destruction of The Matrix
" looks out into the darkness
"Your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world for you, and to baptize you by fire
But from here on out, no one knows
" "Can we ask The Oracle
" "Not in this life
" is confused
"No one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day Cypher turned on us
" is taken aback
"But she must have known, if they came to her
" "Perhaps she did
" shakes his head
" cant believe it
dont know, Morpheus, if Im prepared for this war
Im not a soldier
How, how are we going to win
" "For decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world, without a conclusion
Now, after nearly a century of war, were at a standstill
The only way that we can see to win is by destroying their source of energy
We have to pull the plug on them
We must crash the Matrix
" grins slyly
"Remember, when  told you, that Ill show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
" "Yes
" " brought you deep, yet  no longer know the way
No one does
With every second we sink deeper than before
You are our guiding light, now
Your powers exceed mine a millionfold
have shown you the path to victory, Neo
Lead us down it
" , , , , and   are on the chairs  as theyre being   by  and
:  jumps in the  operators chair, his hands blur over  the touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the Matrix
(
) "Were going straight for the throat, people
" :  and   typing like made at their  keyboards hits the   key
They look  on, transfixed with  anticipation
The screaming Matrix code grinds to a readable halt
The slap each others hands and continue hacking
(
) "We have the advantage of surprise
They wont expect us to return so soon
" of them  stand, immobile,  around a  ringing phone  as their minds filter in to their body images
They are dressed practically  in denim  and leather,  like blue  collar workers
Their dress  wouldnt attract the slightest  bit of attention,  except for the  padded coats and tote bags filled with firepower
"Keep your eyes out for changes, theyre modifying things
Dial 0 for operator
" holds his celly to his ear
(
) "And have a nice day
" drops the phone into his pocket
They turn to him
"Niobe, youre the liasion to our operators
Neo, what do you have for a game plan
" "Where is the mainframe
" "The Metacortex building
" NEOs jaw drops
"What the fuck
Thats where  worked
" "And what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video games
You were working for The Man
" "Its true, Neo
Metacortex employs humans to write code for the Matrix
" " thought  was working on a fucking database
" "They keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing
Thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people
But, that doesnt matter
" recovers
"How bout this
just walk up to the Metacortex building and blow it up
" laughs
"What, by power of will
" nods
smile fades
He looks to the others
"Hes joking right
" shakes his head
"Well fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you
If youre able to accomplish this mission, well phase back into the ship
Stay in contact
If you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately
" five  of them  exit
They  blend into  the crowds  on the  street, anonymous and  quiet
looks back  as ,  taller than most, heads down the street
pauses next to him
"What is it
" shakes his head
"Whats going to happen
If this is it, right now
The end
" " cant even imagine
" grins  and starts  to turn
As he  does, his  profile matches  the profile on  a   poster stuck  to the  wall
Its  a dark, grainy picture of him, alongside photos of Neo, and Trinity
: glances at it, and continues on
walks  calmly, observing  the people  that filter  by
Men, women, children, all oblivious to their true nature
dirty homeless whino, nose  explosion red with burst blood  vessels, is  staggering  along  the  edge of  the  crowd,  unseen  and ignored
Somehow, he catches NEOs eye
"Spare a quarter, buddy
" shakes his head, but still stares
on  the
He mutters  something, and  reaches into  his shopping cart to  open a garbage  bag
Its filled  with twenty dollar bills, thousands of them
"How bout a quarter mil
" homeless  man is  astounded
As  he stands,  speechless,  fades back into the crowd
and  fight in the glade
is always one step  ahead
is a cruel  sensei, and doesnt pull  punches
But with every  blow takes, he rebounds and attacks again
, just as  he seems to  be gaining on  , he takes  a rapid fire series  of blows,  and collapses  to the  ground, breathless  and beaten
"Fuck
" circles him
"Pain is only weakness leaving your body
When you are sufficiently strong, you will feel no pain
" "Tell me about what is happening
Whats wrong with the world
" "Get up and fight
" gets to his feet and takes a stance
stares at him  from a relaxed poise
He slaps at , who deflects the blow and  takes a jab, nearly hitting  on the chin
They circle
"The world is not for you
" slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow
"What do you mean
" "Youre not human, Gregory
Thats why you dont fit in
Thats why you have certain powers
" takes a swipe
They engage, then push off one another
"What, am  from planet Krypton
" "Not quite
But as humans continue to evolve, some are developing capabilities beyond those of the average man
Reality-altering abilities
have them
Others in the Agency have them
And you have them, too
Were all that stands between law and order, and a terrorist dictatorship lead by the one called Morpheus
" stop fighting for a moment
"We need you to stop the terror
We need you to save our world
" sinks in
is starting to believe
"We need you, because youre better than me
Now push past your abilities
You can turn you imagination into reality
See your hands striking me, see yourself overcoming me
Fight, boy
" comes at him, and  responds
Their fists and kicks are  a fast, then turn  into a blur
cant believe  his own actions
misses  a block,  and   blows him  backward with  a chest punch
, recovering, looks up
looks around
is gone
"Where is she
" stands
From behind his back he produces a baseball sized  glass ball
He tosses it to
"Here
" looks in the ball
Its a window to an  apartment overlooking the city
Chandra is in bed, waking up
"She doesnt remember our encounter
Shes fine
Dont worry
" disappears
puts his hand to his earpiece
is staring down at  the ground
,   is walking toward his building
"Hes back
" "Ill be there
Execute the defense plan
" turns to
"Come with me
But only watch
Youre not ready to engage in a fight with the enemy
" "Why not
" "Because if you havent defeated me yet, you wont defeat them
" snaps his fingers
finds  himself  alone  on  the  top  of  the    hotel, overlooking
The  building stands across  the street
has been  along this road a thousand times, but in another lifetime
raises one hand, palm pointed toward the building
:    :  The  building  is  a  massive  tower of  glowing shimmering energy, no more real than a three-dimensional polygon
and   stand atop a  building a few  blocks away, looking toward the Metacortex building
on his gaze on the building, then lowers his head and closes his eyes
building tremors slightly, like  a heat mirage
Slowly, it  starts moving downward
: the first  level
The exterior glass  disappears, vaporizing in a million crystal shards that melt into the air, exposing the  hive of office cubicles and corridors within
The walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred  people - office  workers, security,  maintenance men,  standing with  nothing between them
The massive    vaporize
: the bottom of the building
One can look straight through  the entire  building
go  through  the empty  building,  passing dazed people, until we pass out the other side, and come to
looks up
The office  building is supported by nothing
Slowly, it descends on the stunned people
They rush, screaming, some laughing in hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them
The last few  flee just before  the ceiling  touches the  ground
The  second floor melts away just like the first
and   stare on in  amazement as the  building collapses, floor by floor
"Hes doing it
" " knew it
" and   look  up in  the air  at the  roof of the building, standing beyond  a block of  buildings
It sinks  toward the ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner
"It cant be this easy
" "Its not over yet
" (
) "Not by a long shot
" :
plants the barrel of a silver Desert Eagle 45 against her temple
whips her head backward as  it fires
We drop into   as the flame and concussion blossoms in front of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward, pulling a pair of -10 Uzis from under her jacket
belongs to turns,  pulling a  short weapon  from under  his coat
Its boxy, with a short barrel the size of a soda can
He plants it in the  small of  back and pulls the trigger
burns straight  through brown,  blowing steam, flame, smoke, vertebrae, and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach
on the weapon
It recoils on tension coils, discharging a shell the size of a 12-ounce soda can
What remains  of   flies forward
helps   up and the retreat into the building and  take cover under a window
Through the window, we see military trucks, filled with troops, charging down  the street, toward the Metacortex  plaza
After the trucks  come rumbling, black-painted M1A2  tanks
black   flies  over the convoy
looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon
"Holy fucking shit
" "Weve stirred up the hornets nest now
" and  stare  down into the plaza
The  building shakes slightly as it descends
the three  streets that enter  the plaza, military  vehicles pour in
Hundreds  of troops  discharge and  form a  -shaped circle around Tanks  rumble in,  and the  Apaches whirl  to a  hover
Panicking civilians rush out of the kill zone
stands calmly, continuing his work
and  stare from the rooftop
The air rumbles as the building continues to gently collapse
The  sky flashes, and massive streaks of  lighting blast across it like  cracks in reality
: They line their weapons on
They are nervous "This is impossible
Whats going on
" "Just keep him in your sites, soldier
" : eye is glued to the tank  site and his trigger finger on the  fire button
: The green crosshairs sit on  chest
: His eyes open, but the building continues to collapse
He stares up at a mirrored window, and somehow, straight into the eyes of: : "Open fire
" of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines
The tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on  as we drop into bullet time
bullets sizzle  as tracers burn  off their backs
The draw toward him like  slugs
Thousands  of bullets  fired at  perpendicular angles close  in on  him
As  they draw  close to  one another  along almost perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce
The bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to burn
The world  is in  stop motion  as the  bullets stop,  turn 180 degrees, and  suddenly accelerate  back at  their origins
Faster and fast they fly, until we drop back into
line  of troops is  ripped apart by  a hail of  their own bullets
:
With an -249 , he blazes away at , only  to be shredded by his own bullets
private takes a shot at , and  a bullet slaps into his  shoulder
whats happening,  he drops his weapon
are dropping like flies
The firing quickly subsides
stands  alone in  the center,  unharmed
He  turns to the skirmish lines
surviving soldiers  drop  their weapons,  and  run
Panic ensues
Only a few officers, NCOs, and soldiers too amazed to think of running remain
is targeted on an  screen
"Fox One
" : -65  --- The missile drops from its release claws and ignites, accelerating off screen
: The missile flies  horizontally over the  plaza, then pitches  up, and back down at
He looks at it, and at the last second the nose goes back up
The missile swoops up over him, leaving him in its exhaust smoke
: missile banks,  panning across the  city, until it  locks onto the helicopter from which it originated
missile bears down the chopper
: stunned to move
Mouth agape, he can only watch as: to  fiery pieces, and  comes tumbling down,  landing on the street as soldiers and civilians flee
"Fire
" pulls the trigger
M1A2 drop into bullet time as a cone of fire - bigger than the tank  and the shape of a  pine tree, blows out  of the barrel, pushing  the tank back
From the fire streaks a   round, white hot, leaving a  laser like tracer as it bears down on
stops in front of , and out of the air the  round appears
Suspended in air, it shakes with violence
It accelerates backwards, flying straight back into the tank barrel
gunner screams as the  explodes, blocking our view
The tanks explodes like a  60-ton hand grenade, plowing soldiers  onto their faces, consuming the unlucky ones close to it, and throwing  the 30-ton turret straight up, 10 yards into the air
It rotates,  aflame, and comes crashing down on a nearby commander and his radio man
shakes  the building
The scene  below is  a complete route
Black smoke billows up  from the flaming wrecks
The  remaining tanks arent retreating  - the crews  are piling out  and running
The Apache helicopters turn tail and run
"The plan is not working
" "No shit
" enters the room
"What about your protege
" "Hes not ready yet
Ill deal with this myself
" "You cant beat him
" "Ive been altered
Im Smith, 2
0
" and  look at one another
: clenches his teeth, as though hes girding himself for something
"Kill the others
Ill take care of this
" is at  his operator chair,  surrounded by consoles
Some of the Matrix code screens are in blue, others in red, at least one in green
The code  on the  green screen  starts pouring  down at  an incredible rate
"Fuck
" hits something on the keypad
answers his phone
"Theyre about to pull something
Processing power is pouring into the agent programs and theyre locking onto your 3- grid displacements
"Send through ghosts to confuse their lock
" "Got it
" program  is loaded
We  see 3- images  of Morpheus and  the others flash across the screen
alone, his comrades have disappeared
glass before him shimmers
mirrored glass of Smiths office wavers, then explodes towards us
jumps, and we pan down to follow his descent
He smacks into the pavement on his feet in front of
, facing , about two fighting distances away
NEOs  concentration is  broken
The   building  comes to  a shuddering halt
"Youre back
" : He nods
"And you have a ponytail now
" we concentrate  on , and  he concentrates on  , we can  see more black suits marching up behind him
attacks
backs away slowly, blocking against a  losing battle and taking hits
Meanwhile,  the    converge  on
Just as   lands a smashing  blow on   chin, three voices  at once shout: "
" turns,  and   pushes him  hard in  the opposite  direction to face: They attack at once, one going low and hard with a  knee breaking sweep kick, the other punching  in the face, and the third breaking to the  side and putting  his toe into  NEOs stomach with  a vicious side-kick
They attack  is in  perfect synch,  eight arms  and eight legs working like clockwork, striking  their target without  getting in the  way of each other
The attack slams  back, right into the first,  bloodied slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he  backed into a  brick wall
grabs him  and holds  him in  a , exposing him  to his three  copies
The copies  shift position and attack again
Two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with their combined arms slam  in the face, then step apart as the third comes in
The   grabs the shoulders of  the other two and  flips, walking his loafers up NEOs  body, and kicking him from  below, right up into  the chin  of his  jaw
It  snaps NEOs  back with  a spray of blood
and  stare on as the fight rages
grips  the edge  of the  brick wall  edge
The stone crumbles under the tension
"We can only watch
" on  continues
He struggles, unable to concentrate long enough to find a way to fight back
bangs away at the keyboard
"Four fucking agents, no wonder so much processing power is devoted to them
" flying  by   and   slows its  flight, slows  its flapping, and freezes
:
pink lightning  bolt freezes as it streaks  across the sky, sealing the worlds light in an a light rouge
Near the  plaza, panicked  civilians slow,  and fall  to the ground as though theyre passing out
Razor stares at the data pouring down the screens
"No goddamned way
" His headphone chimes
"Operator
" is on the phone "What the hells going on
" "Theyre putting all the coppertops to sleep
They froze the Matrix
" "Why
" "All processing power is being re-diverted to the agent program
" stands at the edge of the building and points down
"Morpheus, look
" on the ground below them, theres a swarm of  Smiths The passed-out people stand, and one by one,  into
It happens over, and over,  until dozens, then hundreds, are  marching on the plaza
reaches back and puts his hands on either side of  head
As hes  being pummeled  from the  front, he  squeezes and  screams
His screams are mixed with
The agents head deforms as were hear a sickening  crack
Suddenly,  the body  reverts back  to that  of the original owner, a security guard, and the head simply
hold broken,   stumbles  back over  the body,  with the  three in pursuit
He somersaults, comes up on his feet, and jumps  to the left, putting one Smith in front of the other two
He attacks, his killing blows destroying , smashing through his blocks
He falls, and  takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of them away in one shot
As he comes  down, a wall  of Smiths converges  from all sides
They stop, leaving a circle around him
to view a sea of black-suited  flooding the plaza
: his hand  passes over  his face,  it is  refreshed, anew,  perfect again
He surveys the wall-to-wall
talks with his voice, times a thousand
", leave the Matrix
You know not what youre doing
" "Well, is that right
" turns  to the   building
Its repairing,  growing steel girders and concrete skin
NEOs face darkens
"No
" as  his anger strikes  out at the  building
The tops floors burn, and then explode
The explosion rips down the  building, slowing, slowing, then stopping
of   are gazing up  at the building,  concentrating on combating NEOs attack
sees the building exploding,  and runs
He smashes through  an access door
hurtles down the stairs, one at a time
building is frozen, mid-explosion
of pieces hanging in  the air, suspended only by frozen tendrils  of fire and arms of smoke  and debris
attack
They fight  in a massive melee, dying in  mass
Meanwhile, the  building pulls back together, the damage and flame disappearing as time/space around it is reversed
: : With  his hand  on his  ear piece,  he comes  out the  elevator door, slowly
Pistol drawn, he looks around the corner
and  stand there, their backs to him
Without hesitating, he advances on them, blasting away with impunity
of  and   are wracked by gunfire  and collapse in a heap of bullet-ravaged flesh
walks  up  to the  corpses  and  kicks one  with  his  shoe
It shimmers, and then disappears, followed by the other
dials the phone
picks up
(
) "Yes
" "Theyre hitting your ghosts
" attack of  bursts on the line
"What the - " goes dead
looks  at the  phone and  redials
comes through,  his voice digitized and distorted
"Theyre cutting comes, get to the access point on Laxe - " line goes dead
signals to
They exit the roof as he dials and  hide  in the shadows of  an empty room, watching  the battle
cell rings
She answers silently
(
) "Lets go
Laxe Three
" "What about Neo
" (
) "We can do nothing to help him
Well only get in his way
" leave the room
stumbles  into the  lobby
Slumbering  bodies lie  everywhere, slumped over desks, half-in chairs, on the ground
exits into the street
The scene is one from
the neon  sky, fires are  frozen and smoke  columns hang in  the air, still, like massive tree trunks
The battle rages and surges,  a thousand  pouring onto  one
All around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed  bodies abandoned  by the  agent
Men  and women,  of all  ages and  designs, smashed, decapitated and broken
: overwhelm him  with sheer numbers
is a blur, a  human chainsaw now,  crushing or  smashing them  all, but  they crowd on all sides
The bodies pile up as they fall, and  finds himself stepping up the rubbery mass of corpses
few more smashed  fall,  morph back into their stolen forms, and  is -
He cant take it
Choking,  struggles to free himself
climb up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously
stalls, in shock, his eyes  locked with the lifeless  blue eyes of a  woman he just killed
She looks amazingly like
Perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences  of this war, and his mind seizes as the Smiths pummel him
goes  berzerk
and fighting,  he claws  his way out and surges into the wall of agents
They throw him back, and he cant kill them fast  enough
leaps upward,  trying to  fly away,  but Smiths cling on to him, and cling on to each other
struggles to  fly, and as  he does, hes  pulling a stalagtite  of black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet
: face  is wide  with fear  and shock
He cant  climb anymore, and looks back down at the mountain  of agents hes pulling into the  air
His face  clenches shut  as a  scream wells  from deep  within him
He starts to glow, and we jump back to see: orange, spherical shock  wave blasts away from his  body
It rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts  the Smiths away, leaving him clean
slows down  as , exhausted,  tumbles out of  the sky
On his way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward from the  concussion
hits the  ground, bounces,  and lies still, sprawled,  as people  drop all  around him,  piling up,  like Satans snowfall
() sky and Matrix are still  frozen
and  make their  way along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover
They pause  behind a dumpster, and  just before looking  out, theres the  sound of metal tapping metal, twice
looks in  the direction of  the sound
and  are standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley make their way to them
peeks  cautiously around  the edge
On the  other side of the street is a phone booth
"Is it clear
" " smell an ambush
" "Me too
Too quiet
" grips his gun and grimaces
"Too quiet
The world is frozen
Ill go first
" one likes the idea
- suddenly returns
The lightning bolts  in the sky  suddenly re-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them  jump out of their skulls
The sounds of the city suddenly flood back
street, people stir to  their feet
Everyone is confused as  to what happened
a sea of the dead
From its center,  emerges, soaked in blood, gagging and  gasping for  breath
He  stumbles over  them
Shocked and crazed, he glimpses the Metacortex building
Its in one piece  again, unharmed
He falls against  a smashed corporate  art sculpture
He  picks a cell phone up from the ground and dials
"Morpheus, pick up
" We hear nothing but static
Disgusted,  throws the phone  away
He falls against the sculpture and looks up
Coming around the corner  of the building is a group of agents and soldiers
sinks down,  staring at  his hands
He catches  his breath  and concentrates
The  blood  disappears,  and he  dons  the  suit  of an anonymous soldier in black
His face, too, seems to change
stands and walks away
We only see his back
- weigh their options
Finally,  gives the nod to
"Go
" checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat
There are  lots of people on the streets now
Everyones in shock over what  happened, and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city
"And remember, kids, when youre in a war, never volunteer yourself
" walks out  onto the street,  eyeing the phone  booth and everything else
gorgeous Asian  businesswoman stumbles  into him
Recognition lights up her face and she stops him
"Choi
Oh my God,  havent seen you for months
" keeps looking around, making his way to the booth
"Oh yeah, sorry about that
" turns angry
"Sorry about that
What kind of an asshole are you
" () - is looking around the corner
She pulls back into the alley
"Casanova just ran into an old flame
" () - "No
Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you please
" is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as  she is having a fit
Tears are welling in her enraged face
"Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - " Inexplicably,   hangs his  trench coat  on the  side of the booth
Standing behind it, he reaches  around with his arm, keeping  the coat between his body and the phone
The  doesnt even notice the  web of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering  the inside of the jacket
" - youll tell me why you dont call, why you, you, what are you doing
" "The jacket stops fragmentation
Sometimes they bomb the phones
Kiss me for luck
" grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers
: His hand grabs the phone
We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one of the  numbers of  the keypad
The number  tone rises  in pitch to a crescendo
pull back and: and the woman are bowled over by the flame
() - They take  cover from  the blast  as people  all over  the street  are knocked flat
() - is obliterated
Miraculously,  and the woman  are still under the cover of  the jacket
the smoking  jacket off them,  screams in agony as  he grasps the smoldering stump of  his right shoulder
The arm is history
looks on,  her eyes as wide  as dinner plates
Shaking,  she falls back, still staring
"You werent lucky
" , , and  rush to him, picking him up on his  feet
is  screaming and  laughing
Someone  grabs his  smoldering coat, dragging it along
stares at the ex-flame as they cart him  away
His eyes are crazy
"You still want me to call you
Ha ha ha
" they struggle down the street,  starts to walk more on his own
run from the scene, screaming
- the four of them
looks  at something  off-screen and  frowns
pulls to the left
"This way
" and   are  filling into  the street  ahead of them, coming from around the corner
turn onto a different  street
This street, too, is  filling with troops
Worse, its being lead by
"Tanks, or agents
" "Tanks
" "Yeah, tanks a lot
" They break
stands on his own, and they run back onto the  street with the tanks
: stop in the  street
Their turrets swing into  place with terrifying quickness and precision
,  they open  fire with  their main  cannons and machines guns
blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of  lead down the street
Troops filed between  the tanks pull  their triggers and dont let go
Everything in the street is shredded and blown away, as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose
,    for  the sides  of the street, except for
He stands amid  it all as the tracers come  closer to his body
He raises his machine  gun with his good arm, and  lays into the enemy
rounds kick away from  his gun, ripping straight back  into the wall  of soldiers
His rounds  deflect off  the sloped  armor of  the tanks, recoils pile into the flesh  of troops
He rakes his fire  into the enemy bodies
: zoom in on  him
tank round  blasts by, and the  wall of air kicks him to his side
He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed by  another, blasts  through the  middle of  his body
More and  more bullets smack into  him, blasting chunks  of meat and  viscera out the back
() and   take one side  of the street,  running and shooting simultaneously
reach  the buildings on  the side and   goes , as  jumps from cover to cover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets
side  of  the street,    goes straight  up  the building  facade  and  starts  running  sideways,  completely  defying gravity, firing downward at the soldiers
: , and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his  body apart piece by piece
Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,  and torso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his machine gun, barrel  smoking, spinning in  the air, firing  still
The arm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger
It is  the last piece of  to fall
climbs  as he  runs
In  mid-stride he  changes magazines and stops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground
On the other side of the street,  stands on the wall, blazing  at the mass of troops with two  guns that never cease
is  no cover and  no reprieve  from the     from above
Most are  still firing down the street, or over toward
runs  up the  side of  the street
Her guns  go empty and she dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her
: In slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade
Somehow, the  metal ring reaches  ears
: She slaps a magazine into her  pistol, pulls the action and comes  out from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade
She fires, hitting the grenade
explodes directly over the group of soldiers, flattening them to the ground
smacks  through   wrist, and  the hand  comes off, popping like the head off  a dandelion
Blood spurts from  the severed arteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip
,     leap for one another
They catch each others arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin in place, firing away
The tank commanders in their copulas blast  upward with their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple
and  concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down
land amidst  the carnage
emerges, shaken, pressing  her coat to her arm
() - The other end of the street fills with soldiers, and
: surveys the  scene, and immediately  draws and fires,  running full bore for the rebels
, Niobe and  are too close to the tanks to be fired on, but the nearest one lunges at them
They climb up over concrete stoops and over  the side  of the  tank
They  sprint down  the street as the tanks turn their turrets behind them, searching
"The garage, hurry
" dive behind a corner as  a tank fires
Morpheus throws the  woman forward as the tank round hits  the edge of the building, blowing  the concrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder
Perhaps a  ton of rubble falls on Morpheus legs
He drags himself forward
Niobe and Trinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble
Niobe shoots the lock off a steel door, and they pile into the building
() - and his  men rush  into position  around the building the rebels are hiding in
Suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine  starts, and as we stare  at the  garage door,  it explodes  outward
jet-black, hyped explodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up smoke
It cuts through a few  soldiers, hitting them in the knees,  as it rips up the street, the throttle going way too high
() - street scene spins before them
is at the wheel, a  broken and dusty  sitting next to  her
The tach is redlining as  the car rips up the street
Pedestrians dive for cover
holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed
"Shift
" does so,  and the tires  squeal again when  she releases into second, then  third
In  a few  seconds theyre  over 60  on the  busy street
() - Soldiers pick themselves up  just in time to  hear another engine -  a super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen
wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel
There isnt even time to take a shot until shes gone
() - rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up the breakdown lane
Once they hit  a straightaway Trinity  floors it, and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars
grabs his twisted, folded legs
He was literally poured  into the seat
Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the broken, fractured legs
He closes his eyes and concentrates
The legs reform into straight, strong limbs
grabs the wheel
"Keep your foot on the gas
Heal thyself
" pulls her bleeding wound from her arm
Her face tightens,  and she closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world  out, which  is  good,  as  they suffer  constant  close  calls  as Morpheus controls the wheel from his awkward spot
When she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel
With  hands
pulls out  his cell and  tries the line
Its still full  of static
"Any luck
" "None
Theyve killed city-wide comms
" "Then the agents are out of touch with each other
" "They cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our exits, and find the Neb
Well try the desert
Communications might be working there still
" "What about Niobe
" "She knows to meet us there
" () - NIOBEs bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over 100 miles  per hour
The wheely  bar is  folded up  against the  rear wheel
dual  stream of vehicles  spit by her  like giant machine-gun bullets
She zooms out of view
() - slows from a run
He looks back as police cars and  ambulances race toward  the Metacortex  building
He  cant shake  what hes just witnessed
He looks forward, only to run into: freezes, then bursts into questions
"What the fuck just happened
" "We need you, Gregory
Will you help us stop this
" is perplexed
Resolve comes over his face
" can stop this
" "Yes
" "Alright
But how can  fight him
" " will give you the power you need
" () - building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that no sane person could find attractive
The humble place is home to exits an  elevator
Recomposed and  dressed normally, he  walks up and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in
tall black woman, one of the Oracles priestesses, comes out of  the stairwell and recognizes
"Neo
" turns  and looks  at her
She smiles,  but as  Neo looks at her, a flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the smile returns
"The Oracle is anxious to see you
" follows her into the familiar apartment
The windows are  covered, and  and the priestess are the only ones there
The Priestess moves into the dark kitchen
NEOs eyes  adjust to  the darkness
He hears  something squish as he steps, and looks down
The tattered rug  is a swamp  of dark, congealing  liquid
reaches down and touches it with his fingertips
Its half-dried blood
He stands, his eyes adjusted to  the dark now
The walls are  chipped, covered in bullet holes
In slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens
In walks turns to the  kitchen
and   appear
They all draw their
45s
stands  still as  they walk  up to  him and  put their guns to his head
scoffs
" was on to you the whole time
only came in here to isolate you, to destroy you
" "What are you waiting for
" " realized, that  cant destroy you - " nods at " - without destroying the Matrix itself
" "You killed me too easy last time
" "And if you kill us - " nods at "Well only come back like him
" nods to
" know
" breathes deep, and drops his gun
The others follow suit
"So, why dont you take it all down
" "The Matrix
" "Yes
" " can
But if  destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die
" snorts
" take it the great Morpheus failed to mention this
" looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change
"How many people are in it
" holsters his weapon
He speaks matter-of-factly
"Six and a half billion
" , the numbers are too huge to imagine
scoffs
"Could you destroy us
" a serious question for Neo
But he nods
He knows his potential
" could
" "What does that make you feel like
God
" is amused by the idea
"This is getting tiresome
Where do we go from here
" " you cut the power that the Matrix supplies to your armies, Ill let you live
" "Idiot
We dont care about life, we care about victory
" "Why
" "So our kind
prevails
" "You mean, lives
" "Who do you think started this war, boy
Your kind tried to kill us first
" "But you didnt
Youre not as tough as you think
" "Well see
" three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door of the apartment
opens it,  and stops, his face meeting a  flying His vision   with the  impact, and he  staggers back into the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet
steps into the room, tall and
holds up a hand
"Stop
dont want to fight you
Youre human
" doesnt  answer
He  smashes  a  side-kick  into  NEOs gut, doubling him over
kick carries  such an impact  that a pale  concussion wave flashes past Gregor
It sends  crashing out the window
stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the  three agents
Theres nothing on the street, twenty stories below
The building  starts trembling
We hear  rapid-fire impacts,  growing louder and coming faster
as  crashes  up through the  concrete, throwing the agents away as  he embraces  in  a bear hug
blast up through the ceiling
follow them up through three more floors, bam, bam, bam
Each concrete floor smashes  in the head
() - and   through the roof, flying upward, like a missile, past us
() - : is contorted in rage as he rockets upward
is  barely conscious
Seeing this,  stops, and flings Gregorys body violently earthward
looks down as  the body falls toward  the city, thousands of  feet below
He turns away,  just as the distant   is falling out  of sight
Just before he does, the speck of a person  up, and  grows larger and larger as  it returns
contrail  streaks behind him as  a rips through  the air
,   is  like an  missile bearing on
turns just in  time to catch    in his chest
Like a cue ball striking another billiard,  all Gregors momentum is  transferred into Neo
Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view
: is in  shock somehow as  he sees   flying away
He  clenches his fists and flexes his body, then looks down
see the ground, thousands of feet below
"Holy shit
" some  reason, he  starts to  fall
Even  as he  claws to  maintain altitude, his  rational mind  has caught  up with  him and  is somehow denying the fact that he can fly
As hes  facing the  ground,   slams into  him from above
Gripping Gregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down
The  ground rushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper
Neo slams  Gregor,  front first,  into  the concrete  sidewalk
They bust through the sidewalk, into the sewer below
() - stands
Offscreen,  we can here  choking breaths
Neo  looks down
Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times through the chest by snapped, rusty rebar
He takes one last breath, and  his eyes half-close
checks the pulse
Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole
: eyes  blink, and  he follows  NEOs departure
Choking, unable to breath with the rebar through him, he writhes
Theres nothing for him to grab to pull himself off the steel
His eyes clenched  shut, Gregor levitates,  by force of  will, pulling his body off the rebar
The corrugated bars make wet,  sucking sounds as the pull through his body
Finally, he gets to a twisted  piece of bar, and cant make it over
Hes losing all his breath, all his  life force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest
one  last, wiggling  effort, he  works it  through him
mouth opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo
Just as the end of the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more, : () - Countach and bike  zip down a long,  perfectly flat empty road brown sunset plagues the horizon
There is no civilization in sight
() - tries his cell again
This time, it reaches the Neb
- and  are both operating the consoles
"Operator
" (
) "Good to hear youre still there
" "Jesus, you too
Where the fuck are you
" "About two hundred miles east of the city, on highway 315
We need an exit
" "Coming up on your left, ten miles, a rest stop
" () - " dont remember an exit there
" "Gimme five minutes
" "Out
" () clears the  screen in front  of him and  cracks his fingers
He looks at Circa
"Theyre
" "Gotta get em out
They need an exit program
" : Keyboard
fingers  fly at  inhuman speeds  over the keys
Data  pours down  the console  as he  blazes away
Finally, he  hits enter so hard it rocks the station
turns to  Circa as  Matrix code  resumes its  cascade down  the screens
"Yes
Did you like that
" just rolls her eyes
() phone rings
He answers
Its Razor
"Exit ready sir
" "Check the phone for bombs
" - looks over some data and shakes her head
"Its clear
" () - (
) "Its all set
Theres a pair of cops at the rest stop, though
" "Not a problem
" Countach pulls into  the meager rest stop,  not more than a  water fountain, toilet house and phone booth
police cruiser sits, lights off, waiting to intercept speeders
() - Countach skids  to a stop,  kicking up a  massive dust cloud  that hides the  car
We  hear the  door slide,  and the  massive black-clad figure of  emerges from the dust
An Uzi in each hand, pointed at
behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even duck for cover
The safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips  through it, chewing the cop to pieces
His body thrashes in the seat
turns away
pulls up on her bike and gets off,  slowly, obviously the ride had been  a long one
Trinity joins  them
Morpheus stops
" thought Razor said their were two cops
" () - cop, his  face to young for  a razor, is shaking  as he peeks through a crack in the door, through which he sees the terrorists  who just wasted his partner
He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his service pistol, only to shake in pain as his body morphs
- and  see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen
"Fuck, fuck fuck
" () - smell somethings wrong
They  move, back to back in  a triangle, for the  phone booth,  weapons draw  and looking  in all  direction at once
"Niobe, you first
" "Bullshit, its my turn
" "Junior ranks leave first
" enters the booth as the phone starts ringing
Its the moment Smith was waiting for
out of  the door,  gun firing  at the  booth
Inside, glass shatters, and blood sprays as  Trinity is riddled with bullets
Smith doesnt stop
He sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses, phone still ringing
Her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth door as it shuts from her weight
() body spasms violently against her harness as her life  signs go berserk
Shes not  dead, but  death is  only seconds  away
Circa screams, but Razor is locked, staring at the screen with the intensity from which he derived his name
() - and  open fire
Smith shudders, flickers violently, his body moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at him
The actions of the guns stop in the open position, barrels and empty chambers smoking, as the last empty shells patter to the ground
throws the guns down and turns to Niobe
"Get her out
" dives for  the shattered booth,  kicking away the  starred glass and  answering  the  ringing  phone
She  pulls  it  down,  and hauls Trinitys destroyed body up, placing the phone to her ear
head merely sags lifelessly to one side
"Come on
Go through, Trinity
God damnit dont give up
" eyes   flicker
She   focuses  on   Niobe,  summoning  her consciousness enough to make the  phase back into the real  world
She starts to fade as we cut to: () stands over  Trinity as the  rebels blue eyes  flutter open
Her whole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs Circa
"Youre safe, youre safe
" charges
Smith ignores reloads  him, and sights  in on the exposed back of Niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone  back on the  hook
As  the sights  rest right  between her shoulder blades, Morpheus grabs his gun with both hands
He squeezes off one shot,  the action freeze  back on  an empty  chamber, before  Morpheus throws his hands up in the air The shot ricochets clips Niobes ear and ricochets off the booth
She hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear
The phone  rings
She looks at it, then back at Morpheus and Smith, raising dust as they fight
She leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight
- pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen
"Crazy mothers
" has  removed Trinitys  interface, but  shes having  a seizure
Circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the  cover off a wicked hypo
"Whats wrong with her
" "Her bodys dying but her mind wont quit
" straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest
() Morpheus and  Smith clash  in the  dust -  punches, kicks,  and blocks coming too  fast to  see
Smith  is wailing  on Morpheus, but Morpheus sneaks in a  kick that separates  them
They take  stances a good  two distances away
Theyre about to go at it again when: sprints  into the  fight
Performing  a flying  leap kick, Smith grabs her  and swings  her down,  crashing her  body into the concrete with a sickening crack-thud
She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus flies  back into  action, catching  the agent  with a  furious ass  of swinging kicks
Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love
Together they  assault the agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will  capped by the limits of their Matrix-bending powers
Finally, Smith resurges
He  lands  a punch  into  Niobes stomach,  and  her body  folds  over unnaturally, as if her back is broken
She crumples to the deck, blood pouring from her mouth
screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  Smiths neck,  smashing  the  agents  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in the concrete
For a  moment, Smith is  still
Morpheus collects  Niobe and runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing
too far
Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward
Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him  and starts smashing his fists down into Morpheus face
" should have killed you the first chance  had
" Like an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final blow
But  instead of  striking, his  eyes catch  something
He  flips back, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second too  slow to  cut the  agents head  off
Instead,  it slices  cleanly through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat
, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over Morpheus as  he pursues  the agent
Smith rolls  backwards, gains his footing, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death
He  turns to Morpheus: "Go
" - is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed
-  drags  to the booth
Behind them, Agent Smith backs away from  dual blades, on long, one short
Whenever Razor attacks,  Smith backs away
They circle  one another
puts Niobe through the phone
forces Smith around
"Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor
" frowns  and moves  forward, but  the whistling  edge of  a blade makes him  think twice
holds  the short  sword parallel to the ground, the long sword straight up
He hides his eyes behind the short sword
SMITHs back is against the sunset
The sun drops below a cloud
flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into Smiths eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword
, blinded, turns and backs away
attacks
the  booth, Niobe  is gone
hangs  up the  phone
He  can barely stand up enough to reach the handset
When it rings he picks it up
But he doesnt disappear
"Reload me
" - "All right
" punches  some keys
3-  avatar flashes  on a  console, along with a massive array of weapons
() - disappears for a second, then reappears
Now he is  perfectly clean, and immaculately dressed
He replaces his sunglasses and  kicks through  the remains  of the  booth, walking  toward the  fight as  he produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat
keeps  swinging at   -  and missing
Seeing his chance, he runs back for the ringing  phone
pursues, almost on   when the neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  sword after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell
the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smiths outstretched fingers, sending them  flying
The long sword  grazes his forearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh
The tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off, digging about an inch into his torso
collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust
He doesnt try to get up
passes , who backs up to the ringing phone booth
Razor goes  through first
keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked on , who  makes no  attempt to  pursue
He  stands calmly,  and in a dignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheus step into the booth, and replace the phone
It rings
One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith
stands there, not attempting to pursue
Morpheus pauses,  taking advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy
stares at the booth for a second
Emotion twists his face, first anger,  then  perhaps  sadness
Hes lost
Hell  be  in  the Matrix forever
With a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the rookie cop
young  man is  left standing  there
He  is filthy,  bloody, badly sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing
He looks around at the carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in shock
He focuses on Morpheus
The rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his  body broken and his mind blown
- helps  off the interface chair
Razor is triumphant
"Did you see that
We beat him
fucking agent
He gave up
" , unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles
"Where is Neo
" "Havent heard from him
The city is still cut off from the rest of the Matrix
" appears enraged
He looks at Neo, supine on his chair
"Why does it still exist
Why hasnt he destroyed it yet
" "Maybe he cant
" is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like hell
"Is he even alive
Is he captured
" "Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building
Havent locked onto him since
" "What
Why not
" "Call me crazy, but  think hes masking his own displacement signature
" "His carrier signal just goes nowhere
But there is data going back and forth
" stares at  the data  on the  screens
The  Matrix lives
He pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at  an incredible rate
Its obvious Morpheus can handle computers
" found him once
Ill find him again
" We  go deeper  into the  miasma of  green symbols,  swallowed by  the blackness of the screen, and emerge into: () - The apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished
Gregory sits on a leather couch, watching  whatever on the  tube with the  sound off
He absentmindedly  manipulates a  quarter over  and around  his fingers
Finally, he stops and looks at the quarter
Holding it between his  thumb and forefinger, he  folds it in half  as though it was a disk of bubble  gum
He folds it again, then rools  it as though its a musket ball
Chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch
She reaches points the remote at the , but Gregory puts his hand over it to  get her attention
"So, you really dont have any idea how you got here
" "No
only remember being on the bike
" sighs
"Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head
Do you know how we got this place
" She looks at him, annoyed
"Duh
We broke in
We dont own a penthouse
" "What if  said we did
" "Id say youre insane
" She finally gets the remote and changes the channel
The volume  comes on, louder and  infinitely more tinny  and obnoxious than  anything in life
Chandra laughs at the images as Gregory stares into space
-  () - sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring  ahead
Hes  in the  belfry of  an ancient,  destroyed cathedral,  among the pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap
here, in  downtown, we can  see the modern,  uptown section, with its  gleaming  skyscrapers
still  stands, illuminated  by searchlights
sits and broods
Isolated, his world turned upside down and  right side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank
Again, he tries his cell phone
Static
He collapses it and puts  it
Just as it leaves his mind, it rings
The face flips open
puts it to his ear without speaking
(
) "Neo
" grim expression is melted by relief
"Morpheus
Holy shit
You wont believe what happened
" " know
" " couldnt do it
Morpheus, theres a problem
" - has the headset on
He stands and surveys
"Yes, there is a problem
The Matrix exists
" -  () - relief fades into confusion
" know
Im sorry
" (
) "And the problem is
" "Uh, its impossible
If the Matrix is destroyed, the people within the system will die
They will all die
There has to be a different way
" doesnt respond
"Morpheus
Did you know this
" We  hear  nothing
can  hear his  own  heart beating
Anger  and confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries
(
) " didnt say things would be easy, Neo
" sinks to the ground, shocked
He shakes his head
"No
" - isnt happy about what he has to tell his protege, but  there is no bending his will
The others look on soberly
"Neo, the Matrix
its not real
And its up to you to end it
" -  () - cant stand the reality of the situation
Hes coming apart
"No, Morpheus, this cant be
We cant do this
We have to get the people out
" (
) "Even if we could somehow get to them without cutting through their defenses, theres no way we can rehabilitate billions of people
They wouldnt even want to be woken up
" Neo is silent
(
) "You can do it
You can free us
" "Why me
Why the fuck do  have to do this
" is silent for a long while
- Everyone is watching  Morpheus, and no  one can quite  believe what is happening
"You know what needs to be done
Time is short
Make up your mind
The only way youre getting out of the Matrix is through its destruction
" Morpheus kills the connection
-  () - Neo hears the line click dead
He cant believe what has happened
- drops the headset on  the operations console
He types  a few commands on the keyboard, then addresses the crew
"No one goes in
Hes on his own
" He leaves the main deck
Trinity stares at Neo for a moment, her face fighting for composure No one looks at her
She walks away, then leans against the bulkhead, her body shaking
-  () - Neo closes the cell  phone
He reaches to  tuck it away, then  pauses, looking at it
He drops it to the ground and walks on
He stands out on   a finger of crumbling   church, the night air   all around him
The  city  lights are   alive below
He  focuses  on the Metacortex building
Leaving  him there, we  rush to it  until we dive into the dark  shadows  of the  very building,  going  microscopically close, until the  darkness gives way  to the glowing  green miasma  of quantum  code
It  fills  the  screen  before  we  bust  through into darkness again
