The witness is
She is maybe 13
She is a witness in a criminal trial
Her testimony has been carefully rehearsed
we go back to our homeroom for dismissal, unless you have a pass for sports or something
(
) And is that what you did on the day in question
No
Mr
Gettys asked me to stay after class
What happened next, Barbara
Mr
Gettys closed the door
Everyone else had gone
Yes
He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk
, the defendant, is 50
The very picture of respectability
His perfect wife and son staunchly enduring this testimony

Defense counsel
Taking it all in
(
) told him  was afraid  would miss my bus
He promised  would get to the bus on time if  would help him to do something
Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom -- taking inventory -- assessing damage -- (
) Then he put -- before  could say anything -- he placed his hand inside my blouse
Kevin -- checking the jury and -- (
) was so frightened  didn't move
thought if  was just quiet it would be okay
Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops him cold -- (
) Then his other hand went up under -- inside my skirt
Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly feeling their way along the leg of his chair -- (
) his hand then, it started, he started, moving back and forth -- farther and farther inside my skirt
Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it -- (
) he said he was testing to see if  had any special feelings, that he wanted to find out what kind of feelings  had

) didn't know what to say, was trying to think of something to say but  was confused and he just kept on -- with his hand -- moving it -- under my dress -- higher and higher
Kevin is rocked
Trying not to show it
(
) then ,  was asking him to stop but it was like he couldn't hear me -- he just kept on -- Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving -- (
) -- and then  screamed
Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him
Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap
He's been caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and -- then he, he got mad and said we would have to try again sometime
And did he try again
Not with me
With friends of yours
Yes
And when you told them what he had done to you, they told you what he had done to them, isn't that true
Yes
have nothing further

Gettys right on his heels
Lloyd, as your attorney, 'm advising you to get the fuck away from me
Why
What are you talking about
The wife
The kid
The outrage
You definitely had me fooled
You're my lawyer
You're here to defend me
You know what 'm thinking
Why don't we put you on the stand and you can jerk off for the judge
You know she's lying

Gimme a quote
Fuck off
'Mr
Lomax had no comment on today's events
Speculation, however, was widespread that the young lawyer's unblemished string of victories would come to an end in this courtroom

Startled, as overhead -- then just as suddenly, becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing
It was a nice run, Kev
Had to close out someday
Nobody wins 'em all

Everyone in place
Math hasn't exactly been your subject this year, has it
No
Any theories on why you've done so poorly in math this year
It's not my fault
Would you say Mr
Gettys is the problem
(as she shrugs) You're not sure
Have you had any discipline problems in math class this year
No
No
Isn't it true Mr
Gettys has had to talk to you repeatedly about your behavior
Isn't that why he asked you to stay after class
No
Have other teachers ever asked you to stay after class
Once or twice
Did they want to talk about your behavior

You may answer the question
don't know what the other teachers wanted
You'd have to talk to them
You ever pass notes in class, Barbara
Maybe a note that made fun of Mr
Gettys
No
No
Never called him a 'disgusting pig monster'
No

Your Honor, 've pre-marked this Defense Exhibit
Objection, Your Honor, we've had plenty of time for discovery here

'm gonna let this in, Mr
Lomax, 'm also gonna suggest that if you have any other exhibits you present in a timely fashion or not at all

It's a joke
'He's a huge hog beast
He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast
' You're writing here about Mr
Gettys, aren't you
It was meant to be a joke
Have you ever had a party at your house when your parents were away
(waiting) Yes or no
Objection
This is way out of
Credibility and bias
Overruled
Answer the question
(rattled) Yes
The word special came up in your testimony earlier
You claimed that Mr
Gettys asked you whether you had special feelings, if you felt special
(beat) Have you ever heard of a game called 'Special Places

(waiting) Is this game sexual in nature
We only played it once
This special party, Barbara, this was the first time you told the story about Mr
Gettys
Yes
've spoken to the other children who were there that day
Can you think of anything else, Barbara, they might have told me about that party
Objection
Your Honor, if he has other witnesses let him call them
(right at Barbara) If  need to call those other children,  will
'm gonna sustain that, Mr
Lomax
Rephrase your question
You threatened those children, didn't you
That's not the way it happened -- You told them to falsely claim that Mr
Gettys had hurt them, didn't you
These things did happen

They happened to me
So you made up a story special story, about a math teacher -- a disgusting pig monster -- you didn't like

Because  knew  was gonna like it
That you would shine -- that we would take this walk -- that we'd really talk
Why came down
You want the truth
'm an aging, hipster plutocrat
came up from nothing
From dirt
'm warming my hands on your talent -- (distracted then -- ) Where's the chicken
What
sits in a doorway -- (perfect Cantonese) Where's the chicken
The chicken that plays tic-tac-toe
He used to be right here
(Cantonese) No, you passed it
Back that way
(back to Kevin, as they walk) There's a chicken, he's famous, he plays tic-tac-toe
He never loses
(suddenly) Hey
Like you
Right
(catching himself) Look, 'm rambling because 'm excited
You're in the part of the game  like best
The realm of the True Believers
You are a believer, aren't you
believe in the presumption of innocence
Better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be executed

Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home, somebody takes an interest
Working so hard, putting himself through school, 'd never met anybody like that
Knew the Bible, every word, just knew it by heart
Every meal, there he was, at my ear and just
didn't want that week to ever end
But it did
He came to say goodbye, it was late, and started to cry and he said not to worry, 'Behold,  send you out as sheep amidst the wolves

You were reason enough to endure anything

We will blow every fuse of enlightenment until it looks like a vandalized, neon sign
And while God is busy at his peephole -- as he deigns us with his disapproval -- as he lumbers around his empty kingdom like some overfed colonial governor -- as God sleeps late, we will win

In the Bible you lose
You're destined to lose
Consider the source
Christabella -- her hands -- moving over her body -- Stop talking
Both of you

Kevin moving quickly down the aisle
Mary Ann standing there, completely unprepared as Kevin comes in behind her
Embracing her
Holding her tightly to him with a fervor that we alone will understand
Honey, what are you doing

Smiles
Backs away
