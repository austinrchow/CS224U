Joseph
Hallenbeck Private Investigator When you consider that a career in pro foot- ball means maybe ten years, after which you got no legs left, and during which you're a painkiller drug addict, a million a year sounds about right
So when people bitch at me about the money  made,  have a pat response: Go fuck yourself
James Alexander Dix Former quarterback, Stallions : The only light, that of a flickering  screen
big  lies, shirtless, on the bed
Watching a sports program
We hear: (

Worst thing ever happened to pro football
Already you got Eric Dickerson, no team's good enough for him
You got Dion Sanders, this guy, Bosworth, bunch of peacocks

And he woulda played for free, you get me
He loved the game

Speaks haltingly
Hello

The Man's hand unclenches

What you're gonna do is rush for 150 yards against Chicago

Good afternoon and welcome to Soldier Field, Chicago, site of today's confrontation between the Stallions and the Chicago Bears
This is Vern Lindquist with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my friends, it is that cold

He takes a bottle of pills from the locker

His   on the soundtrack

And you gotta be thinking, give the ball to Billy Cole
He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense
The huddle breaks
The

Cole adopts a three-point stance
Everything happens in hyper-real  : The snow falls
The receivers breeze past, in motion to begin their patterns
Moving like gazelles

He is like a spring

Pitch-out to Cole
He takes it on the run
Tucks it under his arm
Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled

Picks up a blocker
Feet pounding
Arms pumping

Reacts with almost comical terror

We are now in full-scale panic
The players are fleeing the field

Pandemonium

Running full out
They've got riot guns, cocked and locked
Sprinting through the snow
Cole crosses the goal line

People are running back and forth like extras in the Keystone Cops

Windless silence

a huge, rotting billboard
On the billboard, a girl in tight jeans
Grabbing her own butt
surprised look on her face
Yes, honey, that's your butt
a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow
In the shadow of the 405 Freeway
shingle hangs from a wrought iron post:
, On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth
The sprinkers come to life
Fling water across the car
Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo
Sprawled across the seat
Half-empty bottle of Seagrams on, playing tinny  music
Picture the  tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch self-hating  loser you can
Now give him  a two-year-old suit from  &  Clothing

One picks his nose

: #1 Dude's trashed
#2 Shit, we should do something to him
Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs
It looks like his entire fist is up there
Pause, then: #3 know where there's a dead squirrel
-     - with a tail sticking out
The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently
Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck
Still snoozing
Dead to the world
#1 Do it
They heave the squirrel into the car and run away
pause
Another pause
The sprinkler goes round
Nothing happens
Hallenbeck snores
The mashed squirrel perches on his chest
shadow falls across him as -- return, scratching their heads
Staring in at him
#2 Goddamn
Dude's trashed
#3 Take his bottle
Kid #1 smiles nervously
Reaches in with infinite patience
Trembling hand inches closer and closer -- And closes on the bottle as, without warning -- 7
sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a
38 revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it
Hey, motherfucker
The Kid, of course, shrieks
And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes
He sucks in a deep breath
Releases the struggling Kid
Swears under his breath
Watches    the boys flee in terror
Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap
Scowls
Heaves it out the window
Pumps    a Camel into his mouth
Lights it
Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams
Thus begins his morning
He opens the car door
The sprinkler douses him
He gets out
Stands on the lawn
One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the sidewalk
#3 'm not scared
Hallenbeck scowls
You're on my property, kid
#3 Sidewalk belongs to the government
Hallenbeck stares at him
Smiles weakly
Excuse me
He leans over and vomits on the lawn
One hand gripping the car fender
The sprinkler goes round and round
- redwood beach house, mellow in the morning sun
There was a party here last night
Banners
Balloons and streamers
Tawdry in the light of day

- plush bedroom
Sun streams in the window
sits, straddling a backwards chair
Bare- foot, bare-chested
Blond hair, perfect tan
He is nursing a beer
Smoking and staring at -- where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent
Like a sleeping kitten
Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed
No tan line
The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping girl
Meet Jimmy Dix
Twenty-seven years old, former National League heartthrob
He shakes his head and mutters: ( ) Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so damn ugly
He gets up and goes into the head
Pulls out a glass vial
Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease
Sucks it up a nostril
For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror
: - Seventy thousand people screaming
Jimmy in the middle
Younger Jimmy
Fresher Jimmy
It's a night game at the Coliseum
He's the quarterback
The snap
Jimmy fakes the draw
Rolls right
Around him, all is impact
Sound and fury
He targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket
Sixty- yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers
' Covered with dirt and mud
Blood, too
Young and proud
Seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive
He makes a difference

Alone in the bathroom
leaning on the counter
Head down
voice calls softly from the bedroom: (
) Jimmy, are you still here
Pause, then: don't know
He looks up at his reflection
Glazed eyes, beard stubble
Crows' feet around the eyes
Yeah
guess  am
He sniffs, clearing his nose
- Hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in
Dark
Depressing
Sprawl of furniture
Stack after stack of sports magazines
Drop all your belongings out of a plane
They will land like this
He flicks on the light
Crosses to the couch and flops down
Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table
Next to the bottle, we see -- side by side
In one, younger Hallenbeck is kissing younger bride
Smiling
In the other, the President of the United States presents Hallenbeck with a medal
They are both smiling beneath the Presidential Seal
Hallenbeck scowls and chews three aspirin
Swallows

He groans
Chain-lights another smoke, stubs out his old one
Chins the receiver and says: Hallenbeck Investigations

) Hey, Joe, Mike Miller over at Swerdlow
You got a minute
Mmmmm

) Mmmmm
What's mmmmm
Jeez, you sound fucking terrific
What'd you do last night
Sat in the car
Looked at the sky
Got hammered
(
) How bad
killed a squirrel and don't even remember
(
) That's bad, Joe
Tell me about it
Look,  crawled out of a perfectly good bottle to answer the phone, what the fuck do you want

) Still takin' charity
No pride here
What'cha got

(
) Terrific
And, Joe, big favor, okay
Try    to
fix yourself up, if you can   manage it
Look the part
Not    like the last time, okay
Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over the
His face is ashen grey
Hollow eye sockets
Blotchy skin
Gimmee the address
- Hallenbeck emerges into the blinding glare
His tie is crooked
His cuffs are too short
He looks like a grouchy bear
He looks up at the girl on the billboard
'Morning, gorgeous
Gorgeous does not respond:   Coy
Very coy
Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth the
Phil Woods'  fills the air
He looks at himself in the mirror
() 12
: (softly) Nobody likes you
Everybody hates you
You're an asshole and you're stupid
You're gonna lose
(pause) Smile, you fuck
He stretches his mouth into a grimace
Pulls out into the street
Off he goes
: - Jimmy Dix leaves the bedroom
Pads barefoot down a hall littered with beer cans, food wrappers
sleeping guy
Stops at a door, peeks in: all-night poker game in progress
Four bleary-eyed men
Unshaven
Stack of wrinkled money on a card table
'Morning, boys
They all grunt
One of them, name of , looks up at him
Holds out a half-smoked doobie: Hey, Jimmy
You want some of this
No, man
Why do you think they call it dope
(beat) Henry, did  do anything last night that  should know about
You puked a couple times
Pointed at some lady's tits
Chased a dog for a half an hour
Fucked a congressman's daughter, shit on someone's car
No, man,  meant something bad, that  should know about
() 13
: Mmmm
Nope
(frowns) My ass hurts,  think  had gay sex last night
don't remember
When are you gonna come look at my gun collection
Soon, Henry
One of the other  looks up, says: Are you Jimmy Dix
Played for the Stallions
'86 and '87, that was me
Hell,  think the league gave you a raw deal
Thanks
What the hell, shit floats
'll be back
hope so
'll be back
Everyone plays cards
No one looks at him
He frowns
Leaves
- Jimmy is seated in the devastated living room
Putting on shoes
He hears a  outside:  woman scream- ing
Water splashing
He frowns, puzzled
Gets up
Pads out onto a redwood deck
- six-foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end of the deck
He is dunking a terrified female head under the water and laughing
Jimmy clears his throat
() 14
: Ho
Ray
The  looks up, annoyed
() What the fuck you want, Jimmy
What's with the girl
She surfaces, sputtering and screaming
Ray thrusts her beneath the surface again
Bitch won't blow me
(pause, then) Too early in the morning, Ray
Let her go
Fuck you
She's not coming up till she starts blowing
Jimmy swallows hard
Says: Ray
Let her go
Fuck   you, loser
What are you doing at a   league party, asshole
You and ol'   Dex Manley should get together, swap   stories about gettin' booted
Jimmy controls himself with an effort
Ray, she's gonna drown
Not if she blows me
Jimmy's eyes are smoldering
He steps to the right
Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck
Last chance, Ray
Go spit
() 15
: Fine
Jimmy turns, as if to walk away
Instead, he spins back and launches the football
It sings, that's how hard he throws it
And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks
It ain't the ball
The big man howls
Clutching his flattened nose
The girl comes up for air
Gagging and choking
Jimmy is at her side instantly
Pulls her out of the water
Get out of here
Go
She goes
He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair
The guy is bleeding
Delirious
Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart
Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch
Remember that
He lets go
Ray sags, semi-conscious
The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside
- Jimmy gets into the car
Takes out his vial
Spoons some powder, sucks it up
voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car
" - Joe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front of a cozy stucco dwelling
Gets out, crosses the lawn
fat  is watering shrubs next door
He waves
'Morning, Joe, how's it going
My ears are burning, Andy
Even as we speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole
You're funny
'm playing Tahoe on the 15th
16
'  - Hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room
woman, forty-ish, once beautiful, appears in the bedroom doorway
Wearing a terry cloth robe
This is Joe's wife thought you were in Las Vegas
was
Where did you sleep
Office
He brushes past her and crosses to the bed
On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly
Hey, Furry Tom
He sits on the bed
Lights a cigarette
Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his
38
Starts to load the gun
How much did you lose
wasn't there to gamble
was doing a skip trace
How much did you lose
Fifty bucks
He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand
crayon sketch
He picks it up, frowns: What's this
Darian's class drew holiday pictures
That was hers
Her teacher wants to see us, Joe
17
It's a picture   of Santa Claus,  except this Santa has long, stringy hair,   bloodshot eyes,  and grotesque talons little girl's   severed head is  clutched in one hand
Underneath, in   block capitals,  is written:
Satan Claus
Kid's got some talent, don't you think
It's hideous
Her voice is ice cold
Joe turns and regards her levelly
You okay, Sarah
'm tense
couldn't get to sleep last night
Hmmmm
Well,  think the kid will be fine
Boys still tease her about the headgear
Are you kidding
Brace Face, that's the latest
Little bastards
(under his breath) She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen
Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe
Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup
The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon
She comes in late at night,  think, 'Christ, a burglar
'  almost shot her twice
You're not funny
All the girls at that school wear makeup
() 18
: Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer
And for your information, our neighbors think 'm very funny
Go live with them
Don't tempt me
He tosses the holstered
38 on the bed
Stalks into the bathroom
Damn raccoon
He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet
Walks back out into the bedroom
He kneels, looks under the bed
Frowns
Straightens and says, very conversationally: Who's the guy in the closet
Sarah stops dead
Spins and stares at him
Excuse me
(frowns) Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that 'm a detective
(lights a cigarette) See, first  noticed how tense you were, but  let that pass
Then noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow
So
Why the steamy shower
() () 19
: (') Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early
Tah-dah
Please, no applause
silence hangs between them
Sarah just stares
Shakes her head
Well, nothing changes
You're still a lunatic
Mmmmm
'm sorry, honey,  don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it
(beat) What's his name
Please leave
have to get dressed
It's okay, 've seen you naked
So, apparently, has someone else
What's his name
You want me to open the closet, Joe
Huh
You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, 'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do
Is this a trick question
'll do it, Joe
Okay
And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want
Huh
An awkward pause
Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says: No
We won't open the door
Thank you
() 20
: (sighs) Nope
Door stays shut
Instead, what 'm gonna do is
(he scoops up the 38) 'm gonna count to three, and then 'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth
One
If you shoot up my house, Joe, will make you eat that gun
Two
The truth is a beautiful thing
He cocks the hammer
Arm extended, hand rock steady
Call your shrink, Joe
still have the number
Call him and tell him you're losing it,  cannot fucking deal with you like this --
Three
Last chance
Joe, dammit --
He sighs
Starts to pull the trigger
And Sarah screams -- Jesus, no --
And grabs the gun
Everything freezes
She looks at him
He looks at her
Understanding occurs
swings slowly open, then
And out steps a man in a bathrobe
Compact
Wiry
Hair still soaking wet
None other than  , Joe's early morning phone call
We know this because Joe says: () 21
: Hello, Mike
Keeping her warm for me
The gun barrel does not waver
Not an inch
Easy, Joe
Don't do nothing dumb
How as she, Mike
On your finger scale, how was my wife
It just happened, Joe
It just happened
You call me from here this morning
She said you were in Vegas
was gonna leave a message on the machine
When you found out  was back
Why didn't you split
She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office
Normally  wouldn't
(stares at him) You knew
suspected
So how about it, Mike
On a scale of one to ten
How was she
Joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh
How long
Mmm
'd say roughly until you put your dick in my wife
() 22
: You gotta understand -- know,  know, it just happened
It was an accident
Sure
You tripped
You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife
Gee, Mrs
, 'm sorry, just isn't my week
Sure, Mike
Happen to anybody
(beat) don't gotta understand anything
Sarah speaks then
Head down
Eyes averted
Put the gun down
Hmmm
Oh, right, the gun
(sighs) You're right, Sarah, 'm acting nuts
He pulls the trigger
The  is  in the closed room
Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself
The bullet goes high and wide
Over his head
On the wall is a framed wedding photo
The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office
The bullet strikes it dead center
Blows it to pieces
Silence
The tinkle of glass hitting the floor
Hallenbeck turns
Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes
Where was Darian
She stayed at Cindy's last night
He nods
Turns and waves the gun at Miller
Let's take a walk, Buddy
- The two men come out the back door and cut through the hedge
() 23
: Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb
Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard
Holsters his gun
neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail
Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur
Where you want it, Mike
Head or gut
Listen, Joe,  -- (stops, sighs) Gut
Hallenbeck pats the dog
Straightens
Plants his back foot and spins
Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's gut
Miller drops to his knees
Begins to retch
Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette
Lights it
If  see you again, 'll kill you
Miller nods weakly
Gasping for breath
So
West Hollywood at seven, right
Huh
The job
Seven o'clock, right
You still
want the job
It's two hundred bucks
Yeah
guess it is
He climbs to his feet, still doubled over
'm sorry, Joe
() 24
: Hallenbeck says nothing
Miller turns and stumbles to his car
Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing
dead mask
He walks back toward the hedge
The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth
Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird
Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball
Throws it
The   and bounds after it
Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition
The   to pieces
An
Flying glass and metal
The car becomes airborne
Engulfed in fire
Does a lazy spin
Comes down
The shockwave catches Hallenbeck
Slams him ass over teacups
Windows blow in up and down the street
Smoke and fire roll to the sky
The  cowers,  in fear
Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire
Hallenbeck rolls to his feet
Covered with twigs and leaves
Clothing scorched
Stares
Eyes glazed
: - mobile crane hoists what's left of Mike Miller and his Pontiac
Policemen direct traffic, curb bystanders
a   questions Hallenbeck and Sarah, who stand stiffly
Not looking at each other
Why did Mr
Miller visit your home this morning, Mr
Hallenbeck
Joe lies easily: () 25
: He came by to talk business
He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance
He farmed it out to me
see
Is that all you talked about
Yeah
That's all
He looks the Officer in the eye
Betrays nothing
: , Female, for the record
Signaling us that we are now: " "  - Rowdy strip club in   West Hollywood

Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm usually reserved for standing in line at the
Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling
Behind the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks
His name is
Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old  speaks into a microphone: () Flash of green buys a flash of pink, gentlemen
So reach into your pockets if you aren't there already, and reward the lovely and talented Ms
Vixen
The black man shakes his head
() 26
: My son
He writes his own material, he's proud of that
Some people are proud, they cured leukemia
Old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's Eddie Murphy
Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast
Alex the astronaut
Harp raises his own glass
Alex the astronaut
It seems to be a common ritual between them
Jimmy drinks, thumps the bottle down
Says, resolutely: 've had it, Harp
Had what
It, man
've had it

'm an idiot, Harp,    act like a complete dickhead
don't have friends
drink too   much
fuck anything that's warm  and breathing
Stay on that side of the bar

You cheated on her
You must be crazy
Maybe so, Harp
Maybe so
His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on -- 27
- Who makes her way between the tables
She is beautiful
Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally
Supple body
Deep green eyes
Flaxen hair
Her name is
She stops at a table against the wall
Puts down a Seagrams
in a rocks glass
Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad suit
The essence of boredom
Looks like he's been there three days
cloud of smoke hangs around his head
Mr
Joe Hallenbeck, no less
The police won't help you, huh
Sure
After 'm dead they'll perform the autopsy
Guess you don't want to wait that long
Guess not

What did you expect
Pat Boone
The Four Freshmen
What are you, my father
Yes, 'm your father
Get your clothes on

It's gonna be an extra hundred bucks
You're hilarious
Sit next to the speaker, you'll     get used to it
After a while      you'll be screaming play that     funky music white boy
The screaming part  believe

: She smiles and moves away
Hallenbeck sips his drink
Scans the crowd with shrewd eyes
The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar
Harp looks on
(seductive) Hello, handsome
How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne
How much for a bottle
Forty dollars
No thanks
Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver
Tall guy
Sandy hair
That's the one

Ha-ha
So no bottle, then
For forty bucks 'd rather drink my own piss
That's extra

Cory pulls away
Jimmy smiles
Hi, Cory

He feigns innocence
Points to Hallenbeck
Who's the stiff
He's nobody

Come back soon

She smiles and moves off, swishingly
Jimmy watches her go
His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck
He frowns
Near the stage, the would-be Eddie Murphy steps up to the mike and says: You know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they're always in the mood, they never bitch, and after you fuck 'em you can eat 'em

Pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke
Removes a crumpled, empty pack, as: saunters up, looking less than friendly
He looks at Hallenbeck
Hallenbeck does not look at him
Hi
You're nobody
Shhh
Don't tell anyone
That's what Cory said
She said you were nobody
Only Hallenbeck's eyes move
He looks up, regards Jimmy coolly
They size each other up
Hallenbeck sighs
Easy, Junior,   'm not raining on your parade
She's too young for me
'm just    keeping an eye on her for a few   days
see
What are you, some kind of bodyguard
Something like that
You got a cigarette
No
Is Cory in trouble
hope not
You tell me
She didn't mention anything to me
Mmmm
That bothers you, doesn't it
() 31
: Maybe
Don't sweat it
Women have secrets
Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets
(beat) 'll buy you a beer
Sit down
Jimmy remains standing
She hired you, huh
What, you in the phonebook
Yeah
Actually, she hired my buddy Mike
'm filling in
Where's Mike
He died
Sorry to hear it
Don't be
He was a lousy surveillance man
Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table
Look, friend,  don't know who you are or what's going on
But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble,  want to hear about it
That's client confidential
Tell me anyway
Nope
say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole
() 32
: Do it
You sure
'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough
You don't like my suit, guess what
don't like your money
Good, 'cause you're not getting any
Story of my life
What is
Not getting any
They stare each other down
Hallenbeck calmly sips his bourbon
You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss
(nods) Hit me
Excuse me
Hit me
Bust me in the chops, chickenshit
(beat) You're not afraid, are you, Jimmy
(freezes) You know who  am
James Alexander Dix,
Stallions, '86 and '87
Barred from the
on gambling charges
Allegations of point shaving to support a cocaine habit, never proven
() () 33
: (') Busted once for possession
You had the makings of a first class dumbshit
Mister
You are now pissing me off
About fucking time
(extends his hand) Joe Hallenbeck
'm a private detective
(ignores the hand) don't know, Joe
You look like a dumb wop to me
At least  didn't shit my talent away on coke, motherfucker
Can  hit you now
Absolutely
Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin
It never gets there
Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist is trapped
Dead stops
Fingers grinding into palm
Jimmy swears
Stumbles
Sits down hard
Hallenbeck releases him
Please, have a seat
(gasping) You think you're some kind of hot shit tough guy, huh
(shrugs) It's not a question of tough
'm bigger than you, and  was trained
So  can take you
That's just the way it is
You can throw a better pass
(beat) How about that beer
() 34
: Piss off
(signals the waitress) You were a great quarterback, Jimmy
watched you play at Washington State
Red shirt freshman in '82
Followed you with the Stallions
Good scrambling ability, seventy percent completions from the pocket
You had the best gun in the
Jimmy looks at him, puzzled
Didn't they just swap punches
Yeah
Thanks
guess
(big smile) Hell
'm a fan
Onstage, the    a  as Cory dispenses with the last of her clothing
Strikes a pose to wild applause and we   her radiant beauty and -- : - Cory and Jimmy are engaged in very hot sex
This is not a love scene; this is a sex scene
Sigh
'm not even going to attempt to write this quote-unquote "steamy" scene here, for several good reasons: )   The things that  find steamy are none of your damn business, Jack, in addition to which -- )   The two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful, highly athletic ideas which manage to elude most fat-assed writers anyhow, and finally -- )   My mother reads this shit
So there
(
:  think we lost her back at the Jacuzzi blowjob scene
) () 35
: Suffice to say, they fog the screen
At last, Jimmy rolls over and pours champagne into two crystal glasses
Lifts one in a toast
Alex the pediatrician
(giggles) Alex the pediatrician
They drink
And from this blissful affirmation of life we -- : - Joe Hallenbeck is pounding an already-dented cigarette machine
No dice
It has eaten his money
He shakes his head, muttering
Looks at his watch
Looks at the dressing room door
Shakes his head again
Walks to the end of the corridor
Goes through the fire door
Out into: - Starry, moonlit night
chill breeze
Joe draws a breath
In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster: , it reads
Above the logo, a picture of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man
Hallenbeck regards it balefully
didn't vote for you, you bastard
He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the ground: half-smoked cigarette butt
Just sitting there
Joe stares at it
Thinks it over
Starts to walk away
Stops
You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe
() 36
: He bends to pick up the butt
steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches
Hallenbeck spins, startled
Reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm
Misses, chops the air
Two more men, behind him
Nowhere to go
sap pops him behind the left ear
sickening thud
The world spins out of focus
He goes down
Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks
Rolls over, staring up
Vision muddy, indistinct
' Three silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps
Their voices are fuzzy
#1 That's him
He was with her
#2 Shit, he's packing
What should we do
#3 Get him away from here
Then kill him
#2 There's no contract for him
#3 Then do it for free
Just do it elsewhere
The men disperse
One of them drags Joe to his feet
stocky, crag-faced man
He jams a silenced pistol in Joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot nearby
#2 Start walking
'm right behind you
The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model sedan
Climb into the car and sit, watching the nightclub
Waiting
() 37
- rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule- vard
Choked with weeds
Broken glass
rusted-out car
towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell
Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot
The crag-faced man follows behind him
- ( #2) Wrong place at the wrong time, buddy, that's all it is
Just want you to know it's nothing personal
That's what you think
Last night fucked your wife
The gunman cracks up
Hallenbeck grins drunkenly
- Oh, you did, huh
How'd you know it was my wife
She said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath
The guy cracks up again
- You're pretty cool for a guy gonna take a bullet
After fucking your wife, 'll take two
The hitman wheezes laughter
Joe just grins
- You're a funny guy
It's a shame to take you off
Here, kneel down
Are you kidding
We barely know each other
The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head
- This is wild
never shot no funny guy before
() 38
: You need a special funny bullet
- Come on, cut it out
Head or chest
That's what your wife said
- Would you quit with the wife
Enough is enough
Ask me how fat she is
- How fat is she
She's so fat  had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot
You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in
(the hitman loses it) Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts
got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin
They got lost in her nasal hair
But seriously, her eyes are like the streets of Paris: crossed
They're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back
She's got back-tearia
- (can't stop laughing) Oh, that's awful
Buddy, you're a fucking rio -- From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of gravel at the man's eyes
The man cries out
Stumbles backward
And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring
Not drunk at all
He takes  the broken bottle he's been clutching and cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter
The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face
Blood bubbling
the  once, into the ground
Drops it from nerve- less fingers
Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast
() 39
: - Bastard
Hallenbeck meets his gaze
savage, feral gleam in his eye
And then some
The guy pitches over dead
Hallenbeck kneels beside him
Retrieves his
38, holsters it
Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband
'm playing Tahoe on the 15th
He takes off running
- Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot
She scans the area, shaking her head
can't believe it
The bastard split on me
(sighs) 'm staying at a motel for a couple days
Will you follow me
Sure
He heads for his car
The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan
Watching Jimmy and Cory
The driver keys the ignition
Starts the car
In his lap is an automatic rifle
- Joe Hallenbeck is running full out
Headlong down the sidewalk
Gasping for breath
Move
() 40
: He slams into a man
Knocks him flat
Groceries fly
Joe doesn't care
He stumbles
Keeps going
- Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag
Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero
Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging
Humming with on the
Cory comes to a red light
Pauses
Turns right onto a sidestreet
Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection
passes Jimmy
Accelerating
Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car
It's enough: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth
The   around the corner, cutting in front of Jimmy
Oh God
This is a hit this is a fucking hit
comes up behind Cory
Comes up fast
Rams her car
Metal crumples
Meanwhile: frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out
He roars with anger
Flings open the door
Leaps out and runs forward, screaming: Cory, get out of there
Too late
Cory is already out of her car, yelling: Hey, can't you fucking drive
() 41
: Her eyes go wide with shock
The Hitmen burst from their car
on full auto
Cory is cut down
Blown backward over the hood of her Ford
Flung to the street
Oh Gooood
And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And   on Jimmy
He takes a running start
Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap
the metal behind him
He lands, hard
Sucks the ground
Huddled behind his car, as: move toward him, triggering
The kid is dead meat
Or so it seems until, without warning -- charges into the intersection
Screaming bloody murder
He's got a  in each fist, and both are
One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire
Bullets go through him
the sedan's
The second Hitman turns and   on Hallenbeck
Too late
Joe rolls behind a mailbox
chase him, blowing apart the metal box
The Hitman swears
Turns, running for the sedan
He knows when a getaway is in order
Just one problem
He forgot about Jimmy Dix
of
As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber
Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights -- The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him -- And  into the gray sedan
() 42
: Shatters the Hitman between the two cars
And holy Christ, the guy's still alive
Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken
He raises his rifle, screaming
Jimmy dives flat on the front seat
The
The Hitman
Still pinned
Still screaming
He     into Jimmy's car
Hallenbeck walks up behind him
Puts a  in his head
He stops screaming
is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass
Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window
Hey
(as Jimmy looks up) Back up
Jimmy puts it in reverse
The car backs up
Steam pouring from the crumpled hood
The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street
Like a sack of flour
Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing
He stops as: stands outside a door marked
Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck
Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street
It's all over, compadre
Get off my property, mister
() 43
: (scowls) Sidewalk belongs to the government
He turns and looks at Jimmy
The kid is in pain
Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body
Eyes glazed
Hallenbeck says nothing
He crosses to the shattered Hitman
Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets
Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes
Extracts one
Lights it
fill the air
And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat -- Takes out the vial of coke
Ditches it
Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight
No one sees him do it
come  up, flashers turning
Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless -- And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon
: - sits behind his desk, scanning a stack of typed pages
tired-looking cop named McCASKEY lounges in the doorway
Christmas tree in the corner sheds needles
Through the glass window, we can see Hallenbeck and Jimmy seated outside in the squad room proper
Bessalo stops reading
Sniffs the air
Frowns: Something stinks in here
(widens his eyes) My God, it's this statement
He flings the paper onto his desk
McCASKEY Sarge
It's shit
Hallenbeck is hiding something
() 44
: McCASKEY How do you know
know how the bastard's mind works
Every lie has eighty percent truth to it
Guy scares me
McCaskey is staring out the window at Hallenbeck
McCASKEY We lookin' at the same guy
(smiles) Go ahead
Tell me what you see
McCASKEY see a guy, looks like he just slept in his suit
(nods) Yep
That's what most people see
McCASKEY There's more
Oh, yeah
There's more
(beat) long time ago, that son of a bitch saved the President's life
- Outside the office Hallenbeck and Jimmy are perched side by side on a wooden bench
Jimmy is crumpling pieces of paper and tossing them at a wastebasket
He throws with unerring accuracy
Beside him Hallenbeck frowns, deep in thought
Finally, Jimmy speaks: That stuff Cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her
That was all bullshit, wasn't it
Yeah
don't know what she was into, but those were professional hitters tonight
Mob style
(beat) Tell me about Cory
What was she like
() 45
: None of your fucking business
Listen up, friend
'm trying to get a handle on this
How was she fixed for money
(pause) don't know
Pretty strapped, guess
Always kept an eye out for work
No hooking, if that's what you mean
It isn't
Tell me what she did at the club, besides dance
The usual
Waitressing
Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne
Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles
Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist
She get many high rollers
Sure
Even rich guys get lonely
Fine
(beat) So suppose one night, her 'guest' gets a little too drunk, and brags to her
reveals something about himself
Something that could hurt if it came out
What would she do
don't get it
Would she blackmail him
Jesus, 've had about enough of you -- () 46
: Would she consider the possibility of blackmail
(sighs) She'd consider it
If she could get away with it
But she'd need hard evidence
Otherwise, it's ' never said that,' his word against hers
Right
So what does she do
don't know
Follow the guy
Have him followed
Bingo
Kid, this is making sense
She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence
Who does she hire
Ah
She hires my buddy Mike
(beat) Right
Right
It makes sense
Except -- Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man
Exactly
He got spotted
They made him, and they killed him
Then they took out Cory
Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto
Whatever it was, it was way over their heads
They knew they were in trouble
How you figure
() 47
: Because Mike was scared
He bailed out and threw the case in my lap
He handed it to you
without telling you how dangerous it was
Hallenbeck stares straight ahead
Sighs and says: He was fucking my wife, Jimmy
(beat) die
He gets my wife
Jimmy just looks at him
At that moment, McCaskey pokes his head out of Bessalo's office
McCASKEY Okay, you guys are cleared to go
Pick up belongings at the property desk
- Hallenbeck is collecting his firearm from the property clerk
Jimmy lounges against the wall
Winks at a hooker as she goes by in the hall, followed by a patrol cop
Jimmy eyes his rumpled trousers
Ripped shirt
Shit
This shirt cost me eighty bucks
(holsters his gun) Glad to see, at a time like this, at least you got your priorities straight
Do me a favor and shut up
You think  don't care that Cory's dead
(rubs tired eyes) Christ,  feel like  been rode hard and put away wet
() 48
: Get some sleep
Wow
What stunning advice
was gonna go hiking
Fuck you
They start down the hallway, side by side
You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks
How's this
Fuck you and the horse that looks like you
Get some sleep
passing  stops
Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully
Frowns: You look real familiar
Do  know you
Jimmy grins, shrugs
Obviously flattered
You might
Some people recognize me
Got it
Peanuts Morton
Used to sell hash in Crenshaw District
No, man
played football
Jimmy Dix,
Stallions
What position
Forget it
Fuckin' football
Free agents ruined the damn game
() 49
: He walks away
Jimmy scowls
Grumbles to himself
We gotta cross the parking lot
You wanna borrow my sunglasses
Fuck you
Hey, snappy comeback
You a detective
As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier
She is talking to her pimp
There is a heated exchange
The pimp slaps her
Hard
Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward
Balling his fists
That son of a bitch
He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily
Propels him out the front doors
Away from trouble
- What the fuck are you trying to do, Tarzan
He hit the chick
You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead
Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons
Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all 'm saying
He just shouldn't, okay
Why
Because they're weak and need protecting
() 50
: (pause, then) Yeah
He's serious
Hallenbeck starts to chuckle
Shakes his head, lights a cigarette
Laughs through the smoke
This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard
: - Hallenbeck walks across the parking lot toward his car
Jimmy trots behind him
Mind if  catch a ride with you
Yes
My car's fucked up, remember
Take the bus
Cut it out
Look, you sorta saved my life
Let me buy you a beer
'm not thirsty
Good night
He approaches his battered Plymouth
Jimmy scowls
That's it
Good night
Go home
Get some sleep
What are you gonna do
'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend
What's the message
() 51
: That we're out of it
That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us
You're kidding
Joe gets in the car
Says nothing
You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything
watch
, what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything
The kind with a wife and kid
Look, it's over
My job is done
Fuck you your job is done
We witnessed a murder, Joe
Yes, it was very exciting
Tomorow 'll take you to the zoo
(beat) You wanna play hero, go ahead
When you die, 'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts
Look, until this is over, 'm sticking with you
The hell you are
'm part of this
We do something, we do it together
Have a ncie night
He  the
Don't drive away, Joe
Joe puts it in gear
Pulls away
() 52
: Joe --
'll tell the cops, Joe
Joe taps the brake
Stops
Leans out the window, says softly: Tell them what, Jimmy
That Mike Miller was fucking your wife
(beat) Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death
When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno
'm scared, and 'm coming with you, got it
Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy
You little creep, 'm gonna beat the shit out of you
Go for it
Then the cops'll really love my story
(smiles) You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead
You and me is not a fight
You and me is a massacre
Gosh, you're tough
Get in the fucking car
-  - Hallenbeck is in a foul mood
Jimmy lights a cigarette and applies for a position as pep chairman: You got any hobbies
() 53
: Mmmm
Used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist
Ventriloquist, really
hear Ps and Bs are the hardest
Yeah, well, actually -- (interrupts) Hey, you got any tapes in here
(leans forward) Man, what is this shit
Dick Haymes
Who the fuck is Dick Haymes
Jeez, you must be older than  thought
Hallenbeck grimaces and shifts in his seat
What's the matter
Stomach problems
Ear problems
What kind of ear problems
The kind that won't shut up
He stops at a traffic light
Sees a torn poster on a nearby telephone pole:     - He grumbles
Gives it the finger
Baynard, huh
What's the matter, you got some kind of beef with the guy
You might say that
You wanna share with the class
(sighs) Bastard got me fired from my old job
() 54
: Yeah
What were you, cop or something
Secret Service
You're high
Get outta here
(grins) Really
You protected the man
Holy shit, you musta got laid every night
That's me
Every night
(beat) Where did Cory live
She had an apartment on the West Side
Why
want to check it out
Jimmy stares at him, puzzled
thought you were off the case
(scowls) Look, dipshit,  told you that to keep you out of my hair
(pause) My client's dead and  haven't earned my fee
Whoa, back up
You mean, we're gonna nail these fuckers after all
(grins) Damn
knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior
Yeah, 'm a prince
Shut the fuck up
55
- Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk between tiny, palm-shaded cottages
The moon casts a pale glow
Bet these places run a fortune
Tell me about it
'm paying the fucking rent
How charming
Sounds like a great girl
What else did you spring for
Clothes
Car payments
Wasn't like that
Cory could've had lots of rich guys
Me, she loved
Oh
Love
Well, forget about it, then
Let me guess
You don't believe in love
(lights a cigarette) believe in cancer
believe in love
What, they're both diseases
Something like that
Jimmy shakes his head sadly
Man,  don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up
'm sure she'd love meeting you
Probably blow you on the front porch
Little bitter, Joe
Eat shit
56
The two men approach the door
Jimmy takes out his key ring
The cops are gonna want to check this place out, so don't disturb anything
Yes, massah
Jimmy opens the door
Flips on the lights
Stops in his tracks
The room has been systematically torn to pieces
knife has been used to rip open the couch
Broken furniture, shredded clothing
Everywhere
It looks like a combat zone
think someone disturbed some stuff, Joe
Well, shit
Looks like somebody beat us to it
Beat us to what
Whatever evidence Cory was holding
Assuming there was any
Stay here a minute
Where you going
Bathroom
You wanna come with me
Doctor said  shouldn't lift anything heavy
'll pass
Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage
57
Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him
He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc
Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard deodorant
Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom
Inside, the can is hollow and empty
The perfect hiding place
Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief
Removes a little plastic Baggie filled with white powder
Stashes it in his shorts
Starts to replace the lid
Stops
Frowns
Reaches into the can a second time -- And pulls out a yellow envelope
He looks at it, perplexed
Puts it in his pocket
Replaces the lid
Tosses the can on the floor
Flushes the toilet
Leaves
Hallenbeck, meanwhile, is prowling the living room, looking at photographs on the walls
The girl in the photos seems young, beautiful, and naive
One shot depicts Cory and a friend in cheerleader outfits
On it is scrawled,
, Hallenbeck gazes around the devastated cottage
Looks like you made it, baby
Jimmy emerges from the bathroom
Find anything
Yeah, there's some really nice rubble
() 58
: may have something
What
Later
Let's get out of here
- The two men emerge from the house
Joe heads for his car
Jimmy peels off toward a battered  Pacer parked at the curb
Where the hell are you going
As long as we're here,  might as well take Cory's car
You got the keys
Yeah
'll follow you
Hallenbeck starts to turn away
Jimmy gets in the car
Hallenbeck stops
Frowns
Cory has two cars
Yeah
This one's just sitting here until she can sell it
The color drains from Hallenbeck's features
Jimmy, no
He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition
Ouch --
What's your problem
Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car
() 59
: Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting in the moonlight
They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too
(stands) Except they wired the wrong car
Jimmy pales noticeably
Oh
Shit
Oh
Jeez
Hallenbeck claps him on the back
Easy, kid
No harm, no foul
We caught it in time
He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling
Cheerfully unaffected
Jimmy catches his breath
Swallows hard
Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other way
What are you doing
Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters
Gotta disconnect the fucker
Whoa
Hold on
Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something
(smiles) Relax, Junior,  used to do this for a living
He isolates one wire
Turns and offers the cutters to Jimmy
You wanna do it
No, man,  -- () 60
: Come on, chickenshit
Just snip the wire
Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters
Reaches beneath the wheel well
Plucks at the wire tentatively
Cuts
Oh, shit not that one
Jimmy screams and stumbles backward
Lands on his ass
Hallenbeck is chuckling softly
Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood
You're a fucking asshole
And then some, Junior
And then some
: - have been taped to the car's ignition system
Hallenbeck removes the taped bundle
Holds it up for inspection
We'll hand this over to the cops
They can analyze it
Great
So what now
(shrugs) You tell me, kid
Give up
Flee
Go really far away
got a better idea
Let's check in with my family
They start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth
Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy
'm tired
You drive
() 61
: Sure
Family, huh
You got kids
Yeah
Little girl
Does she like you
Not much, no
And she likes Prince, so go figure
like Prince
Great, you can marry my daughter
Or better yet, fuck my wife hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid
's
(beat) Open the trunk
(indicating bomb) You're just gonna stick that in your trunk
(nods) You're right
Let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with
Jimmy opens the trunk
As he does, however, a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness
(
) Hold it right there, gentlemen
They stop
Slowly they turn
are approaching from out of the trees
One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy
The other carries a silenced Beretta
Is it the cops
No, Jimmy
It's not the cops
() 62
: Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid
Slams it shut
Turns, facing the new arrivals
The  wear tailored suits with matching ties
One is tall and lean
The other is a bruiser, short and stout
They both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters
The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady
Good evening, gentlemen
Bit late for a stroll, don't you think
Yeah, you two better be getting home
The streetlights are on
That's amusing
How delightful to find such amusing men so late at night
(beat) don't believe 've had the pleasure
No,  don't believe you have
(to Jimmy) He'd like to have the pleasure
Tell him it's not for sale
He says it's -- What's your name, fuckface
This from the Shorter Man, who is clearly not happy
(shakes his head) 'm asshole
He's fuckface
Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield here of his situation
() 63
: Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles
Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's face
sickening crunch
two inch gash streams blood
Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun
Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes
Jimmy rushes forward, snarling
The Beretta swivels
Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut
(gasping) Easy
Jim
All they want is the evidence
The evidence
Very smart
See, Jake, he knows when a situation is untenable
(smiles) You like that word
Great word
It occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question
(spits out blood) Give up, Jimmy
We're dealing with geniuses
Another fist to the head
Hallenbeck grunts
Spits more blood
Leave him alone, you fuck
Back off, Jimmy
The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy
Leave him alone
(shrugs) Whatever you say
Jake
The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck
Turns and launches a kick at Jimmy's groin
Connects
The kid drops to the ground, retching
() 64
: (sighs) Ah, my young friend
neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain
exuberance
Christ
'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble
He's still in a good mood, Jake
Kick him again
Jake steps forward
Wait
Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips: You want the fucking evidence that the stripper had
've got it
So we can play games, or  can hand it over
And then you'll let us go, right
Sure
We'll let you go
(to Hallenbeck) Where is it
Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze
Speaks softly
Hand me the car keys, Jimmy
Jimmy stumbles to his feet
Looks at the Tall Man
Walk over and hand him the keys
Slow and easy
Jimmy takes out the car keys
Crosses to Hallenbeck
Gives him the keys
The evidence is in the trunk
Open it
Slow
() 65
: Hallenbeck smiles
Shakes his head
don't think so
He turns and throws the keys as far as he can
They fall out of sight behind a cottage
Oops
guess nobody gets it
You dumb bastard, you're going to pay for that
Jake, open the trunk
Jake steps forward, drawing a
38 silenced pistol
He is going to shoot open the lock
This is what he's been waiting for
He tenses, looking to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside, angling down and away
He grips Jimmy's wrist, signalling to get ready
Jake raises the
Take aim at the lock and
The  is
What follows is not
Because the bullet blows through the trunk -- And hits three sticks of live dynamite
Hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side, throwing himself and Jimmy down the hillside
The night lights up like a
tower of fire
Climbs up and outward from the car
The   is  fifty feet in the air
The tires are pulped
for fifty yards in every direction
And, most importantly:    both hitmen are engulfed in flame
() 66
: Fury
Flames, rolling skyward
of raining
Bits of falling metal
All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile: continue to careen down the hillside
Bouncing like rag puppets
Out of control
Lurch to stop at the bottom
Covered head to toe with dirt
Bruised
Bloody
Alive
They lie side by side, sucking air -- Until they both hear an odd noise: The sound of
The sound is
They both crane their necks in time to see -- The flaming car, tumbling end over end Coming down the hill
Heading straight for them
Jesus fucking Christ
They both dive for cover, out of the way
Barely make it
The  plows past them in a shower of dirt
Heaving
Spitting fire
Finally  to a halt against a palm tree
Burns
The night is filled with  and
The sound of
The crackle of flames
Joe rolls over
Looks at Jimmy
Jimmy looks at Joe
() 67
: You alive
Don't know yet
They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones
The dynamite
Either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall
Dead guys
don't make bad jokes, right
Right
So we're alive
Yeah
Hooray
He spits blood as  once more fill the night air, Go
Get out of here
What
Get the fuck out of here, 'll take the heat on this one
Rent a car
Then go home and wait for my call
Do it
Jimmy meets Joe's eyes
Nods
Dashes off into the night
: /  - Sergeant Benjamin Bessalo is in the mood to kick things
metal trashcan is booted across the room with a clang as he whirls, glaring at Joe Hallenbeck, who is seated before him
() 68
: Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son of a bitch
'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies, Joe, and the next time see your ugly mug 'm puttin' a bullet in it
You got that
You are off the case, buddy
Is that clear
Hallenbeck stares at him
Blows smoke
Says nothing
: -  - Jimmy's at the wheel of a rented Subaru
Hallenbeck beside him
He hands Joe the envelope he found in Cory's apartment
If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this
Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded patio
Both are older, distinguished-looking
Joe suddenly looks very pale
The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the owner of the
Stallions
Forget about him
Look at the guy on the right
Sort of familiar
Who is he
Senator Calvin Baynard
Jimmy draws a sharp breath
Pause, then: Let's go back to the cops
'm scared
Take it easy, kid
It's not so bad
() 69
: Not so bad
Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad
You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there
' It's fucking vomit, okay
This is bad
Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette
Stares straight ahead through the windshield
Begins to talk: When  was thirty,  was on the President's personal security force
Once night  was on the way home from a late session
'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when  see something up ahead
Another time
Another night
younger-looking Hallenbeck
Rugged features
Clipped military haircut
He is driving
Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist
Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog: is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass
He  to a stop
In a dream-like  , he approaches the overturned car
There are two dead bodies inside
woman
little boy
In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass
The furry cat is splattered with blood
() 70
: (
) It was a high-speed collision
Both cars were totaled
The woman and the boy were dead
The driver of the other car wasn't
is weaving toward Hallenbeck
Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes
He wears an $800 suit
Tan Cordovan loafers
Silk tie
Fuckin' bitch
She got in front of me, man
Shit
My fuckin' car
Stupid bitch wrecked my car
He stumbles toward Hallenbeck, eyes attempting to focus
Do you know who  am
'm Louis Baynard, my father is Calvin
Baynard, man
Call my father, he'll take care of it
The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck
Clutching at Joe's lapels
Wheezing liquor fumes
He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand
You'll tell 'em what happened, right
Bitch swerved in front of me, man
Wrecked my fuckin' Mercedes
Right
(
) could smell bourbon on him, big time
He was  standing there, not a scratch on him
went a little nuts
hit  him
In  , Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk, with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips
Breaks teeth
We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt
sickening concussion
The blow was non-lethal
But when he fell, his head hit the pavement funny
Put him in a coma
() 71
: The younger Hallenbeck stands on the highway of eight years past, staring at the Drunk with fierce, blazing eyes as we -- : - Driving
Even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head
His dad fixed everything with the cops
The accident report disappeared week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house
Acting on an anonymous tip
The senator fucked your job
And my pension
And my marriage
Only reason 'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls
Since then 'm just playing it out
Day by day
Jimmy is silent for a moment
Then: Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed
(beat) We gotta show this photo to the cops
Not yet
need more evidence
(beat) want Baynard, Jimmy
want to bring him down
could use your help
Why should  help you
Because if Baynard takes a fall, so does Marcon
The man who kicked you out of professional football
72
- tall, thin, almost effeminate  is seated on a couch
High cheekbones
shock of blond hair
Glittering, malignant eyes
He is directing a pornographic film
is bound hand and foot to the posts of a lavishly appointed bed
Around her, the room is filled with Kleig lights
Reflectors
Camera equipment
The girl is scowling furiously
She speaks to the director: want the sheets changed, Milo
() Of course you do, but we're running behind, dearest
don't give a shit
'm an actress, not a piece of meat, and want clean sheets
Fine
It's done
Right after this next shot
strident    on Milo's belt
He turns to the two-man crew and claps his hands for attention
Okay, let's do it
(beat) Roll camera
Rolling
And
action
The closet door opens
hulking man emerges
He is carrying a chainsaw
The Girl on the bed stares, incredulous
Milo
What the fuck is this, some kind of joke
() 73
: Not at all, dearest
It's what's known as a snuff film
The hulking man pulls the starter cord
The to life
Oh God Milo please oh God oh no please Miloooo
smile twitches Milo's upper lip
Easy, Pablo
She's not a piece of meat
He exits
Closes a sound-proofed door behind him
-  - Milo enters, all business
Crosses to a telephone with a blinking light
Stabs a button
Scoops up the receiver
Yes, Mr
Marcon
How can  help you
(
) Is this line secure
One hundred percent, sir wouldn't have used your name otherwise
(
) Sid and Jake are dead, Milo
Killed in an explosion
Looks like we got a new player in the game
Who is he working for
(
) From available information, he appears to be a free agent
Guy by the name of Joe Hallenbeck
Milo sits and begins punching keys on a computer
() 74
: (
) Get me everything you can on this fucker, Milo
want it on my computer screen in fifteen minutes
Yes, sir
And then
(
) And then you'll be handling it personally
- Dawn is a ghost on the horizon as Jimmy parks the rental Subaru outside
The two men emerge
Head for the front door
So  get to meet your family, huh
What's your daughter like
She's like thirteen
And if you even look at her funny, 'll shove an umbrella up your ass and open it
- As they come through the front door, Joe's daughter, , is slumped in a big Lazy-Boy, staring sullenly at a movie on
Cute kid, cursed to wear ridiculous- looking dental headgear
She doesn't bother to look up
First things first
'm starving
(notices Darian) Hey, kiddo
Why aren't you in bed
'm watching television
can see that
hate you
Leave me alone
() 75
: She still won't look at him
The two men cross to the kitchen
Hallenbeck opens the refrigerator, takes out some lunchmeat
She's pissed off because  wouldn't let her go out on a date with her friend Billy
missed the biggest party of the year
Why couldn't she go
(incredulous) Because she's thirteen, that's why
(to Darian) bought you some ice cream
'm not talking to you
Gee, that's a shame
You always have such pleasant things to say
' hate you, Dad
' 'm gonna miss that, darn it
(beat) It's chocolate chip, your favorite
don't care
You're an asshole
Without missing a beat, Hallenbeck opens the window and heaves the ice cream outside
That's for saying asshole
God, hate wasting food
Wanna abuse me some more
Go ahead, shock me
You know,  hardly ever hear the word asshole
Bullshit,  bet you get it all the time
All right, knock it off
() 76
: What're you gonna do, ground me some more
Hey, you want it, you got it, lady
Thank you, asshole
You're grounded for a week
Yes, sir, asshole
That's two
You wanna play this game
love this game
Just leave me alone
(to Jimmy) He thinks he's fuckin' Ward Cleaver
All right, that's it
You wanna be a gutter mouth
You wanna sound like your mother, well that's terrific
Christ, all day long  don't take enough abuse, gotta listen to shit from you
Hey, Joe, take it easy
Don't you tell me how to talk to my kid
All  wanted was to go to a party, but Pop here thinks 'm out to get laid
Go for it, kiddo
All the dirty words
Come on, shock me
Go ahead
Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up
() 77
: All right, 've had it
Go to your room
Or  will whip your behind
You'd probably like it
Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair
Toward her room
Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that
You got it
You don't ever call me a fuck-up
Why shouldn't , Mom calls you that all the time
That stops him
He looks at her, stricken
Your mother called me a fuck-up
When
On the phone to Uncle Jay
Uncle Jay
Ohh, Christ, 'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy
Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, 'm surprised he hasn't done time
Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion
(smiles) Because he doesn't fuck up
She goes into her room and shuts the door
Hallenbeck rubs his eyes
Leans against the wall, exhausted
You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers
() 78
: No
Anything that much fun, 'd want to do myself
think we could both use a drink
Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams
Swigs
Hands it to Jimmy
As Jimmy drinks, he notices   a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with   George Bush
That's you
Yeah
That's me
You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch
' Yeah,  was a regular Boy Scout
Joe starts to fix a sandwich
Jimmy takes nips from the bottle
So
You gonna get a divorce
Don't know
He bites into the sandwich
Not really tasting it
You don't like women much, do you, Joe
(mouth full) Mike Miller wasn't the first time
Sarah has cheated on me before
Twice
never told her  knew
At first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah
And now
Now 'm content if  like the guy she's fucking
This last one was my best friend
() 79
: Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye
What am , Jimmy
He tried to get you killed
Friends can't be perfect
(sighs) wish the sky wasn't blue wish water wasn't wet
wish didn't still love my wife
He eats in silence
Jimmy says: You know what  did last night
What
went to a party and shit on a car
Damn
You, too
'm a complete loser
Capital '
' All  ever wanted
was to be somebody's hero, you know it
Now  mostly sit around
Watch Get laid
'm a fucking slug, throw salt on me 'd curl up
Life sucks
You're wrong
Life doesn't suck
No, life sucks
But you're not a loser
Cory loved you
Yeah, and the last thing  did was cheat on her
(beat) Why do people cheat, Joe
() 80
: Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior
Ooooooh
Very deep
So deep  don't know what the fuck it means
It means another drink is required
He raises the bottle
Alex the accountant
He drinks
Hallenbeck frowns, watching him
Is Alex your accountant
No
But he could have been
(beat) Alex was my son
Hallenbeck stares at him
was married at 19
Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb
didn't know she was a junkie
All during her pregnancy
Shooting up
There were complications
She died
Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator
Fell asleep
Died before he woke up
(takes a drink) He was born
He had time for one dream
and then he died
wonder what his dream was about
'm sorry
think about him a lot
mean, who was this
guy
() () 81
: (') This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe
What was he like
(beat) What would he have been
He would have been a great ball player
Like his dad
(shakes his head) No
He had to die, Joe
Don't you see
Why did he have to die
(softly) Because he came out of me
He puts aside the bottle
Scowls
'm gonna borrow your shower
He exits
Hallenbeck watches him go
Says nothing
- Jimmy enters and shuts the door
Turns on the shower
Makes no move to undress
Instead, he reaches inside the waistband on his pants
Removes a vial of coke
Dips a spoon
The door opens
Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh towels
He stops
Staring at Jimmy
They freeze in tableau
Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides and slugs Jimmy with all his might
Decks him
The kid goes over backward into the shower, head striking the porcelain
He swerves
Claws his way out, drenched
Not in my house, you dumb motherfucker
() 82
: Joe, man, you don't get it -- Shut up
He picks up the vial of powder
This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it
You found this when you found that envelope
He crosses to the toilet
Jimmy cries out
Joe, please
Joe drops the vial in the water
Flushes
Jimmy darts forward
Joe shoves him back
You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done
That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit
You got it, son
'm just mixing it in with all the other shit
(beat) Get the fuck out of my house
Now
You don't understand
said, get out
'll break your fucking neck, kiddo
Jimmy glares at him
Coldly defiant
Go ahead, tough guy
Go ahead
(beat) 'm trying to survive, man
use that stuff to get by, so fuck you
don't use it
get by
() 83
: Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal
And your fucking kid
And  said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives
go to church,  give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit
' And he didn't say nothin', Joe
He grabs a towel
Scrubs savagely at his wet torso
And then  lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why
You know why
Because  gambled
Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it
He advances on Joe, trembling with anger
Why, Joe
Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh
Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the
does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread
Marcon
the commissioner those fucking hypocrites
killed the last thing  could do, Joe
can't do anything
anymore
And suddenly he is crying
couldn't save my wife
She died screaming and  couldn't do a Goddamn thing
And my baby came out
and he was so fuckin' small, Joe
He was too fuckin' small
He collapses against the wall
Slides down to a sitting position
Huddled on the floor
Hallenbeck watches him
Says nothing
For a moment, he seems moved to compassion
Then his gaze hardens
He kneels next to Jimmy
() 84
: When you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way
(wipes his eyes) You're a total bastard
You brought cocaine in my house
End of story
Jimmy is silent
He stands
Exits into the hall
Joe's daughter, Darian, is standing there
You're Jimmy Dix, aren't you
Huh
There is an awkward pause
Darian holds out a football card
Young, smiling Jimmy
The card is old
Tattered
'm sorry  acted like a bitch
Would you sign my card
Hallenbeck steps forward
told you to go to your room
But, Dad --
Go to bed
This guy's not signing anything
Aw, come off it
Forget it, Darian
(beat) The guy's a loser
Big time
Darian's face is a mask of confusion
() 85
: Jimmy walks past her to the front door
Stops with his hand on the knob
Turns
never shaved points, Joe never did
Joe is silent
Stone-faced
If you want my help, 'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura
He exits
Shuts the door behind him
Darian goes into her room, fuming
Shuts the door
Joe is alone
He turns
Sees his reflection in the hall mirror
Smile, you fuck
- The first light of day streams through the window
Hallenbeck pushes Furry Tom to one side
Sits on the bed
Regards his sleeping wife with hooded, lifeless eyes
She is peaceful
Serene
He reaches out to touch her
Stops
Withdraws his hand
Crushes out the cigarette
Stands
Leaves
'  - Hallenbeck enters
Crosses to Darian's bed
She is asleep
She looks vulnerable
Helpless
He leans over and kisses her
She stirs in her sleep
Murmurs: Billy
Hallenbeck recoils
Stares at her
The
Startling him
He mutters under his breath
Stalks out of the room
86
- Down the hall to the front door
Flings it open, pissed off
Goddammit, Jimmy,  told you --
It isn't Jimmy
Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond hair
The man removes a   from his overcoat
Good morning, Joseph
He  point-blank
The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest
of electric current
Hallenbeck jerks spastically
The world spirals away
He plunges down into darkness
: - Jimmy looks bad
Sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets
Jeans
Bare feet
Smoking
Staring at a football card
duplicate of the one Darian showed him
He swings his legs off the bed
Stands, crushes out his cigarette
Moves into the bathroom
The Baggie of coke is on the counter
He stares at it with bloodshot eyes
Swallows hard
Acts before he can think
Grabs the Baggie
Tosses it in the toilet
Flushes
Watches as it goes down the drain
- Another Goddamned day
chill drizzle
The palm trees look forlorn
87
Jimmy buys a paper
Trudges along Ventura Boulevard
Huddled against the chill
, slides to the curb in front of him
Two men get out: One is Pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in Milo's snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired muscle who we'll call
The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him
He looks up, startled
Good morning, Jimmy
Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name
(frowns) This is the guy
You sure it's the guy
This is him
The kid with the million-dollar arm
Yeah
Shit
He don't look like much wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo
Neither will anyone else, anymore
'm growing whiskers here, guys
You got something to say, fucking say it
Wow
Tough guy stuff
Must have caught it from his buddy Hallenbeck
() 88
: Who
Don't play dumb, shithead
You were with him last night at the club
Mr
Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy
Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business
Get ready, kid
This one's an ticket
And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms
Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence
Please, guys, don't do this
Jesus Christ,  was just her boyfriend,  swear to God, please
They toss Jimmy over the fence
Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances
In this case, however -- fifty-foot drop
Awaits him beyond the fence
huge, looming pit dug into the earth
Foundation for a new parking garage
Jimmy plummets like a stone
Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead
But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of water to land in
He hits with a splash
Disappears beneath the water
Surfaces, screaming in pain
Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his skin at a crazy angle
() 89
: His million-dollar arm
His throwing arm
He clutches at cracked ribs, screaming: Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ
He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth
- Alone in the pit
Huddled in a pool of muddy water
His screams of pain  in the chill, morning air
/  - Ben Bessalo's office, to be precise
Bessalo reclines grumpily at his desk
Scanning reports
McCaskey hangs up the phone and calls across the room: McCASKEY got bad news and bad news
Gimmee the bad news first
McCASKEY Bad news is, they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura
He's busted up
Okay, now gimme the bad news
McCASKEY just got a call from Hallenbeck's neighbor
Bessalo looks up, intrigued
McCaskey continues: McCASKEY Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike Miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case, right
Right
() 90
: McCASKEY Okay
So how come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims that Miller's car was parked there all night, in the same spot
Bessalo sits bolt upright
Eyes glazed
Wheels turning
He lied
Why did he lie
Realization hits him like a thunderbolt
Shit
Miller was fucking his wife
McCASKEY What
That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember
(beat) Christ, Joe wasted the bastard himself
He stabs a button on the phone
Barks into the receiver: want an
out on Joe Hallenbeck
Now
Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard
He slams down the phone
Stares, stricken, at McCaskey
let him go, Mick
He wasted Mike Miller and waltzed right out of my office,  let him go, Goddammit
McCASKEY Relax, Ben
We'll bring him in
He's not that good
You wanna bet
And, with that, we promptly -- : 91
' Weathered
Sallow
Dark circles under the eyes
comes   and slaps him
Hard
Rocks his head to one side
-   - Thick carpet
Polished, wood furniture
Window walls
Outside, the sea is angry and grey
are standing over Hallenbeck, who is slumped in a chair
Both hitmen wear holstered sidearms
Chet leans over and slaps Hallenbeck again
The big detective begins to stir
His eyelids flutter
think he's awake
Make sure
Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap -- And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically appears
Intercepts the blow
Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it
cry of pain
Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist
'm awake
His eyelids creak open
He squints, adjusting to the light
Studies his captors
You nearly broke my wrist, man
Life's a bitch
() 92
: He starts pawing his coat pockets, looking for a cigarette
In the corner, Pablo chuckles: Milo warned us to watch out for this guy
Chet is seething
He glares at Hallenbeck
Hallenbeck yawns
Fuck that
Look at him
He's nothin'
Guy's a piece of shit
Hallenbeck ignores him
Sits up
Rubs tired eyes
Anybody got a cigarette
Chet steps forward
Grins wickedly
Sure, buddy
got a cigarette
He reaches into his shirt pocket
Extracts a Marlboro
Hands it to Hallenbeck
Takes out a lighter
Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips
Leans forward for a light -- And Chet slugs him in the face
The cigarette goes flying
Hallenbeck's head snaps back
Blood creeps from his lower lip
(guffaws) Hey, baby,  thought you were tough
See, Pablo, he ain't so bad
Hallenbeck's eyes glint fiercely
He takes a breath
Leans forward and says: seem to have dropped my cigarette
May  have another
Chet turns, meets his gaze
The grin falters a bit
(unnerved) Sure
Sure thing, buddy
() 93
: He hands Hallenbeck another smoke
Hallenbeck puts it between his lips
need a light
(beat) And if you touch me again
'll kill you
pregnant pause
The challenge hangs in the air
Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket
Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features
Hallenbeck leans forward for a light
Chet extends his arm -- And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again
Rocks him
Chet howls with laughter
Pablo grins
Baby
Two for two
The laughter continues
Hallenbeck takes a deep breath
Stands up
Strikes with a flattened palm
Breaks Chet's nose
Drives it up into the brain
Chet stands, pole-axed
Blinks once
Pitches over dead
And suddenly Pablo isn't laughing
He stares at Hallenbeck, incredulous
Stares at Chet, lying on the carpet
Jesus Christ
(draws his gun) You son-of-a-bitch
Jesus Christ
He rushes to Chet
Kneels beside him
Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat
You killed him
'Fuckin' , you killed him, he's fuckin' dead
Hallenbeck says nothing
() 94
: At that moment, a door opens, and Milo enters
Slick
Well-dressed
Utterly composed
Is there a problem
(still dazed) He killed Chet, Milo
The mother- fucker just killed him
Milo looks toward Hallenbeck
Hallenbeck says nothing
Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's lighter from the carpet
Lights his cigarette
Blows smoke
tense moment
and then Milo does something un- expected: He starts to laugh
Advances into the room, chuckling
Oh, my
Oh, Goddamn
Joseph, Joseph, you don't disappoint me
He draws a Walther  and approaches Hallenbeck
Smiling and cheerful
You seem to have killed one of my men
(shrugs) needed a light
Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense
You took an awful risk
Pablo here could have shot you dead
If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me
Yes, that's true
(sits down) suppose introductions are in order
(waves his hand) Fuck it
You're the bad guy, right
() 95
: Yes
'm the bad guy
And you've got the gun, and 'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that
Something like that
Fine
'll start trembling in a minute
Mind if  have a drink first
(smiles) don't see why not
Pablo, please take Chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr
Hallenbeck a drink
Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway: (
) Make that two
Hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival
Hey, look who's here
Connie Marcon himself
Sure enough,   saunters in, just like he owns the place
Which, by the way, he does
Tall, strong, Texas-tough
Dressed in a Saville Row suit
He frowns at Hallenbeck: Careful, son
Only my friends call me Connie
You got friends
When did this happen
(chuckles) 'll give you one thing
You're pretty calm for a man in your position
() 96
: You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year
They're having some problems
They stink
Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment
'm glad you're here, Joe
We got a few things to discuss
He takes a moment to gather his thoughts
For starters, 'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better
(lights a cigar) Used to be, you went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes
Guys who fought for their hometown
Anymore, no one gives a shit
Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier
Playing only for themselves
Giving nothing back to the game
Pablo hands him a double bourbon
This year, the final blow: the votes to decertify the Players Organization
Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents
Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce
To greed, you follow
When do  say the Pledge of Allegiance
Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck
() 97
: Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year
Per week
An average of two point eight
Oh, for Chrissake
You're telling me this whole thing is about ratings
People have stopped watching, Joe
Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow
Guys like you
Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle
Hallenbeck reacts, startled
Looks at Milo
We took the liberty of researching your background
How about it, Joe
Is it truth or hype
(shrugs) got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir
There you go, that's what 'm saying
The public wants real heroes
Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers
(beat) In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football
Can you guess
It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck
Gambling
() 98
: Exactly
Gambling
(puffs his cigar) Just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states
And that, Joe boy, is where  come in
(sudden realization) Shit, that's what this is about
You're bribing United States senators
Paying them to pass legislation -- -- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states
Exactly
Attendance goes up again ratings go up again
You got it, son
The networks are happy
'm happy
Everybody's happy
Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, 'm not your fucking son, and second
why am  still alive
Marcon stops pacing
Sighs and sits down facing Hallenbeck
It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then  hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard
(takes a sip of bourbon) don't get it
What's the snag
offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it
Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take
Sprays bourbon
() 99
: Baynard
Are you nuts
The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies
Allow me to clarify:  offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money
(sighs with relief) Thank God
For a minute there felt hell freezing over
Did he ask for more than a million
Does the Pope shit in the woods
He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan
don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die
Taking off a
senator, that's pretty ballsy
Even for an asshole like you
Oh, 'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe
Who is
Marcon says nothing
Just looks at Hallenbeck and smiles
Oh, shit
He rubs tired eyes
'm the perfect fall guy
Everyone and his uncle Max knows  hate Baynard
(nods) Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy
My hands are clean
Hallenbeck scowls
() 100
: Any particular reason  should go along with this prize-winning scheme
(smiles) Just one
He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway
Reappears a moment later
He's got Joe's wife
He stands
Face contorting
Fists clenched
Rage courses through him like an electric current
Marcon cocks his gun
Sit down, Joe
moment
Joe stands, smouldering
On fire
Sarah speaks: Do what he says, Joe
Joe sits
Breathing shallowly
Eyes locked on Milo
Are you alright, Sarah
Yes
That's a temporary condition, Joseph
As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films
And unless you do every fucking thing Mr
Marcon tells you
your wife will make her motion picture debut
He meets Joe's murderous gaze
and smiles
101
- Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table
His ribs are taped
His arm in a cast
Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo
Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated: Look, 'll say it again for the cheap seats:  don't know anything and  can't help you
Okay
Can  go now
Bessalo grimaces in disgust
Let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason
Is that it
That's it
You're full of shit, kid
(beat) Tell me where Hallenbeck is
How the fuck should  know
Try his house
We did
Where is he
For Chrissake,  just met the guy
(beat) Look, Sergeant
don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck
just busted my throwing arm and 'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here
He glares defiantly at Bessalo
: 102
- The grey day wears on
Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment unit
Pulls up short, staring ahead -- Slumped outside the door to his apartment
Asleep crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand
He kneels beside her
Touches her shoulder
Hey
Wake up
She stirs
Awakens, looking at him
Her eyes are puffy and red from crying
Her hair is a tangled mess
She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts into tears
Buries her head in his chest, sobbing
He cradles her with his good arm
Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads: '
He stares at the note, dumbstruck
: - savage wind sweeps in off the ocean
Gulls wheel overhead
is tethered to a wooden dock outside the beach house
Milo and his crew prepare to cast off
Meanwhile: approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an Izod shirt
He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck
() 103
: They are seated on the dock
Each handcuffed to a metal railing
Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe's cuffs
Get up
Go fuck yourself
Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs
Hallenbeck gasps in pain
meant that
in a good way
Pablo hauls him to his feet
Props him against the railing
Time for a little payback, Joe
Call it a service to dear departed Chet
He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle
Sarah cries out in alarm
How's that feel, fuckhead
(weakly) 'm asshole
she's fuckhead
And with that, Pablo lets him have it
Rains punches on his chest and gut
Slams an elbow into his kidneys
Drives a knee into his groin
Joe hits the deck
Milo calls out from the boat: Easy, Pablo
want him conscious
Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form
Goddamn you, stop it
Oh, Jesus, leave him alone
() 104
: Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick
Spits on him
Hallenbeck vomits
Lies bleeding on the dock
Sarah crawls over to him
As far as the cuffs will allow
Cradles his head in her lap
Don't
look at me
Shhh
It's okay, Joe
'm here, it's okay
(strokes his hair) love you, Joe
Hallenbeck looks at her like she's just grown three heads
get the shit beat out of me
puke all over myself
and now you love me
never stopped loving you, Joe
Christ, you slept with three guys
You knew about the others
knew
You never said anything
Figured
you needed them
Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something
Like what
'Fuck you, Sarah'
Yes
Fuck you, Sarah
Anything to show that you
that you had some pride left
pause
Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh
() 105
: Sorry
'm fresh out
'm scared, Joe
Get me out of this
Must be my trick ear
Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of this
' You can take these guys, Joe
've got cracked ribs and a concussion
Save me, Joe
Be a hero
don't believe in heroes
That's no excuse
He stares up at her for a moment
Then, through bloody lips: Fuck you, Sarah
And he smiles
Just then, Milo signals from the boat
Seeing, this, Pablo approaches the couple again
All right, lovebirds, break it up
He yanks Sarah to her feet
Lets his gaze roam up and down her body
Nice tits
He rips open her blouse
Roughly fondles her breasts
Hallenbeck
On the ground
He growls with fury
Starts to push himself up
() 106
: Stay down, fucker
Don't you move
At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock
Whistling cheerfully
Careful, Pablo
We don't want to get Mrs
Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby
He squats next to Joe
Hello, Joseph, guess what
Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price
You're gonna kill us both anyway
Perhaps
But there are ways to die, and then there are
ways to die
Capisce
You determine your wife's fate
He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet
Propels him toward the boat
As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out: Joe
He stops
Turns
Looks at her
Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark: Tiny
Fizzling
Almost gone
But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly kindles -- And eight years melt away
Just like that
The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and says, with deadly calm: () 107
: 'll be back
(beat) That's a promise
Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol
You're wasting my time, Joseph
Let's go
Hallenbeck turns
Dirty
Tired
Unshaven
Bloody
He looks at Milo
and grins: If you touch me again
'll kill you
They stare into each other's eyes
Hallenbeck does not give an inch
Milo hits him again
- Remember Jimmy's friend, Henry, who we met briefly near the opening of the film
Of course you do, you're a highly-paid reader or development person
Well, Henry is seated in a big, lived-in den watching football films
The walls around him are adorned with hunting paraphernalia
Rifles
Trophies
There is a  at the door
He gets up
Crosses to the door
Opens it
And Jimmy Dix is there
He gets right to the point: need to borrow a gun, Henry
, -  - Conrad Marcon sits behind a huge teak desk
Surrounded by football paraphernalia
Paintings
Trophies
The
He picks up the receiver
Stabs a button
Marcon
: 108
- It's Milo, sir
We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours
Good boy, Milo
The commissioner's party starts at six
'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty
Very good, sir
Any problems with Hallenbeck
No, we're getting along famously
Glad to hear it
No fuckups, Milo
want him deep-sixed
assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise
Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit
If it annoys you,     could always adopt a Texas drawl,    though 'm afraid  don't know    any stories about fucking pigs
Sir
Cows, Milo
Never pigs
'll remember that, sir
He hangs up
Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles
Goddamn fruitcake
He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a   is seated in the shadows off to one side
His face is obscured
Marcon addresses him: () 109
: So far, so good
The Man in the corner nods, then speaks
As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full
We've worked too hard, Con
There's no margin for error
Take it easy, buddy
We're covered
You're using the first team, yes
Absolutely
(sighs) Actually,  have no choice
How's that
Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams
- sign reads,  :
Jimmy moves briskly down a concrete ramp toward a Hatteras sport charter
He is obsessed
Determined
Darian trots along behind him
She's holding up pretty well, considering
What do you need a boat for
'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina
Marcon will be there
He swings a bag of gear onto the boat
Starts to store it
Maybe
we should call the police
() 110
: No, honey
Not now
There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs
If  blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies
(beat) 'm sorry, Darian
(about to cry) So
what do we do
What  do
is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back
Is that gonna work
Beats me, but  think it's what your dad would do
'm scared
Me, too, honey
His gear stashed, he turns to Darian
Tries a smile
So
why'd you come to me, anyhow
don't know
thought you'd
know what happened, know what to do
(beat) mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes
Jimmy almost chokes
What
() 111
: When  was little, he used to talk about you all the time
Best football player in the game
Great this
Wonderful that
You shoulda seen him when you got busted
Jimmy stares straight ahead
Takes a deep breath
'll get them back, kiddo
'll get them back
: -   - The island sits beneath a dark, cloud-filled sky
Fog nestles in the foothills, rolling in off the ocean
slices through the murk, filled with light, laughter, Boats are arriving at a private dock
steady stream of guests
Tuxedoes and evening gowns
parade of phony hair and phony boobs
All mounting the stairs to a huge chalet
Inside, a dinner party is in progress
- in progress
People with six-figure incomes
Pretending they're important
Mingling
Schmoozing
At a raised bar, Conrad Marcon bends the ear of a Japanese businessman
lot of laughter
Back-slapping
sudden commotion near the front door
People crane their necks
Marcon turns to look, as: 112
enters the party, surrounded by an entourage of men in Armani suits
Seeing this, Marcon's face changes
Gone is the affable Texan
In his place, a ruthless murderer
He smiles
: as a thirty-shot clip is snapped into place
-  -  - Milo is preparing the weapon
He works the action
Pumps a round into the chamber
Looks up at Hallenbeck, who is bound hand and foot
Seated across from him in the boat's cabin
Your wife's very pretty
Fuck you, cocksucker
My, my
Little testy this evening
He pulls a switchblade out of his Windbreaker
That's not very polite, you know, calling someone a cocksucker lot of hard Ks
Very abusive sounding
Hallenbeck says nothing
What would you do, Joseph, if someone called you that
Would you cut out one of his eyes
Nope
What would you do
() 113
: 'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone
Milo studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish
It occurs to me, Joseph, that would very much like to hear you scream
Come again
You're so cool, aren't you
So
if you'll pardon the expression
hard-boiled
'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain
Play some rap music
Milo chuckles, shakes his head
Fascinating
When do  kill Baynard
(laughs) Come now, Joseph, did you really think that 'd hand you a loaded gun
(beat) You're not really going to kill anyone
'm not
No
He leans forward
You're going to be framed for the senator's murder
when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime
114
- Boats, lots of them
Sportfishers
Yachts
Floating boats
Money, money, everywhere, and plenty of drinks to drop
quietly into the harbor
Jimmy at the rudder
Nudges up to the dock
In the chalet above, the party rages
- ' Jimmy lashes the boat
Goes below
Grabs a tuxedo from the closet
Stands, dressed, in front of the mirror
Opens a box
Removes a 9 millimeter Baretta
Works the slide
Jacks a bullet into the cylinder
Stashes it in the waistband of his pants: In back
Concealed by the tuxedo
Studies his own grim face in the mirror
Okay, hot shit, let's do it
- Jimmy emerges from the cabin
Heads for the rail
voice calls out: (
) Nice tux
He turns, and sees Darian Hallenbeck
Peeking her head out from under a tarpaulin
Goddammit,  told you to go home
Fuck you,  stowed away
They're my parents, okay
Jimmy shakes his head
Exasperated
Fine, whatever
Just stay here
With the boat
() 115
: Darian starts to protest
He throws her the keys
Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here
Darian takes the keys
Frowns, says: You look terrible
feel terrible
Are you really a drug addict
was
kicked the habit
When
This morning
Stay here
He swings over the side, onto the dock
Don't let them break your other arm
Thanks, kid
You're a fuckin' inspiration
'  -  - Milo speaks to Hallenbeck
Clipped
Businesslike
At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved
He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea
Jesus
He thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff
Milo nods
Points to two identical suitcases in the corner
() 116
: Baynard will not leave his boat
One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase
This suitcast
He opens one of the cases
Hallenbeck stares
Twenty thousand of them, to be precise
Neatly bundled
Then we pull a simple switch
When the man returns to his boat, he's carrying this suitcase
He points to the identical twin
Plastics
(nods) Detonation upon opening
Enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft
(smiles) And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career
That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred
With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth
Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline
Maybe 'll get to hear you scream, after all
Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the door
You better get up here, we got a problem
117
-   - Milo's yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore
Island lights blink in the distance
Fog rolls in
Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck
Crosses to the railing, looks down at: bobbing in the water about thirty yards away
is waving his arms
Hailing them
Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son
Hey
Buddy,  got a cracked engine casing, 'm dead in the water
Can  get a tow
Milo swears under his breath
Calls out: 'm sorry, sir
This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector
Aw, shit
Look, it'll take ten minutes
'm sorry, we can't help you
Goddammit, now  gotta call the Coast Guard
Milo's crewman steps up to the rail
Speaks urgently: Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast Guard down on top of us
Milo ponders for maybe three seconds
Then he calls out: Excuse me
Sir
The Fisherman turns
His family beside him
Fuck you, sir
() 118
: He reaches under his Windbreaker
Pulls out an Ingram model
The entire family is blown away
and fly
The bodies topple like broken toys
Milo ceases fire
Turns to his crewman
Problem solved
Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen
He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred
- Jimmy is strolling along a hedge behind the house
Looking for a back entrance
He hears , approaching
Pulls up short
Ducks into the shadows
Senator Baynard goes by, with two bodyguards
Brisk
Businesslike
Christ,  can't believe  agreed to this dog and pony show
Let's get it over with
The head for the boats
Jimmy stares after them, mind racing
Makes a decision: heads for the boats
Following Baynard
/
'  - Jimmy casts off the lines
Heads for the cockpit
Darian is inside
Gimmee the keys, kiddo
Where are you going
() 119
: The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door
'm gonna follow him
He keys the ignition
Get off the boat
Fuck you, man
No way
Darian, Goddammit -- She runs below decks
(
) 'm not coming out
Jimmy looks up: The Senator's boat, a sleek, powerful Marlineer, is even now pulling out of the cove
Okay
Shit
Okay
Easy
Shit
He throttles forward
The Hatteras pulls away from the dock
: - The sound of  , as a refitted Bell Cobra cuts through the night sky over Catalina
Banks sharply, cruises offshore
- The  works the stick while the - searches the water below through infra-red binoculars
He speaks into a microphone
- This is Air One, over
(
) Roger, Air One, over
() 120
: - The drop zone is clear, repeat, the drop zone is clear, over
: '  - Milo is at the other end of the connection
Beside him, two crewmen
Roger, Air One, over and out
(replaces the mike) Up anchor, gentlemen, we have a go
(points to Hallenbeck) Gag him and stash him
As Milo goes topside, one of the men tapes Joe's mouth
The other opens a cramped storage compartment
They stuff him inside
Shut and lock the door
- About two miles offshore
The Senator's Marlineer cuts through the waves, converging with Milo's yacht
The two boats pull up alongside
The lines are made fast
One of Milo's crewmen greets Senator Baynard's , a slick-looking Italian in a $1,000 overcoat
Baynard's man hops from one boat to the other
Boarding Milo's yacht
Meanwhile -- - Jimmy Dix is clearly lost
He bangs his fist in frustration
Goddammit,  lost him
can't see a fucking thing
See if this boat has sonar
Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All
() 121
: Fuck you
Watch your mouth
Take a bath in my ass
They're clearly having no fun
: '  -  - The payoff is in progress
One of Milo's crewmen carries the suitcase over to the wall
Places it on a built-in counter
Underneath the suitcase is a half-finished jigsaw puzzle
Off to one side is a half-empty coffee container
The case is opened
Greenbacks galore
Baynard's Aide whistles softly
Examines the stacks of bills
Nods, satisfied
Okay
We're cool
Just then Milo enters the cabin
Adopts a harsh New York accent as he angrily barks: Hey
Any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah
No, sir, we didn't think -- Exactly, you didn't think
Goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin' guy
Hey, baby, 'm clean, take it easy -- Fuck easy
Against the wall, spread 'em
() 122
: As Baynard's man assumes the position -- Milo hits a concealed button
It happen in less than a second: the built-in counter rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an indentical counter
Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle
Identical coffee cup
And, of course, the identical suitcase
The indignant Aide turns around, pat-down concluded
Okay
Satisfied
Milo smiles apologetically
We're cool, baby
He hands over the suitcase
Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase
Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat
Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there
They cast off the lines
Freeing the two boats
'  - Milo watches, tense
As the lines are freed, he says: Hard to starboard, get us out of here
Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast
'  - The go-between heads   below deck, carrying the suitcase
Senator Baynard puts   down his wine glass
Looks up, expectant
The Aide flashes an "-Okay" grin
Sets the suitcase on a table
Meanwhile -- '   - Jimmy has had about enough
He sighs with frustration
Stares ahead into the fog
() 123
: All we're doing is burning gas
Sorry, kid, 'm turning back
The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing , growing louder
Darian looks up puzzled
Do you hear that --
And with that -- bursts from the fog
Directly in front of them
Hovers like an avenging angel,   -- Holy fucking shit
Rotor wash sprays in every direction
The noise is deafening
- The  grabs the mike and shouts into it: Code yellow, code yellow, we got a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie, over
'  - Milo snaps his head to one side, hearing this
Grabs the mike: Air One, Air One, where the fuck is he
(
) Nine o'clock, repeat, on your nine, and closing fast
124
Jimmy's   out of the fog
And suddenly he's in a world of shit
Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht
Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer
Oh, wow
We're fucked
He  the
Spins the wheel, banks to port
screams past, cutting across the bow, nearly taking off the roof -- Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile -- ' The Senator actually has his hands on the suitcase to open it, when one of his  yells: Shit
Something's going on
What is it
Another boat
It's a fucking setup
Get us out of here, now
The guy relays the order, and: Baynard's Marlineer surges forward
Full throttle, heading for shore, as -- ' Milo skids out on deck, grabbing for his machine gun
Calls out: Who the fuck is he
crewman grabs a pair of binoculars
Meanwhile -- 125
Hallenbeck has no fucking idea what's going on, but he can hear everthing that's said, as: the Crewman lowers the binoculars in disbelief: Son of a bitch
It's Dix, the Goddamn quarterback
Hallenbeck's face goes through various stages of shock
It's nothing compared to when he hears: (
) There's a little girl with him
With that, he goes berserk
Draws his legs back, thunders them against the compart- ment doors
Kicks with all his might
Over and over like a crazed horse, as: Air One does a flyby, circling, awaiting instructions
Milo grabs the hand mike and says: Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger
'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over
(
) That's a roger
Over and out
(turns to his men) Okay, let's go
Full throttle
- With a final, resounding crash, Hallenbeck kicks open the compartment
Topples out onto the cabin floor
() 126
: Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied in front of him
Everybody's topside; for the moment, at least, he is forgotten
He half crawls, half lurches over to the kitchen nook
Worms beneath the table
awkward, desperate
Drags out the can of gasoline
Tries to unscrew the top
No dice
Can't get a grip
Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side
Brings his legs up in the air -- Slams them down on the can
Over and over until, with a metallic pop --
it bursts
Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile: Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's Hatteras
The crew members take up positions on the prow
As he throws Darian to the deck, shields her with his body
The wheelhouse is  by
He grits his teeth
Reaches beneath his tux
Yanks out the  and returns ,  --  --
and meanwhile: Hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his teeth
Dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet
He releases the box
Bends
Picks up a single match in his teeth
Presses his face to the wall
Gives his neck a wrench -- Lights the match
He drops the match on top of the
() 127
: of combustion
It bursts into flame
Joe swivels around
Balancing on his backside
Thrusts his legs into the fire
Strains
Pulls
Sweat runs in rivers
Until the ropes binding his legs snap
He lurches to his feet, lets free
Now there's only one problem: He's on fire
The legs of his pants are soaked with gas
Flames race up his legs
He plunges headlong up the stairs
where he hurtles toward the rail, dives -- into the sea, swallowed by the waves
suddenly screams: Fire in the hole
Fire, indeed
It's a rapidly-spreading blaze
The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to put out the fire, and meanwhile: surfaces, gasping for air
Trying to swim with his hands tied
spots him first
Sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean, screams: Daddy
Jimmy whirls around, startled
Shit
don't believe it
Do something
Hurry
() 128
: Jimmy spins the wheel
Banks hard to port
Brings the boat around in an arc
Yells to Darian: Keep the wheel like this
Don't let it move
She grabs the wheel
Jimmy bends down
Opens a compart- ment
Takes out the boat's anchor
Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain
He hefts it like a grappling hook
Third and long, baby, lets' go
And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm -- But, boy, does he heave that anchor
It soars through space, chain playing out behind it
Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck -- Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the waves
' Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted Hallenbeck
He growls in rage
Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as: Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh --
He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet
the water where he just was
He skims over the waves
Bounced
Battered
Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour
Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in
Struggling
Straining
The boat rushing headlong, driverless
With a last, desperate surge of energy -- They drag Hallenbeck over the side
Into the boat
Dad
() 129
: She collapses, weeping, atop her father
Hugs him for all she's worth
What the hell's she doing here
stowed away
splits the air
Reminds them they're not out of the woods
' is behind them again
The fire is out
The chase is on
It steadily cuts the distance
' Hallenbeck staggers to his feet
Get below, Darian
And stay there
He stumbles into the wheelhouse
Dazed
Barely conscious
Got any ideas
Yeah
Go really fast and hope they don't catch us
(beat) Oh, shit
What
Fog bank, dead ahead
Hang on
Into the fog they go, and, folks -- This is really scary
Because you can't see a foot in front of your face
They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour
Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield
() 130
: And then a shape materializes off to port: Milo's yacht
Running alongside
Drawing closer
Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel
No dice
The yacht draws ever closer
men on deck
machine guns
Joe looks over
and his face tells the story: We're dead
Except, just then, a strange thing happens: Milo's yacht veers off to the left
Away from Hallenbeck
Jimmy stares, dumbfounded
What the fuck
They're peeling off
Why
pause
then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt: 'Cause they got sonar, that's why
Hard to port
Port
Left, Goddammit
The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog -- The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them
Shit fuck piss
They almost make it
As it is, they avoid a head-on
Instead, they hit broadside
sickening  --
Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet
momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them
Jimmy gets up
Staggers to the controls
Pushes the throttle
The boat lurches forward -- Then
Fizzles
He swears violently
() 131
: We're on half power, we lost an engine
- The crippled boat chugs through the mist
swears again
Bangs his fist
We're sitting ducks
They got sonar
They can find us
Kill the running lights and radio the Coast Guard
Jimmy flicks off the lights
Grabs the mike
As he does, a   fills the cockpit, causing him to pause
and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog -- And Air One hovers directly overhead
Fuck me
The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a  rocket
Get down
They both hit the floor
Hands over their heads -- And then the pilot makes a costly error: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht
With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog -- right  the
Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds
Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass
Turns night into day
132
are still huddled on the floor
Pause
They look up
Bewildered
There was a big light
Big noise
Why aren't they dead
They move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window
Stare in disbelief
Joe looks at Jimmy
Jimmy at Joe
Debris rains down
: - Jimmy, Joe and Darian are on deck, chugging through the wreckage
Darian clings to her father's arm, in shock
Hallenbeck sees something in the distance
Squints: What's that
Jimmy looks:     bright object
going in circles
That's Baynard's boat
(nods) It can get us to shore faster than this one, don't you think
He starts to turn away
Notices something in the water
Speaks over his shoulder to Jimmy
Hand me the pole
Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end
He fishes in the water
Snares a large, floating object
Swings it aboard
Drops it at Jimmy's feet
The suitcase
What is it
Birthday present
() 133
: He turns away
Jimmy bends to open the suitcase
Joe heads into the cockpit, Darian beside him
Steers the boat away from the crash site
Toward the senator's boat
Chugs forward on half an engine
, Jimmy suddenly yells: Holy fucking shit
'  - The once-mighty Marlineer runs aimless circles in the mist
Half the cockpit is blown away, probably by a rocket
The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and Hallenbeck steps to the rail, carrying the Baretta
Wait here
He swings aboard the senator's boat
Gun cocked
Ready
'  - Enters the cockpit
What's left of the roof is bullet- pocked
The navigator is dead
Slumped over the controls
Joe pulls him off the panel
the
Joe bursts inside
Hard and fast
Gun leveled
No need
It's a slaughterhouse
The walls are perforated
Baynard and his men are dead
The suitcase's evil twin lies unopened on the table
Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard's lifeless body
Stares into the wide-open eyes
Sorry, Cal
Life in the big city
: - The senator's boat pulls up to the dock
No one is around
134
- Hallenbeck crouches next to Darian, looks her in the eye
Listen carefully
'm gonna go get your mom back, okay
You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there
Talk to the waitress but don't mention me
Mom and  will come pick you up later, got it
(crying) They're gonna kill you
Are you kidding
do this for a living
(hands her a twenty) Buy me an ice cream
'll be back
(beat) love you
She throws her arms around him
: -  - All business now
Deadly serious
Jimmy and Joe stare ahead through the windshield
Grim
Tense
In the back seat sits the coveted suitcase
Your prints are all over that boat
What happens when they find the bodies inside
Quit being a fuckin' killjoy
He cuts the headlights
Cruises to a stop behind a road- side dumpster
Come on
We've got some things to pick up
'  (
) - They creep across a suburban lawn, hugging the shadows
() 135
: Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark
Deserted
Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants, nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin, pants hanging in scorched tatters
Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand
They stop
Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree
Joe points: late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his house
There is a man slouched inside
Smoking
Shit
Someone's staking me out
(clears his throat) Oh,  forgot to tell you
The police want you for killing Mike Miller
Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look
: - Coast Guard cutter is circling the site of the boat/ chopper crash
uniformed  shines a light on the dark waters
think  got someone
Four o'clock
is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage
Half his hair is burned away
His face is blistered
He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as: He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready
: 136
- The sour stakeout cop reaches for a job necessity: the pot to piss in
He undoes his fly
Pees into an old Maxwell House coffee can
Opens the door to dump it out
hand reaches in, lightning quick
Grabs the can, throws it back in his face
As he jerks backward, blinded, the hand knocks him cold
- Hallenbeck drags the unconscious cop from the car
Let's get him inside and tie him up
Are you crazy
That's a cop
You don't punch cops
forgot
Hurry up
'  - The cop is bound and gagged in the corner
Unconscious
Hallenbeck moves hurriedly
Not a second to waste
Pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer
Rips off the sleeve
Throws it to Jimmy
Wear that
He strips off his own shirt
Crosses to the closet
You know how to use a gun
The trigger's the little black thing
Here
He hands Jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd, black cylinders
() 137
: Use these
They're shredders
Equipped with an explosive charge
When you fire the gun, they spray on impact
Take out anything within ten yards
What are you gonna use
little souvenir
He reaches into the closet
Pulls out a sniper rifle
The rifle
The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest
Go bring the car around
'  - Jimmy emerges, starts across the lawn
Pulls up short
Stares ahead at: - parked at the curb
He starts to cry out -- And a dark figure looms behind him
Clubs him in the head
'  - Hallenbeck snaps a full magazine into the rifle
Stuffs extras into a black Windbreaker
Hears a
Looks up, expecting Jimmy -- Draws a sharp breath: standing in the doorway
All of them have guns
Pablo grins, shakes his head: Face it, pal
You're fucked by God
: 138
as they're placed in front of Hallenbeck
He is seated on the bed
Three guns covering him
Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin
Are you a literate man, Joe
got a subscription to Jugs magazine
That's good
See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story
sticks his head in the door
We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk
Get him out of here
Take him to Mr
Marcon
'll follow you as soon as my business here is finished
The Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two others
He studies them
Calculates the odds
Verdict: Bad
Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe
About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way
Yeah
you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself
Hey, who's writing this story
You're doing all the good parts
Oh, and, Joe
Don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered
What cop
() 139
: Pablo draws his pistol
into the unconscious cop in the corner
That one
You son of a bitch
Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it
He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage
Pity the fool
Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes
thoroughly unnerving stare
Then Joe does something very odd
He says, softly: We don't like Pablo very much, do we, Furry Tom
There is a pause
And then, incredibly -- Furry Tom answers
high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice
(as Furry Tom) No, Mr
Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass
Dead silence
Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for that matter
and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven- triloquism
And the funny thing is, he's really good
Pablo overcomes his shock
Shit, is he doing that
Hallenbeck's face remains cold
Expressionless
Furry Tom, tell Pablo what 'm gonna do to him
(as Furry Tom) You're gong to make Pablo eat all his teeth, Mr
Hallenbeck
() 140
: Pablo can't help it
He bursts out laughing
That's amazing, man
Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom
Inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth
(as Furry Tom) Hey, Mr
Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me
That's not very nice
By now, all three hoods are in hysterics
Are you mad, Furry Tom
(as Furry Tom) don't get mad
get even
And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens -- And , showering stuffing
One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half his throat is gone
And Furry Thomas   again, and the second goon goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed already -- Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas
Pablo is a little sharper
little quicker
He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand
Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut
They reel across the room
Locked in combat
Lamps topple
Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall
Leaves a dent
Does it again, a sickening impact
Starts to strangle Joe -- And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore
He's not going to make it
The world swims away
Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something beside him
something hanging on the wall
Fights to focus
Breath gone
Strength gone
Identifies the object: () 141
: His Presidential Medal of Valor
Shiny medal
Shiny ribbon
His name
It hits him quite suddenly: The medal has sharp edges
With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the wall
Drives it into Pablo's throat
The big man stumbles backward
Eyes wide
Gurgling
He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely from his gushing neck
Drops to the dusty carpet
Dies
Hallenbeck takes a deep breath
Eyes wide
Insane
He is surrounded by corpses
He takes another deep breath
Picks up the sniper rifle
Slings it over his shoulder
Heads for the door
'   - Jimmy Dix is on the floor, and Marcon is kicking him savagely
Pointed alligator boots lashing out
Again and again
You know  don't enjoy doin' this, Jim
Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball
Marcon paces, shaking his head
remember how much you hated the pain
You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you
'll make a deal with you
Tell me who you talked to, and 'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow
Nobody knows
Just
just me
and Hallenbeck
Now, see, 'd love to believe you
But we are talking about the future of my football team
() 142
: He crosses to the fireplace
Removes a poker
And ain't nothin' more important than my ball club, 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs
Got one of yours, you know
(softly) Who'd you talk to, Jimmy
Nobody
Marcon raises the poker
Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm
- Hallenbeck leaves the rented Subaru by the side of the road
He is dressed in combat black
Government issue
Rifle over one shoulder
Hunting knife in a hip scabbard
Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush
Heading down the canyon
'  - An armed sentry patrols the grounds
Below him, nighttime
stretches to the Pacific
Joe Hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees
Clamps a gloved hand over the sentry's mouth
Drives the hunting knife into his back
- Marcon stirs the fireplace logs, stoking the blaze
Replaces the poker
Crosses to his desk and sits
Jimmy is on the carpet, delirious
Out of it
Marcon presses a button
An armed  appears
Mr
Marcon
() 143
: He's nothing, he can't hurt us
Take him somewhere and kill him
Yes, sir
The Hardguy crosses the room
Grips Jimmy by the shoulders
With a soft  of sound, his forehead blooms crimson
He collapses, lifeless
At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as: steps through the French doors behind him
He resembles nothing human
demon in black
Eyes burning
Gun held loosely
An extension of his arm
Marcon reaches for the button to summon help
Don't
He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx
Hisses: The gun is silenced, 'll fuckin' kill you
Where's my wife
don't remember,
Joe shoves on the gun
The barrel chokes him
My wife
Grabs a pen
Shoves it in Marcon's hand
The address
Now
It's
Milo's film studio
Write it down, dumbfuck
() 144
: He speaks over his shoulder: Jimmy, you okay
Jimmy stirs
Hurts like hell
Marcon finishes writing
Hallenbeck snatches up the address
Stows it in his pocket
Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it
(beat) Can you walk, Jimmy
Yeah
think so -- Joe, behind you
Too late
revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head
Drop it
It's the same odd voice we heard earlier
The man with the speech impediment
You drop it, asshole, or  kill Marcon
The Strange Man chuckles
Sorry, but that won't work don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun
pause
Once more, Joe calculates the odds
No dice
He places the rifle on the desk
Walk over there by your friend, Joe
Hallenbeck turns around
and, for once, his jaw drops
He's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago
145
Son of the late senator
The right side of his face doesn't quite match the left
The muscles don't work
Hallenbeck recovers his composure
As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him
Two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear
Well, Goddamn
How's the head, Lou
( ) Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely
Next time, Lou, just say no
Shit
This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face
Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid
He snaps at Baynard: You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me
Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad
(turns) never thought 'd see you again, Joe
Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here
Call it a financial partnership
For a price,  agreed to connect Mr
Marcon to the necessary people in Washington
In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times
() 146
: (ignores him) But imagine my delight this morning, Joe, when Mr
Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime
What can  say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist
Do  also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess
(sighs) It was , unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne
spoke a little too freely to that hooker
She wasn't a hooker, dickhead
He should know, Jimmy
With a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it
You can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth
Jimmy chimes in: We'd rather watch yours
It's goofy-lookin'
Marcon has had enough
He pounds his fist on the desk
Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em both
Any bright ideas, Joe
Gimmee a minute
Excuse me, could you give him a minute
He's trying to think of a way out of this
() 147
: Behind them, the two hardguys  their
Jimmy sweats
He's scared shitless underneath
Hallenbeck clears his throat: You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man
Marcon holds up his hand
Wait
The gunmen lower their weapons
Let's humor this asshole
What are you talking about
(shrugs) Nothing much, just that  made a phone call from the boat on the way in
You called the cops
Fuck it, they can't prove a thing
Oh, but  didn't call the cops called the mob
Marcon stares at him
Blinks
See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking
If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government
(beat) wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you
Of course,  might be able to call it off
Marcon stares him down
pause
Then Marcon smiles: () 148
: He's bluffing
He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit
Nice try, asshole
(waves his hand) Kill them
(plowing ahead) Then there's the matter of two million dollars
Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float
He once again looks Marcon in the eye
've got your money, Connie
Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru
We'll take you to it
(laughing) Jesus,  don't believe it
This guy's a riot
(sotto) don't think it's working, Joe
Try another one
Hell, 'm fresh out
You wanna try one, kid, go for it
pause
Then, without warning, Jimmy turns -- And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm
Decks him
Fuck you, Joe, 'm not just gonna stand here and die
Mr
Marcon, he's lying
We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker
have the key on me
'l hand it over if you let me go
Hallenbeck stares in disbelief
The kid's actually trying something
Where is the key, Jimmy
() 149
: It's stashed in my shorts
(nods) All right
Slow and easy
Sure
Slow and easy
Jimmy reaches inside his jeans
Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist
We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell
He holds it in his fist
Promise you'll let me go
Hell with that, son
Hand it over or 'll have you kneecapped
Oh, yeah
Well, that's too bad
See, it's one of those new plastic keys
The kind that melt
And, with that, he hurls it into the fire
So fast that nobody can see just what he threw
guess nobody gets the money
The two hardguys rush to the fireplace
Pull it out of there
One of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the
Sprays the two hardguys
Cuts them to ribbons
Then, several things happen at once: Everybody goes for a gun
Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- As Marcon draws his  and , missing -- Joe  , - --
Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile -- () 150
: Baynard draws down on Jimmy, who picks up a flaming log and hurls it, knocks the  wild, as: Marcon darts out the French doors, into the night, so Hallenbeck spins,  at Baynard -- Blows him backward in a bloody spray
Baynard sags against the mantel
Collapses, dead
Silence
Jimmy and Joe are alone with three corpses
Jimmy snatches up a pistol
Joe slings the sniper rifle over his shoulder
Stares at Jimmy: Plastic keys
The kind that melt
Hey
Short notice, best  could do
You did fine, junior
Learned it from a pro
Come on
'  - The wooden garage   outward, bursting to splinters, as a Ford   right  them, Conrad Marcon at the wheel
He careens off into the night
Makes a getaway
- Jimmy and Joe come racing out of the house, just in time to see Marcon's taillights disappearing up the canyon
Son of a bitch
Forget about him
Let's get my wife
He crosses to a parked Mercedes
open the door
Gets in
Pops the ignition package
Hotwires it
The   to life
() 151
: Get in
He's so slick, it's scary
'  - The Mercedes barrels out through the splintered garage doors
down the hill
- They stare straight ahead
Tense
Breathless
On my way, honey, on my way
- Conrad Marcon, meanwhile, is rocketing along the winding road, heading up the canyon, when he sees something ahead: - ' sitting abandoned in the roadside brush
Acting on a sudden hunch, he   the
Stops the car
Gets out, crosses to the rental
Peeks in
two-million-dollar suitcase sits, pretty as punch, on the back seat
Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't bluffing
He draws his gun
Blows out the glass
Reaches in
Opens the car door
Snatches up the briefcase
: 152
- block of seedy-looking brick buildings
Off Sunset
Not many people at this hour
slews around the corner races down the street, running without headlights
Lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley
Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand
Hellenbeck is grim, purposeful
Jimmy is nervous
'm new at this, Joe
How do we do it
We get in, we get out
Shoot anyone who's not my wife
Check that: Don't shoot me
He jacks a fresh clip into his rifle
: inserted in the latch of a back door
Hallenback finds the tumblers
Springs the lock in seconds
- Jimmy and Joe
Side by side
Walking
Expressionless
They round a bend in the hall
seated outside a wooden door
38 special in a shoulder rig
Sees them, leaps to his feet, gun clearing leather -- Joe blows him out of his socks
-
Silenced
Guy hits the wall
Paints it with blood
Flops, dead
Jimmy and Joe step over him
Joe braces himself
Draws back his foot
Kicks the door, as: 153
- The door flies open
Doesn't hit the wall
Something stops it
Joe doesn't blink
He puts the rifle against the panel
three  through the wood
Keeps going
body falls out from behind the door
Joe doesn't even look
The body sits up
Not dead yet
Jimmy comes through the door
him
Follows Joe
One more door to go
Thick
Soundproofed metal
It isn't locked
Joe yanks it open
Steps inside
Lights
Camera
The wrong kind of action
on a bed, naked
bright lights on her
Around her, a director cameraman
with a chainsaw
and he's standing right over her
Jimmy  down the two artistes
Joe takes the actor
Cut
He throws the hunting knife
It pierces the guy's neck
The chainsaw clatters to the floor
He does the funny little dance peculiar to those with pierced necks
Falls
Dies
And then, mercifully, it's over
Joe crosses to the bed, puts out an arm, and Sarah collapses against him, shaking with sobs
() 154
: He strokes her hair
Speaking softly
Quietly
Speaking to the only woman he's ever loved: 'm here
it's all right
'm here
He cradles his wife in the middle of a slaughterhouse
: - Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes
He turns to Jimmy
Hands him a set of keys
Drive one of their cars
They won't be needing them
Where do you want me to go
The two million bucks is still in the Subaru
Parked on Mulholland above Marcon's house
Go pick it up and bring it to the office
We're gonna go get Darian
Yes, massah
He moves off into the parking lot
Hallenbeck says to Sarah
'll take you and Darian to the office
You can sleep there
Why can't we go home
There's four corpses in the bedroom
Oh
It's a very tiny "oh
" - ' in the shadow of the freeway
The night wears on
From the billboard, Gorgeous continues to entice
155
'  - Darian is asleep, cradled in her mother's arms
Her mother is awake, cradled in Joe's arms
Jimmy should be here any minute
Then we gotta talk to the cops
Sarah nestles into the crook of his arm
Will the police catch Marcon
Maybe
He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town
pause, then Sarah says: remember when we got married
My friends would talk about their husbands
They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer
'  used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking
' Don't knock it
It's a skill
She turns
Looks into his eyes
want to try, Joe
Do you still want to try
pause
He leans in and kisses her tenderly
And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher
Ahh, shit
Looks like the local constable has come to chat
Shall we invite him in
No
Stay here
'll deal with it
() 156
: He gets up, throws on a jacket
'  - Joe exits the office, starts across the lawn toward the vehicle with the flashing light
Realizes with a sudden shock:   something's wrong
That's not
' the insignia on the door panel reads In the same glance, he sees there's a dead cop slumped in the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that: Milo is in the driver's seat
Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly   on Joe
Son of a bitch
He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as: - Sarah sits bolt upright
Eyes panicked
Terrified
Darian comes awake, screaming: Mommy, what's happening
Sarah leaps off the couch, cradling Darian and meanwhile -- - Hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support legs, as   it to splinters
157
advances
changing clips
Methodical
Precise
Like a robot
He is obsessed
All vestige of sanity gone
You fucked up my face, Joseph
Joe starts to climb
Scales the wooden structure
Swings himself onto the raised platform
Flattens behind the billboard
Don't try to hide, Joseph
've got all night, you fucked up my face
He sprays a  of  up at the billboard
huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward
Through the wooden frame
hot   through Joe's arm
An eruption of blood
He hisses in pain
Rolls away from the gunfire
Looks around
Desperate
Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby
He counts to three
Milo calmly changes clips
Hallenbeck bursts from cover
Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of the billboard, hard and fast -- the board right behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous's derrierre -- And then Joe does a risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he doing
() 158
: He's trying to make the freeway
It's a good fifteen feet
Try it sometime
He flies through open air -- Milo's   below, seeking him out -- And just does make it
Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming as he rolls on his injured arm
Looks up -- is headed straight for him, bearing down
He rolls aside just in time
It  past
Staggers to his feet, frantic -- and Milo is climbing the billboard
Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide
There isn't any
He's going to have to run through traffic
He shifts from foot to foot, searching for an opening, and meanwhile -- - Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway, driving, when he looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck
don't fucking believe it
He swerves over to the side and meanwhile watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform
Walks across the front of the billboard
Toward the freeway
Toward Joe
Snarling
Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground
Heaves it
Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow
Blood flows
All it does is piss him off
You ruined my flesh

: Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as Milo opens up again, a chattering  of
The muzzle flash is blinding
The windshield of a passing car  -- The driver panics, the car spins out of control -- Slews across the road in the middle of traffic
of
slides straight toward Hallenbeck
He dives aside, rolls to his feet -- And he's right in Milo's sights
My friends, the fat lady just sang
Except another lady says different: single   the air
Milo's chest explodes with bubbling blood
He shrieks
Turns, staring in disbelief at below, on the lawn
She aims Joe's service revolver and says: You just fucking die
She  again, and Milo reels backward
Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard
She  the  again and again
Empties the gun
Milo jerks and twitches
Racked by gunfire
Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making Gorgeous's bloody buns even bloodier -- Clutches himself
Looks over at Hallenbeck
She's something, isn't she
Milo pitches forward
Falls to his death

stares, dumbfounded at Sarah
She look up at him
moment passes between them
Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars Amidst it all, he stands
Beaten
Bloody
Bullet-scarred
Jimmy winds his way through the cars
Walks up to Joe
They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says: The car's over on the other side
'mere,  want to show you something
405  -   - Jimmy and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the rented Subaru
Jimmy points to the shattered window
Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat
Had to be Marcon, right
There is a pause
They both stare at the car
Two million
Down the drain
Except, after a beat
they begin to laugh
First chuckling, then chortling
Now it's go-for-broke
Jimmy hoots
Joe howls
Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk -- You can guess what's inside
Son of a bitch got the wrong one
: on the dresser of a fancy penthouse suite
Signed by Joe Montana, no less
bustles back and forth, shoves the last of his needed possessions into a travel bag
Hefts it
Puts it near the door
() 161
: Crosses to the bed, where the other suitcase lies
Looks at it
Smiles, contented
Can't help himself
He reaches out
Flicks the latch
Opens it
There is a note taped to the inside: - 32ND  - Marcon's flaming corpse is   through the glass, along with his earthly possessions
He plummets like a meteor
: - Two ten-year-old black boys are walking down the street
Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of the skyscrapers
Quite suddenly, without warning -- football drops out of the sky
Hits and bounces, very high -- Comes down
Settles
Rocks, back and forth
The kids look up, puzzled
Searching the sky
The ball sits there
Only slightly scorched
Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught, one of the boys bends down
looks both ways
Picks up the ball
Smiles
Then, as if by some unspoken agreement -- The other boy starts to run
Slowly at first, then faster
faster still
slant pattern, heading for the mailbox
And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass
Their laughter is joyful
Innocent
Fervid
They will grow up to be sports heroes

- Hallenbeck sits impassively while Bessalo paces, fuming
You got a lot of questions to answer
know
You'll probably lose your license
know
Bessalo glares at him
Do you care
Hallenbeck smiles
My wife loves me
Bessalo looks at him like he's grown a tail
- '  - Another blistering hot December day
Gorgeous looks on from her perch, cheerful as ever, despite the crusted brown stripe on her ass
'  - The suitcase sits on a table
Jimmy and Joe contemplate it over a bottle of Seagrams
So
Yeah
So
(clears his throat) You gonna keep it
Hallenbeck nods
Some of it
() 163
: How much
Hallenbeck frowns
Opens the case
Reaches in -- And plucks out two crisp $100 bills
Stuffs them in a pocket
Jimmy stares at him
(shrugs) My fee
He shuts the case
Shoves it toward Jimmy
Jimmy leans forward, eyeing the suitcase
Shit, Joe
got all the money need
He shoves it back into the center
Joe nods
'm thinkin'  could use a partner
(beat) Think you could handle that for awhile
maybe could handle that
For awhile
He pours a drink
Raises his glass on high: Alex the detective
He drinks
- uniformed man is emptying the   jar when he notices a suitcase lying against the wall
Under a poster that says  :
He bends down
Opens the suitcase
When the money is counted, there will be $1,999,800
note is taped to the inside: 164

- Jimmy and Joe walk side by side
Away from us
Slightly drunk
Palms wave lazily
sweaty Santa rings a bell
See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks
But you still can't be hangin' around Satan Claus, you know why
Why
'Cause someday, compadre
Satan Claus and Santa Claus are gonna have a big fight, and you know what
(beat) Santa's gonna kick some royal ass
He puts a fatherly arm around Jimmy's shoulder, grins: Hey
Smile, you fuck
