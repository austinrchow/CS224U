Tell us what we're up against
Golden (
) In it's simplest terms
The end of Mankind
One asteroid, one mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force of all the  nuclear weapons in the  world, times a thousand
Half our population will die within 24  hours from tidal waves and heat pulses
The other half won't be so lucky
In the  end, it will be men  eating the flesh of other men
(beat) It's not the end of the  world, General, the world - Earth - will still be here
But there will be no  life - maybe cockroaches and  some resilient strands of bacteria
Temple Well, that's really positive, Dan

Their Mars Probe in '96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa
Temple They're going to pull off the probe and replace it with four Atlas  Class  nuclear warheads

) To when
Temple Sixteen hours from now
All the
Technicians  at once
Golden (
) What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together
Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear detonation is not  going to work
The only way is to split the thing in half and hope the two pieces  slide past us
Temple Thank you for bringing up the impossible, Dan
Colinswood People, the President's joining us, Mr
President
President (
) Well, this has been a tough day
The media's all over this

Telling the public we might all be dead in  eighteen days achieves nothing but panic
Golden (
) Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing to do unless you have the exact co-ordinates
There are only twelve telescopes  powerful enough  to see it right now
You've got a full moon goin' for four days -  makes it all but impossible to see
Once these things draw closer to Earth, you'll never keep a lid on  this

Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost expert in  deep drilling
You hold specialized patents in high speed bits, drilling fluids,  downhole motors Can  call you Harry
Harry Stick with Stamper
Golden Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole
It's in a difficult  place
Harry 've drilled in them all
Golden Not

If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be over
Golden We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a nuclear device in  it's core
To do that we need to drill an eight hundred foot hole
Harry looks at

Harry How does it work
Harry starts to inspect the bit
Quincy It works through a series of complexly designed differential gears
Harry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further -- Harry This is my Patent
Quincy "Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics," by Harry
Stamper
You registered it with the
Patent Office last year
Harry You stole it
Quincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper
Quincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button
The drill bit  presses down into a block of concrete and begins to rapidly  through it, as  Harry marvels at the realisation of his design
Quincy (cont'd) We built this arm to mine ice from the moon -- greatest discovery in space in thirty years
Harry What'd this cost
Golden Ten million
Quincy Twenty-our million
Harry Boy, 'm in the wrong line of work
So, that's where my taxes go
For  thievin' incompetent, government employed rip-off artists
No torque adjustment, no pressure release valve
a big hunk of junk
Quincy We're working on that

What is the price
Harry Fifty million dollars

Stamper, this mission is to preserve the future of
Harry You're right, too low
'm still pissed
Seventy million
Temple Done
Harry looks to Grace
Harry Give that money to my Greenpeace buddies

Temple reluctantly nods
They stand to shake, Harry pulls away again

Golden The deal was for you, not others
Harry 'm only as good as the men  work with
The ones in those home movies  of yours

Chick Charlie Bronson could kick Steve McQueen's ass and have enough left over  to duke it out with Burt Reynolds in his "Smokey and the Bandit" period
Max 'm glad you qualified that shit 'cause you know the Burt Reynolds of  "Deliverence" would have kicked Charlie's ass
Chick Burt was trouble in that flick
Max What would you say the all-time, slam-bam, take-no-prisoners, kick-ass  Charlie Bronson movie is
Chick All time
Well, let me think
"Dirty Dozen," the first "Death Wish

That movie where he hunted the buffalo don't remember the name but he  hunted a buffalo and he said like three words during the whole picture
That's my  selection
Max Fine
The buffalo movie

presses a button and the cabin, simulating "depressurisation" in space,  begins to fill with water

climbs out of the tank
After a  minute,
looks up, sees all the eyes in the room on him

Harry runs his hand over a that hangs from his neck
Golden approaches
Golden

We need a list of names from you to fill the slot
Harry

Golden We don't want independent thinkers
And we don't need heroes
We need a  team
Harry You have to have confidence in the men you send up understand that
But 'm the one that has to land on that rock
Not you

Golden One shot
Pull him in line or send him home

Tech approaches
Technician Harry wants to see you

stand in the centre of a high-tech supply room

Harry You tell me what the hell you think you're doing
'm trying to work with the team
Harry Bullshit
You're trying to lead this team
You're trying to be me
You're not me
What do you want
You want me to quit
Harry If you can't bury this cowboy shit, yeah,  want you to quit
don't have to prove anything to anybody, Harry
Harry  listen to
, you listen to me
That's the chain
Either you  follow it, or you're done
'll follow it
Harry  stood up for you, because 've made a life of proving people wrong
Harry's hand slides down to the medal hanging from his neck
Harry (cont'd) When  was about your age,  was in Galveston, Texas
scraped together some money, bought some old equipment, a little land set up a rig  and drilled my first hole
Then  sat there and watched her soak up the sun for six  months - waiting for this baby to pop
Everybody told me to quit
wouldn't  listen
My wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace
Everybody in town thought   was a fool
But  stayed with it
And in the last hour of the last day, she  popped
She spit out that black gold and  danced in it like a wild Indian
(reflective ) captured the magic (holding medal) This is the last piece of pipe that struck  gold that day
Harry takes off the medal
Sets it on the table
He grabs a cutting vice and  cuts the medal in two perfect halves
He hands one half to
Harry (cont'd) Here, take it up there

The two teams sit in the orange
flight  pressure suits
Golden enters and stands before the room
Golden In the book of Revalations, the Bible speaks of a final day on Earth,  when all mankind shall perish, shall cease to exist
This day is known as  Armageddon
(firm) Right  now, that day conflicts with six billion schedules
(beat) For the  first time in the history of this planet, s species possesses the technology to  prevent it's own  extinction
(beat) 've been with
my entire adult life
Eleven years as an astronaut, another fifteen on the ground at Mission Control
Twenty-six years 've had  to answer one question -- why
Why more money
Why the race for  space
Why do we need to know what is up there
(beat) When we come through  this, 'll take  comfort in the fact that won't ever have to answer those  questions again
You are our warriors up there
You are our last hope
God be  with you
The crew stands

Harry studies them
Grace  approaches
Harry You know  was thinking, Gracie
Over the years,  should have patted  you on the back more
Grace Dad, you don't need -- Harry No father has ever been prouder of his child, Gracie want you to know  that
Grace's reaction makes it clear that Harry has never said anything like this  before
Grace  love you, Dad
Harry  love you too, Gracie
Grace (as they hug) Keep an eye on
for me
Harry climbs up the metal stairs -- and the rest of Harry's crew comes out of the building
moves to Grace  as she watches her father disappear into the jet
Excuse me
(Grace turns) You're really insanely gorgeous and  was jost  sort of wondering if you -- Grace 'm engaged
But my father hasn't given him his blessing so you might  still have a chance
(smiles, then serious) Promise me you won't do anything  stupid up there
nods
They kiss passionately
Harry's crew sees this and applauds
Grace  blushes, embarrassed
love you, Grace
Grace  love you
Come back, Okay
Harry's crew boards   2

Golden  work for the President of the United States
(long pause; looks over  at Collinswood) But  think it's my duty as a scientist to tell the world what is happening
Three,  days ago a manned space mission was sent to intercept an asteroid  which has entered the Earth's orbit
( all chatter) This is a difficult  mission
In all  frankness, it is the most difficult mission anyone has ever flown
(beat) little over fifty years ago we sent our Armed Forces half-way around  the world to save the  world from an evil empire that threatened mass extinction
The men  and women of this nation united, answered the calland preserved our freedom
(beat) Once again  we face a threat to our way of life
And once again we look to our  military to preserve our future
The men and women selected to lead this mission  are America's  finest and most decorated career officers in the military
Our  hopes and prayers are with them

Harry   77
Let 'er rip
Chick throws a lever, lowering the    into the rocky, icy surface
Down  the drill pipe goes, unimpeded, 10 feet just like that
It suddenly stops
It's  turning, but not drilling
Bear and Max approach the drill hole
Bear What in hell's down there
Harry Chick, bring 'er up
Chick throws it in reverse
The   reverses out of the hole
The Bad  Boy bot comes up
Harry and the guys examine the drill bit
Everyone exchanges a worried look
Max The dream
It's my dream
Harry Shut up, Max
(looks at Bear) What's with the look
Get that off your  face
You've seen bits get eaten before
Bear Not after ten feet
Chick The first ten better be the worst ten
Harry Go to the Terminator
Chick grabs Harry's mysterious
Harry pops open the metal case,  revealing  , a super high-tech bit
Harry  designed you
built you
You are the enemy of all subterranean shit
You are the king
It's showtime
Harry passes it to Bear, who screws it onto the drilling pipe, Rockhound scoops  up a
Harry (cont'd) Hit it, Chick
The   turns
Sediment comes  out of the hole and --     descends like a bitch
Sharp, Watts, Pitts and Fisk have a  removed, exposing the guts of  Freedom's wiring and components
Watts and Sharp are inside the panel, scrunched  against the fuselage wall, unbolting a large

Harry What do you make of that
Rockhound picks up several chips
Draws them close to his eyes
Rockhound Oh my
Oh my, my, my
This isn't rock
It's uhh, it's uhh,  it's
iron
Harry Iron deposit
Rockhound (shakes head) No
It's been melted
Forged rather
've only seen  this once - at a volcano in Hawaii
(looks up at Harry) You're drilling into a  big slab of cast-iron, Mr
Stamper
Harry picks up the radio
Harry Give me Dan Golden
-   / Golden's handed the phone
Golden Yeah, Harry
What's your situation
-       / Harry Situation
You put me down on the worst possible place on this asteroid
'm drillin' into something  shouldn't
The hole just ate one of my  diamond-tipped bits in thirty minutes
That has never happened to me in twenty years
Golden You're forty minutes in
You should be down 150 feet
How far are you
Harry Not far
(beat) Twenty-three feet
Golden as he looks at Temple
Temple This is an exercise in futility
Golden (to Harry) "Don't tell me what you can't do, tell me what you can
" Remember that, Stamper
Go faster
Harry We will
Golden How
Sharp and Pitts enter
Fisk hands Sharp the phone
Sharp Sharp, over
on Sharp in  -
His jaw tightens
His eyes dart
Sharp (cont'd) Sir, the bird can't fly
Temple (
) Well, you need to get it fixed unless you want to die along with that asteroid
, as Sharp listens
Sharp : (cont'd) Yes, sir
Temple (
) And,  don't want those drillers knowing about this
They have enough to worry about just drilling the damn ole
Collinswood (
) Colonel Sharp, this is Chief of Staff Collinswood
Have  Pitts and Fisk prepare to detonate that nuke on the surface
Too many lives are  at stake here
Have them standing by
Sharp On your order sir

- Chick and Bear screw on a new length of drill pipe
Chick engages the gears
The  drill pipe descends
is working
Harry approaches from the  shuttle
Harry How far
Chick Almost 60 feet and startin' to kick ass
Suddenly
The drill pipe stops
Harry walks over to the hole
Chick (cont'd) That did not sound good
Harry Increase r

Chick throws the lever
The drill pipe turns faster, but still doesn,t descend
Harry and the guys crowd around the drilling hole
Max Freaky, man
Bear  got one of those big-time crappy feelings about this
Harry We gotta get more power down to this bit
(thinks; looks up at Chick) Full throttle
Chick You sure
Harry Yeah, 'm sure
Chick  don't think she can take it
Harry She's gonna have to
Chick The last time we ran her at full throttle we ripped her up
Harry  don't have time to argue, Chick, now goddamn it, throttle up, or 'll  come up there and do it for you
Chick reluctantly throws the lever to

Harry Stop
Chick throws it into reverse
Up comes  , Bear  and Max look at it, then each other
Very worried now
Bear The Terminator's terminated
Chick The clutch is dead
Harry We're goin' to the second rig
Harry stalks off toward the Shuttle
Harry (cont'd) We need the second Armadillo
Sharp We'll bring it out to you
Harry moves to get his pipe tongs
Fisk and Pitts are next to the uncovered  nuclear bomb
Harry looks at the bomb
- Chick, Bear and Max listen to Harry over the inter-crew link
Harry Why don't we cut to the chase, fellahs
What the fuck is going on with  that other nuke
Harry stares at the nuclear weapon
Sharp Stamper, if you can't drill the hole, we're detonating this thing on the  surface
Chick and the guys eye each other
Harry walks off, pissed off
Golden and Clark are hunched over monitors
Two carrying a () Golden, alarmed, tries to figure out what they have
Chick, Bear and Max enter through the airlock
Everyone turns and stares at  Sharp
Sharp There's no way in hell you're gonna get that hole dug, and you know it
Harry Well, it wasn't my scientists that told me about the fucking fire  cracker inside the hand story
Are we detonating on the surface or are we gonna  drill
Bear  didn't come up here to die
Chick  say we drill
They say we have until Zero Barrier
Sharp (freaked out) That hole better be dug in two hours, or we're detonating
Whether you're on this godforsaken rock or not
Harry We're drilling
Harry and his crew file out
- Golden (to Temple) What is going on up there
Temple Your drillers aren't doing the job, Dan
Golden After 15 minutes
What do you expect
Temple Golden, we are preparing for surface detonation
Golden  surface detonation isn't going to do it, General
My scientists have  already told you that
It must be detonated inside the asteroid
The alternative  is that the Earth  will be bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as  catastrophic
Temple stares off pensively into the sky
Temple We have a lot better chance of surviving the "smaller matter
" The  drillers have two hours (to the Aides) want you ready on my command
The Adjutants prepare the nuclear command link
Military Adjutant Sir, we have interface with the weapon
Remote detonator  standing by
- Lev is sitting on the ground, head in his hands, completely demoralised
Lev  feel like Skywalker Luke when he learn Darth Vader his father
What   should do
Get up, we got work to do
Lev
, let me cash in my chips
Lev, we're getting off this rock, if  have to drag your ass the whole  way
(off Lev's look) Now get up
walks into the Independence cargo bay, detached from the nose section
Then  climbs into Independence's Armadillo
' ,
- Lev is prying open the cargo bay ramp door (the hydraulics are shot) ,
- Golden turns to Temple
Golden The asteroid's surface is heating up
Temple What does that mean
Golden It means they may not be able to work on the surface for much longer
The temperatures will be unbearable
- The Armadillo, engine rumbling, is poised to roll Independence's long tubular    which has been ejected with other debris from the broken  fuselage
Lev Wait
We drive over nuclear weapon and we finished before we started
So move it
Lev jams a pipe between the   and the nuke
As he rolls the nuke  over, the arming device detaches, rips off, and clatters to the ground
Temple Golden, tell your drillers the clock is ticking
have 6 billion  people down here relying on them
In the b

Sharp comes back from the cockpit, carrying the detonator
Harry's on the phone  to Golden
Harry
You told me that the only way to deal with this hunk 'o crud is to  get a nuke 1000 feet down
You sticking with that
Golden (
) Firmly
Harry Great
Glad we have that understanding
Golden (
) you're gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk about time
and temperature
Zero Barrier's in two hours
Harry Wait
wait
what about temperature
When did temperatures come into the  picture
Golden (
) Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius
Harry And
How hot is it going to get
Golden (
) We didn't anticipate you being on the asteroid so long
The clock is ticking
Harry How hot is it going to get
Golden (
) Three hundred and fifty degrees
Harry's face drops
Harry Thanks for telling us now, Golden
don't think my bits can handle  those kind of temperatures
- Harry clicks off the radio
Watts We've still gotta fix this shuttle, Stamper
Harry Give me some more good news
You've got two new assistants who can fix  your shuttle
Bear, Max, hop to it
There's not a machine they can't fix
We can  handle the hole from here
The airlock opens
Sharp and Pitts are led out by Harry
Harry Colonel Sharp, if we're going to blow this hole, you gotta help
need some more manpower
- The   rumbles out of Freedom's cargo bay
Chick and the  Roughnecks work like a  pit crew
Sharp and Pitts lay on their backs  holding down a 1000 pound axle, fighting zero-g
Suddenly, the ground begins to tremble

" It is breathtaking, spiritual
and frighteningly bright
' Over the hill
Suddenly, the ground under the vehicle shakes sharply
stops the Armadillo
The ground around the vehicle heaves up and down
The One    rises 15 feet in the air
The ground breaks like a wave, up and  down
- Here, too, the ground shakes
Bear, terrified, drops a Max is shaken  to the ground
Chick is nearly thrown off the Armadillo
Chick Clear the rig
Chick jumps down, bouncing
Everybody gets the hell away from the drilling hole

The asteroid  a few more seconds, then the quake slowly stops
All is  stll
(cont'd) Let's take a look
Lev gets out; he nervously paces back and forth across the lip of the fissure
Lev This bad
(repeating, mantra) Darth Vader
Darth Vader
Listen, Mr
Negative
Everyone thinks we're dead
We're not
So, suck it  up
Because if we don't drill that hole, six billion people are going to die
And 'm not lettin' Harry Stamper get all the freaking credit for saving the world
(firm) We're gona do this, then we're going home
Lev  l-o-v-e this American confidence

Lev goes around back, climbs on the He  clicks off his pressure suit's pro-gravity thrusters
Lev Okey-doke
The Armadillo begins backing down the slope

The Armadillo stops
Hey, Lev, we're gonna see what this Porche engine can do
He throws it in drive
The Armadillo lurches ahead

Lev splayed out 50 feet from the back of the Armadillo,  covered in asteroid surface dirt and grime, looks up at him
Lev Very bad idea,
- Harry orders his crew to start the drill up
The men drill a shitload of feet in  record time
They finally burst through the rock and hit easy sediment
The asteroid is spinning toward sunlight
Here, too, there is a sunrise
Bear's  face sweats inside the helmet
Chick's vision begins to blur
Tito takes a seat  on a nearby rock, exhausted
Chick Mutha
it's getting warm
Bear (worried) We got that sunrise, Harry
These bits are gonna fry up

Out of the corner of his eye Harry turns to it
Nothing happens
His eyes move back to Chick and Bear,  then back to the drilling arm
It kicks up again
Just a few inches

Harry and the men standing there, just watching
Devastated, confused, in shock
This is a total catastrophe
The mission is  over
Sharp nods to Pitts
Pitts picks up the
Sharp Stamper, you ready to blow this
Let's get outta here
Harry ignores him
He won't accept defeat
Harry Chick, get your butt over here
Chick drags his ass over to Harry
Chick Yeah

There's no place to turn

Harry gets up and dives down inside a fox-hoe-sized in the asteroid  surface
The  rolls right over him
Finally the quake stops
The situation stabilises
Everyone gets to their feet

Everyone checks themselves
Looks at others
There's no talk, no time to lose
They reconvene, by the

The alumniium gurney is smashed, mangled
Sharp Three on that side, the rest over here
They hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole
They plug one  end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the other

Suddenly Sharp tries to grab a      from the broken gurney
Sharp (cont'd) Stop

Sharp inspects the Sharp (cont'd) The remote's shot
(looks up) It'll have to be manually  detonated
Chick What's that mean
Pause
Harry Means one of us ain't leaving
- Golden addresses the room
Golden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote detonator is not  functional
One of the crew is going to stay behind and
(deep breath) manually detonate the device
Golden looks over at Grace
She is stunned
The news is just sinking in
Golden Don't stay for this
Grace 'm not leaving
Temple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier

But we need two people  to fly this mother back
So, we either all stay or you guys draw
Sharp raises a     in his hand
The crew's going to draw  straws
The highest tension yet
No one breathes, no one moves
Sharp Who's first

Sharp holds the    in front of Lev

Two strands remain, and two men, Harry and

The matter will be decided on this last pull

They lock  eyes

Harry (stern, hard) Sit down, Chick
Chick sits down

Gets used to the idea
He reaches and begins to  pull

We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small smile
Well,  guess  won
Now 'm the guy who gets to save the Earth

Harry takes off his half medallion
We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole
It just ain't gonna be  on Earth
They slide the two halves together to make a whole
Harry and exchange a  long look

Suddenly the jets ignite
Watts Ignition
She's started
- Skip turns to Golden excitedly
Skip They got Freedom goin'

About Grace, Harry
(laughs nervously) know it ain't gonna happen now,  but
if things were different
What would you say
Harry walks back toward Freedom
follows
Harry  always wanted a son
And if  had
'd want him to be like you
Harry hands him the pipe section
Harry (cont'd) You're going to need some magic in the world
You can marry her,
laughs, being told at this dire time in his life
He looks at Harry with a  hint of bittersweet smile
Mean "could have
" Harry No
Go home,
Marry Grace
'm not going home Harry
With one hand, Harry stabs the airlock door, and then with a small pipe clamp,  rips
's air tubes off
Harry It's my hole,  drilled it, and 'm staying with it till the end
Harry grabs him, throws his kicking, screaming body into the airlock
is  choking
Harry (cont'd) She's always going to be my little girl
The door shuts automatically
Harry is now alone
- explodes from the airlock into the cabin
Goddamn it,
lunges for the airlock
Sharp grabs
with his good arm, helped by Bear
holding him back
, sobbing, furious,  on the  , staring at Harry outside
(pounding on the door) Harry turns and walks back to the drilling hole
Sharp looks at him
Sharp This guy really is a hero
- Skip Director
It's Mr
Stamper
He wants to talk to his daughter
Golden looks over at Grace
Their eyes meet
Tech hands Grace a mike and exits
She stares at the static on the  monitor
Harry's face fades in and out
Grace knows something is very wrong from  her father's strained, tired face
She forces a smile
with Harry  inside the Armadillo Grace Daddy
Harry (
) Grace

Tears start to well up in her eyes
Harry (
) (cont'd) just

Grace wipes a tear from her face
Harry (

So pure

"The world is a fine place
and worth  fighting for
"  looks at Earth, smiles) Gracie, 'm just an iron-ass-warrior doin'  what's best
(pause) Take care of
'll look in on you from time to time
Harry pulls off the video link
Grace's monitors go black
Grace touches the  monitor, as Harry's face fades away
Her knees buckle
She sinks to the floor
- Harry looks at the detonator in hand
Harry You have three minutes and 'm not waiting
- Watts and Sharp settle into the cockpit and begin flipping switches
- Harry, all business now, situates himself next to the nuke
The manual detonator  in his hand
Harry Let's go, Sharp
Get the hell off this rock
push this button

The booster rockets  and die

He  it again
Again

Lev grab a wrench and goes ballistic

We hear through the component and -- --  hits the   and the
- Shuttle Freedom lifts off the asteroid on full , like a  Harrier jet
It ascends backwards, falling away from the asteroid, away from  Earth, toward the Moon
Harry is a solitary figure, left behind
- Sharp, Watts,
, Lev and Bear watch Harry becoming smaller and smaller on the  asteroid
- Harry takes his final breaths
Looks around
Harry All right, son-of-a-bitch, it's just you and me
Harry's  compresses on the detonator button
next to the drilling hole  up to five feet away
, directly underneath Harry,
The flies from  Harry's hand as he's knocked backward -- -- into the drilling hole
Harry falls ass-first down the hole, his - pushing him  further and further down
Harry's   into the walls of the hole
He  scissors his legs
scrape the sides
He begins climbing up out of the  hole
We see that his air has been punctured
He's losing pressure
He starts  to choke
They've ascended to a safe distance
Sharp Something's wrong
Don't worry
He'll come through
Sharp We should have detonation by now
Harry doesn't fail
Sharp We're going back
What
Sharp Every life, that you know, will die
unless that nuke is detonated
- '   grip the sides of the hole
Then his helmet appears
He  looks across the asteroid surface to the , lying in the dirt
The nuke has now descended several hundred feet into the hole
the faces of the terrified men, looking down on the craggy  asteroid
Chick (unsure) That means we might die too
Sharp Watts, prepare for re-landing
Watts, frozen with fear, begins hitting switches
- Harry crawls out of the hole
The nuke is at the bottom of the hole
Harry runs, gasping for air, bounding  across the asteroid surface, dodging geysers and rolling debris
He dives for  the detonator
He stares long and hard
wells in his eye
His finger  presses on the detonator
sweat pours over his face
Harry  beat you

The nuclear device

Everyone's violently buffeted around
Watts Houston, we have detonation
Watts fumbles for the reverse switches as the flames from the explosion grow
She hits the directional , jamming it as hard as it will  go
the flames bite up at them
The shuttle veers off toward Earth
Harry
and the others stare out the cockpit window as the , the halves of the asteroid wing off

Golden closes his eyes and falls to his seat
Arms raise in unison embrace

The Technicians stare in  wonderment
Golden Where are they, Flip
Give me some angles, give me some directions,  give me speeds
Flip (analysing new data) The new courses are
they're gonna miss us
The Technicians
Grace looks up
Wipes her tears
Golden approaches her
Golden  just want to tell you 'm proud to know the daughter of the man who  just saved the world

There are Coke cans, coffee mugs,  cigarettes overflowing ashtrays
