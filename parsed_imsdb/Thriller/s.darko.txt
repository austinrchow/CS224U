Written by Nathan Atkins Second draft - (18) opens her eyes
She squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size
She sits up slowly, looks around
and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field
Sam is pretty and demure
Her coppery hair flows past her shoulders
Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite golden shimmer
Amber waves of grain
Patches of forest in the distance
It's quiet
Serene
Beautiful
She smiles, and starts walking

Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the deserted lanes, is a

Sam makes her way across the asphalt toward the vehicle

She awakens when Sam gets in on the passenger side and slams the door shut
Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair, piercings, a little grungy
She rubs the sleep from her eyes, greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm
She finds a soft pack of  and lights one
What time is it
Early
Corey adjusts her seat
She takes a long drag and chokes, then spits out the window
She starts the car

She cranks up the  on the car's  , nodding her head to early-90s
(suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)
Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery:  at work in the fields; a  advertising a local restaurant;   filled with trash
She fixates on a  travelling in the slow lane
It contains the all-American  : ,  and three , one of them being a

She sees that the   has hit the red and her    is on
Shit
40/'  - By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway, steam billows out from under the hood
Sam gets out of the car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel
Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the steam
It sounds like someone is rhythmically  the inside of the engine with a hammer
Turn it off
(poking her head out the ) What
Turn off the car
Corey does so
(') Doesn't look too good
How do you know

It smells funny
Sam looks up when she  a -  coming toward them
Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down
The pick-up pulls over ahead of them
(24), a brawny, attractive young man, gets out
When Corey sees him she gets out too
(') Thanks for stopping
Our car's messed up
What happened
My check engine light came on, then it just started smoking, and ticking and shit
As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange looks
Chris pops opens the   and burns his hand on the steam explosion
(shaking it off) Blew your water pump
Can't drive it
Fuck me
El Reno's just a couple miles up ahead
Can call for a tow there
'mon, 'll give you a lift

' / ,  - All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up, they drive through the center of El Reno, Oklahoma (population 16,000) and see some of the locals out and about [ fueled by early- to mid-90s era   (suggestion: Come As You Are, by Nirvana) -- reminiscent of the `Middlesex Middle School Montage' in  ]: (54), an employee of the local , sits on a bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette

They come up on   (48), who ambles along the side of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they pass
He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi- colored   over his head and face
[ ] Sam swivels her head to watch Tom

Chris picks up on her curiosity
He waves to everybody
Just kinda walks up and down
Resident nutcase
People call him Vietnam Tom
He was in the war
He thinks he was

Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight

As a splashes through it,    : /
' / - Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big garage attached to his old two-story house
Corey's car has been towed there, and   (37; father of Ruth Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood
Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting, bored as hell
laps at a nameless treat wedged into a crack in the walkway
The girls are forced to get up when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door
5
Can  get out
Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house
Ruth's look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older than her 18 years
The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father
She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some , which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek
After this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes outside to address Corey and Sam
Yeah
it's the water pump
So what do we do
can order you up a new one
Probably be a couple days
Great
This the only show in town
Cheapest and the best
But you want me to call the tow guy back here, no problem
Probably charge you another hundred bucks, but he'll get ya wherever you wanna go
Just go ahead and fix it
- Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's '  when the girls enter
They each have a and a  in tow
What can  do for you
We need a room

Corey finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form about the

How much is it
$39 a night
How many you stayin'
Just a couple, we hope
He takes the  to  15 off the rack
Well
welcome to El Reno
- Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the street from the motel
Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion to how they were earlier in the day
You get checked into the motel alright
Yep
Randy seems surprised that Ruth has already made their acquaintance
He wastes no time in introducing himself
My name's Randy
This is Mike and Jeff
Guess you already know Ruth
Corey
'm Samantha
They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the strangers
Sam hangs back a little
One of you guys mind pickin' us up a bottle of something
think  can manage that
What do you want
7
don't know
Vodka, whiskey, whatever
Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash
Randy takes the money and heads for the store
Be right back
After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously
Ruth stares at them in a different way
She seems somewhat resentful of their presence
From Virginia, huh
Yep
saw your plates
Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment
Another beat of uncomfortable silence
(') Where to
What
Your obviously just passin' through here
We're on the way to Vegas
Ruth snickers
Well
you need anything besides booze, you just lemme know
Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag
He passes it off to Corey, along with some change
Thanks a lot, man
8
No problem
You guys wanna come back to my place for bit
Bring your bottle, we got some weed
Corey looks like she's considering it, but -- 'm really tired
She takes Sam's signal
Yeah,  think we'll just head back
Been a long day, ya know
That's cool

She lies atop the blankets wearing a - and
She looks over and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed

There's a digital / that reads 3:30
The  is on, and a late night  for the plays
Sam stares at the screen as the images and  in a way that coincides with an increasingly loud, rumbling  from outside
In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the television
She reaches out with her  , about to touch it
strange, abrupt   : - Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from the building
She wears a  , , and her is wrapped in some sort of

There's a  in the side of her forehead by her temple, with what looks to be a    partially embedded under the skin and protruding from the wound
She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and fluid

burns around a Miniature   lead a around in a circle and then  right past Sam's field of vision
It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly
She has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path
She moves toward the
- Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower
giant squats beside it
Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30 feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of his ski mask
: Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of which is littered with  , a  , and
He cradles a  in his arms
His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to what is sitting right beside him -- Sam
Her legs dangle over the side of the platform, and she stares off into distance
The sky's so beautiful here
Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at her
Sam turns to meet his gaze

Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible makes contact impossible

As Sam and Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a emanates from within -- - They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away from it together
Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the sky as he runs
there's a brilliant flash of   -- deafening -- a blinding  -- - Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her
She struggles to peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that stands over her
Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a policeman -- Officer 'Dell
11
' `Fraid you can't sleep here, miss
Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near the side of the road
'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning
' (') Got anyplace to be
Sam manages to find her voice
The motel
She takes his hand and rises

'' / - 'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is uncharacteristically full
is parked by the side of the road
Just then, a call comes in on the  : (
) We got some kinda situation at Frank Haley's farm
' Copy that
'm here now
- Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere
spurts from the broken
And a cantaloupe-sized  sits in the center of the crater
Two  haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam and 'Dell arrive on the scene
Corey is already there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local
(54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming
Un-fuckin'-believable
The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet
12
#1 It's still warm
You know how much it's gonna cost me to replace this goddamn windmill
Officer 'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite with his boot
' Sell this thing off to some meteorologist nerd club,  bet you could do okay
Ya think
Sam looks down at a    on the ground amidst some scorched
'Dell takes note of some other and
' What's all that stuff, Frank
That whack job Tom's been squattin' up there the last couple a' months
Thinks he's the goddamn town watchman
() You think he got blown up
Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until Phil pipes up: saw him out in front of the motel early this morning, alive and well
() Oh, well, thank heavens
Sam turns and peers up at the
It's marred by and  from the explosion
As she tilts her head and looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin
in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned 13
- Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that Chris has followed them
Hey
Hey
So you guys stayed here last night
One of us did
Sam gives Corey a look
Chris decides to ignore the comment
What's up with your car
It's gonna take a couple days
For a water pump
Sam and Corey shrug
(') None of my business, but
He's distracted when a brand new `95  pulls up and parks nearby
(25), a thin, pale young man hops out and hustles into the field toward the crash site
What
Chris regains his train of thought: was just gonna say, if you wanted,  could give you a ride back
He looks right at Sam when he says this
He then glances over at Corey, as if just remembering she was there
(') You too
mean,  could give you both a ride
14
To Middlesex, Virginia
Do you have any clue how far that is
() got some time
Sam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey overpowers her
We're not goin' back
Even El Reno's better than there
Chris makes eye contact with Sam again
She maintains it for a moment and then looks away

He scours amongst the   , and crumbling
He bends to pick up a    and adds it to a collection he's making in a worn

) Isn't that just awful
Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders
(') His poor mother
- The girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes
How much money do we have left
15
Not a whole lot
can't believe your fucking parents wouldn't give you anything
They totally flipped out that  was even going
They weren't about to give me money for the big trip
We should've waited till the end of the month when my mom gets her check
She wouldn't have given you anything
know where she keeps her cash
What's she gonna do, send her boyfriend after me
Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw
(') Doesn't matter
As soon as we get to Vegas, we'll be set
My cousin said sometimes she makes two grand in a week
Jesus
Sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction exhibits reservations
Just then, Agatha Dowdy arrives with plates of
Here you go
Where'd you two say you were from again
Virginia
You hear that, Ted
She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter
16
What
These girls are from Virginia
'll be damned
'm from Reedville, if you know where abouts that is
Neither Sam nor Corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no
(') Well, have yourself some ice cream when you're done, on the house
Okay
Thank you
Anything else you need, give a holler
Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their food
Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the counter by their booth
It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence
Just a coffee, please
Ted nods and pours him a cup
After he receives his coffee, Jeremy turns and stares at the girls
They both notice him doing it, but Corey is the first to speak
Can we help you
No, no
it's just that recognize you
saw you by the motel
Pretty amazing, huh
guess
just made a deal with Frank Haley to buy it for seven-hundred fifty dollars
17
Whoop-dee-doo
What the hell are you gonna do with a friggin' meteor
Meteorite, actually
Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected
Sam smirks and munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation
(') 'm gonna study it
'm a grad student at Redlands
we've actually got a pretty cool geology lab there
Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on
(') 've gotta do some tests, but if had to guess, 'd say it's a siderite
They're composed primarily of iron and nickel
Have fun
My name's Jeremy
That's nice
Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or embarrassed by Corey's snub
But he's not
He's smiling at her, and she can't help but smile back
' / - Each licking an   , Corey and Sam walk past the home of Father Homeijer
The priest is outside working in his flower garden, wearing his
An old rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it
When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his forehead
Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them
What's his problem
18
Just keep walking
Corey waves to him in a sarcastic, exaggerated manner
The priest doesn't wave back, but continues to gawk at them until they go around the corner
Freak

They find Randy, Ruth, Jeff and Mike at their usual post
Hey, what's up
Not much
just getting stared down by creepy priest boy back there
Father Homeijer
Don't worry, you're a little old for his taste
Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv
(to Randy) You got an extra cigarette
Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one
'm throwin' a big party at my house tonight, you guys should come by
No excuses this time
Sam and Corey look at each other, considering

(') You're gonna be stuck in El Reno, you might as well have some fun, right
' ,  - The party at Randy's teems with , ages ranging from early teens to late-20s
On the back deck is a and a  blasting
There's a slimy-looking , and a few people swim in the greenish water
Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair
They stop off so Ruth can sell a    to some eager
Corey and Sam hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer
You guys gotta come visit the club when we get all set up
We'll give you the  treatment, man
Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition
Sounds good to me
Give us a little time, me and Sam'll be runnin' that place, no doubt
right
Yeah
Definitely
Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam appears more out of place
She drains the better part of her cup for some liquid courage
Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer 'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes
Ruth notices him first
Fuck
What
That pig, 'Dell
20
Don't worry about Ryan
He might be a cop, but he still likes to party
Randy's theory is proven when 'Dell takes a  from his pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of But Ruth is still not satisfied
think that asshole knows  deal
You know how fucked that is
From what  hear he's got a little somethin' goin' on the side himself
Fucking pig's a pig
They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into the pool and splashes them
Fuck
Bastard
What the hell
Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants
Ruth watches her, smirking
We might as well all go in now, we're already wet
Good idea
Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool -- : She sinks into the murky water in -
All  are and everything is tranquil, completely detached
Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's glimmering beyond the surface of the water

She sees that Randy is the one responsible for pulling her out
You fall asleep down there
He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing
Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision
She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and jump into the pool beside her
Many of the  hoot in approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in right behind her
Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps are, and fewer people
When she arrives there, she's surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel
Thought you could maybe use this
As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide  on the inside of Sam's
but doesn't mention it
Sam wraps the towel around her sopping wet body
Corey looks over and sees her getting out
' ,  -   - Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers
So what's so wrong at home that you had to take off
The question takes Sam by surprise
22
(') 'd love to get outta here someday too
just don't know quite where 'd go
Sam decides to open up a little
hate it there
It's like everyone knows everything about me, but 'm invisible at the same time
It's like the worst of both worlds
Small towns
How `bout your family
They didn't want me to leave
well, they did, but they wanted me to go away to Harvard or something like that, like my sister
Sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness
(') Sometimes  think it would've been easier if
just, after my - Sam stops herself
What
(changing gears) That's why  love Corey, she just doesn't give a shit
She does what she wants and she doesn't care what people think
You just gotta be yourself, that's all
What is it you wanna do exactly
always thought 'd be a dancer, like in a troupe or something
Sam is self-conscious after admitting this
(') That sounds kinda stupid probably
23
No
When  was younger, my dance team was on Star Search
Really
Yeah
but  didn't go
Why not
didn't end up dancing in the talent show where they got discovered
didn't really feel like it at the time anyway
Huh
But that's why we're going to Vegas
There's lots of opportunities there
Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless, splashing and goofing around with some
() Yeah, good place for it
Gettin' some practice on the way, too
Sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive
Is that supposed to be like some kind of judgement or something
No,  was just- She takes her beer and storms away from him
(') Sam, wait
hey, come on

' ,   - Sam finds a  at the side of the house where she can be alone
She can  the  going on in the backyard, but no one else is in sight
Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts to pound the rest of her drink

Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam whatsoever

She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a near a  -- : Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch
Tom stares at her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask

From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight through to the other side

Soft,   touches their faces from the phosphorescent glow, and a gust of  is nearly strong enough to make them falter
On the opposite end of the culvert, a flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of '  -- - Tom and Sam stand outside the church

Dilapidated  snakes around them, and Tom barely has enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger

The old dry wood begins to  and --
The   echo and fade away

Louder now, and different

He does not look pleased
You plannin' on checkin' out today
() Uh
,  don't know yet
Well, it's already way past checkout time, so you'd better figure it out quick
've just gotta find Corey
and check on the car
27
You do whatever you have to, but if you're stayin' another night wanna see some money up front
- Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall  with the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it
It strikes a chord but she doesn't know why
The sign reads 12:48  -- and then --  20, 1995
It changes to the  : 14 , 8 , 11 , 22

- Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears
Some of her  - are consoling her
don't believe it
still just don't believe it
- It's gonna be alright
You'll see
Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably
(dabbing at her eyes with a tissue) Can  help you
Is everything okay
No, it's not
Mount Calvary burned to the ground last night
Mount Calvary
Father Homeijer's church
Oh
How did it happen
28
The police are looking into it, but
know it was arson
Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam
(') It's no secret to me how people in this town feel about Father Homeijer
The horrible accusations that have been made against him
But it's just a lot of nonsense
El Reno's changed so much since  was a kid growing up here
The young people nowadays
() No offense
She places her hand on top of Sam's
(') But with all the drugs and the crime
just don't know what this world's coming to anymore
Sam tries to redirect her focus
Are you able to get money wired here from my bank back home
We don't usually work with other banks like that
need to check my balance and get my money out
How do  do that
You'll have to call and arrange it
You could always use Western Union
Where's your bank
Virginia
Oh
`cause they're gonna need to have a signature
Disappointed, Sam turns to leave

: As she's on her way out, she notices a   with another    for
She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's dark, empty eyes
Though it's just a low quality black & white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and despair
- As Sam comes out of the bank Jeremy rolls up in his  and parks in the lot
He gets out and approaches her
Hi there
Hey
didn't get your name at the diner
'm Sam
Jeremy
They shake, and Jeremy holds her hand for a little longer than what is generally comfortable
(') So what are you up to
Trying to get money
not very successfully
've gotta pick up some cash too
Need some supplies for the lab don't think 've even slept since got my hands on that meteorite
You should come by the lab with me and check it out
can't
Sam starts to walk away from him
30
could let you borrow some money
if you need some
don't even know you
That's okay
trust you
Thanks anyway
You're sure you don't want to check out the lab
Sorry

Randy is behind the wheel with a  in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed into the back, passing around a
How many cheeseburgers did we get
Like eight
Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit, chases it with some beer
Wait, did we get smokes
Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when they turn a corner and see what's left of the church

Father Homeijer stands with Officer 'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins
The only things standing amid the charred mess are the    of Mount Calvary

Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside himself with bitterness and sorrow

We just got food
Want a burger
My stomach's fucked up
Awww
Poor tummy
Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back
Ruth leers
(') We gotta talk about what we're gonna do
Don't worry about it so much
The motel guy came to the room this morning all pissed off
We're probably not even gonna have enough money to pay for the car
Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out
Before she can reach a decision, something in the department store's parking lot catches her eye: a   with dark hair, wearing a
But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two parked vehicles
Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car
Should  wait a minute
We gotta get some smokes
Just go ahead
'll catch up with you later on
Alright
Later
Corey gets out and shuts the door
Randy speeds off toward an intersection about 20 yards ahead

- Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke break
- Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's car is stopped at a red light
We just gotta figure out what we're gonna do
don't think- () Lemme guess, you wanna go home
What
You wanna run back to mommy and daddy and say sorry so they can put you through college
Well that's real big of you, Sam, but  don't have that option
(taken aback) What are you talking about
'll go home and get the shit kicked out of me, and get my ass grabbed by my mom's boyfriend
They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming up on Randy's car
Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from the backseat, smelling the drama
(') knew you'd bail on me eventually, but not this quick
'm not bailing on you
Would you - 34
You can fucking sleepwalk back to Middlesex for all  care
'm not driving you
you're a fucking drag
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left
Fuck you, Corey
Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming straight across
Corey starts to follow
but something stops her in her tracks:
He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him
Billy wears a  ,  and
He looks pale and weak, and is covered with
He stares right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road
Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of the intersection
] Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but something blocks her -- an invisible   makes forward progress impossible
swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit it
She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into infinite space
She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier once again
Just as she touches it

He jerks the wheel -- and the  hits on the front passenger side -- completely smashing it in -- Sam spins when she  the deafening
Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an smacks him dead on
The inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a   by the side of the road

'Dell sits facing her
' You're sure you didn't see a driver
No
He takes the statement from her
' Well, you're one lucky girl to have gotten outta the car when you did
Front passenger side was wiped right out

Corey nods, taking this in

He's pretty shook up
Corey doesn't respond

That old beater cut right in front him
Can't you just look up the license plates

' No plates on the vehicle
We're investigating the , but that could take a little more time, depending on the history of ownership
We'll find him
Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject: What about the missing boy
'Dell shifts in his chair
' You really think it was him, huh
He was on the side of the road right before the accident
' 'm no psychiatrist, but  do know sometimes shock does funny things
You think  was hallucinating
' We were on the scene five minutes after the accident
think somebody woulda noticed a little boy wandering around
He sees how troubled Corey is
' (') Why don't you stop in and see Dr
Peters on your way out
right down the hall there
She'll give you somethin' to make you feel better
Corey nods and gets up to leave
As she's on her way out, 'Dell's voice stops her
' (') Oh, uh
is there anything you wanted to say to Samantha's parents
Corey's expression is blank

Like what
,    - Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a secluded back parking lot
She holds a  for anti- depressants
She is frightened when she notices a    staring at her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom
He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle
Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her
She's about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the police station behind her
Get the hell outta here
Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris
Tom shuffles away
(') Should know better than to be carrying his rifle around town like that
Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare
(') You okay
What're you doing here
had to put in a statement too
Can  give you a lift

' / - Chris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up
They've gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the in her hand
'm real sorry about Sam
Corey nods
38
(') It's such a waste
Just a horrible, freak thing
said some pretty shitty things to her right before it happened
'm sure she knew you didn't mean it
Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room
15 - Corey swallows two of her  with some liquor from a plastic cup
She sits down on one of the full-size beds where Sam's belongings are spread out
She opens Sam's backpack and discovers book, by Roberta Sparrow
As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room
Strangely, Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes
The digital / shows 6:30
There are  of Sam's family tucked away inside the book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, and  ;   with  and ; an old photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds , a
Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand
She then looks down and notices that the book is open to: -
Fragmentary Universe
She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than several days

She sits up in bed
The clock/radio reads 3:30
The  is faint but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming from outside
- Corey follows the distinctive  toward the on the side of the building
until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them
Corey freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the ,  and
He is pale and bruised
Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from elsewhere in the cosmos, far away
The  taper off to a faint,   as Billy speaks: You need to save me, Corey
Corey stares at him in disbelief
(') You need to save me
and save the world
Why can't anyone see you
If you tell them about me they'll think you're a dummy
Why me
didn't pick you
Just like you didn't pick me either
Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed
(') We shouldn't even be here
Nobody should
Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him
Where the prices should be,  flash in a rhythm that seems to coincide with the ululations of the distant : 2

The   on the vending machines go back to normal , the   , and Billy disappears
(
) What's goin' on out here
Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes, having come out of a room near the lobby
She's dumbstruck
Nothing
- don't know
Go back to your room and get some sleep
You've had a tough day
Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone
- Corey wanders through the aisles of the department store, looking peaked and jittery
She comes upon Chris stocking some shelves near the back of the store
Hey
how ya feelin'
Not so good
Is there anything  can do
need some cigarettes
and maybe some food
But  don't really have any money right now
'm off at 3:30
Meet me out behind the store

She shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a 41
Corey takes it from him and looks inside:  , a , some , a pack of
Thanks
She tears open the cigarettes and lights one
Chris lights up one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking
Shouldn't you go back home
There's nothing for me to go home to
Trust me
What about Sam's funeral
Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance: What's the point
She's gone, that's it
Nothing's gonna change that
Chris lets it go
(') Is there a library around here
() Yeah
you need a book
Is it walking distance
can take you
think 'd rather walk
- Corey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street
So you guys were real close, huh
42
When  moved to Virginia Sam was like the only person  could even stand to talk to
How long had you been plannin' your trip together
Not too long
kind of a last minute thing
It was good timing, `cause  don't like to stay in one place for too long, ya know
Huh
was really surprised when Sam wanted to come, actually
just kinda brought it up one day, and she was down
Corey reflects for a beat
(') If it wasn't for me, she'd still be alive right now
You can't think like that
It's true, isn't it
Chris doesn't respond
,    - Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth near the back of the library
They stare at a from 1988 about  '
That was Sam's brother
Yeah
On the screen is a  of the   with many gathered in front of it

Her parents must be going through hell
Sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of Donnie's
Chris thinks on this
saw something on Sam's wrist the other night
it looked like a scar
She told me it was from some accident
Put her hand through a window or something
Did you believe her
Corey doesn't answer
She pulls up  , one that chronicles a  who was      with no known origin
is about a   who was that was inexplicably flying through the air
(') God
Chris is horrified
Corey is totally engrossed
She brings up a   that tells the story of a who was     that fell from the sky shows his legs sticking out from under it like the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in Munchkinland
(') don't understand why we're lookin' at this stuff
They still never found a driver to that car that hit Randy
was standing right there
didn't see anyone
44
was pretty close too, but everything was all crazy
Whoever it was must've jumped out and took off
found this book in Sam's backpack last night
There's a chapter where it talks about stuff like this happening
Like a guy being killed by an arrow that nobody shot, and a swordsmith getting killed by a sword he hadn't made yet
Unexplainable things, but it says there's a reason why they happen
book
don't get what your talkin' about
What was the reason
It didn't say
Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express something
(') Last night, and right before the accident,  saw
What
Nothing
Corey sighs and turns back to the screen
(') You already think 'm a freak show

They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're cut off by the unchained   -- it's growling and barking in a frenzy -- (
) Darielle
The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out of the house and takes her by the collar
She's got a bandage over a cut on her forehead
(') Come to check on your car
Yeah
Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into the garage
'  is parked in the same spot it was when she left it the other day
The hood is propped open
Randy's been a wreck since the accident
He should be
He was driving around shit-faced and somebody got killed
You can just fuck off
She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris retreats a step or two
(') Prima donna motherfucker think your shit don't stink
Corey steps in: She's right
Chris gives her a look
(') mean, there's nothing Randy could've done
46
Ruth turns and goes into the house through a
'll get my dad
The door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at each other
Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten  in hand
Got some bad news for you
He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and wiping his hands on his greasy jeans
(') Your engine seized up when your water pump blew
need a new engine now
can get one in there for you
Cost you about fifteen hundred
Corey's face drops
don't have anywhere near that much money
That's probably as much as the car's worth
understand
But,  already ordered the water pump, and 'll have to get paid for my time
That comes to about three-hundred total
don't have that much either
Dusty is perturbed
You think  do this for charity
47
You didn't do anything
What's she want a water pump for if she doesn't have an engine
see how it is
couple a' punks
You don't plan to pay what you owe, you can get the hell off my property right now
Corey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm
(under her breath) Asshole
Let's go

At the same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the carrying a
As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the window
Good afternoon
We're taking collections to help rebuild Mount Calvary after the tragic fire
Any small amount you could manage would really help
Sorry
Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger seat but she just stares back at them
God bless you
They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up
48
Everybody wants somethin'
What about you
What do you mean
You wouldn't give me stuff and drive me around if you didn't want something in return
Why not
`Cause that's just not how it works
Maybe you're wrong about that
Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him
See ya
She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room

She gets up to answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught
Do you hate me
Huh
49
You think it's my fault she's dead
No
You mean it
Yeah
it wasn't your fault
Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted
What's that
Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand
Oh, it's just
something of Sam's
Randy nods
Corey tosses the book onto the bed

Randy pulls into a more  , away from the other cars but still with a nice view
've been comin' up here since was a kid
Good place when you wanna just get away from everything
Randy pushes in a  (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad Season), then takes a  from his pocket and sparks it up
Is Ruth your girlfriend
50
Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it
Naw, we're just friends
She's pretty weird sometimes
Too like
intense, or something
Seems like you guys are pretty close
Yeah
don't worry about Ruth
Randy takes another hit and holds it in
Do you ever have a hard time telling what's real and what's not real
Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed
Sometimes
sometimes something can feel really real, but it's just your mind playing tricks on you
've got so much shit in my head right now
've never felt so outta control
think 'm really goin' psycho
He passes her the joint
got some acid from my buddy one time
this like flying eagle pyramid shit
took two hits, and man
next thing  knew  was on the floor, curled up in ball, and Mike and Jeff were just standing there lookin' down at me
could see this like glowing grid cutting through my brain, and  knew when it got all the way through 'd be this sketched out vegetable could picture my dad staring down at me in the hospital in my straightjacket, crying and shit
Corey blows out a hit, captivated

(') The whole time my esophagus was like twisting and turning in my throat and cutting off my air supply
it was terrible
Jesus
can still slip back into it sometimes, but  know now that my brain is what's making it real
and that's like a blessing and a curse, man, `cause that means you have to decide what's real and what's not
The things that feel the most real right now are
impossible
More like a dream
Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the car's ashtray
know what you mean
The scariest part is thinking you're not the same person anymore
Something's changed
like your identity
What if the change is for the better
Randy finds an  in his pocket and takes a puff
That's fucked up
don't think  even care if 'm crazy
Corey turns and looks into his eyes
Randy leans forward
They're about to kiss, when -- (') What the fuck
scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the forest where there's a , some  , and a

It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his (') That fucking guy again
Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension
But Tom's proximity has spoiled the mood
Let's get outta here

There's a and the numbers shift, changing briefly to 01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30
Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare
She sits up and looks around, remembering where she is
She discovers Randy asleep by her side
She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside the bed and grabs her shirt
after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes -- because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his , staring at her
Only one day left
Corey turns and looks down to Randy
He's still fast asleep
What am  supposed to do
As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery, liquid   protruding from the center of her chest
Billy is now gone, but her  beckons her out of the room, elongating to illustrate her path
Corey is in awe
' ,   - Her  leads her through the living room, and past the sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth
Following her path leads her to step on '  as she goes by
Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as she treads out the door

The residential street is guarded by great,   on either side
The dark sky above starts to  and , and a  in space-time materializes
There's a simultaneous flash of  and sharp , and Corey looks up to the  -- a massive, swirling  gapes open like a tunnel to the inter- dimensional realm of darkest night

Billy stands atop her car, watching her
His perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile
The   suddenly cracks from pressure
As Corey stares into the drain

The entire driveway and the street in front of the house are covered with water
,   and an are gathered in front of the property
: Ruth runs toward her house
When she turns a corner and it comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks
Her face shows sheer terror -- Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer 'Dell and another policeman,
the   struggles against it's , growling and barking frantically
and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by #2 Lucky  heard him screamin', else he woulda drowned down there

The book is open to:   - The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary Universe
No one knows how or why a Receiver will be chosen
She flips through the onion skin pages to:   - The Manipulated Dead are more powerful than the Living Receiver
If a person dies within the Tangent Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver through the Fourth Dimensional Construct

What's a fuck-ass
Everyone cracks up, including Corey
Sam is humiliated
She backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes
Randy revs the engine, expressing his will to take off
See ya later, Sam
Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward the intersection
She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot where she's standing

Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the backseat
She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting herself to any more of their mockery
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left

you're sure you didn't see a driver

Sam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her
' (') Well, we'll find him, one way or another
Sam nods in acknowledgement
'Dell sees how much this has traumatized her

He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle
He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him
Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom watches her with empathy
It looks as though he's about to go to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door
You okay
Sam is still too choked up to speak
Tom sneaks away unnoticed

Major emotional release
Chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have the words

They've gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the in her hand

'm really sorry, Sam
She doesn't respond
(') It's horrible
but sometimes these things can happen for a reason
Sometimes good can come of it
growth, ya know
What the fuck are you talking about
Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is caustic
All  meant was, sometimes- know what you meant, and it's bullshit
When someone dies for no reason you can't just make one up to fill the void and make yourself feel better
It sucks, and it fucks everything up, but it doesn't mean shit beyond that
'm sorry, - You've obviously never lost anybody like  have, `cause if you did you'd already know that
Chris doesn't try anymore
Sam immediately feels bad
(') Thanks for the ride
She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room

She reaches inside and pulls out book, by Roberta Sparrow
As she studies the cover, her image is reflected by the

The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room

She looks at the     tucked away inside the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko family together
Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie, and she puts them all down

Well
okay
Thanks

So
what are you gonna do
don't know yet
Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not wanting to go inside the motel room
(') Do you believe that everything happens for a reason
know that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
Yeah
learned that in science
And everything in the universe is in constant motion, as the universe is constantly expanding
Yeah, but do you believe that everything happens for a reason, like in life
You mean like destiny
71
Jeremy thinks on this for a moment
(') think everyone has a purpose
Something they're meant to do
Like potential, but more clear-cut
For instance,  was destined to get my hands on the meteorite
Really
'm making amazing discoveries every day, practically sleeping at the lab
While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches nervously at his left forearm
It draws Sam's attention away from what he's saying

Jeremy stops scratching

Sam hesitates

It's no big deal
She accepts the money
Thank you

As they move down the line and approach Sam, she tenses up
Trudy is about to go into her spiel when she recognizes her
Oh
hello
She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward
It doesn't work
Aware of Sam's financial situation, she gives Father Homeijer the hint to move on
He follows her lead

Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly filled with sadness

Someone on the other end finally picks up: (

He peers at the twinkling lights through his scrap metal  , and cradles his  in his arms like a soldier at rest

She wears her  , and the
The    is lodged in her forehead
You wanna know what happens when you die
Tom shakes his head no
(') wish it was me
She looks at Tom

to die
Tom aims his gun at her face
He realizes that a   has formed in between them, because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier bends and becomes slightly opaque
Sam is expressionless
Tom's finger trembles as he places it on the trigger
He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's  , and sees a   take shape like a coordinate system on the force field
Sam's eye is in the Tom pulls the trigger
liquid   shoots out of the gun barrel
Immediately after, a  is discharged and follows it
The   passes cleanly through the grid, but when the  reaches it, the entire force field curves to accommodate the penetrating force

She's got some makeup on, and has spent more time on her hair than usual

Chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly uncomfortable
just stopped by to see how you were holdin' up
'm okay
Sorry about the other night '- was just upset
shouldn't have snapped at you like that
Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness
So what are you still doin' here figured you woulda hopped on a bus by now
'm gonna be taking off soon, think
just gotta figure some stuff out
It's quiet here
don't know if you're doin' anything later on, but
He trails off when he  a  pull up and park by his truck
He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his

was just on my way out
What were you gonna say
Nothin'
Okay, well
'll see you later
Yeah, sure
He steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door
Bye
Bye
Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they drive off together
- Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab
There are    with  and some As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain his excitement
Sam follows, taking note of a   in an extremely
Here's my station
He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a  containing a tiny    with a grid- like     embedded in it
That's it
The rest is locked away somewhere else
somewhere safe
Everyone's gonna want a piece of this thing pretty soon
He takes it over to an    and turns it on
He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's through an

(') You ever seen one of these
No
It's a scanning electron microscope
It uses electrons instead of light to scan the image
&   appears on the microscope's  -- it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades
(') At first  thought it was a siderite, but then  saw it was more than that
Much more
It does have a percentage of nickel and iron in it as  first suspected
But it also has something else
He waits for Sam to take the bait
And what's that
He points to cluster of   on the monitor
Their shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding them
An unrecognizable element
've done all the tests
It doesn't exist on the periodic table
Jeremy is practically beaming
So this is pretty major
This is history
'm thinking of calling it framium
Framium
For my last name
Frame
78
What if it's like
proof of some alien life-form from another galaxy or something
Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at his left forearm as he talks
It's very important you promise me you won't tell anyone else what 've showed you
have to wait till just the right moment
, or some secret government organization could come in here and take it away from me
As Jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder
(') And then later on, years from now, take credit for the discovery themselves
won't say anything
Good
Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him
There's this book  think you'd like
got it from my physics teacher in high school
The study of physics has unraveled some of the most profound mysteries of the universe
It's called The Philosophy of Time Travel
Time travel
Yeah, but it's not really that
It's more like one scenario, or one type of scenario
don't completely understand it
79
Sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor
(') Another mystery
What do you mean
My life seems to be full of them
Mysteries are what make life interesting
Sam doesn't agree or disagree
She's become tense, because Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers
(') You're a mystery to me, Samantha
He goes in for a kiss, but Sam gently pushes him away
(') Ow
Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm
Sam looks down and sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger , covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto his forearm
That doesn't look good
should get some Hydrocortisone
He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him
(regarding the attempted ) Sorry about that
'm sorry
should've know better
You barely know me, right
And nobody really calls my Samantha
Just my mom and dad

We were just about to call it quits when we heard something comin' from Jeremy's garage
He'd stuck it in a trash can and put the lid on

Died just a few days later
How old was he
don't know, just a couple years
Cute little black and white- No
Jeremy

He was like nine, probably
He was just a kid, he didn't know what he was doing
When you were nine years old did you know it was wrong to put a living creature in the trash can and leave it there

When she sees the handmade   lying among his things, she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it up
She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and jagged teeth
She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her
When she senses his presence she's startled
Sorry
She sets the   down where she found it
Tom says nothing
He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her there
He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view
After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him
To her surprise, Tom begins to speak: My mom told me someday everybody would understand
She said it was my job to look out for the town
so that's what  do
That's what always do
Sam listens to him intently
(') They don't know why
They don't even want me here, but  still have to protect them
They're lucky to have someone to protect them
'm used to it
'm lucky to have a job to do
Some people don't have any reason to be here at all

Tom turns and looks at her strangely

You're more important than all of us
Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask
Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask
When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping her -- not too rough, but forceful
Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go
His eyes drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side
Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him
When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with emotion
Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand

Again, Tom does not speak
After a beat, Sam gets up slowly and walks away, leaving Tom with the book

When he looks down the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly
He disturbs her while she's looking at some Sam

Oh, hi Jeremy

Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up his jacket and puts it back on

He zips up his jacket tight
Are you fucking kidding me

No
