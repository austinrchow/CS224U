Quentin Tarantino's October 22, 1990 ----------------- This movie is dedicated to these following sources of inspiration: DeTOTH --------------------- 1
'   - Eight men dressed in  , sit around a table at a breakfast cafe
They are
,
,
, ,
,
,    , and the big boss,
Most are finished eating and are enjoying coffee and conversation
Joe flips through a small address book
Mr
Pink is telling a long and involved story about Madonna
"Like a Virgin" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick
The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks
No it's not
It's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times
Then she meets some guy who's really sensitive-- --Whoa
whoa
time out Greenbay
Tell that bullshit to the tourists
(looking through his address book) Toby
who the fuck is Toby
Toby
Toby
think
think
think
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy
Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that
Which one is "True Blue
" You don't remember "True Blue
" That was a big ass hit for Madonna
Shit,  don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and 've at least heard of "True Blue
" Look, asshole,  didn't say ain't heard of it
All  asked was how does it go
Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan
hate Madonna
like her early stuff
You know, "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but once she got into her "Papa Don't Preach" phase,  don't know, tuned out
Hey, fuck all that, 'm making a point here
You're gonna make me lose my train of thought
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl
What's that
found this old address book in a jacket  ain't worn in a coon's age
Toby what
What the fuck was her last name
Where was
You said "True Blue" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella
But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks
Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s about
It's about some cooze who's a regular fuck machine
mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick
How many dicks was that
lot
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby
This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape
"  He's diggin tunnels
Now she's gettin this serious dick action, she's feelin something she ain't felt since forever
Pain
Chew
Toby Chew
No
It hurts
It hurts her
It shouldn't hurt
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now
But when this cat fucks her, it hurts
It hurts like the first time
The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin
Hence, "Like a Virgin
" The fellas crack up
Wong
Fuck you, wrong
'm right
What the fuck do you know about it anyway
You're still listening to Jerry-fucking-Vale
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong
You know, like the Chinese name
Mr
White snatches the address book from Joe's hand
They fight, but they're not really mad at each other
Give me this fucking thing
What the fuck do you think you're doin
Give me my book back
'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe, 'll give it back when we leave
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names
"Toby
Toby
Toby
Toby Wong
Toby Wong
Toby Chung
fuckin Charlie Chan
" got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap -don't- know-what, outta my left
What do you care
When you're annoying as hell, care a lot
Give me my book
You gonna put it away
'm gonna do whatever  wanna do with it
Well, then, 'm afraid 'm gonna have to keep it
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize
Have you guys been listening to - 's super sounds of the seventies weekend
Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it
Can you believe the songs they been playin
No,  can't
You know what heard the other day
"Heartbeat - It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family
haven't heard that since  was in fifth fuckin grade
When  was coming down here,  was playin it
And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on
Now  ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big,  heard it a million- trillion times
'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time  ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed the guy
thought the cheatin wife shot Andy
They say it in the song
know,  heard it
musta zoned out whenever that part came on before
thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife
No, she did it
She killed the cheatin wife, too
You know the part in "Gypsies, Tramps and Theives," when she says "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he'd done
"   could never figure out what he did
The table laughs
The  comes over to the table
She has the check, and a pot of coffee
Can  get anybody more coffee
No, we're gonna be hittin it
'll take care of the check
She hands the bill to him
Here ya go
Please pay at the register, if you wouldn't mind
Sure thing
You guys have a wonderful day
They all mutter equivalents
She exits and Joe stands up
'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip
(to Mr
White) And when  come back,  want my book back
Sorry, it's my book now
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya
Mr
Blonde shoots Mr
White with his finger
Mr White acts shot
Joe exits
Okay, everybody cough up green for the little lady
Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table
Everybody, that is, except Mr
White
'mon, throw in a buck
Uh-uh
don't tip
Whaddaya mean you don't tip
don't believe in it
You don't believe in tipping
(laughing) love this kid, he's a madman, this guy
Do you have any idea what these ladies make
They make shit
Don't give me that
She don't make enough money, she can quit
Everybody laughs
don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that
So let's get this straight
You never ever tip
don't tip because society says gotta
tip when somebody deserves a tip
When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra
But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds
As far as 'm concerned, they're just doin their job
Our girl was nice
Our girl was okay
She didn't do anything special
What's something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick
They all laugh
'd go over twelve percent for that
Look,  ordered coffee
Now we've been here a long fuckin time, and she's only filled my cup three times
When  order coffee, want it filled six times
What if she's too busy
The words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary
Excuse me, Mr
White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee
They all laugh
These ladies aren't starvin to death
They make minimum wage
When  worked for minimum wage, wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy
Ahh, now we're getting down to it
It's not just that he's a cheap bastard-- --It is that too-- --It is that too
But it's also he couldn't get a waiter job
You talk like a pissed off dishwasher: "Fuck those cunts and their fucking tips
" So you don't care that they're counting on your tip to live
Mr
White rubs two of his fingers together
Do you know what this is
It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses
You don't have any idea what you're talking about
These people bust their ass
This is a hard job
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them
They're servin ya food, you should tip em
But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there
That's bullshit
They work harder than the kids at McDonald's
Oh yeah,  don't see them cleaning fryers
These people are taxed on the tips they make
When you stiff 'em, you cost them money
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country
It's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on
The reason is because of tips
Fuck all that
They all laugh
Hey, 'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips
That's fucked up
But that ain't my fault
it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis
You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, 'll sign it
Put it to a vote, 'll vote for it
But what  won't do is play ball
And this non- college bullshit you're telling me,  got two words for that: "Learn to fuckin type
"  Cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise
He's convinced me
Give me my dollar back
Everybody laughs
Joe's comes back to the table
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling
Wait a minute, who didn't throw in
Mr
White
(to Mr
Orange) Mr
White
(to Mr
White) Why
He don't tip
(to Mr
Orange) He don't tip
(to Mr
White) You don't tip
Why
He don't believe in it
(to Mr
Orange) He don't believe in it
(to Mr
White) You don't believe in it
Nope
(to Mr
Orange) Shut up
(to Mr
White) Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard,  paid for your goddamn breakfast
Because you paid for the breakfast, 'm gonna tip
Normally  wouldn't
Whatever
Just throw in your dollar, and let's move
(to Mr
Blonde) See what 'm dealing with here
Infants
'm fuckin dealin with infants
The eight men get up to leave
Mr
White's waist is in the
As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying a gun
They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House, talking amongst themselves
2
'   - : When the credit sequence is finished, we      : Over the  we hear the sound of   in agony
Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car , through traffic
Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear : () Just hold on buddy boy
Somebody stops screaming long enough to say: () 'm sorry
can't believe she killed me
Who would've fuckin thought that
: 3
() - The Somebody screaming is Mr
Orange
He lies in the backseat
He's been  in the stomach
covers both him and the backseat
Mr
White is the Somebody Else
He's behind the wheel of the getaway car
He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and out of traffic
Though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat
They are the only two in the car
Hey, just cancel that shit right now
You're hurt
You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying
(crying) All this blood is scaring the shit outta me
'm gonna die,  know it
Oh excuse me,  didn't realize you had a degree in medicine
Are you a doctor
Are you a doctor
Answer me please, are you a doctor
No, 'm not
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know what you're talking about
So if you're through giving me your amateur opinion, lie back and listen to the news
'm taking you back to the rendezvous, Joe's gonna get you a doctor, the doctor's gonna fix you up, and you're gonna be okay
Now say it: you're gonna be okay
Say it: you're gonna be okay
Mr
Orange doesn't respond
Mr
White starts pounding on the steering wheel
Say-the-goddamn-words: you're gonna be okay
'm okay
(softly) Correct
4
- The  does a 360 around an empty warehouse
Then the door swings open, and Mr
White carries the bloody body of Mr
Orange inside
Mr
Orange still is  loudly from his bullet hit
Mr
White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor
Just hold on buddy boy
Hold on, and wait for Joe
can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you
We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe
Who are we waiting for
Joe
Bet your sweet ass we are
Mr
White gets up from over Mr
Orange and starts to prowl around the warehouse
(yelling) Don't leave me
Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand
ain't going anywhere
'm right here
'm not gonna leave ya
Larry, 'm so scared, would you please hold me
Mr
White very gently embraces the bloody Mr
Orange
Cradling the young man, Mr
White whispers to him
(whispering) Go ahead and be scared, you've been brave enough for one day want you to just relax now
You're not gonna die, you're gonna be fine
When Joe gets here, he'll make ya a hundred percent again
Mr
White lays Mr
Orange back down on the mattress
He's still holding his hand
Mr
Orange looks up at his friend
Look,  don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon,  gotta see a doctor
don't give a fuck about jail, just don't wanna die
You're not gonna fucking die, all right
wasn't born yesterday
'm hurt, and 'm hurt bad
It's not good
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do
was panicking for a moment, but 've got my senses back now
The situation is, 'm shot in the belly
And without medical attention, 'm gonna die
can' take you to a hospital
Fuck jail
don't give a shit about jail
But  can't die
You don't have to take me in
Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk
'll take care of myself
won't tell them anything
swear to fucking god, won't tell 'em anything
Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes
(Mr
White does) -won't-tell-them-anything
You'll be safe
Lie back down, and try to-- 'm going to die
need a doctor
'm begging you, take me to a doctor
Mr
Orange lays his head back on the mattress
Spent from his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself: Take me to a doctor, take me to a doctor, please
Suddenly, the warehouse door  open and Mr
Pink steps inside
Was that a fucking set-up or what
Mr
Pink sees Mr
Orange on the floor, shot and bloody
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged
Throughout this scene, we hear Mr
Orange moaning
Gun shot
Oh that's just fucking great
Where's Brown
Dead
Goddamn, goddamn
How did he die
How the fuck do you think
The cops shot him
Oh this is bad, this is so bad
(referring to Mr
Orange) Is it bad
As opposed to good
This is so fucked up
Somebody fucked us big time
You really think we were set up
You even doubt it
don't think we got set up,  know we got set up
mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh
One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there
didn't hear any sirens
The alarm went off, okay
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time
Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond
In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there
All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there
Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars
Those were the ones responding to the alarm
but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us
(pause) You haven't thought about this
haven't had a chance to think
First  was just trying to get the fuck outta there
And after we got away, 've just been dealin with him
Well, you better start thinking about it
Cause , sure as fuck, am thinking about it
In fact, that's all 'm thinking about came this close to just driving off
Whoever set us up, knows about this place
There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me
For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now
Let's go in the other room
The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner
We move past it, and see down a hall
5
- At the end of the hall is a bathroom
The bathroom door is partially closed, restricting our view
Mr
Pink is obscured, but Mr
White is in view
() What the fuck am  doing here felt funny about this job right off
As soon as  felt it should said "No thank you", and walked
But  never fucking listen
Every time  ever got burned buying weed,  always knew the guy wasn't right
just felt it
But  wanted to believe him
If he's not lyin to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby
But it's never Thai stick
and  always said if  felt that way about a job, 'd walk
And did, and  didn't, because of fuckin money
What's done is done,  need you cool
Are you cool
'm cool
Splash some water on your face
Take a breather
We hear the sink running, and Mr
Pink splashing water on his face
'm gonna get me my smokes
Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and We see Mr
Pink, his back turned towards us, bent over the sink
Then he grabs a towels, and dries his face
Mr White   with a pack of Chesterfields in his hand
Want a smoke
Why not
The two men light up
Okay, let's go through what happened
We're in the place, everything's going fine
Then the alarm gets tripped
turn around and all these cops are outside
You're right, it was like, bam blink my eyes are they're there
Everybody starts going apeshit
Then Mr
Blonde starts shootin all the-- --That's not correct
What's wrong with it
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off
They didn't show till after Mr
Blonde started shooting everyone
As soon as  heard the alarm, saw the cops
'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon
They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr
Blonde went off
'm not sayin they weren't there, 'm sayin they were there
But they didn't move in till Mr
Blonde became a madman
That's how  know we were set up
You can see that, can't you, Mr
White
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit-- --Don't tell me your name,  don't want to know
sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine
You're right, this is bad
(pause) How did you get out
Shot my way out
Everybody was shooting, so  just blasted my way outta there
: 6
- Mr
Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk
He has a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a
357 in the other
If any  get in his way, he just knocks them down
We  at the same speed, right along side of him
are running after Mr
Pink
We  with them
We  with a young woman on roller skates is plugged into a walkman
We hear the song she's listening to  over the
She's twirling and skating backwards to the beat of the song
Rollergirl turns a corner and  with Mr
Pink
The man and woman  to the ground
Mr
Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car that  to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over him
7
() - The  is in the backseat
is the car's driver
Mr
Pink pulls himself up from the hood, shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver
Get outta the car
Get the fuck outta the car
The Shocked Woman starts screaming
Mr
Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's locked
Open the fucking door
' Mr
Pink  it in our face
8
- with Cops coming up fast
Mr
Pink  the Shocked Woman out of the car
The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed
Using the car as a shield, Mr
Pink  three shots at the Cops
Everybody  the ground, or scatters
Mr
Pink  in the car
Cops
9
() - in the backseat, Mr
Pink  it
down the street, with the Cops  after him
: 10
- Mr
Pink and Mr
White still talking in the bathroom
Tagged a couple of cops
Did you kill anybody
few cops
No real people
Uh-uh, just cops
Could you believe Mr
Blonde
That was one of the most insane fucking things 've ever seen
Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that
don't wanna kill anybody
But if  gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin outta my way
That's the way  look at it choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all
But  ain't no madman either
What the fuck was Joe thinkin
You can't work with a guy like that
That mother- fucker's unstable
What do you think
Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger- happy
think he's a sick fuckin maniac
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place
came this fucking close-- (hold up two fingers and makes a tiny space between them) --to taking his ass out myself
Everybody panics
When things get tense, everybody panics
Everybody
don't care what your name is, you can't help it
It's human nature
But ya panic on the inside
Ya panic in your head
Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation
What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional psychopath is not a professional
You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next
mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was
Twenty, maybe twenty-one
Did ya see what happened to anybody else
Me and Mr
Orange jumped in the car and Mr
Brown floored it
After that,  don't know what went down
At that point it became every man for himself
As far as Mr
Blonde or Mr
Blue are concerned,  ain't got the foggiest
Once got out,  never looked back
What do you think
What do  think
think the cops caught them, or killed 'em
Not even a chance they punched through
You found a hole
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle
But if they did get away, where the fuck are they
You don't think it's possible, one of them got ahold of the diamonds and pulled a-- Nope
How can you be so sure
got the diamonds
Where
got 'em, all right
Where
Are they out in the car
No, they're not in the car
No, don't have them on me
Ya wanna go with me and get 'em
Yes, we can go right now
But first listen to what 'm telling you
We were fuckin set up
Somebody is in league with the cops
We got a Judas in our midst
And 'm thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here
That was the plan, we meet here
Then where is everybody
say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house
We ain't got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to Mr
Blonde or Mr
Blue
They could both be dead or arrested
They could be sweatin 'em, down at the station house right now
Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place
mean, that could be happening right now
As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin here this minute
swear to god 'm fuckin jinxed
What
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop
No shit
Thank god, we discovered in time
We hadda forget the whole fuckin thing
Just walked away from it
So who's the rat this time
Mr
Blue
Mr
Blonde
Joe
It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up
Maybe he set it up to set it up
don't buy it
Me and Joe go back a long time
can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time
known Joe since  was a kid
But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous
can say definitely didn't do it, cause know what  did or didn't do
But can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause  don't definitely know
For all  know, you're the rat
For all  know, you're the rat
Now you're using your head
For all we know, he's the rat
Mr
Pink points  to Mr
Orange
Mr
White's expression changes
Jesus Christ
11
- They run over to Mr
Orange, who's unconscious
The hovers over the action
Mr
Pink reaches him first
Is he dead
Mr
White pushes him out of the way
He feels the pulse on Mr
Orange's neck
So, is he dead or what
He ain't dead
So what is it
think he's just passed out
He scared the fuckin shit outta me
thought he was dead fer sure
Mr
White stands up and walks over to a table
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital
We can't take him to a hospital
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night
That bullet in his belly is my fault
Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me
And 'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy
We gotta book up
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel
We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain
You gotta idea, spit it out
Joe could help him
If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him
During Mr
Pink's dialog, we slowly  in to a of Mr
White
() Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here
Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us
Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now
Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians
Jesus Christ
tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight
If  was him, 'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible
Before you got here, Mr
Orange was askin me to take him to a hospital
Now  don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead
He begged me to do it
told him to hold off till Joe got here
() Well Joe ain't gettin here
We're on our own
Now,  don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em
don't know anybody
() Well,  guess we drop him off at the hospital
Since he don't know nothin about us,  say it's his decision
' : () Well, he knows a little about me
You didn't tell him your name, did ya
() told him my first name, and where 'm from
There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr
Pink, then he : Why
() told him where  was from a few days ago
It was just a casual conversation
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to
() He asked
Mr
Pink looks at Mr
White like he's retarded
() We had just gotten away from the cops
He just got shot
It was my fuckin fault he got shot
He's a fuckin bloody mess - he's screaming
swear to god, thought we was gonna die right then and there
'm tryin to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, 'm gonna take care of him
And he asked me what my name was mean, the man was dyin in my arms
What the fuck was  supposed to tell him, "Sorry,  can't give out that information, it's against the rules
don't trust you enough
"
Maybe  shoulda, but couldn't
Oh,  don't doubt is was quite beautiful-- () Don't fuckin patronize me
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from
() Of course
Well that's that, then
mean, was worried about mug shot possibilities already
But now he knows: (a) what you look like, (b) what your first name is, (i) where you're from and (d) what your specialty is
They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out
That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection
() If  have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round
Mr
Pink walks out of the
and turns his back on Mr
White
Mr
White's   over to him
We ain't taking him to a hospital
() If we don't, he'll die
And 'm very sad about that
But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't
() That fuckin did it
Mr
White's   toward Mr
Pink
Mr
Pink turns toward him in time to get  hard in the mouth
Mr
White and Mr
Pink have a very ungraceful and realistic fight
They go at each other like a couple of alley cats
As Mr
White  and , he : You little motherfucker
Mr
Pink  as he : Ya wanna fuck with me
You wanna fuck with me
'll show you who you're fuckin with
The two men end up on the floor  and
Mr
White gets Mr
Pink in a
Mr
Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it out
Mr
White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr
Pink, and goes for his own weapon
The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their guns outstretched, aiming at one another
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit
Take a shot
Fuck you, White
didn't create this situation,  'm just dealin with it
You're acting like a first-year fuckin thief
'm actin like a professional
They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen
And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault
didn't tell him my name
didn't tell him where  was from
didn't tell him what  knew better than to tell him
Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name
You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created
So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror
Mr
Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White
So if you wanna shoot somebody, put that gun in your mouth and shoot yourself
Then from   we hear: () You kids don't play so rough
Somebody's gonna start crying
12
-  - The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr
Blonde
Mr
Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog
Mr
Blonde
You okay
We thought you might've gotten caught
What happened
Mr
Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out
He doesn't look at either Mr
Pink or Mr
White, he just eats his hot dog and sips his coke
This is making Pink and White nervous as hell
But Mr
Pink tries to talk through it
We  follow Mr
Blonde around the warehouse
Really, how did you get away
Mr
Blonde walks the loft
Silent
You saw what happened to me, found a hole and booked
Silence
Where's Mr
Blue
Blonde looks in the bathroom
We were hopin you two would be together
Blonde looks out the window
That was the big question we had, what happened to Mr
Blue and you
Blonde walks away from the window
We were worried the cops got ya
Blonde bends down over Mr
Orange
He got it in the belly
He's still alive, but won't be for long
Enough
You better start talkin to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about
We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin bag on our hip
Mr
Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves towards them
So, talk
We think we got a rat in the house
guarantee we got a rat in the house
What would ever make you think that
Is that supposed to be funny
We don't think this place is safe
This place just ain't secure anymore
We're leaving, and you should go with us
Nobody's going anywhere
Silence takes over the room
Mr
Blonde stops moving
After a few beats the silence is broken
(to Mr
Pink) Piss on this turd, we're outta here
Mr
White turns to leave
Don't take another step, Mr
White
Mr
White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr
Blonde
Fuck you, maniac
It's your fuckin fault we're in so much trouble
Mr
Blonde calmly sits down
He looks to Mr
Pink
(referring to Mr
White) What's this guy's problem
What's my problem
Yeah,  gotta problem
gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot
What're you talkin about
That fuckin shooting spree in the store
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got
You almost killed me, asshole
If had any idea what type of guy you were,  never would've agreed to work with you
You gonna back all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite
What was that
'm sorry, didn't catch it
Would you repeat it
(slowly) said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite
" Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down
(to Mr
Blonde) So you wanna git bit, huh
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin playground
(pause) don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and 'm the only one actin like a professional
You guys act like a bunch of fuckin niggers
You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers
They're just like you two, always fightin, always sayin they're gonna kill one another
(to Mr
Pink) You said yourself, you thought about takin him out
Then
That time has passed
Right now, Mr
Blonde is the only one  completely trust
He's too fuckin homicidal to be workin with the cops
You takin his side
Fuck sides
What we need is a little solidarity here
Somebody's stickin a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle
Now know 'm no piece of shit
(referring to Mr
White) And 'm pretty sure you're a good boy
(referring to Mr
Blonde) And 'm fuckin positive you're on the level
So let's figure out who's the bad guy
Mr
White calms down and puts his gun away
Mr
Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning, talking about Madonna
Well, that was sure exciting
(to Mr
White) You're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't you
Me too
don't know about the rest of you fellas, but my heart's beatin fast
(pause for a beat) Okay you guys, follow me
Mr
Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door
The other two men just follow him with their eyes
Follow you where
Down to my car
Why
It's a surprise
Mr
Blonde walks out
13
- Three cars are parked out front
Mr
Blonde is walking towards the car he drove
Mr
White and Mr
Pink are walking behind
The Camera is  following behind them
We still gotta get out of here
We're gonna sit here and wait
For what, the cops
Nice Guy Eddie
Nice Guy Eddie
What makes you think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a plane half way to Costa Rica
Cause  just talked to him
He's on his way down here, and nobody's going anywhere till be gets here
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie
Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place
You didn't ask
Hardy-fuckin-har
What did he say
Stay put
Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise brought you
Mr
Blonde opens up the truck of his car
handcuffed, uniformed  is curled up inside the trunk
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy Eddie, what say we have a little fun finding out who the rat is

'  - We're inside the office of Joe Cabot
Joe's on the phone, sitting behind his desk
(into phone) Sid, 'm tellin you don't worry about it
You had a bad couple of months, it happens
(pause) Sid, Sid, Sid
Stop, you're embarrassing me
don't need to be told what  already know
When you have bad months, you do what every business man in the worlds does,  don't care if he's Donald Trump or Irving the tailor
Ya ride it out
There's a  on Cabot's office door
Come in
One of Cabot's goons, , opens the door and steps inside
Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks towards the man
Vic Vega's outside
Tell him to come in
Teddy leaves
(into phone) Sid, a friend of mine's here gotta go
(pause) Good enough, bye
He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the front of the desk
Teddy opens the office door, and    walks in
Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr
Blonde
Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies style jacket
Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open
The two men embrace each other
Teddy leaves, closing the door behind him
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin good, ain't it
It's a change
Ain't that a sad truth
Remy Martin
Sure
Take a seat
Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet
Vic sits in a chair set in front of Joe's desk
(while he pours the drink) Who's your parole officer
guy named Koons
Craig Koons
How is he
Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house
Never ceases to amaze me
Fuckin jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty-five cents
Fuckin nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer
But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin prick
Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair
Vic swallows some Remy
just want you to know, Joe, how much  appreciate your care packages on the inside
What the hell did you expect me to do
Just forget about you
just wanted you to know, they meant a lot
It's the least  could do Vic wish  coulda done more
(Joe flashes a side grin at Vic) Vic
Toothpick Vic
Tell me a story
What're your plans
Well, what  wanna do is go back to work
But  got this Koons prick deep up my ass
He won't let me leave the halfway house till  get some piece of shit job
My plans have always been to be part of the team again
There's a  at the door
Come in
The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie
Vic turns around in his seat and sees him
(to Vic) see ya sittin here, but  don't believe it
Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie
How ya doin, Toothpick
Fine, now
'm sorry man,  shoulda picked you up personally at the pen
This whole week's just been crazy
've had my head up my ass the entire time
Funny you should mention it
That's what your father and  been talkin about
That  should've picked you up
No
That your head's been up your ass
walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god
Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing
Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up
"  And  say "Well, Joe, coulda told you that
"  "'m ruined
He's ruining me
My son, love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin toilet
" (to Joe) 'm not tellin tales out of school
You tell 'im Joe
Tell 'im yourself
Eddie,  hate like hell for you to hear it this way
But when Vic asked me how's business, well, you don't lie to a man who's just done four years in the slammer for ya
Eddie bobs his head up and down
Oh really, is that a fact
Eddie  Vic and they fall to the floor
The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle on the floor of Joe's office
Joe's on his feet yelling at them
(yelling) Okay, okay, enough, enough
Playtime's over
You wanna roll around on the floor, do it in Eddie's office, not mine
The two men break it up
They are completely disheveled, hair a mess, shirttails out
As they get themselves together, they continue to taunt one another
Daddy, did ya see that
What
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me
You fuckin wish
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it
But don't try to fuck me
don't think of you that way
mean,  like you a lot-- Eddie, if  was a pirate, wouldn't throw you to the crew
No, you'd keep me for yourself
Four years fuckin punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it
might break you, Nice Guy, but 'd make you my dog's bitch
You'd be suckin the dick and going down on a mangy -bone hound
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin like a nigger
It's all that black semen been shootin up his butt
It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth
Are you two finished
We were talkin about some serious shit when you came in Eddie
We got a big problem we're tryin to solve
Now Eddie, would you like to sit down and help us solve it, or do you two wanna piss fart around
Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it
So they both take seats in front of Joe's desk
Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a parole problem
Really
Who's your
Craig Koons
Koons
Oh shit,  hear he's a motherfucker
He is a motherfucker
He won't let me leave the halfway house till  get some piece of shit job
You're coming back to work for us, right
wanna
But  gotta show this asshole  got an honest-to- goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own
can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin back before ten o'clock curfew
(to Eddie) We can work this out, can't we
This isn't all that bad
We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs
Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker
don't wanna lift crates
You don't hafta lift shit
You don't really work there
But as far as the records are concerned, you do
call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy
You're on the schedule
You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week
And ya know dock workers don't do too bad
So you can move into a halfway decent place without Koons thinkin "what the fuck
"  And if Koons ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day
That day we sent you to Tustin
We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there
You're at the Taft airstrip pickin up a bunch of shit and bringing it back
Part of your jab is goin different places - and we got places all over the place
(to Vic) Didn't  tell ya not to worry
(to Eddie) Vic was worried
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow
'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch
(pause) When do you think you'll need me for real work
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now
Things are kinda-- --Nuts
We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up
And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach
Give ya some cash, get that Koons fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya
Daddy,  got an idea
Now just hear it out
know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys
He's been gone for four years
He ain't on no one's list
Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him
Joe looks at Vic
Vic has no idea what they're talking about
How would you feel about pullin a heist with about five other guys
What's the exposure like
Two minutes, tops
It's a tough two minutes
It's a hold up, daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd
But you have the fellas to deal with the crowd
It's a jewelry store
They're getting a big shipment of South African diamonds on a certain day
They're like a way station
It's gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Hamburg
When you walk through the door, you'll know right where to go for the rich stones
The fellas are good, me and Nice Guy picked em
Nobody knows anybody else
Nobody's connected
don't use connected guys for this shit
What's the cut
Juicy, man, real juicy
Toothpick Vic smiles
So does Nice Guy Eddie
: 15
'  () - Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his portable car phone
The sounds of the seventies are coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse
(into phone) Hey Dov, we got a major situation here
(pause) know you know that
gotta talk with daddy and find out what he wants done
16
- The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed behind his back
Mr
White, Mr
Pink and Mr
Blonde surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him
"Love Grows
"  over the soundtrack
17 (into phone) All  know is what Vic told me
He said the place turned into a fuckin bullet festival
He took a cop as hostage, just to get the fuck out of there
18 The three men are stomping the cop into the ground
19 (into phone) Do  sound like 'm jokin
He's fuckin driving around with the cop in his trunk
(pause) don't know who did that don't know who has the loot, if anybody has the loot
Who's dead, who's alive, who's caught, who's not
will know, 'm practically there
But what do  tell these guys about daddy
(pause) You sure that's what he said
(pause) Okay, that's what 'll tell em
: 20
- Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside the warehouse
Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse
He gets out of the car, looks at the other cars parked outside
(to himself) Fucking assholes
Eddie makes a beeline for the front door,  it open, and steps inside the warehouse
21
- The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still on him
Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps
What in Sam Hill is goin on
Mr
Pink and Mr
White speak together
Hey, Nice Guy, we got a     You're askin what's goin cop
on
Where the fuck is Joe
Nice Guy sees Mr
Orange
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up
No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on us if we don't get him taken care of
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us
What
Nobody set anybody up
The cops were there waitin for us
Bullshit
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were
And 'm tellin ya, the cops had that store staked out
Okay, Mr
Detective, who did it
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin each other
And what are your answers
Was it me
You think  set you up
don't know, but somebody did
Nobody did
You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up
Where's Joseph
ain't talked to him
talked to Dov
Dov said he's comin out here, and he's fucking pissed
(to Mr
White) told ya he'd be pissed
(pointing to Mr
Orange) What are you gonna do about him
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin chance to breathe
got a few questions of my own, ya know
You ain't dying, he is
'll call somebody
Who
snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think
'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up
No, where's Mr
Brown and Mr
Blue
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue
Nobody saw what happened to Mr
Blue
Well, he's either dead or he's alive or the cops got him or they don't
to  on the cop
() take it this is the bastard you told me about
(referring to the cop) Why the hell are you beating on him
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up
Would you stop it with that shit
You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire
That don't necessarily make it so
Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit
Please tell me somebody brought something with them
got a bag
stashed it till could be sure this place wasn't a police station
Well, let's go get it
We also gotta get rid of all those cars
It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside
(pointing to Mr
Blonde) You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop
(referring to Mr
Pink and Mr
White) You two take a car each, 'll follow ya
You ditch it, 'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones
And while 'm following you, 'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend
We can't leave these guys with him
Meaning Mr
Blonde
Why not
Mr
White crosses to Mr
Blonde
Because this guy's a fucking psycho
And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off  am at him, for puttin me in the same room as this bastard
(to Eddie) You see what  been puttin up with
As soon as  walk through the door 'm hit with this shit
tell 'm what you told me about us stayin put and Mr
White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, 'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah
" He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery
(to Mr
Pink) What are you, a silent partner
Fuckin tell him
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store
This is what he was doin
Mr
White acts out Mr
Blonde shooting everybody in the store
told 'em not to touch the alarm
They touched it
blew 'em full of holes
If they hadn't done what  told 'em not it, they'd still be alive
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage
don't like alarms
What does it matter who stays with the cop
We ain't lettin him go
Not after he's seen everybody
You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up
There is no fuckin set up
(Eddie takes charge) Look, this is the news
Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two
White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you
Eddie, Mr
White and Mr
Pink walk out of the warehouse talking amongst themselves
22
-  - Mr
Blonde closes the door after them
He then slowly turns his head towards the cop
Alone at last
'
() Now where were we
told you  don't know anything about any fucking set up
've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything
don't know anything
You can torture me if you want-- () --Thanks, don't mind if  do
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up
() First off,  don't have a boss
Are you clear about that
He  the cop's face
() asked you a question
Are you clear about that
Yes
() Now 'm not gonna bullshit you don't really care about what you know or don't know
'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless
Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me
There's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do
Except pray for death
He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth
' Mr
Blonde walks away from the cop
Let's see what's on -' "super sounds of the seventies" weekend
He turns on the radio
Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" over the speaker
: This entire sequence is timed to the music
Mr
Blonde slowly walks toward the cop
He opens a large knife
He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits in it
Mr
Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding the knife, singing along with the song
Then, like a cobra, he  out
across the face
The cop/camera moves around wildly
Mr
Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing along with the seventies hit
Then he reaches out and   the cop's/our ear
The cop/camera moves around wildly
Mr
Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see
Mr
Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out of the way
23
/
-  - We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse
to his car
He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of gasoline
He walks back inside the warehouse
24
- carrying the can of gas
Mr
Blonde  the gasoline all over the cop, who's him not to do this
Mr
Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel
Mr
Blonde  up a match and, while mouthing: "Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right
Here  am, stuck in the middle with you
" He moves the match up to the cop
When a bullet  in Mr
Blonde's chest
The  camera  to the right and we see the bloody Mr
Orange  his gun
We cut back and forth between Mr
Blonde taking and Mr
Orange emptying his weapon
Mr
Blonde  down dead
Mr
Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody trail behind him
When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him
(feebly) What's your name
Jeffrey
Jeffrey what
Jeffrey Andrews
Listen to me, Jeffrey Andrews
'm a cop
know
(surprised) You do
Your name's Freddy something
Freddy Newendyke
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago
Shit
don't remember that at all
do
(pause) How do  look
The gun-shot Mr
Orange looks at the kid's  face and the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be
don't know what to tell you Jeffrey
Jeffrey starts to weep
That fucking bastard
That fucking sick fucking bastard
Jeffrey,  need you to hold on
There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away
(screaming) What the fuck are they waiting for
That motherfucker cut off my ear
He slashed my face
'm deformed
And 'm dying
They don't know that
All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up
was sent undercover to get Cabot
You heard 'em, they said he's on his way
Don't pussy out on me now, Jeffrey
We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin head through that door

' - tough-looking black man named , who sports a Malcom  beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny bacon, cheese and avocado burger
He sits in a booth all alone
He's waiting for somebody
As he waits, he practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he likes it
We see Mr
Orange, now known as  , wearing a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot Holdaway, and head his way
Holdaway sees Freddy bop towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered across his face
down  to   of Holdaway
We fear Freddy

) Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside
Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team
This better not be some Freddy joke
looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table
It ain't no joke, 'm in there
'm up his ass
Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then smiles
Congratulations

Freddy's doing a lot of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying

) Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to meet me
He says  should just hang around my apartment and wait for a phone call
Well after waiting three goddamn days by the fuckin phone, he calls me last night and says Joe's ready, and he'll pick me up in fifteen minutes
The freeze frame
Holdaway comes suddenly up to speed and says: Woo all picked you up
From here to end we cut back and forth
Nice Guy
When we got to the bar
What bar
The Boots and Socks in Gardena
When we got there,  met Joe and a guy named Mr
White
It's a phony name
My name's Mr
Orange
You ever seen this motherfucker before
Who, Mr
White
Yeah
No, he ain't familiar
He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either
He's gotta be from outta town
But Joe knows him real well
How can you tell
The way they talk to each other
You can tell they're buddies
Did the two of you talk
Me and Mr
White
Yeah
little
What about
The Brewers
The Milwaukee Brewers
Yeah
They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin
And 'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if--know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr
White motherfucker's ass want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face
Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger
(with his mouth full) What kinds questions did Cabot ask
Where  was from, who  knew, how knew Nice Guy, had  done time, shit like that
Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now
He motions for Freddy to elaborate
He asked me if  ever done armed robbery before
read him my credits
robbed a few gas and sips, sold some weed, told him recently  held the shotgun while me and another guy pulled down a poker game in Portland

Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt
Freddy sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket, looking at pieces of paper stapled together
What's this
It's a scene
Memorize it
What
undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando
To do this job you got to be a great actor
You got to be naturalistic
You got to be naturalistic as hell
If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bull shit in this job
(referring to the papers) But what is this
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal
What
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job
gotta memorize all this shit
It's like a joke
You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own
The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it
can do that
The things you gotta remember are the details
It's the details that sell your story
Now this story takes place in this men's room
So you gotta know the details about this men's room
You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands
You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors
You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it
And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you

'  - Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing the anecdote
He's reading it pretty good, but he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a while he stumbles over his words
this was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought of '86
still had a connection
Which was insane, 'cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckinwhere then
Anyway, had a connection with this hippie chick up in Santa Cruz
All and my friends knew it
And they'd give me a call and say, "Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you think you could buy me some too
" They knew  smoked, so they'd ask me to buy a little for them when was buyin
But it got to be everytime  bought some weed, was buyin for four or five different people
Finally  said, "Fuck this shit
"  'm makin this bitch rich
She didn't have to do jack shit, she never even had to meet these people
was fuckin doin all the work
So  got together with her and told her, "Hey, 'm sick of this shit
'm comin through for everybody, and nobody's comin through for me
So, either 'm gonna tell all my friends to find their own source, or you give me a bunch of weed, 'll sell it to them, give you the money, minus ten percent, and get my pot for free
"  So,  did if for awhile
Freddy exits frame : 30
- Another empty frame, except obviously outside
Freddy enters frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene, finishing his sentence
When we move to a wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to Holdaway in a parking lot
Holdaway sits on the hood of his beat-up car
Freddy paces back and forth as he performs his story
but then that got to be a pain in the ass
People called me on the phone all the fuckin time couldn't rent a fuckin tape without six phone calls interrupting me
"Hey, Freddy, when's the next time you're gettin some
"  "Motherfucker, 'm tryin to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when  have some, 'll let you know
"  And then these rinky-dink pot heads come by--there's my friends and everything, but still
got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags
Well, they don't want sixty dollars worth
They want ten dollars worth
Breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass don't even know how much ten dollars worth is
"Well, fuck, man,  don't want that much around
If  have that much around 'll smoke it
"  "Hey, if you guys can't control your smokin, that's not my problem
You motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it
" Finally  just told my connection, count me out
But as it turns out, 'm the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business
But  was still sick to death of it
And she's trying to talk me into not quitin
Now this was a very weird situation, 'cause  don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin drought
Nobody and anything
People were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months
And this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it
So  told her  wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man anymore
But  would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends
She agreed to that, and said we'd keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as  helped her out that weekend
She had a brick of weed she was sellin, and she didn't want to go to the buy alone
: 31
- Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr
White all sit around a table in a red-lighted smokey bar
Freddy continues his story
The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it
Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly
What for
Traffic tickets gone to warrant
They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail
She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed
Well,  don't wanna do this,  have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin me, keeps askin me, finally  said okay 'cause 'm sick of listening to it
Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station
You're picking the buyer up at the train station
You're carrying the weed on you
Yeah, the guy needed it right away
Don't ask me why
So we get to the train station, and we're waitin for the guy
Now 'm carrying the weed in one of those carry-on bags, and  gotta take a piss
So  tell the connection 'll be right back, 'm goin' to the little boys room
: 32
'  -   - He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his shoulder
Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks
We move into a
(
) So  walk into the men's room, and who's standing there
on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd
All of their eyes are on Freddy
Everyone is frozen
(
) six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and a German Shepherd
(
) They were waiting for you
(
) No
They were just a bunch of cops hangin out in the men's room, talkin
When  walked through the door they all stopped what they were talking about and looked at me
33 That's hard, man
That's a fuckin hard situation
34       ' barking his head off
(
) The German Shepherd starts barkin'
He's barkin' at me mean it's obvious he's barkin' at me
We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room
We can hear the dog barking
(
) Every nerve ending, all of my senses, the blood in my veins, everything  has was screaming, "Take off, man, just take off, get the fuck outta there
"  Panic hit me like a bucket of water
First there was the shock of it--, right in the face
Then 'm just standin there drenched in panic
does a  from face to face of the sheriffs
(
) And all those sheriffs are lookin at me and they know
They can smell it
As sure as that fuckin dog cam, they can smell it on me
Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in front of the sheriffs
It suddenly jerks to life, and moves to speed
The dog is barking
Freddy moves to his right, out of frame
We stay on the sheriffs
One sheriff yells at the dog
#1 Shut up
The dog quiets down
Sheriff #2 continues with his story
couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen, but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him
#2 So my gun's drawn, right
got it aimed right at him
tell 'em, "Freeze, don't fuckin move
" And the little idiot's lookin at me, nodding his head "Yes," sayin " know
know
know
" Meanwhile his right hand is creepin towards his glove box
So scream at him, "Asshole, you better fuckin freeze right now
" And he's still lookin right at me, saying " know
know
know
"  And his right hand's still going for the glove box
The   away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss
#2 (
) tell 'im, "Buddy, 'm gonna shoot you in the face right now if you don't put your hands on the fuckin dash
"  And the guy's girlfriend, a real sexy Oriental bitch, starts screamin at him, "Chuck, are you out of your mind
Put your hands on the dash like the officer said
"  And then like nothing, the guy snaps out of it and casually puts his hands on the dash
Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past the sheriffs over to the sink
The   with him
sheriff is sitting on a sink
He looks down and watches Freddy wash his hands
#1 What was he goin for
#2 His registration
Stupid fuckin citizen, doesn't have the slightest idea how close he came to gettin shot
Freddy finishes washing his hands
He goes to dry them, but there's only those hand drying machines
Freddy turns on the drying machine
He can't hear anything the sheriffs say now
The sound of the machine dominates the sound track
These following shots are
of his , rubbing each other getting blown dry talking
We can't hear them because of the machine
, smoking a cigarette, glancing over at Freddy
Machine turns off
: 35
- () That's him, that's Mr
White
An office upstairs in the undercover division of the police station
look at mug shot
Lawrence Dimick
Let's see what we got on him
the name ,  is typed in
,
This is your life, Lawrence Dimick
printing out sheet
The noise of the printer plays loud over the soundtrack
Jodie's hand comes into  and tears sheet from the printer
: 36
'  - Holdaway sits behind his desk
Freddy sits on the edge of the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese
They look into the
We hear Jodie's voice
() Lawrence "Larry" Dimick
Also known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin "Al" Jacobs
This guy is Mr
Joe- Armed-Robbery
He's a pro and he makes it a habit not to get caught
slowly into
He's only been convicted twice, which is pretty good for somebody living a life of crime
Once for armed robbery, when he was twenty- one, in Milwaukee
What was it
Payroll office at a lumber yard
First offense - he got eighteen months
He didn't get busted again until he was thirty-two
And then it was a backdoor bust
routine vice squad roust
They roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence is in there knocking down a few
He gets picked up
He's wearing on his person an outlaw
45 automatic, apparently his weapon of choice
Also, on his finger is a diamond ring from a jewelry store robbery a year earlier
He got two years back inside for that
Freddy winces
Goddamn, that's hard time
So far, it's the only time he's ever done
Was this vice squad bullshit in Milwaukee
No
The vice squad roust was in He's been in Los Angeles since '77
' from left to right
When did he do this time
Back in '83, got out late '86 found something else out  think you two should be aware of
About a year and a half ago, up in Sacramento, an undercover cop, John Dolenz, worked his way into a bank job
Apparently before the job they found out he was a cop
Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's birthday, a bunch of cops are waiting in his apartment for a surprise party
The door opens, everyone yells "Surprise
", and standing in the doorway is Dolenz and this other guy sticking a gun in Dolenz's ribs
Before anybody knows what's going on, this stranger shoots Dolenz dead and starts firing two
45 automatics into the crowd
What happened
The  moves behind Jodie
It was a mess
Cops got hit, wives got hit, girlfriends got hit, his dog got hit
People got glass in their faces
Three were killed, six were wounded
They couldn't pin the killing on one of the bank robbers
They tried, but they didn't have a positive
and all those guys had alibis
Besides, we really didn't have anything on them
We had the testimony of a dead man that they were talking about committing a robbery
They never went ahead with the bank job
The  completes its circle
And Larry Dimick was one of the boys
He was probably the one
Just how sure are you with your cover
to
on Freddy
Today they may know something, tomorrow they may know something else
But yesterday they didn't know anything
' () What's the next step
() Do what they told ya
Sit in your apartment and wait for 'em to call you
We'll have guys posted outside who'll follow you when they pick you up
35
'  - It
Freddy answers it, we  the receiver up to his face
Hello
() (through phone) It's time
Grab your jacket-- 36
'  () - of Nice Guy Eddie speaking into the car phone
--We're parked outside
() (through phone) 'll be right down
We hear the  of Freddy hanging up through the phone
Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle
He'll be right down
39
'  - The  follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment getting everything he needs
He puts on his jacket and slips on some sneakers
fast toward the front door knob
Freddy's hand comes into , grabs the knob, then lets go
We to his face
Fear
(to himself) Don't pussy out on me now
They don't know
They don't know shit
(pause) You're not gonna get hurt
You're fucking Baretta and they believe every word, cuz you're super cool
He exits
We stay put and hear the door open and close
40
'  - ' From inside an unmarked car across the street, the watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and up to Eddie's parked car
#1 () There goes our boy
#2 () swear, a guy has to have rocks in his head the size of Gibraltar to work undercover
#1 () Do you want one of these
#2 () Yeah, gimme the bear claw
Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic
Cop #1 starts the engine and follows
41
'  () - Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel
Mr
Pink is in the passenger seat
Freddy and Mr
White are in the backseat together
Hey,  know what 'm talkin about, black women ain't the same as white women
(sarcastically) There's a slight difference
The car laughs
Go ahead and laugh, you know what mean
What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute
They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up
gotta go along with Mr
Pink on this
've seen it happen
Okay, Mr
Expert
If this is such a truism, how come every nigger know treats his woman like a piece of shit
'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out
Not these guys
Yeah, those guys too
Let me tell you guys a story
In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois
Elois
Yeah, Elois
and Lois
We called her Lady
Where was she from, Compton
No
She was from Ladora Heights
The black Beverly Hills
knew this lady from Ladora Heights once
(in a stuck up black female voice) "Hi, 'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills
" It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-upper
bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once
You know who she looked like
Christie Love
'Member that  show "Get Christie Love"
She was a black female cop
She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar
" was in the sixth grade when that show was on
totally dug it
What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love
Pam Grier
No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier was the other one
Pan Grier made the movies
Christie Love was like a Pam Grier  show, without Pam Grier
What the fuck was that chick's name
Oh this is just great, 'm totally fuckin tortured now
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her
So one night walk into the club, and no Elois
Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos
So  asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady  tonight
"  Well apparently Lady  was married to this real piece of dog shit mean a real animal
And apparently he would so things to her
Do things
What would he do
You mean like beat her up
Nobody knows for sure what he did
We just know he did something
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool
And waits for the next time this bag of shit gets drunk
So one night the guy gets drunk and passes out on the couch
So while the guy's inebriated, she strips him naked
Then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly
The car reacts to how horrible that would be
'm dead fuckin serious
She put some on his dick and some on his belly, then stuck 'em together
The paramedics had to come and cut it loose
The car reacts badly
Jesus Christ
You can do some crazy things with it
don't know what he did to her, but she got even
Was he all pissed off
How would you feel if you had to do a handstand every time you took a piss
The car laughs
42
- Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse
The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside
43
- The four men enter the building
At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are Mr
Blonde, Mr
Brown, Mr
Blue and Joe Cabot
We shoot this from , looking down on the men
(to everybody) So they're talkin about how they get their wives off, and the French guys says: (in a bad French accent) "All  gotta do is take my pinky and tickle my Fifi's little oo la la  and she rises a foot off the bed
" Back to Joe
So the dago says: (in a good Brooklyn accent) "That's nothin
When  take the tip of my tongue and wiggle it against my Mary Louise's little fun pimple, she rises two feet off da bed
"  Then our friend from Poland says: (in dumb voice) "You guys ain't no cocksmen
When get through fuckin my Sophie, wipe my dick on the curtains and you know what
She hits the roof
" Joe laughs like a crazy man
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
We hear a lot of laughing
Ain't that a masterpiece
Stupid fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on the drapes
Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals
You're here, great
Joe
We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House scene together again
Some sit on folding chairs, some stand
Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table
blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to the right
We do a 360 around the men
We woulda gotten here sooner, but we got backed up around La Brea and Pico
No hurry
(to the boys) All right, let's get to know one another
With the exception of Eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases
Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself
That includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in St
Petersburg you might've robbed
You guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done
Only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do
This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself
And that's the way  like it
Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that  expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with
You don't know any names
You know my name, you know Eddie's name
That don't care about
You gotta prove it
ain't worried
Besides, this way you gotta trust me like that
set this up and picked the men  wanted for it
None of you came to me, approached all of you
know you
know your work,  know your reputation
know you as men
Except for this guy
Joe points a finger at Freddy
Freddy shits a brick
But he's
If he wasn't , he wouldn't be here
Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody
But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if  even think hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name
(Joe searches for the right words) you won't want to be you
Okay, quickly
(pointing at the men as he gives them a name) Mr
Brown, Mr
White, Mr
Blonde, Mr
Blue, Mr
Orange, and Mr
Pink
Why am  Mr
Pink
Cause you're a faggot
Everybody laughs
Why can't we pick out our own colors
tried that once, it don't work
You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr
Black
Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down
So forget it, pick
Be thankful you're not Mr
Yellow
Yeah, but Mr
Brown
That's too close to Mr
Shit
Everybody laughs
Yeah, Mr
Pink sounds like Mr
Pussy
Tell you what, let me be Mr
Purple
That sounds good to me, 'm Mr
Purple
You're not Mr
Purple, somebody from another job's Mr
Purple
You're Mr
Pink
Who cares what your name is
Who cares if you're Mr
Pink, Mr
Purple, Mr
Pussy, Mr
Piss
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr
White
You gotta cool-sounding name
So tell me, Mr
White, if you think "Mr
Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade
Nobody's trading with anybody
Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin city counsel meeting
Listen up Mr
Pink
We got two ways here, my way or the highway
And you can go down either of 'em
So what's it gonna be, Mr
Pink
Jesus Christ, Joe
Fuckin forget it
This is beneath me
'm Mr
Pink, let's move on
leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the layout of the jewelry store on it
() Okay fellas, let's get into this
: 44
- Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty little league baseball field
Okay, we're gonna station men across the street from Karina's Fine Jewelry
But their orders will be not to move in unless the robbery gets out of control
You gotta make sure they don't have to move in
You're inside to make sure that everything goes according to Hoyle
We have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous
They got complete visibility of the exterior
So as soon as Joe Cabot shows up, we'll see it
What's your visibility of the interior
We can't see shit on the inside
And we can't risk gettin any closer for fear they'll spot us
This is bullshit, Jim
get all the fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety
What's the matter, Newendyke
Job too tough for ya
No one lied to you
You always knew we'd hang back until Joe Cabot showed up
Oh this is great
You ain't giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever
But you are giving me an attitude
Since when does an undercover cop have protection
Freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don't start screamin blind man now
understand you're nervous
wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn't
We have to make do with the cards we're dealt
didn't say  wasn't gonna do it
'm just remarking on how shitty the situation is
don't mean to be harsh with ya, but 've found tough love works best in these situations
We have to get Joe Cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot
We don't care about these other bastards
We're willing to offer them good deals to testify against Cabot
Isn't this risk unorthodox
What
Letting them go ahead with the robbery
The whole idea behind this operation is to catch Joe Cabot red-handed
We bust these hired hands, we ain't accomplished shit
Letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs are very clean
We got people surrounding the perimeter
We got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings
We could replace the employees with cops, but we'd run the risk of tipping 'em off
That's out
They know the faces of who works what shift
These guys are professionals
We're professionals
It's a risk, but  think it's a calculated risk
45
'   - We see   of the outside of the jewelry store
coming and going
waiting on customers through the windows
While we look at this we  over the soundtrack Mr
White and Freddy talking
() Let's go over it
Where are you
() stand outside and guard the door
don't let anybody come in or go out
() Mr
Brown
() Mr
Brown stays in the car
He's parked across the street till give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store
() Mr
Blonde and Mr
Blue
() Crowd control
They handle customers and employees in the display area
46
'  () - Mr
White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street from the jewelry store, staking it out
Myself and Mr
Pink
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds
We're there for those stones, period
Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off
We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer
What if the manager won't give up the diamonds
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass
They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever
If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in
Drops 'em right to the floor
Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose
Freaks everybody out
Nobody says fuckin shit after that
You might get some bitch talk shit to ya
But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next
Watch her shut the fuck up
Now if it's a manager, that's a different story
The managers know better than to fuck around
So if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two
If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers
The little one
Then you tell 'im his thumb's next
After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear
'm hungry, let's get a taco
: 47
- It's the moment of the robbery
The alley is empty
In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose
Guns , people  and , sirens , glass
car whips around the corner, into the alley
The doors  open, Freddy and Mr
White hop out
Freddy opens the driver's side door
bloody Mr
Brown  out
(screaming) My eyes
My eyes
'm blind, 'm fucking blind
You're not blind, there's just blood in your eyes
Mr
White loads his two
45 automatics
He  to the end of the alley just as a police car comes into
both
45's, Mr
White massacres everyone in the patrol car
Freddy, holding the dying Mr
Brown, looks on at Mr
White's ambush in shock
Mr
Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes
Mr
Orange
You're Mr
Orange, aren't you
By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr
Brown is dead
Mr
White  up to Freddy
Is he dead
Freddy doesn't answer, he can't
Did he did or not
Freddy, scared
'm sorry
What
Snap out of it
Mr
White  Freddy by the coat and  him along as he
They  the alley and  down a street
car with a   comes up on the two men
Mr
White  in her path, stopping the car
He points his jun at her
Get us outta here
Mr
White climbs into the backseat
Freddy starts to climb in
The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat
The bitch's got a gun
She  Freddy in the stomach
On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and  her in the face
as he  to the ground he realizes what's happened to him and what he's done
Mr White  the dead female driver out of the car
He Freddy in the backseat and  away
48
() - Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr
White in the getaway car
Except this time, we never leave Freddy
() Just hold on buddy boy
'm sorry
can't believe she killed me
: 49
'  () - Mr
Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the passenger seat going through the satchel with the diamonds
Mr
White is in the backseat
The car is back to the garage
(looking through the case) You know, all things considered, this was pretty successful
don't believe you just said that
No, it was messy as hell, but do you realize how much you got away with
There's over two million dollars worth of diamonds here
love this guy
Hey, what's done is done
We can all sit around and have a big cry about it or we can deal with the situation at hand
The situation as hand isn't that fuckin satchel
You and Joe have a responsibility to your men
Hey, it's the best  could do
The man is fucking dying
And 'm telling you, Bonnie'll take care of him
He needs a doctor, not a fuckin nurse
Ask me how many doctors  called
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask me how many doctors  called
Obviously not enough
Fuck you
You gotta little black book, then whip is out
If not, listen how it is
called three doctors and couldn't get through to shit
Now, time being a factor,  called Bonnie
Sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse
Told her a bullshit story, upside:  she said bring him to her apartment
If he dies 'm holding you personally responsible
Fuck you buddy boy
Okay, you wanna play that way
am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation
don't think she'll call the cops, but  don't know for sure
But me being too nice- a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk it
But no fuckin more
(he grabs his portable phone) 'm callin Bonnie back and tellin her to forget it
You take care of your friend, you know so much about it
Goddamnit, will you guys grow up
don't need to grow up, my friend
am a grown up
'm being responsible, 'm taking care of business
Cut the shit
don't think you called anybody except some cooze you once fucked, who happens to wear orthopedic shoes
And don't think that's good enough care for a gut-shot man
Yeah, well  don't give a flying fuck what you think
(to Mr
White) Look, he's not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him
She's gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor
Nobody's forgotten about doctors
Joe'll get one in a snap
This is something we're doing in the meantime
think both of you are actin like a couple of assholes
Yeah, right
arrange a nurse, leave myself wide open, and 'm an asshole
50
- on the door
Nice Guy Eddie, Mr
White and Mr
Pink walk through it
They stop in their tracks
We see what they see
Mr
Blonde, lying on the ground, shot full of holes
The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody mess, Mr
Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound
Eddie, Mr
White and Mr
Pink walk into the shot
What the fuck happened here
Eddie runs over to his friend Mr
Blonde/Toothpick Vic
(to Mr
Orange) What happened
(very weakly) Blonde went crazy
He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
(yelling) Who cares what he was gonna do to this fuckin pig
Eddie whips out his gun and  the cop
The cop and the chair tip over
Eddie stands over him and  him once more
(to Mr
Orange) You were saying he went crazy
Something like that
Worse or better
Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn
He was gonna kill the cop and me
And when you guys walked through the door, he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds
(to Eddie) Uhuh, uhuh, what's  tell ya
That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho
(to Eddie) You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him
He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up
don't buy it
It doesn't make sense
It makes perfect fuckin sense to me
Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did
Mr
Pink walks over to the cop's body
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off
(to Mr
Orange) Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind
According to you, Mr
Blonde was gonna kill you
Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram
That's your story
'm correct about that, right
Eddie, you can believe me or not believe me, but it's the truth swear on my mother's eternal soul that's what happened
The  mover into a
of Nice Guy Eddie
There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr
Orange has said
Finally: You're a fuckin liar
Now why don't you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened
() He told you what really happened
You just can't deal with it
() Okay, you're right, 'm lying
Even though 'm fuckin dyin 'm not above pullin a fast one
Get rid of Blonde, we share his split - no, scratch that,  shot him 'cause  didn't like his hair style
didn't like his shoes either
If it has just been his hair, 'd've maybe, maybe  said, let him live
But hair and footwear together, he's a goner
The man you killed was just released from prison
He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items
He could've walked away
All he had to do was say my dad's name
But instead he shut his mouth and did his time
He did four years for us, and he did 'em like a man
And we were very grateful
So, Mr
Orange, you're tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you're telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we're making good on our commitment to him, he's just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off
Silence
Mr
Orange, why don't you tell me what really happened
() Why
It'll just be more bullshit
Eddie steps out of his
and we see Joe Cabot standing in the warehouse doorway
He walks into the room
(pointing to Mr
Orange) This man set us up
does a 360 around the men
Daddy, 'm sorry,  don't know what's happening
That's okay, Eddie,  do
(to Joe) What the fuck are you talking about
(pointing to Mr
Orange) That piece of shit
Workin with the cops
What
said this lump of shit is workin with the
' Looking up from the floor at everybody
Joe looks down at Mr
Orange
Aren't you
() don't have the slightest fuckin idea what you're talkin about
(very calmly to Joe) Joe,  don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong
Like hell  am
(very calmly) Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake
He's a good kid understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin pissed
We're all real emotional
But you're barking up the wrong tree
know this man, and he wouldn't do that
You don't know jack shit
do
This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr
Brown and Mr
Blue killed
Mr
Blue's dead
Dead as Dillinger
The motherfucker killed Vic
How do you know all this
He was the only one  wasn't a hundred percent on
should have my fucking head examined for goin forward when  wasn't a hundred percent
But he seemed like a good kid, and  was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up
(screaming) That's your proof
You don't need proof when you got instinct
ignored it before, but not no more
He  out a revolver and aims it at Mr
Orange
Mr
White brings his
45 up at Joe
Eddie and Mr
Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms
Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr
White
Have you lost your fucking mind
Put your gun down
Mr
Pink fades into the
, wanting no part of this
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake  can't let you make
Stop pointing your fuckin gun at daddy
Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr
Orange
Don't worry, Eddie
Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot
We like each other too much
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next
Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next
We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff
Mr
Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right
Joe pointing down on Mr
Orange
Not taking his eyes off him
Mr
White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to start firing any minute
Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr
White
Mr
Pink walking backwards away from the action
Nobody says nothing
of guys ready for violence
Mr
Pink in the
'mon, guys, nobody wants this
We're supposed to me fuckin professionals
Joe raises his head to Mr
White
Larry, 'm gonna kill him
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this
Larry, 'm askin you to trust me on this
Don't ask me that
'm not askin, 'm betting
Joe's eyes go back to Mr
Orange
Daddy, don't
Joe  three times,  Mr
Orange with every one
Mr
White  Joe twice in the face
Joe brings his hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground
Eddie  at Mr
White,  him three times in the chest
Mr
White brings his gun around on Eddie and  him
The two men  to their knees,  at each other
Eddie , dead
Joe's dead
Mr
Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest heaving
The only  we hear is his loud breathing
Mr
White is  full of holes, but still on his knees, not moving
Mr
Pink is standing motionless
Finally he grabs the satchel of diamonds and  out the door
We hear outside a
Then the  of a yells out: () Freeze
Get out of the car and lie face down on the ground
() Don't shoot
We now hear , the  of more   , to the warehouse
While all this noise is going on, Mr
White tries to stand but
He somehow makes it to where Mr
Orange lies
He lifts Mr
Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and stroking his brow
(with much effort) Sorry, kid
Looks like we're gonna do a little time
Mr
Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an effort: 'm a cop
Mr
White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's brow
'm sorry, 'm so sorry
Mr
White lifts his
45 and places the barrel between Mr
Orange's eyes
The   into an
of Mr White
The  of outside  inside
We don't see anything, but we  a bunch of shotguns
() Freeze, motherfucker
Drop your fucking gun
Mr White looks up at them, smiles,  the trigger
We hear a  of
Mr
White is  out of frame, leaving it empty
