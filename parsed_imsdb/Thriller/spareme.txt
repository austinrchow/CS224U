Alfie pours himself a cup of coffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half & half
Because his hands are shaking so much, the cream goes everywhere but into the coffee

Good luck tonight Tina
Tina opens a door and goes down some stairs
You guys got something going on downstairs
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community
Basement bingo
Breeze sniggers into his hand (smirks) Yeah, basement bingo
Lemme see your ball
Breeze grabs Theo's bag
Let go of my bag
Sid sidles around behind Theo who tries to keep him in sight
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball
You afraid we're gonna steal it
Breeze unzips the bag and pulls the ball out
Theo's temper is rising, he breathes deeply
He is obviously making a Herculean effort to keep himself in check
said, let go of my bag

Sid howls in agony
Aagh
Stop
Those are my bowling fingers
Tell your little pal to let go
Breeze, give him his ball back
Breeze, astonished, drops Theo's ball into the bag
Sid cringes in front of Theo
Where can  find Buzz Fazeli
Whoa, cool your maples
Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end

Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69

Fazeli in please
Who wants to know

Oh sure
Let everyone in
From now on leave the door wide open
Let the parade begin
Clam it
Millie is silent
Buzz gets up and approaches Zeus
Hey, rat

Zeus growls at Buzz as he comes nearer, then clamps onto his sleeve and hangs from his arm, growling ferociously
In one smooth motion, Buzz flings the rabid poodle through an open window and into the night

She heads outside

Buzz puts out his hand
Theo shakes it
Buzz Fazeli
Theo
know your face, you're an up-and-comer
You bowl on the tour
'm not on the tour this year
(nods understandingly) Need some advice, huh
Well, Mr
Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says 'm a thorn in their side
(dismissive wave) Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies

Why'd they suspend you

() It wasn't really my fault
In the far background the hollow booming  of a judge delivers sentence
() The American Bowling Congress hereby suspends Theo Maynard Skinner from all professional bowling activities within the jurisdiction of the American Bowling Congress and its international co- signers
The ball mashes into the smirking mans head, causing it to snap forward
The judge's gavel  and the crowd

got suspended when  was young, too was pretty cocky in my day
They suspended me for 100 years

was hoping you could help me Mr
Fazeli
(uneasy) What do you think  can do
(sweating slightly) need a sponsor to get my sanction card back
Where  come from, you're the king
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king

It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress

You like orange whips
've never had orange whips, 'm from Akron

He's the guy Buzz
He's not the guy, Millie
Just whip the whips
looked in his car
He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers
He's only a fan, Millie
'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz
You're doing something dangerous in that alley
Millie,  know what 'm doing
We should leave this town
can't take this anymore
'm not gonna let him kill you in my house
20
' ,  			 20 Buzz rejoins Theo in the living room
Remember the finals in Akron in '59
You had a seven-ten split in the final frame
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it
The toughest shot on the last frame
That game was before you was born
My mom was there
She told me about it
The 'Fazeli Split

Her hands are trembling
22
' ,  			 22 Millie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding two orange whips; one thick and deadly, the other thin and safe
There is laughter coming from both men
And the irony is, thirty years later, that prick is bowling in the seniors on all over the world, and look at me
Ah well
The docs made me stop, on account of my ticker
(taps his chest) don't really miss it, but then
(chokes up) miss it
He spies Millie approaching with the tray
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods
Thanks sweetie
Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip
Theo takes the other glass
Thanks
Zeus is on the sofa,  and tugging at Theo's bowling bag
The bag rips apart and the ball hits the floor
Theo brings the drink to his lips
The ball rolls across the room
The ball rolls into Buzz's feet
This your lucky bullet
Buzz picks it up and reads the writing on the ball
He snaps a look into the kitchen, seeing the empty Drano and laxative cartons
Buzz slams the drink away from Theo's lips
The drink explodes across the room
Buzz is up on his feet
(with intensity) Where'd you get this ball
(stunned - looks at the mess on the floor, then at Buzz) It's mine
Who gave it to you
Grace Skinner
(astonished) Grace Skinner
Who's Grace Skinner to you
She's my mom
Theo stands and takes the ball from Buzz's hands
Buzz is in shock, staring at Theo
(regaining his voice) Who are you
Who sent you here
'm your son
You're a hard father to find
Son
(to Millie) Millie, please
(to Theo) don't have a son
think you better leave now young man
Buzz gestures towards the front door
(calmly) Grace Skinner Fazeli, you must remember her
Buzz takes Theo by the elbow to eject him from the house
don't know no Grace Skinner
(pulls his arm away) You knew her
You married her in 1963
Married
Buzz grabs a large bowling trophy and waves it at Theo
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are
You got no right to be here
Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz
got a right
You're my father
ain't nobody's father
Theo hurls the trophy at Buzz
He ducks and the trophy sails into a large glass trophy case
Broken glass and trophies fly everywhere
(noticing Zeus) Zeus is laid out cold near the spilled orange whip on the living room floor
Millie hunches over her comatose poodle
My poor baby
(to Theo) You see what you did

Theo takes the ball and exits the house

Find your bowler
Yeah, but it didn't go so good
He wasn't the man  thought he'd be
Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee
My father used to say to me "Never
" no, hmmm
"Always
" No, no
(puzzles) Ah
Love and hate are blood relations
Maybe  should have left the ball in the car

Theo walks up
He's not here
'm sorry about Zeus, Millie
(points to grave) This is a sign
Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me
don't know if you're the guy or what, but 'm not letting it happen
'm leaving him first
couldn't kill Buzz
need his help
Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself
He's my father, Millie
He's no father to you
Theo lifts a box full of new bowling pins into the trunk
Careful with that one
He won't tell me anything, but  know there's something strange going on over at the lanes
If you ask me, 'd say the old fart wants to die
Where can  find him
(looks at her watch) The Peter Pan
Millie gets into the car
You tell Buzz  went to my sister's in Ronkonkoma
Oh, 'm sorry about trying to kill you last night, Theo

Cup of joe Mr
Fazeli
Yeah, and make it extra muddy,  didn't sleep a zee last night

You don't need coffee, Mr
Fazeli; you need a vacation

You know what a mixer ball is
It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over
Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie
She thinks someone's trying to kill you
couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me
Sheila comes over to take their orders
'll have my usual please, Sheila
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues
You haven't introduced me to your fan
Sheila, meet

(uncomfortably) Theo
Theo
This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter

Theo's bowled on the tour
Oh, a professional man
What'll you have
What's your specialty
Whips
orange whips
Then 'll have the number four with one of your finest whips
How do you want it
(their eyes meet) The eggs
(discomfited at the blatant double entendre) Uh
over easy
Coming right up
Sheila smiles and walks away
Theo watches her slink behind the counter
Watch out for that one
She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince
And, believe me, she's (more) kissed a lotta tadpoles
(looking Theo in the eye) Listen,  been thinking about your problem
'm not the guy to sponsor you
It would be unethical
But, there is something  could do for you
(leans in, secretively) Putt-putt golf
Putt-putt golf
Buzz pulls a golf ball from his pocket, flashes it and slips it back
It's the next level, the next dimension
(deep conviction) the small ball
(in Buzz's spell) The small ball
It's gonna be bigger than big
Think Europe
Think Asia
They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan
(snapping out of it) Not for me
Miniature golf's for pansies
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people
Sheila steps over to the booth with their food
The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball
Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner
(pondering the thought) Maybe  could bowl in Japan
Buzz stands up abruptly

The door opens with a
Three whips
To go
When you get a chance
Sid and Breeze walk over to Theo's booth and slide in
Sid's middle fingers are taped to an aluminum splint

Hey, you still here
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him
don't know no Buzz Fazeli
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger
The Faz's favorite lunch
Sid reaches for the plate
Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid
Get away from that burger
Sorry Faz, we didn't know you was here
Buzz, Mr
Kastle wants to talk to you
(to Theo and Buzz) Are you guys bruddas
The booth party is silent for a moment
Theo
No, we ain't brothers
You know why we call him Breeze
Sid puts a hand near Breezes left ear and blows into Breeze's right ear
He makes fluttering motions with his hand as if wind was hitting it
Breeze's face breaks into a smile as he pushes Sid away
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles
'm serious
You guys are related, right
He's my dad
Buzz flashes a warning glare to Theo
Sid grabs some of Buzz's french fries
(slapping his hand) Get your own
See that, toldja Sid
knew  seen a resemblance
Why don't you clowns get your whips and get lost
Look, Faz, Mr
Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you
(gazing artfully upwards and rubbing his chin) What was that he said
remember, Sid
Mr
Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till
(exasperated) Pinhead
Don't just blurt it right out
Sheila comes over and  down the three whips-to-go
(to Sheila) Your pop said to put these on his tab
Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door
So Buzz, let's skedaddle
Mr
Kastle is waiting
As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs
'm coming with you
Sid shies away from Theo, protecting his hand
Easy
got business to do, Theo
'll come back and haunt you later
(drops a twenty on the table, pats Theo's cheek) Don't say  never gave you nothing
Buzz goes outside with a sleazeball on either side
Sheila takes the twenty dollar bill
Theo grabs his jacket and makes for the door
(to Sheila) Do those two work for your dad or mine
Mine, and they never tip
The sleazeballs hustle Buzz into the front seat of their car and patch out
Do you know where they're taking him
Yeah, Babylon
Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad
Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad

What's on your mind, Miles
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz
Seven years
Kastle pokes a straw into the whip and takes a long drag
This scam we got going here was your (more) brainstorm, Buzz
admit,  thought it was a rotten idea, but  put up the scratch
(pulls a smile) And now we got a beautiful thing
It's a beautiful thing
beautiful thing
And you know why Buzz
You know what we got
Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt
We got balance
Kastle flicks the little wire man
It bobs and sways
partnership is a very delicate balance
But let's say something tips the scales, maybe one partner takes more than his share, then
Kastle tips the wire man off his perch
The little motor squeals pathetically
oops
We got no more balance
Buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat
And look at that; both partners go down together
Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel
He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz
Simple math, Buzz

Miles, 've always been on the square with you
'm sure you have Buzz
Wish me luck
Buzz jogs out into a spotlight

Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl
It's not an "Alley"
hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common
prefer "Bowling Center"
What's this guy here for, anyway
Maybe he's here to pay his last respects
Someone gonna get kacked, boss
If  find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you
Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other
hired you rent-a-thugs to keep tabs on the Faz
want you all over him like a tent
Find out how that little weasel's ripping me off
Buzz Fazeli's gonna blow the lid off dwarf bowling
41     ,  & 				  41 The two of them sit together behind the lanes
came here to have a word with your dad
What do you want with my dad
Business
Won't your father help you with that
(shakes his head) Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town
My Dad is slime
Kastle walks over
Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand
So you're Buzz's boy
've been expecting you
You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner
You know who  am
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it
You don't mind if have a word with Theo, do you bunny
Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away
heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress
(waves at a mother/daughter couple) Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila
Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers
You might say 'm at the top of their shit list
Maybe  can help you
(calling to a young bowler) Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey
(to Theo) 've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit
You got Fazeli blood running through you
Your pop was a genuine talent in his day
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr
Kastle
(dismissive gesture) It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance
(to a seated mother) How's Gloria's thumb
() The blister's worse than last week
No pain, no gain
Keep trying the ice
Chin up, sweetie
(turning to Theo) This place is a bowling oasis
It's very
clean
They pause and Kastle waves to some bowlers
() Hello, Mr
Kastle
Hello, Violet
How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing
() 132, 154
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr
Skinner here
What do you think, Theo
Think Carmelita's got the stuff
That's some pinfall
Almost a 133 average
Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ
(to Carmelita) Now go take out your "big four", darling
(to Theo) Come on, we're making her nervous
They continue walking
get them while they're young
Builds loyalty
() She hit it, Mr
Kastle
(waving over his shoulder) Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment
And the dwarf bowling
They stop, and Kastle pulls Theo over to an enormous aquarium near the lounge
(making sweeping gesture) Think of this business like a big aquarium
You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top
(more) Profits down there, philanthropy up here
(looks at Theo) Besides, it beats the pants off bingo
Nice set-up
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves
What if he wants to get out
(chuckles) He's earned an early retirement
(sprays his mouth with Binaca) But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history
Lets talk about your future
(puts his arm around Theo) wanna show you something
42
' 				 42 Kastle and Theo stand in front of the huge bank of video screens
Rac
--
Renovate, Automate, Computerize
That, my boy, is the future
One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling
Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin
Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike
The little girl jumps with joy
What ever happened to just bowling
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there
You gotta adapt to survive
like the sport the way it is
guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling
You got ambition like a
like a
blowtorch
You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way -
-  shish kebabs
(puts his arm around Theo) Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good
(pauses for effect) think  could help you, Theo
(he's been waiting for this) How Mr
Kastle
You need a sponsor;  have influence could sponsor you
Why would you help me
like you, Theo
You bowl with soul
Kastle turns to his video screens
But, now that you mention it, you could afford me one minor dispensation
Theo follows his gaze to the screen
While you're in town,  need you to keep an eye on my daughter for a couple of days
Her big brother broke out of the mental hospital
Theo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the office dim, and Kastle seems to recede into the far distance
43     '  - 				     43 As running  are heard, the camera whizzes down a darkened alley towards the pins

He has a thing about - (wails) 45
' 				 45 Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Kastle points to her image on the  screen
Sheila turns and looks up at the video camera
Theo and Sheila's eyes seem to meet
Theo freezes for a moment
could do that
As the two men shake hands, Sheila "flips the bird" to the camera
One thing, (pointing to Theo's mid- section) keep the meat in the freezer
: 46
-  			   46 Theo and Sheila blast along the dark roadway on her Vespa, Theo sitting behind Sheila
(shouting above the engine) This is a vicious cycle
think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do
Isn't this technically a scooter
When 'm on my bike  feel like a wild person
(she looks sideways at Theo) Better than any sex 've ever had
Kinda tough on the butt
Everything has it's drawbacks
Where did your brother escape from
The mental hospital
What does he do
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while
Whoa
It's a vicious cycle
: 47
47 Sheila and Theo motor across an empty beach parking field towards a lone station wagon
Swing-a-delic  drifts from the parked vehicle
47
47 Sheila pulls up beside the wagon
She leads Theo towards a group of partying people at the tailgate of the car; three white women, three white men and Luna
Luna pulls a rubber hookah hose out of his mouth and offers it to Theo
Hookah
No thanks,  don't hookah
Theo, you ever do the 'Swing'
Theo shakes his head
These guys all work at the alley, too
This is John, Susan, Jon, Suzanne, Jonathan, and Sue
Everyone welcomes Theo and Sheila
(screams) Dance Break
Luna throws himself into a wild body-whip as the music massively
Luna and Sheila do a wild jitterbug-derived Swing-a-Delic dance surrounded by weaving white folk
One of the guys is on crutches, has a neck brace, a chest cast, and one arm in a truss
He stands by the barbecue and flips burgers with his one free hand
Theo walks over to him
Hey man, howyadoin'
He wiggles his hand out of the end of his cast
Theo shakes his fingers
Don't tell me, John
Cool
Theo
Howzitgoin
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot
Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around
Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning
How's that
was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me
swear man, the guy thought was a piata
If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped
He woulda killed me
Fuckin' guy man, just snapped
How do you like your burger
(meets eyes with Sheila) Uh
over easy
(throws a blackened burger on Theo's styrofoam plate) 'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose
Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes
Luna comes over to Theo and grabs him
They start to dance
Sheila wants me to show you a few steps before you two swing-a-delic
(uneasily) So, you're the pinman around here
And one, and two, and yes,  am
But no one gets them working like Junior used to
and two, and one
- they call him The 'Quasimodo of the lanes
' He's the best pinman there is
and one and two
People used to say he got the machines working so well 'cause he lubricated them with blood
and two, and one
but people just love saying things about Junior
Mind if  cut in
No, not at all
Theo pulls out his resin bag, powders up his hands, and goes for Sheila
Theo and Sheila get low and nasty on the tarmac
Sheila turns and does the freak to Theo, rubbing her rear end into his crotch
As Theo and Sheila dance over near John he makes a throat slitting gesture across his neck
Theo's hands leave white prints on Sheila's butt
The Swing-a-delic funks so hard it causes spontaneous audience dance riots and structural damage in theaters across the country
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers
Can  ask you something personal
'd rather you didn't
Do you have a girlfriend
Not while 'm in training
Do you have a boyfriend
(surprised) No
Do You
No
Not at the present
- Sheila and Theo toast marshmallows over the barbecue as the rest of the party dances in the background
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates
Nobody in this town really understands Junior
When  went to family sessions for him  realized he was the sanest one in the family
Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants
Unfortunately what he wants is you
So, what about you
Do  want you
We'll get into that later

' 				 48 Alone, Kastle stares at the bank of video monitors and runs a battery powered fuzzball remover around his collar
The monitors are deserted
Miles absently pans a camera over and then sits bolt upright
On the screen he can see Buzz Fazeli, in a room at Babylon Lanes, surrounded by large piles of cash, stuffing rolls of bills into hollow bowling pins
(with rising anger) Why that filthy, slimey, double-crossing, misbegotten, two-faced, mangy, son-of-a- bitch bastard
The motor in the fuzz ball remover  as Miles squeezes it to death
It shatters in his hands

"Devil With The Blue Dress" by Shorty Long plays on the stereo
The rest of the party throws marshmallows at each other in the distance
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl
don't know
It's all  ever wanted to do
wanted to be a motocross champion
My folks didn't really care what  did
Then Junior blew a fuse and  became their last hope
Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats,  got bowling never understood how anyone could take it so seriously
hope 'm not insulting you
No, 'm fascinated
Why were you suspended
used to be kind of wild
They used to call me the bad boy of bowling
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated
Well, that was plan
What's plan
Plan  is your dad
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you
He said he'd sponsor me
Ha
And what do you have to do for him
Nothing
Oh really
Nothing
My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days
What
Be my body guard
(she laughs) Here's my body, Theo
Guard it
For my dad's sake
For your career
Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt
Sheila, please
Come on Theo, what about plan
(looking worried) What's plan
Plan
(opens her shirt, showing off her brassiere) is me
Sheila takes Theo's nervous hands and places them inside her shirt
(torn) Look, Sheila,  really like you but
Sheila rolls on top of him, and plants a hickey on his neck
(stopping her) Forget it, Sheila

'' 				 50 Kastle hurries through the darkened bowling alley
He stops short as a warning alarm begins to sound from somewhere deep within the building
Lane six lights up and comes to life
Kastle walks slowly forward
Junior
Is that you, Junior
Don't be afraid
Where are you
won't hurt you
Kastle stealthily sneaks along beside row upon row of silent pin reset machines shining a flashlight in front of him
Come on, Junior
Everyone's waiting for you, son
The beam of light catches Junior's face
He is crouched inside the machine at lane six
Jr
His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy
Needs lubrication
Lubrication
We're having a party for you, boy
Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love
Junior cringes away from the light
You made me hurt him
Kastle reaches into his pocket and pulls a gaudy digital wristwatch from his pocket
Look what  got for you
He holds the watch up in front of Junior
Junior looks curiously at the watch
Happy Birthday Junior
The watch begins to play an electronic version of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head
" Junior's face lights up
Ooooooohhh
Kastle begins luring Junior out of machine number six with the watch
have someone for you to play with Junior
Someone wants to play with me
have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior
Blueface
Blueface is my favorite

Sid gazes out the window
Enrico Caruso from the car stereo
Bowling used to be so pure, so
All- American
Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct
La da da dalala
(looking heatedly disturbed) hate fuckin' opera
How could you hate opera, Sid
Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin
You listen to the feelings, not the words
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera
It was a clearance
Sid seems to calm down
(wistfully) You know, Elvis bowled
No kiddin'
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport
No megalomillionaires, no (more) gambling
And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun
(sympathetically) Sure, Sid
(becoming rabid) But not no more
Now people take advantage
Bowling ain't what it used to be
There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden - (getting excited) - canker sore
(apoplectic) Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out
It makes me sick
Sid starts pressing buttons on the tape deck How do you turn this thing off
Wait
That's an aria
Sid and Breeze struggle for the cassette
The music into a warbling gurgle of an aria
Gimme that
Sid yanks the cassette out, but the tape becomes tangled in the player
He pulls at the endless yards of tape and throws the whole mess out the window

- 				 52 Theo, wearing sunglasses and dressed in a jogging suit similar to Miles Kastle's, steps out of the diner with a bag containing four orange whips
He goes over to his parked car
Buzz walks up
(in deadly serious) Theo,  want you to get out of this town
'm getting to like it here
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour
gotta survive
(shaking his head) He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life
You got a better offer
No
didn't think so
Theo takes a long drag from his orange whip
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television
(bitterly) That's right, Buzz, and you know when did it
Last match, last frame
All needed was one spare for the crown - and get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split
You never even took the shot
You couldn't do it
Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner
(repressed fury in his voice) was beaten on a shot named after my own dad
The moment passes
Theo turns and climbs into his car
He looks up at Buzz
Look, kid, gimme a break
'm an old man
(taps chest) 'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta
'm finished - dead from my ankles up
couldn't care less
Theo starts his car
You know what  think
You didn't come here to find a father
You didn't even come here for help
You just came here to take it all out on somebody
Well it ain't gonna be me
Theo pulls out of the parking lot
Buzz yells after him

, 				  53 The Kastle home is a huge nouveau riche Brady Bunch style house with a large deck jutting over the driveway
The doors are open on the spacious two car garage
Sheila has the headset of her Vespa disassembled
Theo walks up the driveway, orange whips in hand
don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo
(flicking dust off the suit) Really
kinda like it
He sits nearby
Do you talk with your mom
It's been awhile
She didn't want me looking for my dad
My mom told me not to stay in this town
So why do you stay
'm a credit card junkie
went on a binge and my dad bailed me out
Now 'm trapped in his easy payment plan
bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes
'm looking for a professional man
(he ponders the thought) may not be a pro bowler, but 'm no amateur man
Sheila moves closer to Theo
(touches his lips) How much would you charge me for the lips
More than you could afford
Come on, bargain with me
could let them go for ten
(she pulls away, slightly) You professional men drive a hard bargain
'm afraid  only have five on me
Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill
(smiles) If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him
54
, 				    54 Sheila and Theo stand on the deck
Sheila scans the road leading to the house with binoculars
What are you going to do about your brother
You're here
What about the guy he put in the body cast
The road is empty Momentary relapse
Except for that, he's been making progress
Sheila laughs
Theo nervously pulls his collar up over the hickey on his neck
Junior is like a faithful doggy
He loves his birthday so much, that every year, before we can go pick him up
Kastle's car appears, driving hell-for- leather towards the house
he breaks out of the hospital and comes home on his own
Here they come
She hands the binoculars to Theo, who immediately trains them on the road
My mom once had an affair
When my dad found out, he had Junior kill the man
The body was never found, but  think Junior took him to the alley
Theo lowers the binoculars and looks at Sheila
Then it's true, isn't it
About

Yes

Junior, lying on some folded blankets in the trunk, looks at his family with a stunned expression
He is in a straitjacket
Junior's new watch begins to  "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"

Steady boy, steady
Untied, Junior presses the  watch against his ear
His face breaks into a beatific smile

Isn't that right Junior
Kastle  the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand
The table settings jump from the shock
Junior sits impassively, his face a blank
See
No feeling
Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior
After we eat, Dad
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid
Crushed all the nerve endings
Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand
It's not so bad
When 'm alone, it feels like someone else
Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab
She leans over and whispers furiously to her father
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy 'm interested in
(whispers back, defensively) You're just like you mother
Always jealous
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything
She ran away to be with that
(spits out his words) that Motocross champion
Your turn, Theo
Why can't you bowl
Sheila and Kastle sit up
don't like to talk about it
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you
It depends
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it
Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes
Look who's talking
Leave him alone
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business
can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that
(snaps his fingers) Sheila and Kastle sit up
Junior, how 'bout a riddle
(turns to Sheila) Sheila
Knock-knock
Sheila glances nervously at Theo
(impatiently) Come on Sheila, knock-knock

Same wish as last year
Sheila blows out the candles in a hurry
It won't come true, Junior
Kastle places a gift-wrapped box in front of Junior and lifts the lid
He reaches in and pulls out a huge, intricate claw- like arm-shaped device made of plastic and metal and covered with cables
It's a bowling claw
You can bowl now, Junior
With the whole family
Junior beams at the group
(puts one arm around Junior and one on Theo) Pretty soon everybody can bowl
The two sleazeballs walk up onto the deck and over to the table
Hello Mr
Kastle
(nods to seated party) Junior, long time
thought they locked you up and threw away the warden
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock
Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring
Knock, knock
Who's
(interrupting) Don't do it Breeze
(to Junior) You ain't getting us into that
Kastle gets up
Hey, enough fun and games
We have work to do
Come on Junior
Kastle heads for his car
Junior gets up and follows
The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands
(to Theo) If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen

think Buzz is retiring soon
In fact, think he's retiring tonight
Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila
Here, Bunny
Why don't you two go and do something fun tonight, on me
Sheila is lured to the scent of the plastic like a junkie to a fix
One thing, stay away from the lanes
If Junior sees you two together, he'll swallow his tongue
She reaches for the card and Kastle snatches it away from her with a chortle
What did  say
Don't go near the bowling alley
(enunciating clearly) Bowling "Center"
Kastle hands her the card and heads into the house
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it
Nope,  couldn't care less
'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right
Why should  help that old fuck
(sarcastically) Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you
Zip
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow
(exhaling cigar smoke) Way too late
Buzz Fazeli is history
(goes to take another drag, then stops) Too late for what
She turns away
Nothing
Too late for what, Sheila
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming
You got any broken bones
No, but something's gonna blow in this town
can feel it
Are you fucking with me Sheila
Is something gonna happen to Buzz
Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable
(faltering) can't tell you, Theo
Why not
saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on
rumbles
Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders
(gently) Tell me, Sheila
What are you afraid of

You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so 'm gonna play Blue-Face with you
(he grabs Theo's throat) (hoarsely) don't want to play
Theo stretches to get a nearby ball, but just can't reach it, by millimeters
To play,  press my fingers on a throat like this
(he presses tighter on Theo's windpipe) and then the mans face would go blue and  should keep pressing
(Theo's face goes pale blue) and  did and then he stopped moving and he didn't play anymore after that
Theo bends back a finger on Junior's hand
Junior lets out a  of pain and releases Theo's neck
Theo  for air

It bounces off Junior's head like a Nerf ball and rolls down the alley
Thank you, Mr
Skinner
Thank you
Theo desperately, but fruitlessly tries to get away
As he crawls over the ball return trough, Junior puts his foot on Theo's head
can have her,you know
(looks around and whispers) She's not my real sister
(he flashes a lecherous smile) '   ball pops up at the far end of the return and rapidly towards Theo
The ball hits Theo's face with a
We "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head
" ' Being dragged down the lane
Theo comes to and looks down his body to see the empty lane
He looks up to see Junior pulling him towards the pin reset machine
The cut on Theo's forehead bleeds down the side of his face
(muttering) Lubrication
6 Junior pulls the dazed Theo into the pin-reset machine and positions him under the pins
As Junior prepares the machinery, a control cable on his claw becomes fouled
Junior begins to thrash about as he tries to disentangle himself and his malfunctioning arm
Theo rolls away as Junior's flailing releases the machine
It comes slamming down on Junior just as Theo slips out of harm's way
He gets up and staggers away from the machine
Junior's  echoes across the lanes
His twitching feet protrude from the maw of the device
Lane six goes dark
Theo limps up the lane
: 64
64 Theo drives up to the erect draw-bridge
He stops and gets out
The night is silent
(loud whisper) Sheila
Where are you
Sheila pops out of the bushes and walks towards Theo
(angry) You told Junior that we did it
It
It
Bouncy-bouncy
Fucked
He tried to squeeze my fucking head off
What did you say to him
When they reach each other, they stop
Sheila seems to weigh her answer
told him you were my boyfriend
(very pissed off) What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila
We haven't even gotten naked yet
We would have sooner or later
Oh great
He tried to kill me
You knew he would go off if he thought  fooled around with you
Did you - kill him
Theo paces up and down in front of the upright bridge
How do you get this thing down
Tell me what happened Theo
Theo backs Sheila towards the bridge control booth
(glares at Sheila) You wanted me to kill him, didn't you
(in shock) If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back
He's dead Sheila
feel sick
You should
Are you sure he's dead
didn't stop to take his pulse
Theo boosts Sheila up the ladder to the control booth
The hydraulic machinery of the bridge heaves into motion and the bridge begins to lower
Theo walks over to his car
Sheila jumps down from the bridge control booth and follows him
Where are you going
think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz
He gets into his car
Can  come with you
did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off
Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone
She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel
: 65
'  - 				    65 Theo grips the steering wheel with white knuckles
He nods off at the wheel, the roadway through his eyes wavering and distorting
He hits himself in the face in an effort to keep himself awake
66
'  - 			  66 The house is dark except for a light coming from the closed bathroom door
Theo cautiously makes his way to the door
(whispers) Buzz
You alright
is running inside
Theo twists the doorknob and opens the door with a jolt
Junior lunges out of the dark, mangled and bloody with bowling pins sticking out of his chest
Don't you
Theo  the door shut
67
'  - 				   67 Theo jerks awake
His car is parked by the Fazeli house
It is a clear, blustery day
gust of wind pulls the screen door open, then  it shut
He gets out of the car and walks unsteadily towards the house
68
' ,  			 68 Theo walks into the house
The place is completely trashed
Theo picks up a golf ball from the floor
He makes his way to the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob; then pulls back
He picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head as he reaches for the doorknob
This time, he thrusts the door open
The bathroom is empty
Relieved, he cradles the ball in his arms
Thick crimson red fluid trickles down his forearm, dripping off his elbow
Horrified, he pulls his fingers out of the ball
Blood streams out of the three finger holes
He drops the ball to the floor
He goes into the bathroom and turns on the sink faucets
' , Water runs as Theo manically washes the blood from his hands and arms
He rinses the blood from the holes of his ball and looks up to the mirror
" " is smeared in blood across his reflection
69
7-   - 			69 Theo waits through several rings
Hello
Hello, mom
Theodore
Where are you
Are you alright
found dad
He's dead, isn't he
(pauses) Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born
Mom, you know  had to do it
just did it a little too late
You sure you're  Teddy
You're not bowling are you
gotta go
Love ya mom
Theo hangs up the phone
Alfie shuffles over
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared
saw them pull a body bag out of the alley
heard he was kacked but good
They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out
(stunned) The pin machine
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six
All's  know is it's gonna be a closed coffin
My advice to you is to lay low
He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away
70
'' 				 70 Theo pulls into the parking lot
The place is cordoned off with day-glo yellow emergency tape printed with "Bowling Police - Do Not Cross"
black bowling police van, its blue light spinning, is parked in front
Bowling cops herd dwarfs and customers into the van
Mothers and daughters mill around behind the yellow tape
group of little people brandish "Right to Work" signs
Theo gets out of his car
The crowd moves in as Kastle, hands cuffed behind him, emerges from the door
There he is
Camera flashes  all over the place
Two black-jacketed bowling cops step out behind him
They are Sid and Breeze
Bowling police, step back, give him room
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back
Let him through, ladies
Ladies, please
As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball
Mr
Kastle, we know you wouldn't do anything bad
Thank-you, sweetheart
(turns to Breeze) See that you pinheads
Character witness
(with sweeping head gesture) They're all character witnesses
(he sees Theo) Thanks to Buzz Fazeli, bowling is dead in this town
He  it
The two officers hustle Kastle towards the van
Theo steps out in front of him
(between clenched teeth) You fool, we could have done great things together
Where's Junior
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next
Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's  increases
Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder
(shouting) Lock your daughters up, ladies
Junior's out there
Mothers and daughters send out a cacophony of screams and scatter for their cars
The  cops hoist Kastle into the back of the van
Sid slams the doors shut
The van screeches off, sirens wailing
Sid and Breeze walk up to Theo
Sorry about your loss
(shaking his head) should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one
You should probably hit the road
Go home
This place could get hazardous for your health
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating
Breeze looks under Theo's car
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you
Theo gets into his car and starts the engine
Sid and Breeze poke their heads in the windows
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide
You got some balls goin' after that psycho
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad
Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul
Theo patches out
Think he bought it
'd buy it
Sid chews his lip worriedly
71
'  - 				71 Theo nods off for a second and then snaps back
His eyes seem hypnotized by the lines on the road which seem to swim and undulate unnaturally
He nods again
And snaps again
72
- 			  72 Theo pulls up to the old party spot and gets out
He walks over the dunes and towards the beached station wagon
huge flame rises down the beach
woman is visible in its light, tossing objects into the fire
Theo walks towards her
, Sheila is stripping Barbie and Ken dolls and tossing them onto the pyre
Each one goes up in an exaggerated   of flames
She notices Theo when he steps into the light
Once my father walked in on me while was making Barbie and Ken do it
He freaked
was seven
He took all my dolls away from me and cut them in half
He gave the top halves back to (more) me
Then he made me watch him burn the bottom halves in the fireplace
Theo kneels down nearby and throws a Barbie onto the bonfire
It goes up with a can see Junior's face in the fire
Theo puts his hand on Sheila's hand
She looks at him
Why did you come back
When 'm with you Sheila,  don't even think about bowling
Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately
She stops him and looks around nervously
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both
killed him once, 'll just have to kill him again
You don't get two chances with Junior
At least 'll die smiling
Sheila pushes him over
He falls backwards, her on top
And you only get two chances with me
Sheila yanks her shirt over her head and tosses it away
The shirt  and burns
She pulls Theo's head up to her breasts
What's it gonna be, Theo
Barbie's breasts blister from the heat
& Theo bends Sheila backwards, down on her back
She grabs the tail of his shirt, yanks it over his head and off his body
Sheila rubs her hands up Theo's back
What's the plan, Theo
Ken back bubbles and melts
Theo lifts Sheila's back off the sand and works her jeans down her legs
Say something, Theo
Give me something doll's legs catch fire
Theo stares into Sheila's eyes
Plan
From now on it's gonna be plan
Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin
It's gonna be you, Sheila
They humpty-hump to the beat of "Scientist's" '
' We hear Theo and Sheila's stereophonic as a Barbie and a Ken doll collapse and vaporize from the blazing heat
We pan up through the flames, the  increasing in volume and intensity as they reach the you-know-what-we've-all-been- waiting-for
: 73
- 				  73 coffin moves slowly forward as a solemn  plays
The top is in the shape of a bowling alley with a miniature black bowling ball inscribed with "The Faz" at the head
The pallbearers; Theo, Breeze, Sid, Tina, and two other bowlers place the coffin on poles above the grave
rotund priest sprinkles holy water
Sheila stands next to Theo, crying
(more) Theo wears a glazed look
The priest clears his throat with a loud
(with pomp and vigor) Bowling
(pauses to reflect) Bowling is a little like faith
Every now and then, we are blessed with the ability and strength to send a full roller down
(makes bowling gesture) and scatter those babies like nobody's business
And every now and then we end up in the gutter
(pauses and gets glum) Buzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter of life
Trapped in hook alley, throwing nothing balls
But before he left us for that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled himself out of that gutter
Buzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of bowling
Now he lies at peace alongside his lane brothers here in Bowlers' Field
(makes sign of the cross) He died so that we could bowl - with dignity
Millie, decked out in mourning black, lets out a wail, steps up and throws a bouquet of flowers onto the coffin
(sniffles) forgive you Buzz
Sid leans over to Theo
(in loud whisper) The Faz sure took care a her
(points to Millie, does the cash rub with fingers) Breeze makes a nasal  as he tries to suppress a snigger
Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him
Sid and Breeze approach the coffin
Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz
See ya 'round Faz
Tina steps up to the grave with a handful of papers
These are all your perfect games
(she drops scoresheets onto the coffin) Bowl with God, Buzz
Mourners sniff and cry
The coffin starts descending into the ground
stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets
Sheila nudges Theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into the grave
Maybe you were right Buzz
Maybe  did just come here to take it out on somebody
But,  had to find my father
The muffled  of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" begins playing from inside the coffin
Theo's body jolts
He runs after Sheila who is walking towards her scooter
Buzz is alive, Sheila
The two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk towards their car
Theo grabs Sheila's jacket
Theo, Buzz is dead
didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad
He owes me
(bitterly) Back to plan
The vicious cycle all over again
Theo lets go of Sheila
've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life
She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it
Now he's the one who's locked up and 'm the one who's free
If  gotta do this alone,  might as well start now
She revs up and peals out
(yells) 74
74 As Sid and Breeze walk up to their car, Theo catches up with them
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin
Something stinks around here
Your time is up, busyboy
Who identified the body
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality
'm the next of kin
should've seen him
After we , we bury the body
Case and casket closed
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place
Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in
It's splitsville for you
Sid and Breeze back away from Theo
You faked my dad's murder
You used him
Where is he
Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car
He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand
Sid howls
Ow
Ooh
No, please
Doc said 'd be back on the planks in a week
Show him Breeze
Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket
The headline reads " : " with a photo of Buzz Fazeli
It's official, you're an orphan
Happy now, busyboy
Theo stares at the newspaper
He lets Sid's fingers drop
75
- 				   75 Sheila speeds along, her Vespa maxing out at 30 mph
From behind her we see Theo's car approaching rapidly
He pulls up beside her
(shouting and pointing frantically) What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum
Huh
Who said anything about an ultimatum
You want to find your father
Get a shovel and start digging
Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now
Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo
He moves up beside her again
You're really pissing me off
'm pissing you off
'm doing what said 'd do
What the hell are you doing
What about your word
My word is good, and it'll always be good
When did  ever give my word to you
What about plan
Fuck plan
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone
You think 'm dumping you to get back into bowling
Well who's dumping who
'm not dumping you, 'm suspending you
Sez you
Suck my dick
She speeds ahead

76 Theo  along in his car
He listens to his  over the stereo
Theo digs into his pocket and pulls out the golf ball from Buzz's house
77      					  77 The logo on the ball reads "

The white ball fills the frame

Hmmmm The camera pulls back from the ball to reveal: 78

The woman behind the counter looks like Alfie's twin
(It's actually Alfie in drag
) It's the same store as before, only with a tropical motif
Instead of bowling magazines on the rack, there's Mini- Golf Digest
examines the ball at arm's length, through her bifocals
You a mini-golfer
Nope
Paradise, huh
Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99
Theo turns to leave
Can  get you something for the road
You have orange whips
Orange who
Not from 'round here, are ya
No
'm from Akron

- 				 79 The billboard fills the frame
It reads "Paradise Putt-Putt", and underneath: " heavenly experience
"  motorized cheesy- looking smiling dwarf-angel swings a golden club
- Miniature golf obstacles are bathed in the light of the setting sun
The camera passes a huge cement centaur surrounded by astro-carpeting
() just hold it loosely with both hands
() That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you
Then grasp firmly
The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green
() Grasp firmly
Then what
() Line up where you want it
() Yeah
() Now swing it out a little to the right
() Like this
() No, no, that's too far
Try a more gentle stroke
It's all in the stroke
Go ahead, now, honey - stroke
As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman
His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it
Strokin'
Here goes nothin'
She swings a club, sending a golf ball puttering into a cup
Hole in one
You're the queen of stroke
Yippy
Theo strides towards the couple
The man under the halo is (more) Buzz
He raises the club at the approaching Theo, keeping the woman in front of him as a shield
The front of Buzz's cap reads "'m No Angel
" Get away from me
Who the hell are you
Hi Dad
Dad
You said you was single
We ain't married no more
He says that to all his wives
As she tries to wiggle away from him, the club conks Buzz on the noodle, squishing his halo
(freeing herself - to Buzz) Geez Maynard, is he telling the truth
Don't pay him any mind, sweetheart
You're a nice guy, Maynard, but if you got two wives -  ain't into no polybigamy
Buzz is silent
He takes the club out of her hand
She steps away - startled - then turns and jogs away
Buzz throws down his club in a fury
Goddam it
was just about to make a love connection
You sure got a way with women
You show up, women get away
(laughs) The whole world thinks you're underground
am underground
Buzz removes his damaged cap
It could just as easily have been me in that box
told you to get lost
You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you
Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo
What about bowling
(takes a practice swing) Bowling died for me years ago
Besides, 'm a living dead legend
'm a hero
You're a scumbag
Buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head
'm a live scumbag
Theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball
He tosses it to Buzz
Nice knowing you, dad
Theo turns and walks towards his car
Buzz pauses and walks after him
So, eh, you never saw me
Right
never saw you
Thanks, kid
(pause) Where are you goin' now
'm goin' straight
No more short cuts
Theo gets into the car
Buzz leans in the open window
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me
(hands Theo his card) Just make sure nobody's following you
Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze
didn't mean that stuff  said
was trying to keep you out of this muddle
'm glad  didn't have my tubes tied
Oh, and by the way,  made a call for you before  - uh - retired
Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen
(hands the card back) You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call
(taps the card) Tell him your Maynard's boy
He's expecting you, and he owes me
He'll getcha back in like Flynn
(pats Theo's cheek) Don't say  never gave you nothing
(cracks a half smile) See ya 'round Maynard
Buzz backs away from the car as Theo peels out in reverse
Buzz stands and watches as Theo pulls away

As he walks towards the back of the alley, several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe
Theo
Howya doin'
Theo walks on
Others greet the conquering hero
Theo
Hey, Theo's back
Hello there, stranger
(still crying) Waaaaaaaaaaah
At the far end, we see Sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging suit, bowling alone on her lane
Bowlers stop and hold their balls at their sides

Very professional

She pulls out a hundred dollar bill

You'll owe me
