Written by Mort Briskin & David Klass Transcribed by IMSDb Inspired by a true story
We home in on a boat coming in to shore
Off walks a man, he is carrying a backpack and wearing shades
He walks through a town, passing various stores and the general bustle of the people there
He notices a baby in a pram left out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing what looks like a drug deal
Chris reads a closure notice on the door
police car rolls up
How ya doin'
Ok
When'd the mill close
Ahh 3 years this August
If ya lookin for work you might wanna try Aberdeen, that's the closest mill work you're gonna find around here
That's too bad
Nah just simple economics
'know we have a really nice casino here, the wild cherry
You wanna make some money maybe you wanna go on down there and try your luck at the blackjack tables
Nah  don't think so
Thanks
Chris turns around and the sheriff notices his name on a bag
You're Chris Vaughn
The sheriff chuckles and steps out of the car
Well hell,  know all about you Chris
know your folks, 'm sheriff Stan Watkins
They shake hands
How ya doin
Ralston get outta the car, you're lookin at a real soldier here pay some respect
Welcome home soldier
Thanks
Here Chris, (opens the back door) We'll give ya a ride up to your folks
Nah 'm fine thank you
insist
'll walk
Hey it's my pleasure
It's ok
won't take no for an answer (jokingly reaches for his gun)
Get in the car
Chris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles
Did  scare ya with that one
Lil bit
Ya
Let's go
You were gone a while huh
8 years
Harstad was sheriff back then
Harstad, yeah
Sad story
About 5 months back he fell asleep at the wheel and uhhh
hit a tree
Good man, good man and a good sheriff
Thanks for the ride
No problem, and uh Chris (hands him a piece of paper)
It's election month
'm your man
Chris takes the paper and smiles
He walks up the lane toward the house, a simple white building clad in wood
lady dressed in a police uniform comes out
Can  help you
Chris laughs
Lil' brother
You come over here and gimme a hug
They laugh together
You look great
What is this
Hey,  couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform
Hey ma
Chris is here
What's with the tent
(points to a tent set up on the lawn)
Oh, that's for Pete
Look at you
How ya doin
Chris hugs his mother, Connie
man slowly emerges from the front door
How long do we have ya for
For good
'm home
Really
You're not kiddin
No
They hug again
Hey dad
Welcome back
The family are eating takeaway
wish you would have told me you were coming  would've cooked
This is great
So what are you gonna do now that you're home
Well  was planning on working at the mill, your letters never mentioned that it was closed
We didn't wanna bother you with our problems when your father got laid off
got my business, you saw the furniture outside
substitute at the elementary school, Michelle pitches in
We try to keep things simple
kid walks in
Pete
This is your Uncle Chris
Hey Pete
Sit down, say hello
Last time he saw you you were barely walking
And now 'm camping
said you could sleep on the couch
It was Chris' room first
Your tent's gonna take on water
could show ya how to rig it
Doesn't look like it's gonna rain to me Colonel
Pete, cmon sit down, have somethin to eat
First of all  was a sergeant
worked for a living
Did you ever smoke anybody
Pete
Pete
'know, Papa's still got your gun locked up in the garage
Think you could teach me how to shoot
figured that'd be scrap metal by now dad
No, 'm still hoping that you'll melt that thing down on your own
Sorry Pete
Whatever
'm outta here Mom
Okay, be back by ten
Ten thirty (as he walks out) Ten
Remind you of anyone
We can see from the window that it's raining heavily outside
Chris sets about unpacking his things
Pete comes in looking wet
Ok it rained
Happy
No
Why dontcha crash on the floor
Pete looks at him
Ok, 'll crash on the floor, you crash on the bed
uh uh
(starts walking out) Pete
(hands him a towel)
Keep ya dry
Did you really kill people
Chris looks at him
crappy camper van rolls up
man steps out
Ray Ray
Ahaaa
Hello puddin'
They hug
How ya doin
'm alright
What is that
(points to the van) That's the lovemachine
Girls actually get in there
Ray shrugs
How ya been
Good
Clean livin
Wanna beer
No
Believe it or not  quit drinkin
'll take a soda though
Here
Thanks man
Whoah
(spots a tattoo of a guitar on Ray's arm)
Ya like that
When you left town it gave me the idea that  should do something with my life too so uhh  went down to Seattle, got a guitar and became all about music
And then pretty soon was about music and drugs, n pretty soon  was basically just about drugs
Ended up doin 2 years for +
'm sorry
Nahh, look at me now though right been clean and sober for 14 months, doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships from my past
Matter of fact  talked to the bastards, told em you were back and they asked me to politely remind you that kick off's in twenty minutes
group of guys are there waiting, one of them holding a ball
They salute as Chris walks up
They all laugh
Playin ball
Let's play ball
Ray go deep go deep
(as Ray runs off he throws the ball into Ray's back)
(Spotting a sign that reads ' ') When did that happen
His parents hadn't left him the mill more than 2 minutes before he shut it down
Why
a voice shouts ' ' Chris catches a fast ball thrown from behind
Jay steps out of his vehicle
Cause  opened my Casino
Still got a gut huh Jay
Still got your reflexes
What, you get tired of being all that you can be
'm still all  can be
Really
'll just have to see about that
What brings you home
just wanna relax, catch my breath
You
Relax
Another truck with a few guys on it pulls up Not today
football game ensues, there are two teams
Jay's guys vs Chris' guys
On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle
Chris notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking
It comes down to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking
If we score here we win right
Alright boys, last play
We need to put this to rest
Just give me the ball
You got it
On the first hut
Ok Vaughn, last chance
Chris gets the ball and throws it
An opponent comes in hard and tackles him low
He collapses
Ray runs for the ball but gets clotheslined by Jay
That's game
(to Chris) Sorry about that
That's cool man
Chris Helps Ray onto his feet
Welcome home
Good to be back
See ya round
Hey, if you're not doing anythin later on you could come by the casino
'll introduce ya to some nice girls, drinks are on me
Whaddya say
See ya tonight
Cool
Jay speeds off in his car
Pete rolls up on his bike
Hey Sarge, good game
Maybe next time
Hold up
Maybe next time  won't see you with the bleachers smoking weed
Welcome home buddy
Don't you have to be native american to own a casino
Oh Hamilton's one sixteenth black man now
2 Just so you guys know, 'm gonna triple my money tonight
3 Yea, like last time
Wound up selling your body for bus fare
4 He had to walk
They all laugh
Nobody's gonna have any problems finding this place
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that  find most impressive, blends in with the mountains  nicely
The place is packed with gambling tables and attractive women
Not bad huh
Not bad
Isn't it wonderful
All your gambling needs under one great big roof
You got your  machine, tellers to cash your paycheck, and when you're here you don't gotta worry about those lil things like child support, rent, the laws of mathematical probability
Gentlemen, Mr Hamilton would like to invite you to the  lounge
Oh, 'Mister' Hamilton
Heyyy, the dream team
Nice place
Yeah well
Welcome to my world
Look tonight, all the drinks are on the house
If you need a line of credit, say how much
And if you need a lil female companionship
done
Alright
Have a good time
Where you goin
Don't you worry about me, 've got a few things to do
Enjoy
Just remember, nothin in here's free
'mon, this place is nothin but fake boobs and real assholes if ya ask me
Just water for me
Here's to you Chris
They all down some drinks
They lead Chris down a corridor
Don't say we never did nothin' for ya
2 Don't worry, everybody's a lil scared the first time
Get in there, sit back and enjoy
Chris' friends have led him to a stripping booth, his friend inserts the money
2 If you're not back by morning we'll send a search party for you
Bye
No drinking
His friends leave, closing the door behind them
screen goes up and a striptease begins
The lady is dressed in the style of a firewoman and has a pole in the center of the stage
She dances around the pole and removes clothes
So you from here or just visiting
Lil of both,  grew up here
So you've seen all the old faces
Could say that
Your voice sounds very familiar
The lights come on
Chris
Deni
The screen goes down again, Chris leaves the booth
1 Look who's back
2 So, good surprise
1 Told you it was better than gambling
You met Candy
( girl is dancing on their table) Hey Candy
(to the guys) Let's go
6
Easy 6 for a win
(To some girls) We can do a 6
(To Chris) We're gettin killed out here
need you to put 200 down for the bet
No, hell no
3 Look at them (Nods to girls)
Ok
Five hundred on 6
Yes, 'm in
Boom
Gimme some dice
Chris notices something odd, he looks concerned
Lookin' for a 6
Jimmy
Don't roll
Gimme the dice
Lookin' for a 6
Ohhhhh
The dice have landed and it's a 7
Jimmy hangs his head
(To the croupier) You're good, but saw it
Saw what
saw the switch
Hey this is a clean game asshole
Yea
Yea
Let's see about that
Chris puts a load of money on the table
Bet you 'll roll a seven
It's not your roll sir
It's not your roll
Call security
Chris has taken the dice
Put your bets down on the pass line
These dice are comin up seven
Chris, why don't we just let it go
No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy
The dice are comin up seven
It's not your roll sir
Chris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven
No folks, no payout
(To croupier) Why don't you just take care of that bet and we're even
Well  would but it wasn't a legitimate bet, you're not the shooter
It's not your (Chris shoves him)  sir
Is there a problem
Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded
Does your boss know about this
Just gimme my money
The security guy grabs Chris around the neck
Chris elbows him and throws him onto the table
The croupier takes a fighting stance
Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder
Come on, let's go
let's go
More security men appear, one of them knocks Jimmy out
whole fight breaks out, Ray gets knocked out
Chris beats off several security men before taking an electric shock to the neck and a baton to the face
Chris wakes up on a table under a light
1 (Sees the tag around Chris' neck) Special forces
'll take that
Chris grabs him by the neck but they beat him down again
2 What are you doin
1 (Has a scalpel in his hand) Special forces
special treatment
He rips open Chris' shirt
2 This guy knows Hamilton
struggle ensues and Chris' chest is cut up
We see Chris is crawling, badly hurt
truck stops directly in front of him
Chris passes out again
(To Chris' family) Folks, he's pretty banged up, inside and out
Whoever did this left him for dead
lesser man wouldn't have survived
'm gonna need a statement from him Doctor
He's in no condition to give you one
'll also need a copy of your write-up along with toxicoloy, blood alcohol level and so on
What are you talkin about Stan
'm just tryin to get some facts here
Oh come on you need to be out arresting whoever tried to kill my brother not testing his
'm just doing my job Michelle
Ok
understand how you feel
But we still don't know yet who started all of this
Well it wasn't Chris
Just find out who did this to him Stan
'll do my best Mr Vaughn
really will
In the meantime  have to file a full report
You lemme know when can talk to him
The doctor nods
Thank you
He's gonna be fine Michelle
Thanks
Ray goes into a room and takes a big bunch of flowers from there
flowers
Thank you, they're for my best friend
Hey sarge, so much for our
status
Don't they teach you any fighting skills in the army
How did you do
Not good
But  tell you, that guy was feelin me this morning
Chris begins to laugh but is in pain
You okay
Some homecoming hey
don't know if you've noticed but this aint exactly home any more
Chris has returned home
He's still in bad shape and his parents help him out of the car
He insists on taking the steps by himself
There's some old crutches in the garage
Chris laughs
montage ensues with Chris on the couch, sometimes with Ray, other times with Pete
Chris is recovering, and is exercising by the end of it
Chris pulls the cover off an old truck
He smiles and gets in
He starts the engine
Changed the plugs a while back
Appreciate that Dad
might've had serious issues with your career choice but just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck
Where you headin
was goin into town to get some supplies
Wanna come
Let's go
Ya whole life, all you wanted to do was get outta here
What made you come back
You gonna think 'm crazy
been thinking about the mill
When  was a kid goin to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar
You remember that smell
Mmm  remember a lotta nice things before the mill closed
When did they go outta business
(Nods to a closed supply store)
Closed about six months ago
There's a home depot about fifteen minutes up the road
And that
(Nods to an adult  shop) Don't ask
They laugh
Jay pulls up in his car
Hey
First of all  wanna say thanks
For what
He's been fired, and his gaming permit's been pulled
don't know how my security cameras didn't catch that
Jay starts to help Chris taking wood off the truck but Chris throws it back on
They miss a lot at your place don't they Jay
Look Chris  hate seein ya like this
Your boys did it
Wait wait
so they got a little rough, they were a bit edgy
Understandably
You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis
Look, they've been reprimanded
They say you went nuts man
'm sorry
know the proper term vets use is post traumatic stress
What the fuck are you talking about
Whatever it was, you tore my place apart and it wasn't easy for me to get my guys agree not to press charges
Look Chris, if you had a problem
shouldn't you have come to me
Look,  wanna bring you inside
Chris  wanna make you head of security
Whaddya say
No
Ah well
guess you probably need time to think about it
This is for you
It's a little something to help you get
'know
He puts down an envelope with money in it
Chris gives it back to him
Come on man, don't be like that
came all the way out here to your house just to see you get back on your feet
'm goin to the sheriff
'm sorry you feel that way
'll see ya round Chris
Excuse me
An officer is on the phone ignoring him
Excuse me
The sheriff comes out
Well hey Chris
Good to see you up and about, you're lookin spiffy
'm here to press charges
Well this isn't about that incident at the casino a while back is it
Yea, it is
Cause that matter's closed
Did you look into it
They did an internal investigation
That's good enough for me
An internal investigation
Chris,  know you're familiar with the term 'no fly zone'
Hmm
Cause that's what the casino is
Since the mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town
So, case closed basically
'll see ya
'm not gonna let this stand
Excuse me
What did you say to me
said 'm not gonna let this stand
You're lucky to be alive right now, that's all you need to be concentrating on
This is my town ok, 'm the sheriff here
'll tell you what will stand, not the other way around
Now please get out of my building
Deni is at the door
Hey
Hey
This belongs to you
She hands him a leather jacket
appreciate that,  thought this was history
Coulda left it in the trash but
Deni
Nice to see you dear
Hi Mrs Vaughn
Can  talk to you outside for a second
Mom 'll be right back
How you been
Been better
Talked to the sheriff yet
Well  went down to the police station and  talked to somebody with a badge
Sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff
He's up for re-election you know
Maybe you could take his job
Somebody ought to
How about you
Sunshine and pine trees
Been readin these books, teach you how to cultivate happiness
Books on the future, go with the flow, that sorta thing
Is it workin
have my moments
So the casino huh
Yep
Been there almost a year
Treatin you good
Lot better than it treated you
like that
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself hasn't he
Yea, he's a real go-getter that one
Must be
heard he got you
Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long time ago
You still work for him though
Rent's gotta be paid Chris
Suppose so
Hope to see you around
Do you
She begins to drive off
Thanks for the jacket
She toots the horn as she goes
Connie is on the phone
And where is he
The Vaughn's truck pulls up at speed
They enter a garage, Pete is on a stretcher
It's ok mom he's stabilised
(To Chris) It was close
Crystal Meth
'm sorry
never did it before
It's true
We mighta kinda pushed him into it
Chris approaches the kid
Where'd you get the drugs
'm not really sure
Stop
Where
From the security guys workin at the casino
Chris gets into his truck
Chris, wait
Call the police
No, that won't do any good
Chris speeds off
He pulls up at their home and enters the garage
Is Pete ok
He'll be fine
Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard
What are you doin
Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it
Aw Chris not like this
Chris listen to me
If you go outta here with that gun, they're gonna
ne
Chris
Chris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides to leave it in the truck
Instead he takes a piece of wood from the back of his truck
He enters the casino with it
He smashes a fruit machine
guard comes up and Chris beats him
fight scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally trashing the place
He takes back his special forces dogtag from the guard who stole it
Chris hurls his piece of wood at the lounge window, smashing it to pieces
Jay emerges from behind it
Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh
Chris leaves
As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear with sirens going
He pulls over
You should  have come looking for trouble
Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris
advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought
If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years
This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored
Three months home arrest, some community service
Pretty generous offer Chris
But 'd have to plead guilty
Look at it from the other side
There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture
We see a montage of casino workers badmouthing Chris
He started bustin up the machines
There was a gunshot
Went crazy
Complete psychopath
They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet
Well  still say you should take it
wasn't wrong
And  won't say  was
Our job is to keep order
But there was no chance of that
Me and my men we were just tryin to control him
He was highly trained, violent, very dangerous person
So dangerous, so violent, so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly
His weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar
Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy property
He went directly for everything
He just came in and took over the place
You said he broke your arm
Yea that's correct, my right forearm
Both bones with a single shot
It was crazy
2 You know, toss out a coupla drunks now and then
Guys try to grope the girls, but ah nothing with this sort of violence
Did he give you any kind of advanced warning
chance to defend yourself
2 We tussled, but he's a big guy
He was on a mission
Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what could see
So from what you saw, it seemed like he had some kinda purpose
2 think he had a point to prove yeah
was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh came in and started swingin
was tryin to get outta there
Mr Crow, you may present your client's case
(To his lawyer) You're fired
Your honor, 'd like to plead my own case
Order, order
Mr Vaughn, if you choose to represent yourself and not be represented by legal counsel you realise that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis
Yes  do
Very well Mr Vaughn
don't deny anything that was said here today
Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty
'm not guilty of anything
Except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't
Objection
He's trying to introduce prior events your honor
Sustained
Mr Vaughn stay on point
grew up in this town
People used to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino
Mr Vaughn we're not here to listen to civic speeches
And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were being sold to kids
Objection
Sustained
Mr Vaughn you're close to being held in contempt
was justified in what  did, and if you acquit me of these charges 'm gonna run for sheriff
And if elected, 'm gonna fix this town
Order, order
Mr Vaughn you are now charged with contempt
And  will make sure that  (He opens his shirt revealing huge scarring) never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it
order the jury to ignore what they have just seen
Mr Vaughn take your seat
Order
Order
Mr Forman, has the jury reached a verdict
We have your honor
Will the defendant please rise
We find the defendant Chris Vaughn not guilty
The crowd breaks into cheer
Chris takes a tag from his piece of cedar wood which is laying on the evidence table
This is mine
The crowds fade away with chants of 'Sheriff Vaughn'
Chris pulls up to the station in his police truck, it's clear he's now the sheriff
Sheriff
Watkins
Well you won the election, congratulations
We do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here, and  can personally vouch for each and every one of these men
They're good deputies
You're all fired
Chris takes a look around
Jay is speeding along in a sportscar
He is pulled over by a police truck
Hey Chris
License and registration please
You're joking right
License and registration
Jay hands it over
What's the problem sheriff
You
And the drugs you're pedalling out of your casino
Oh
Only thing that's going on in my casino right now is reconstruction
You took care of that
Yea that's right and  plan on taking care of everything else too
If you can, try to think this through
casino is a license to print money
Why would  jeopardise that by selling drugs
Cause you owned the town Jay
It's changed now
Really
See the only thing that  think has changed around here is that every morning you get to wake up and put on that nifty lil badge
But underneath that badge is the same guy that couldn't make it playing college football, apparently couldn't make it in the army and not gonna make it as a cop
Is that right
Yea, and if you push too hard you're gonna be a man who doesn't live to see 40
License please
Chris hands it over
Thanks sheriff
Sir get your tail lights fixed, it's your last warning
What's wrong with my tail lights
Chris smashes up the back end of Jay's car with his trusty piece of cedar wood
They're broken
' Mornin sheriff
Mornin deputy
Chris tosses Ray a badge
No, nope, no
Come on man you know hate cops
You been sheriff 2 minutes and 'm already startin to hate you
'm a convicted felon
got a lil pull around here
Oh now you're a  cop doing favours for friends
That's how it starts
See next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking dudes crotches
Are you done
Ray  need your help
Oh don't do that
need you to take me to drugs school
get to wear a uniform
montage ensues, with Chris and Ray busting various drug dealers
' You're  you're not carrying anything
don't have shit
Officer
Yeah
Search him
Oh
Spread your legs, arms down
Been workin out
Nothin there
Ohhhh somebody needs a
Now you read me my rights and take me in
And  call my lawyer
have a hunch there may be somethin else in here (Pats the dealer's truck)
Could be
Music plays while the two chop up the dealer's car into pieces while laughing
He's clean
Guess we gotta move to plan Screw you,  do have a bit of information for you
It's not just me actually, there's a whole lotta people in on this one
Spit it out
You're gonna get hurt
Chris is in the room with a shotgun
Why does it always have to be your fight
You might need this
No
put my guns down a long time ago
You're just being stubborn
You and me both boy
Chris, listen
You be careful
will
Booth is locked up, Ray is taunting him through a loudspeaker
Please step away from the vehicle
Now Mr Booth are you still upset over that body cavity search
forgot, you got no vehicle
Please disperse, there is nothing to s
Chris has walked in
Can  talk to you
Yeah
Over here
Sure
'm gonna stay with him tonight
need you to take care of my parent's place
You think they're gonna take it that far
Chris hands him the shotgun
'm with you man, 'll check in later
Kay
Deni comes into the police station
Don't shoot
Hey Hi
How's the food around here
Brought you special treats
Salmon, Fried Chicken, Potato Salad
You got cups
Don't you have to work tonight
Hmm  quit
figured you know, you were making some changes around here, could make a few myself
Chris grabs her and they kiss
Ray is on the couch and has just woken to a noise
Who's that
It's Pete
Want something to eat
No 'm good man
gotta get a bigger bed
No, no you don't
Jay calls a number on his celphone
Do it
'm hungry
Got leftovers
Mm mmm,  want pancakes, and eggs, and bacon
loud explosion happens, it's Chris' police truck outside
told you Vaughn
Uh ohhhh
Who needs to step away from the vehicle now Vaughn
Truck for truck baby, that's right, truck for a truck
Chris steps towards the front of the building but men outside open fire, Chris ducks for cover
(To Deni) Get down
Pete, somethin's burnin
Men with machine guns are still firing at the police station
Deni's screaming, Booth is cheering
Take that and get in there
Chris gives Deni a pistol
Pete
Ray steps into the kitchen but gunmen have infiltrated the home
fight breaks out and Pete flees
Ray jumps onto the back of a gunman
Chris shoots up the floor with a shotgun and breaks a hole in it
Ray stabs the gunman with a potato peeler and knocks him out with a frying pan
(To Deni) Come here
They get down into the hole in the floor
When  say 'now' start shooting, over there
Stay low
Booth is now under fire and is scared
Vaughn you gotta get me outta here
Two other gunmen in stocking masks are holding the family hostage upstairs
know who you are
Oh yeah
The gunman takes off his mask and hits him with a pistol
(Calling downstairs) Burke
2 Check it out
He goes downstairs to find Burke dead on the kitchen floor
He follows traces of blood across the floor
Chris is making his way towards Booth under fire
'mon
Get me outta here man
What's it worth to you
Where's the lab
Screw you
Gunshots hit near booth
Ok
Ok
Hamilton's operation is at the mill ok
It's at the mill now get me outta here
The gunman enters a room, Ray is there pointing a shotgun at him
Drop it
Stay down
Booth is standing and gets shot dead
Ray shoots the gunman, who falls to the floor
Ray
2 Stay down
Booth is dead so Chris leaves him there
(To gunman's body on the floor) Hey
you okay
Gunman 2 looks away for a second and Michelle kicks him down the stairs
As he tumbles down Ray reloads his shotgun
The two begin firing at each other, taking cover behind the furniture
Tried to warn ya Chris
Didn't want this to happen
One of the men outside has a canister
Watkins gives him the nod and he begins walking towards the station
Chris is beneath the floor and shoots him in the legs
The two remaining men outside open fire again
Another gunman tries to approach but he's shot in the legs as well
Watkins enters the station and fires repeatedly at the floor
Come get some
Deni
Now
Deni fires off some shots
Watkins is distracted by the shots, Chris appears in the floor hole and blasts Watkins at close range with a shotgun
Deni
Deni
Chris climbs out of the hole and they hug
Shots are still being fired in the lounge
Ray and the gunman begin to wrestle
Ray wins and punches the man repeatedly
Chris has come back to the house and tries to pull Ray off the man, Ray mistakenly hits Chris in the face
'm sorry
Chris helps Ray over to a chair, Ray has taken a shot to the leg
The injured gunman from the kitchen appears brandishing a pistol
You stabbed me
with a potato peeler
Chris and Ray hold up their hands
He aims at Ray but he's shot in the back of the head by Dad who is approaching down the stairs
You gonna be ok
Dad nods
Chris is in a police car driving at speed
He approaches the mill and busts through the locked gates
The mill is dark, Chris is finding his way around using a torch
He finds Jay sitting
Hey Chris
Get up Jay
Just a sec
Remember we used to play hide n seek up here
Jay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound
That was my favourite sound
Get up
Jay stands up and holds up his hands
Look
Chris
just
Jay hits a switch on the floor which opens a hatch
Chris falls into the hatch but hangs onto the saw which is swinging over it
Jay hits more switches, powering up the machinery
You wanna know what my new favourite sound's gonna be
The sound of you screaming like a little bitch
Jay hits Chris in the stomach with a pole a few times
Chris grabs the pole and they both fall
Chris has hurt his leg
Chris stumbles off into the woods
Jay grabs an axe and goes after him, he swings the axe but misses and they both fall down a large earthy embankment
At the bottom they come to their senses and begin fighting again, Jay with his axe and Chris with a log he's ripped off a tree
Chris knocks Jay out by hitting him hard in the legs
You're right Jay, this does change our relationship
This is my town, you're under arrest
Chris and Ray are packing everything, the place is boarded up
That oughta do it
are you doin
Gettin some souvenirs, 'm gonna miss the place
That's how it starts
Next you'll be accepting bribes, setting speed traps all over town, cuttin up trucks
Not to mention the cavity searches
Speakin of which, do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen
Could be
Runnin the shower tower with the felons
He's probably blowin on somebody's dice right now
They laugh as they drive off
The mill makes a horn noise
That's lunch
Let's go pick my old man and grab somethin to eat
'm with ya buddy
