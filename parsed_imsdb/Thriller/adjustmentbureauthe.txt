Written by George Nolfi Based on a short story by Philip  Dick The sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside, and hearing the crowd through a window or door
: -- , 33, is having a private moment, looking down, thinking
He wears a suit and tie
He seems relaxed and confident
Content
Completely in his element
In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges
We hear the muffled voice of someone on a  system outside: Thank you so much for coming today-- man in a   walks up to David
Congressman Norris-
Now  that we're Afl: the entry hall of the Admin Building at St
Johns University
thousand people crowd the quad out front
"Norris for Senate" placards everywhere
- Fred 'Malley with the
've never seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle
, 36, arrives--
Just wait 'till you see how they respond to him
David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State
Don't build me up like that, Charlie
He'll be disappointed
--   -- The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of the Admin Building
Hi there
'm David Norris
And 'm running for the  Senate
2/12/09 2
The crowd goes wild
-- --David finishes a speech at the  Academy's graduation
The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing ovation
--David shakes the hands of workers entering a
Con Edison plant in Buffalo
He's a natural at this
Unlike most politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning
--Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball with a group of Bronx teenagers
Charlie is nearby
--David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin redevelopment of an old military base upstate
--He gives a speech at a Harlem church
Audiences watch David the way they watched , the way they watch Obama today
He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to follow him
Especially young people
--David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their camera-phones
People crush around him
He:doesn't seem to mind at all
He welcomes it
He feeds off it
--He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice
Charlie stands nearby watching him speak:
--  -- David enters his hotel room
The silence contrasts starkly with the noisy energy of the campaign trail
He turns on the
Scrolls through the channels
After a moment shuts it off
Total silence again
It bothers him
He opens up his briefcase
Pulls out a thick file -- his itinerary for the next three days
Dozens of speeches and meetings across the state
He glances at the summary page on the top
Glances down the page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open Space Initiative
( ) Karen Woods, founder
Husband: Bob
2/12/09 3
(') Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little League
John Pascal
Wife: Anna
St
John's grad
Two year old: Loyita
He stops
Knows this cold
His finger runs down to a Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days out
( ) Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan Sabovic, Jim Vargas
His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning
He doesn't need to review
It's already all there
He closes his itinerary file
Goes to the window and looks out at the trees
The silence back
it's deafening
--   -- Charlie enters the lobby
Stops suddenly: spots David, holding court at`the hotel bar
Fifteen strangers around him as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's clearly losing his voice
Charlie walks over, pulls him aside
What the hell
What happened to "'m going to have softie tea, rest my voice, and go to bed early
" You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four  for us to make it in time
David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand
With his free hand he picks up a cup and saucer
had some tea
(sees Charlie's not in the ) Come on, man
We're eight points up in the polls
've gotta cut loose every once in a while and have a life
This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie
Fifteen strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like having a life to him
2/12/09 4
Ten
What
Latest poll has you ten points up
slow smile spreads across David's face
: The sound of a busy room
Then one voice, much louder: County reporting: 8901 for Lynfield, 7233 for Norris
-- Charlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that
She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county
( ) Better than  thought,  thought we'd get killed in Seneca
He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops
Eddie, call Boyd
Where the hell are the
Suffolk numbers
We've got to get the Suffolk numbers
-- light snow falls
Four    , overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story building
Their clothing is more timeless than old- fashioned
And somehow so is their demeanor
The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost- as if it's their domain
2/12/09 5
-- David watches the election coverage on
Pundits are discussing the New York Senate race, which  has already called for David's opponent
#1 Congressman Norris has a reputation for being very direct, even blunt, in his campaign speeches, which is great until you say too many things you wish you hadn't
Then you start to look like an amateur
#2 That's bad for any candidate but it's fatal if you're running for Senate at the age of 33, your opponent keeps calling you an "impulsive kid," and you almost killed your entire political career five months ago with an act of immaturity that ended up on the front page of`
the New York Post
David winces slightly
This is excruciating
Just then Charlie enters
The nerve center
suite is visible through the open door behind him
- Why are you still watching
They called this way too early
David doesn't share his friend's optimism
'--   -- ' campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room: Suffolk County Numbers
Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen
(
) Lynfield: 415,120
Norris: 370,233
Charlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly
(after long beat) really thought we'd win Suffolk
2/12/09 6
senior aide walks over
Kings County just came in too
He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David
beat
Well, it's over
And it's going to be a blowout
David puts on a brave face
but this is the first moment that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going to lose big
It's going to be a grand,
public humiliation
has us up next
Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest  to
Turning now to the New York Senate race,  is now calling the election for Roger'Lynfield
After a shockingly poor showing in both Suffolk county and in his home county, Kings, it now appears that David Norris will lose this election badly, perhaps by as much as 10 points
-- The four men in dark suits
The boss's name is , early 40s
His top aide is
, 50s
This is a
bignight, gentleman
() Is ever ything set
Harry nods
Richardson notices his eyes: You look tired
You should take a vacation when we finish with this
You'll have earned it
'm not sure the kind of tired feel would be fixed by a vacation
2/12/09 7
Sure it would
Everybody needs a vacation
Even us
: --   -- The staff and supporters in here have become very quiet
Their candidate is standing in the middle of the room, but no one can look at him
And David can't look at them either
( ) 'm going to take a walk, figure out my speech
-- Four-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big screens in the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom
No one says a word
The mood has gone from
hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds
-- David slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the staff
But when he
gets to the door he sees that press vans line the front of the hotel
There will be no peace for him if he steps out there
He turns around
Good evening, Congressman
You're in the Grand Ballroom if that's what you're looking for
Actually just looking for a place to be alone for a minute before head in there
None of the banquet rooms on the third floor are in use tonight
Thank you
-- David stands alone looking out at the empty room
Trying to get used to it
It's not easy
2/12/09 8
'  -- David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row of sinks
He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his pocket
He twirls them in his hands for a moment
Then tosses them into the trash can
He looks at himself in the mirror, fighting to hold himself together
sound behind him
David spins to see a  exiting one of the stalls
She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an expensive bottle of champagne
Hi
hope  didn't startle you
What are you doing in here
Hiding from security
Oh
What did you do
Crashed a wedding
One floor up
It's almost midnight
They'just caught on now
Ivana Trump finally realized wasn't her niece
think after the fifth; glass of champagne my Czech accent started slipping
spite of David's state that gets a grin
Are you for real
Life is short
Hard to argue with that
You're that guy running for Senate aren't you
'm "that guy
" 2/12/09 9
You winning
No
Too bad
The other guy's a tool
() Maybe  should have made that clearer in my ads
Personally,  think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal
() And  don't think the Post should have printed the photo
David just shakes his head
He will never, ever live that down and he knows it
At least not full page
He can't help but crack up
Listen, 've done it
You weren't running, for Senate at the time
Do you still have a chance or is it over
He crushed me
She has beautiful eyes
And an exceptional gift for conveying empathy
You must
don't know what you must be feeling
Winning would feel better
But losing has its advantages
2/12/09 10
Like what
The only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep
or in the bathroom
After eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take
She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look
Watching you, you'd never know it
The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even quite sure what it is
Not yet
Thank you
Well, everything happens for a reason, right
Even losing
God, 'm really rollrng out the platitudes tonight, aren't
It's the champagne
Brines out the Hallmark in people
After it kills their Czech accents
She offers:him the bottle
He hesitates, then takes it
Why not
have to think up some good platitudes for my speech
He takes a gulp of champagne
Why the hell would you do that
Apparently, even if  hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign  would have lost the election anyway because 'm too blunt
(swig of champagne) Says who
2/12/09 11
The  pundits
Fuck 'em
They just wish they had the balls to be candidates themselves
She hands him the champagne bottle again
And they work for the Man anyway
() You going to run again
() Tonight's probably not the night to ask
( ) No, it is
Look at me
You have to run again
Do-yo hear me
She's serious about this
Intense
Otherwise the-country will be run by tools
like Lynwood
"Field
" (of f her look) "Lynfield
" beat
She shrugs
Then they lean toward each other
and kiss
It turns more and more passionate
When they finally pull apart: Holy shit
She seems just as surprised
They look at each other and laugh
Just then the bathroom door opens
It's Charlie
He sees David and the woman
David
( ) better go
2/12/09 12
She exits
-- 3RD The woman comes out of the bathroom
David is right behind her
Then Charlie
Wait
The woman turns to face David
Suddenly two hotel guards turn the corner and spot the woman
There
They rush toward her
Gotta go
(to David, emphatically
) Don't let the bastards grind you down
She spins and sprints away
The hotel guards chase her
What the hell was that
'm really not sure
David has a huge grin on his face
But  think 'm ready to give my speech
-- David as he walks out from behind a curtain onto the dais
His supporters start clapping
but clearly they're heartbroken
David looks completely peaceful
grew up in Red Hook and  don't want to shock anybody but  got in a few fist fights along the way
Laughter ripples through the crowd
We don't know enough yet to get the joke
2/12/09 13
And we used to have a saying when you got in a fight: "it's not whether or not you get knocked down -- because eventually everyone does -- it's what you do when you get back up
" () Don't worry, 'm not going to moon you
The audience explodes with laughter this time
But  am
(waiting for the laughter to die down) But  am going to get backup wanted to come out here tonight and give you a victory speech, a speech 've dreamed of giving foremost of my life
But life doesn't always deal you the cards you want
The audience sobered now
Reflective
My life changed when  was ten years old
My entire world turned upside-down
' His audience,
knows exactly what he's talking about
And as  looked for something to -hang ;on to, something; to help me cope' with what had
happened the only thing that made sense to me was service
Finding a way to do something with my life that left this world a little better than found it
The audience is moved
Tears begin to well up
People dab at their eyes
: -- The sky is just beginning to turn from black to deep blue
The park is still and silent
black Mercedes pulls up on Madison Ave
Mr
Richardson, again in a dark suit, gets out and enters the park
2/12/09 14
-- Harry sits on one of the benches -- a fedora in his lap to complement a gray flannel suit
Richardson arrives
He spills his coffee when he steps out of Starbucks
The moment he comes through the door
Got it
Our models indicate between 7:00 and 7:05 am
Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this
You planned that vacation, right
Two weeks
Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves
Harry watches him go
-- An alarm clock reads "5:44 airy
" It turns to "5:45" and the alarm goes off
hand reaches over and taps the alarm off
the arm back to David Norris in a king-sized bed
He rubs his eyes, stretches his neck, and climbs out of bed
-- David works out
He's got the-energy-level of a 25 year-old
He runs on a treadmill
Hits the heavy bag
Does sit-ups
-- ' David's spacious one-bedroom overlooking Madison Square Park
His desk and dining room table is covered with stacks of paper and files
flat screen displays : (

You voted for it, pal
In fact, you cosponsored it
-- Through the window we see David getting his morning coffee
He exits and
on the door of Starbucks
-- Harry is snoring on his bench
David walks past
-- David arrives at Fifth just in time to catch the "M1 Limited- Stop" bus arriving`at the stop
-- Sunlightpeeks:
through a gap in the buildings and falls on Harry's left eye, waking him
He bolts upright
Checks his watch, Shit
He looks around quickly
Spots David about to get o n the bus
Harry leaps : up-- As David pays, he notices Harry sprinting for the bus
Sir, there's someone-- There's another M1 right behind me
23RD  -- The bus pulls out
Harry keeps running after it
2/12/09 17
No
-- As David walks down the aisle a couple of passengers recognize his face
but they don't say anything
David nears an empty aisle seat
woman is curled up in the window seat, sleeping
She wears a funky mini-dress, knee- high argyle socks under leather boots, and a (clashing) argyle bucket cap
David sits next to her
And stares
No way
It's the woman from election night
', He leans around to try to see the front of her face
"It's definitely her
His eyes drift down at her legs
Just then she opens her eyes
She recoils for a second;
Then` her eyes soften when she realizes who it is
( - ) think
we "ve met
() You need a better line than that or 'll have to assume you're a pervert who likes to stare at girls' legs while-, they sleep
(smiles, game on) Your skirt was so short  couldn't help it
Dress
Skirt, dress, same thing
If you're a pervert, yeah
All that matters is they both show leg
So do shorts, dear
2/12/09 18
Yeah, but there's that pesky piece of fabric right here that interferes with your fantasy life
She shuts her eyes and leans against the window
Wake me when you have a good come back to that
have one but, unlike you, wouldn't say it in public
(eyes still closed) Pussy
David laughs
Can not believe this woman
In a good way
His blackberry
Her eyes pop open
David
picks up
Hello
Hello
David looks at his
phone
The signal has gone to zero
( ) The line cut
That ringer get any-louder or do you pretty much have it maxed out
You're relentless
never sleep through the night catch up on the bus
() You going to run again

( ) saw your concession speech heard Bill Clinton called it the best political speech he's seen in 20 years
David looks back at her
2/12/09 19
Something got into me
He means her
They stare at each other
What's the deal with you and argyles
What's the deal with you and boring shades of blue
David is wearing a Navy blue suit, blue shirt, and blue tie
beat
At least my clothes match
That's easy if you
restrict yourself to one color
The belt and shoes are black
Variety is the spice of
life
There you` go with the platitudes again
guess it wasn't the ch mpagne
His blackberry goes again
-
Hello
Hello
He shakes his head
It's dead again
19TH  -- Harry runs down Broadway looking east on 19th to try to spot the bus on Park
-- Your phone sucks
Don't guys like you get special phones that actually work in the middle of the biggest city in the country
2/12/09 20
Depends what the telecom lobby thinks of your voting record
19TH  -- Harry spots the bus passing on Park
He jams his fedora on his head and stretches his arm out-- Now
-- David's phone rings again
As he reaches for the phone he fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress
Oh, Jesus
( ) 'm sorry
19TH -- Harry's face
Shit
He's looking at a leather portfolio
We catch a glimpse inside: a complicated circuit diagram
Harry shuts the book, look's up to get a bead on" the the bus, then takes off down Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square
' -- 'll pay for the damage
He pulls out his wallet
There's $7 inside
She laughs
Hope your new job pays better than your old one
Give me your number and 'll send you a check
2/12/09 21
God, that is smooth
Spill coffee on me then ask for my number
She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip, then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes
Just let me spill some on you and we'll be even
She thrusts the cup toward his tie
David parries
It's my first day at the office
Tell your boss some crazy chick dumped coffee on you on the
It's New York; he'll understand
She thrusts the cup back at him- No
He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers
( ) Come on
Just a little
They struggle with the cup You're crazy
Actually crazy
The phone on David's lap' again
She snatches it with her free hand
( ) He's not here
She hangs up
Who was that
She shrugs
Sorry, pal
He lunges for his phone, but she holds it on the other side of her body
What is this, third grade
2/12/09 22
You forgot what that was like, didn't you
How fun it was
That stops him for a moment
Until the phone  again
Oh my God
How do you stand it
She drops the phone into the coffee
There
We're even
He stares at her
Incredulous
They lock eyes
God knows what would come next if they were in private
The fourth  gurgles up through the coffee
beat
Sturdy little fucker, isn't it
She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail
Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake
By the way, 'm Elise
-- Elise exits
the bus
David stands at the bus door watching her
She turns back to look at him
The morning after
lost  woke up thinking about you
That melts her
Instantly
All her bravado drops
-- Moments later
Through the window, David watches Elise walking down the sidewalk
Their eyes meet
She blows him a little kiss before she turns the corner
His heart skips a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East
-- Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus
2/12/09 23
-- David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper
He carefully tucks her number into his wallet
Then takes the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life-- -- Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus-- -- Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the cup
second earlier and the coffee would have poured all over his shirt
Instead it spills: on the floor
-- Dammit
Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus-- Harry turns just in time to see a
taxi skid into him
He rolls up onto the hood-- -- '  -- big corner office
The phone rings
Charlie picks up
(
) Guess who  just sat down next to on the bus
Who
The woman from election night
-- dazed Harry lies in the road
The taxi driver who hit him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay
2/12/09 24
-- (
) The one you kissed
She kissed me
just didn't fight it
-- Harry sits up
He's bruised but okay
He looks around for something
Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front tire
-- (
) You're shitting me
Just randomly you sit down next to-- He's cut off mid-word
Charlie
David looks at his phone
"Call Lost" on the screen
David hits redial
Gets a fast busy
' (to himself)
This is ridiculous
He pockets his phone
The taxi driver is with Harry now
Are you okay
Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently for something
'm fine-- Will you hand me that
Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few feet away
We'll come to know it as a "
" 2/12/09 25
(') Are you sure you're okay
The driver hands it to him
Harry flips to a bookmarked page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram: Thousands of interconnected lines
Dozens of geometric symbols at intersection points
And written notations in a language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese
And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page
Oh
shit
-- David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office tower
He enters through the revolving door-- '  '--    -- Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other end of the lobby
David gets into an empty elevator
41ST   -- David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone
He waves as-he:passes by
No wade back
She must not see him
Okay
Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself
-- David enters to find the office suite quiet
Not a soul in sight
Not a single secretary is here
(loud, playful) Doesn't anybody bother getting in before eight at this place
David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman
" She's smiling
2/12/09 26
(') () Susan
How are you today
(when she doesn't move) Susan
David looks closer across her desk
Her face is frozen
(') Susan
He leans across her desk, touches her arm
She stays dead still
David rushes through Charlie's door: Call 911
Something's wrong with Susan
'  -- --and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with the phone up to his ear
Like he's in a wax museum
He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver protective suits
(think airport firefighter gear)
One of the men adjusts three metal
probes which are attached to the left side
of Charlie's skull
Jesus
Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see David
it's Mr
Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night
(,
') What the hell are you doing
Richardson blinks Clearly surprised
Then: Grab him
David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him-- -- David sprints toward the door he came in
It closes as he gets there
He grabs it
It's locked
He sprints away into an internal hallway
Richardson emerges from a door in the middle of the hallway
2/12/09 27
David jumps a mile
It's physically impossible that Richardson could have gotten there that fast
You can't get away, David
David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to the floor below
Jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard
As he comes up he runs smack into another  employee who is frozen solid
David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson, coming out of another office
down the hall
Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast-- David spins and--      of a chloroform rag shoved right at us
' ,   as he's carried toward one of the large corner offices on the 40th floor
The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid
" Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David, -- Except when they walk through the door they're not in an office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a large warehouse
Their movement completely violates the laws of physics
Silence
Then voices come up slowly: (
) Yes, sir
No, sir
No, sir understand that, sir
Absolutely
'll do that, sir
() What a goddamm mess
(
) Was that Donaldson
(
) Yes
(
) What do you want to do
2/12/09 28
--    -- to '  of the warehouse David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out
half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver Suits) stand nearby
Richardson and  (one of the men from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away
(
) Can you reset him
(
) don't think we have the authority in a situation like this
(
) - (0
)
Legal just arrived
-- , a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit, carrying a briefcase
He
walks to Richardson
Re-setting's off the table
This is our fault:
Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself off to the side, clearly disgraced
David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson, cranes around to see who's talking
Hey
The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume
What are my options
( ) You could bullshit him but you'll never be completely successful
Can somebody tell me what's going on
2/12/09 29
(still ignoring him) The questions will burn in him till the day he dies
You'll have to monitor him constantly
He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying-- ( ) to make sure he doesn't talk
the endless ripple effects
David untying the rope restraining him
If it were me, 'd level with him
: Completely
That's the only way to extinguish his curiosity
Richardson turns and studies David
Then walks over to him
An uncomfortable pause
Who are you guys
We're the people v ho make sure things happen according to Plan
David stares back at him for a moment
then leaps up
His rope comes off and the chair falls
He sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse
Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand-- - It cracks
and displaces upward
so it's uneven just as David's foot comes down on it
2/12/09 30
David trips and goes flying-- David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed back in his chair in front of Richardson
Did you really think  couldn't see that coming
David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall
(') can read your mind
David stares back
(') Yeah, really
() Choose a color
(barely a beat) Blue
Choose a number
(even less time) Seventeen
David's jaw drops slightly
Richardson was clearly right
Now,
why are you still deciding whether or not to run
David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic response, as if;s
omehow that will keep his thoughts from spilling out into view
You saw the futility of that back at the office
David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking point
He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all this based in the world he's known to date
What the hell is happening to me
2/12/09 31
You just saw behind a curtain you weren't even supposed to know was there, Mr
Norris
Its jarring
'm sure
just
came to work
It wasn't your fault
Your Path through the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted
(glancing bitterly at Harry, in the corner) Your coffee was supposed to
spill onto your shirt as you left Starbucks near your apartment
You would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten minutes later than you did
By then we would have left
() People call it "chance" when their coffee spills or their internet goes down or they misplace their keys
Sometimes it is
Sometimes it's:us
nudging you back on Plan
David takes all this in
He's still shell-shocked
Whatever you were doing to Charlie back there
it wasn't misplacing his keys
Sometimes
when nudging a person back on Plan isn't enough we intervene directly
Why Charlie
What did you do to him
You need to worry about getting back on your Plan, David, not worry about us putting him back on his
David stares back, still trying to get his bearings
(') Only a handful of human beings know what you now know, David
We're determined to keep it that way
2/12/09 32
(') So before  let you go, you need to understand something: If you ever reveal our existence we will erase your brain
Your memories, your emotions, your entire personality will be expunged
Your friends and family will think you've gone crazy
You won't "think" anything because a blank slate can't "think
" Davidstares back
Do you understand what  just said
Yes
Not a word
Not one word about us
(long beat as he studies ' ) okay
you're free to go
David stands there a monent
:
not sure it's real
Richardson points at the door
David walks toward it
Just then another man comes up to Richardson
There's awoman
() There's always & Woman
Richardson motions;to his men
At
- Two men come through from outside and block David's exit
He said  could go
You won't believe who she is
He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see
2/12/09 33
How is that possible
Why didn't we get an alert
He wasn't supposed to be on that bus
He was supposed to be changing his shirt in his apartment
It was a controlled situation
It was supposed to be
The new man looks at Harry
David looks back at Richardson
You said  could go
Richardson walks over to him
, You ran into a woman named Elise on the bus this morning
(:going very still) Why does it'matter
You weren't ever supposed to see her again
Why do you care
Because, David, you can't be with her
And we didn't want to have to resort to this-- Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like prison guards incapacitating a prisoner
Richardson reaches into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet-- What the hell-- What are you-- Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her number on from David's wallet-- (') -- 2/12/09 34
Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then pulls out a lighter-- (') No
And burns Elise's number
David strains and tries to pull loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team men
But he can't get free
(') What is wrong with you people
Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn
David's reaction  : -- David exits through a steel door
, it clangs shut behind him
He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts walking to the corner to orient himself
Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other the Brooklyn Bridge
He's in
-- David sits alone at the bar
His hand trembles slightly
You're David Norris, right
Ice water
That's it
David nods
Harry arrives
We should talk
But not here
Go back to work and 'll contact you later today with a place to meet
2/12/09 35
Okay
Harry can see that David is still very shaken
The world's exactly the same as it's always been
You just understand it more completely now
() Hang on to what mattered before you knew any of this and you'll be fine
-- thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters
-- David enters
Stares at,,hisnew colleagues going about their business as if nothing happened
40TH  --: David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve Kincaid
" He hesitates, then opens it
He sees an empty office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor
It's strangely disorienting for him
(
) Mr
IKincaid's in the finance meeting, Congressitan
Main conference room
David turns to see her
Thanks
David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new reality he now knows
Charlie comes around a corner
There you are
called your cell ten times
You left me hanging
Sorry
2/12/09 36
(seeing the look in ' ) Are you okay
(off David's nod) Come on, we're late
Happy first day by the way
They head towards the conference room
You sure you're okay
Fine
How about you
Great
Why
No headaches or-- feel fantastic, -man
Is it just, me or is this an odd conversation
(off David" s non-response
) What the hell happened with the girl
After the meeting
from outside the building
The firm's partners sit at their weekly investment committee meeting
David watches Charlie intently, looking for what's changed
-- David and Charlie walk back to David's office
(') Please explain to me why you don't have an ear-to-ear smile right now
-- '  -- David hesitates
It's like his friend is an alien
but then again he's totally normal
2/12/09 37
lost her number
You lost her number
(searching for something) was pickpocketed
Come on
You can't be serious
(off David's look) You're serious
Oh, man
dude
'm sorry
'm really sorry
--      -- David sits on a bench looking at the water
The wind picks up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them warm
His right hand feels something
He pulls out a ticket for the 4 pm Circle
Line tourist boat cruise
CRUtgE -- The boat pulls away front=the dock
It's misting rain so there's only asmattering of tourists on-board
David stands looking back at Manhattan
Harry is next to him
lot of people just collapse when they see what you've s'een
Their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them
Life starts to feel pointless
was` raised to believe there's something behind the curtain just never pictured it quite like this
Most people don't
Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his colleagues
He's far from relaxed
How are you feeling
You should know
You can read my mind, right
2/12/09 38
Harry hesitates
as if he's not sure how much to tell David, how far to go with this
Finally: Richardson was just trying to scare you
He knew what color  was thinking
Because he set it up as a choice
"Choose a color
Choose a number" So
Harry looks away
He's crossing a line
He's really putting himself out there: We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts
But before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we percpite that
We know if you're going to go off Plan "or not because, as long as we're close enough, we cansense it when it's about to happen
it-;' s like a sixth sense for you
Seventh, actually
What did they do too Charlie
Made some small change in the way he assesses risk
What type of risk
(this is beside the point) don't know
Something arcane
Something to do with mortgage- backed securities
That's all
2/12/09 39 Yes
What would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me
This is precisely what Harry has been worried about
That's why we're meeting out here
They're not following me
We don't have the manpower to follow everybody all the time
They're checking in on you
Just not here
Not right now
David's face considering this
Moments later
They stand out of earshot of the few tourists up here
Why are you helping me
have my reasons
David studies him
Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into : Why do they care if 'm with Elise
Your entire reality gets shattered this morning and you want to know about a woman
Why do they care
Harry looks back at him
Taken aback a bit by how much David seems to care
don't know
2/12/09 40
You have no idea
All  know is, given the amount of resources they've used, keeping you from her is pretty important to them
(off David's silence) You're going to look for her aren't you
Again, David is silent
(') There are twelve million people in this city
On a slow day
You're not going to find her, you do realize that, don't yore-
() Even if a hypnotist pulled her number out of the recesses of your brain, no matter how many times you called it, you,'d never get through
(his face hardening) They send you here to tell me that
(') You want my advice
Forget about her
Accept that you'`>ll never see her again
Move on with your life
David as Harry's words sink in
: -- Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside David's apartment
The trees are blooming
It's Spring now
-- An alarm clock reads 6:29 am
David lies alone in bed
He's already awake, staring at the ceiling
After a long beat the alarm clock rings
David shuts it off
But then just lies there
2/12/09 41
'  -- It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now
Instead of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six windows across
(He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to his and knocked the walls down)
Three years have passed
No files on the table, like there were the last time we were here
David is on the phone in a new park-view study
(
) How are you feeling about the speech
David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and subdued than when we last saw him
We `hear it in his voice: 'm ready
changed a few things last night
(
) Tell me at breakfast
David finishes his call, then looks out the window
There is a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before
After a moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door
-- David exits Starbucks with a coffee
He walks across the park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years ado
` Even his posture and,-gait are different
-- David enters the Ml bus
He feeds his Metrocard into the reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders
more out of habit than actual hope
He walks back to take a seat
--   -- David stares idly out the window
His Blackberry buzzes with a text message
Looks down at it
Then looks back out the window
Suddenly his eyes snap into focus
' : The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk
2/12/09 42
David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back now
She walks like Elise
She's dressed in the same eclectic style
He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus
Stop the bus
The next stop-- Now
-- The bus stops
David jumps out on Broadway
him as he takes off across the street and runs down 12th
He catches up to her at University Place
Elise
The woman turns around
And it's her
David
Hi
Wow
How areyou
Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then: (from the heart) rode the Ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day 'd run into you again
She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it
Calling would have been easier
couldn't
Girlfriend wouldn't let you
2/12/09 43
No girlfriend
She looks at him with continued skepticism
But his expression is dead serious
(') Can we go somewhere and talk
She hesitates
It hurt when he didn't call
She's angry at herself for that, but it's the truth
(re: his suit) Don't you have to get to work
just got sick
" haven't seen you in three years - - You make me sick" is not an ideal come-on
For the record
David smiles
She's softening
little
His phone vibrates
He pulls it out of his pocket
One second
( ) CharlieT can't make breakfast
(
) Why not
And
might have to push the speech
(
) What
Are you crazy
just ran into Elise
He hangs up
You just hung up on your best friend
We've known each other since we were kids
We have a shorthand
2/12/09 44
He's not being flip or clever or smooth
He's being matter- of-fact
Serious
What speech
Doesn't matter
Let's take a walk
His focus on her is absolute
But she's wary of getting reeled in again
Where
Somewhere far
We have a lot to talk about
don't think you should cancel your speech
What if  don't like you at the end of our walk
'll take my chances
Seri6us1y, my number hasn't changed:
Just call me like you didn't last time
My-speech will always be there, you might not be
(/) was there, David
You didn't callrie
Walk with me and 'll explain that
She's still dubious
His phone vibrates
This time he turns it off
(') (a statement of fact) 'm not losing you again
'm not letting you out of my sight
Stalker
2/12/09 45
Can we walk
The moment she finally relents,  : Polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders
-- Mr
Richardson sits at a large desk
The design is Art Deco crossed with Albert Speer
Downtown Manhattan is visible out the 30th floor window
Richardson's aide enters
We have a problem
-- David and Elise walk north
It's been years, David
How do you know  don't have a boyfriend
Oh, shit
He hasn't even had time to think about that
you have a boyfriend
; Would it-Matter
() Uh
yeah
So all the stuff about me being in your mind constantly for the last three years was just talk
The truth is you don't have any real conviction
It wouldn't matter
So you don't care about being a home-wrecker
2/12/09 46
Okay
if you were married it would matter
Now you're just trying to say what you think  want to hear
beat
She lets David twist in the wind
'm single
David's face: relief
Now let's hear your bullshit excuse for never calling me
didn't have your number
What
It was taken from me
was mugged
Oh, come on
Your number was in my Wallet and they ,:took it
Come on
'm serious
What else could possibly-explain my fawning all over you on that bus three years ago
and again today and not calling you in between
() Um, you had a girlfriend and you felt guilty
have a thing about being lied to, David
swear to God  didn't have your number
swear on my parents' graves
2/12/09 47
(') didn't even have a last name to try to track you down
Do you know how many pages come back when you type "Elise" into Google
() And none of them were you
(after a beat) You really are smooth
That's not fair
It's okay
like it
probably shouldn't, but  do
() It's Sellas
Elise Sellas
'  --  -- McCrady holds open his Planbook to show Richardson an ever shifting diagram
Tell me you're kidding
How could our Path-analysis miss this
McCrady just shakes his head, mystified
Richardson walks to the closet and pulls out his fedora:
'rlhek,e are they now
` Central Park
Bethesda Fountain
-- David and Elise walk past Bethesda Fountain
read somewhere you're running again
haven't announced yet but
soon
hope  had a little something to do with that
2/12/09 48
That concession speech  gave sure did
You had everything to do with that
Elise smiles
You know entirely too much about me given how little  know about you
According to Cosmo 'm supposed to keep it that way
According to Maxim, 'm supposed to "maintain eye contact and ask you what you do for a living
" It's the first witty comment h6' :s made this time around
He's just barely starting t6A'looA`en up
() 'm a dancer
Oh
Not like that, you pervert
In a dance company
The
Manhattan Modern Ballet
think you have the wrong idea about me
think it was the first thing that crossed your mind
Is there a performance of this company coming up that  could watch
Actually, we have a show opening tomorrow night
'm there
You hungry yet
2/12/09 49
He points at the Boathouse restaurant a few hundred feet down the path they're on
Yeah
() But 'm not putting out just because you're buying me brunch
We could wait an hour and call it lunch
bet lines like that work wonders with the "dancers" you normally hang out with
So unfair
-- Richardson and McCrady Step out of a small outdoor bar structure
They, SpotDavid and Elise walking in the side door of the restaurant
',
, Somehow Richardson and' McCrady have travelled from downtown Manhattan to the middle of Central Park in the time it took David and Elise to' walk 100 feet
-- David and Elise are at atable next to the lake
Good morning
It's good to see you again,
sir
Thank you
You're
(pulling it from the recesses of his brain) Paul, right
De
Santo
Wow, yeah
How did you remember that
It's been a year
2/12/09 50
-- Richardson surreptitiously watches David and Elise while McCrady consults his Planbook
steps out of the same door Richardson and McCrady came through
Morris is on the artistic director
Melton is on Charlie Traynor
This whole thing will be over in an hour
(disturbed by something he sees in his Planbook) We may not have that long
What
-- Thewaiter leaves David and Elise
How do you do that
can't remember the names of people  just met
(points at himself) David
Right
Thanks_
' -- Her decision tree is diverging from our models
() 36 hours without contact and she'll never speak to him again
've studied her file
Her deepest fear in life is-- 2/12/09 51
No, something is wrong
'm already seeing inflection points
Off Richardson's surprised look-- -- Davidand Elise eat brunch
Ballet is basically impossible to do correctly
Why
You just do absurd things
with your body
The movement is completely unnatural
It requires incredible strength in all sorts of random muscles
And you have to be born with ridiculous amounts of flexibility in your hip or you'll never be an y good
-- McCrady examines his Planbook diagram
With each new update of the diagram red "inflection points" move across the pages toward a heavy black "present time" line on the right side of the right :page Richardson points at the red point closest to the present tithe ` hrie
What's that
If they kiss
() kiss, that's all it takes
real kiss
But once they do that every possible adjustment that's strong enough to break them up will cause ripples over your limit
2/12/09 52
If Melton and Morris do their jobs right we'll be okay
But Richardson is clearly worried
-- David and Elise
In the history of ballet there've only been a handful of people who actually did ballet the way it's supposed to be done
Forme that just made it completely addictive
Do you ever get nervous when people watch you
Not really
Do you get anxious when you make 'a speech
get more anxious alone in my apartment than in front of an auditorium full of people
Everything's backwards for me
(
hate to interrupt
They turn to see Charlie'''aynor
tXT Richardson turns to a colleague, Melton, who steps through the "bar house" door
(re: Charlie's arrival) Nice work
-- How did you find me
Does it matter
( ) 2/12/09 53
(') Elise, pleasure to see you again
( ) There's a crowd of people standing around downtown waiting for you
Your speech
He's announcing today
At the speech
It's okay
What's okay
It's not okay
The one thing you can't be this
time around is impulsive
That's why we're announcing the way we are, ' -- God, don't skip this for me
told you 'm not letting you out of my sight
David, what the hell
(to Elise, realizing a way out of his dilemma) Come with me
Come and watch
() Okay
Her phone buzzes with a text message
(to both of them) Great
Perfect solution
Now, let's pay and get you over there
Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check
Now
The speech is in 30 minutes
2/12/09 54
can't then
(indicating text message) They just moved my dress rehearsal to noon
David's own sixth sense kicks in
Has he been discovered
We can reschedule the speech
David
( ) Thank you
David looks around for anything out of the ordinary, any sign of Richardson or his men
But
they stay out of view
He thinks they're not on to him yet
'll meet you right after the rehearsal
Where does your company perform
We're n in our space
There was a`;apower ot outage or something
(checking the text) We're using a space" on Murray and West Broadway today
() That's four blocks from where you're speaking
David reacts: Richardson can't be behind that
You can literally walk there after the speech
David nods, his suspicions fading
( ) But we've got to leave right now
2/12/09 55
-- Richardson and his team watch as David, convinced now he's still undiscovered, stands up and heads to the door with Charlie and Elise
The "four blocks" thing was a brilliant move, boss
(putting his hat on) We're not out of the woods yet
He looks down at the inflection points in McCrady's Planbook
-- David and Charlie and Elise walk:toward the side
entrance
( :) 've got to go that way
to stop by my apartment and change
Okay
David and Elise stop to say goodbye to-each other
You know, the speech on election night, you said  inspired you
wish  could do that again now
Richardson makes a small hand motion in Charlie's direction
-- Charlie's iphone buzzes
It's an alarm reminder
text appears: "15 minute sound check
" He's a few feet from-- David leans toward Elise-- 2/12/09 56
() David, the speech starts in 15 minutes
We have a 25 minute drive
-- Richardson makes a gesture at the  by the bar
The picture changes (though we can't see to what)
He then moves a water glass on'their table
The sun hits the glass and reflects into the bar area where-- -- --the reflection catches the eye of a 40 year-old woman having a coffee at the bar with, her 65 year-old mother
Turning so the sun is out of,=hereyes causes the daughter to notice the : an image of David's famous concession speech from three years ago
screen graphic reads "Announcing Today
" As the daughter turns back to look at her mother, she notices David, over her mom's shoulder
David squeezes her hand
and leans in again-- just want to (0
) hope the rumors are true, Congressman
David pulls back fr`bm Elise, suddenly self-conscious, turns to see the 40-year old woman Richardson just manipulated
She points at the  report on David's announcement
40 - You have my vote
65 - Mine too
and  usually disagree with her
Thanks
Thanks a lot
David turns back to Elise
2/12/09 57
() Well, you're really just a hit with women of all ages, aren't you
-- On the phone
'm wrangling him right now-- Whatever happens
'm not going to let anything stand between us this time
It's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what David has gone through
She gives him a quizzical look
But she's also moved by his,tone Okay
:
believe you
Of course tend to believe in the wrong people
Especially men
It's the kind of quip that's more truth than jest
Not this time
He leans in to kiss her-- -- horrified look from Richardson-- -- David kisses Elise on the cheek
But he lingers
Then pulls
away without going further
'll see you in two hours
2/12/09 58
-- Richardson and his colleagues all breathe a large sigh of relief
as they watch David leave
We're okay
That was way too close
What the hell is going on with this case
-- David and Charlie ride in the back
Charlie looks at David
What
've just never seen you like that
David can't possibly explain
"'m going to-postpone my announcement to have brunch with a woman
" Postpone any speech know she made an impression on you but this is
Charlie just shakes his head, unable to comprehend
beat
"What is it about her
() don't know
-- David pulls up outside
Hundreds of his supporters and the press are waiting for him
He gets out of the car to cheers
-- Richardson stands with McCrady on the upper level of a two- story lobby looking out at David arriving for his speech
2/12/09 59
'  -- Elise changes into her dance gear
Big smile on her face
She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and her smile fades
She takes it and puts it in a drawer
Her phone vibrates
She has a text message: "Power back on at
Rehearsal at noon
" -- McCrady hangs up a silver cell phone and nods at Richardson: "it's done
" Just then Richardson's phone buzzes
The caller  says: "Mr
Donaldson
" Richardson
Yes, sir
Believe me, it was a surprise to me too
But think we have it under control
-- Elise and her friend, , 20s, stretch between routines
An unexpected smile spreads across Elise's face
Oh, you're clone
You're gone
-- half-dozen news organizations, film the speech
'm here today to honor that, and to announce my intention to run for the United States Senate
-- Just tell me if he disappears one more time you'll never take his call again
Don't worry
That's definite
2/12/09 60
-- The audience applauds energetically
David nods "thank you" and steps away from the lectern they set up
He shakes two or three people's hands but then heads inside the building
-- David huddles inside with Charlie
Reporters outside are in front of their cameras filing their stories amidst the lingering crowd
Good Morning America at 7am tomorrow, then you have the bankers group
David, are you listening
David's staring out the window
The sunlight has caught the building across the street just right to illuminate Richardson and McCrady on the second floor
-- ( ) ' 11-keep you = posted, sir
Richardson hangs up the phone and turns
t look out at David
As he does he real zes David can see him
` emit
Richardson-steps back out of the sunlight
- What
Get out of the sunlight
McCrady, notices David looking, jumps back out of the light
() cannot get a break on this case
-- Charlie is trying to understand what David's staring at
2/12/09 61
have to see Elise now
After you go back out there and talk to the New York channels-- Tomorrow
After
He heads for the door
Charlie follows
No, we need this on the nightly-- (catching up to David and ) David
Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the right words to say to a friend
Every time we get close
you do something to derail it
beat
There's a truth to that
David knows it
But-- This is different
Trust me, it's different
David leaves
-- David looks at thepiece of
paper
An
address on West Broadway for "Nyman Studios " He's standing at the locked front door
No one inside
Richardson is on to him
The surprise on his face turns to anger
then resolve
He dials Elise's number on his cell
Gets voicemail
Elise
doubt you'll ever get this message but-- David dials 411
Can  have the number for the Manhattan Modern Ballet
2/12/09 62
He looks down to see his phone has zero bars
-- David goes to the saleswoman
-- Through the window we see he saleswoman dial a number
then look at the phone and shrug
It's dead
She and David go to her computer
She looks at it, puzzled
It's dead too
to  Richardson and McCrady
He's going to go next door:
Just then David exits the furniture store and goes next door to a clothing store-- You can't keep
-thephones and internet down on the whole block, for too much
longer without running into ripple problems
-- David enters :
and goes to an agent
'  --
Thagent Googles "Manhattan:Modern Ballet
" Nothing shows RtAL Could itbe called something else
Do you have a phone book
David gets to the phone book page that ends with "Manhattan Mobile Phone Company
" The next page is torn out
David slams his fist down
2/12/09 63
-- David exits the office to find Richardson on the sidewalk
With McCrady nearby
There is an entire world of women out there
thought  made it clear this one was off limits
David takes off walking
must have forgotten
It's been a while
Doesn't change the fact
David looks around, trying to figure out his next move
Why are you so
determined to keep us apart
You know: why
The Plan
If there is a Pi ri you misread it
There's no misreading what the Plan says about you and Elise
It's unequivocal
Then your Plan's wrong
Do you realize who wrote this Plan
don't care
Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall
Well you should
You need to learn a little more respect
David shoves him off
Looks like he might take a swing at Richardson
Then his eye catches the complex diagram that McCrady is looking at in his Planbook
2/12/09 64
Why are you keeping us apart
Because the Plan calls for it
-- () You put us together three times-- That was chance
That wasn't us
Three times
Bullshit
If 'm not supposed to be with her then why do feel like this
It doesn't matter what you feel
It matters what's in black and white
David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in Richardson's eyes
David stops
then his whole expression changes
You don't know, do you
You don't know why they're keeping us apart
() 'It's not something your mind could :comprehend
You're in a nice suit but the reality is you're just a minion aren't you
David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy restaurant
McCrady quickly consults his Planbook
He's deciding how to-- () Uh
oh-- -- David strides in and goes right to a chair
Stands on it
2/12/09 65
() Excuse me ladies and gentleman-- (as people turn and look, ) 'm sorry to disturb your lunch have a bit of an emergency
Is there anybody in this room who's ever seen a performance of the Manhattan Modern Ballet
-- From outside, Richardson and McCrady watch
Son of a bitch
He's smart
He's very smart
David exits the restaurant from another door
He hurries toward West Broadway
-- Not a taxi in sight
David looks for one in vain
Suddenly Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David
Maybe you should try the subway
David holds him in a steely gaze
' Don't all those cab drivers you're diverting have Plans too
What about all the other people looking for cabs in this part of the city right n6t
What about their Plans
The ripples must be endless
Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out
don't care what you put in my way, 'm not going to give up
David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there
2/12/09 66
-- Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a very busy intersection
You've got two more minutes keeping taxis off West Broadway before-- () need something that's going to keep him in place longer-- -- On foot, David heads West towards Hudson St
Several taxis pass with their roof lights off;
Suddenly, down the street, he sees one with his roof light on
He runs for
it when-- -- twenty feet in front of him two cars collide
Metal crunches and glass breaks
This is no fender bender-- Jesus:
, (looks for Richardson) Is this how far you people will go
He rushes toward the accident-- -- An hour later
Four police cars and an ambulance
They treating one of the accident"s victims for minor scrapes ]avid is getting intervie,ved by a police officer
Unfortunately you're the only witness, Congressman
How much longer
few more minutes
'm sorry know you have to meet somebody
didn't say  had to meet anyone
Well
just assumed-- 2/12/09 67
-- Richardson is watching David get interviewed-- Amateur
That's an amateur's mistake
--
-- You're not a real cop, are you
You're one of them
Somebody could have been killed in that crash
Doesn't that make you-- " " Sir, calm down
But David's already walking away
Sergeant
He goes to the highest ranking guy on the
scene
know you heed a statement from me, but do  have to stay here to give it to you or-- No, sir, we know ow to get in touch with you
, Thank you
'
Is this man under your command
David turns to see that the "Police Officer" who was interviewing him is gone
-- David gets into a taxi
2/12/09 68
-- 17th Street between 10th and 11th
And sir, you might have to break some traffic laws getting there
So take this
He hands him a $100 bill
light that just turned green -- Go through that-- The driver blows through it as it turns re Richardson and McCrady are in front of a hip cafe arguing
want more red liUhtss-- (,consulting Planbook) There are too many, ripples in the system
Cumm
lative effects are
coming into play
traffic jam
That's even w r
We have to get more localize
Richardson looks at the taxi disappearing up Hudson
He's getting out of range
/  -- Richardson and McCrady rush through the cafe and into the , surprising the  so completely that he can't even manage a word before they throw open the insulated door to the   and run inside
Hey
2/12/09 69
The chef charges over and pulls open the door to find -- refrigerated food
And nothing else
Richardson and McCrady have disappeared
The chef blinks
--  -- Richardson and McCrady rush from a storage room to the showroom of a fancy art gallery
Patrons stare as they rush straight out the front door and onto Gansevoort Street
8TH  -- David's taxi is hitting all the lights iiow
-- Richardson and McCrady move swiftly down the block
Richardson heads up the stairs of a brownstone
Opens the door to see a street in Chinatown
He slams the door shut
Wrong one
(thinks)
Two doors down
God,  hate downtown
17TH  -- David's taxi heads down 17th from 8th Avenue
17TH Richardson and McCrady step out of the service door of a l ilding on the corner of 10th Avenue and 17th
They can see a taxi, pulling up in front of the Manhattan Modern Ballet buildig down the block
They run towards it
(: ) 've got inflection points
All they have to do is catch sight of each other this time-- What
2/12/09 70
/
-- David opens the door to Elise's dance company, oblivious to Richardson's pursuit
-- , is nearby as David speaks to the receptionist comes from a door across the room
Is she expecting you
He nods
hope you realize how lucky you are
'm the friend
Lauren
17TH  -- Richardson dons his fedora as he races toward the studio
Can ' block the front door
He's already through Pit
RICHARDS6N The next one
Lauren walks David toward the door with the music behind it
It goes without saying that 'll kill you if you hurt her
() And by the way, congratulations on your announcement
17TH  -- Richardson and McCrady down the street
(re: diagram, confused) There are several next ones-- 2/12/09 71
() 'm blocking them all-- His hand stretches out (as Harry did early on in film) Wait, he's-- /   -- pours out as David opens the door
quarter of the way open, the door stops dead
-- Richardson grabs the front door and pulls
It's sealed shut
It won't budge
- Hat
Hat
McCrady is behind him He points
at Richardson's fedora, which is on the sidewalk
Fell off when he ran
Richardson sprints to grab it-- --= David looks through the narrow space of the open door and sees Elise dancing
The piece she's practicing fuses the gra e -ballet with the raw emotion of modern
She's i12xl eattaking
'm in serious trouble here
/
-- Richardson dashes back to the door-- ( ) Forget it
He's already there
Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring through the partially open door to the rehearsal room
2/12/09 72
Dammit
McCrady's phone buzzes
He pulls it out and looks at the caller
() It's Mr
Donaldson
Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in his hands
David turns just in time to see this
At the same time David realizes the door is no longer "stuck
" Celebrate while you can
They'll just kick it upstairs now You have no idea what you're up against
David just looks at him
He'll deal with that when it comes
Sir
Richardson grabs the phone and answers --
going outside to talk
David turns back to the dance studio
He opens the door to get an unobstructed view of Elisee,
She spins, arches, dips
David can't take his eyes off hey` When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes, Elise gives David a
little wave
Then they start again
David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but he's gone
-- defeated Richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs
-- Richardson walks down a hallway with an impossibly shiny black floor and enters a doorway marked "Mr
Donaldson
" '   -- Two secretaries look up at him
2/12/09 73
#1 He's waiting for you
'  -- Much larger than Richardson's office and on a higher floor
, 45, sits at his desk reading a document
After a moment he signs it at the bottom and looks up, Richardson, who is standing awkwardly in front of his superior's desk
Donaldson motions for him to sit down
-- now
David talks to Elise, who's showered and dressed You're incredible
How did you get that good
It's all  do
It's the only thing ever wante& to be
And  started young
How young
By third grade  was going every day after school
That's a lot of motivation for an eight year-old
She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby and they exit on to-- 17TH  --  -- We moved around a lot then
Dance was kind of my stability
Sure
it was the only constant in your life, aside from your parents
2/12/09 74
Really more the dance
She doesn't make a big deal of it but we get it
Oh
David's phone buzzes
Caller  shows it's Charlie
take it this is an unauthorized social break
'm a candidate for the -:Serrate
don't have to punch out''when leave
David sends the call to voice
mai Charlie
Couple houtrs while 'm out of touch won't:ill him
Couple hour, huh
Well, we better make them,,-,--'count
-- taxi pulls tpAa stop
- bavid 'leans over Elise to look out thew n4ow as he waits fot change from the driver
What's this-Pi12- What's it look like
We see the reflection of a dance club in the window
'm a terrible dancer
don't dance
Elise climbs out
David follows
You don't now
By the end of the night, you will
2/12/09 75
They walk towards "Plan ", a hip joint with zebra wallpaper and fake palm trees
Salsa music pulses from inside
You're going to teach me to dance in one night
Not happening
Are you doubting me
Yes
She spins and shoves him against the wall
Forcefully kisses him
Then pulls free
Don't
She turns and walks into the club
David stands there
Holy shit
'  -- Richardson sits across from Donaldson
The disciplinary rules requ-te me to
demote you in rank and re-assign yot to a less desirable post
Donaldson Aingers the document he just signed
'm going-'to interpret those rules loosely
'm going to go easy on you because, feel the deck was stacked ,against you
In a  shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson's sit nearby
'm talking about the intense chemistry between them, the constant inflection points, and the kicker of course: you pulling them apart only to have "chance" put them back together
Twice
That seemed impossible
So  asked Burdensky to do some research this morning, which he just completed
2/12/09 76
It seems like these two were meant to be together because they were meant to be together
What
Were, in the past, in an earlier version of the plan
Actually a dozen earlier versions
() God knows how many artifacts pushing them together are left in the current plan
-- live salsa band has just started
Elise demonstrates Mambo for David
Couldn't be farther from the style of dance he just saw her rehearse
But she's amazing at it
Serious, serious
trouble
Salt, Patron, lime
'-
and two glasses dotin on the bar
Ready
Nope
Perfect
She yanks him onto the dance floor
'  -- Donaldson, Richardson, Burdensky
Why was it changed
2/12/09 77
Something important
They went from "meant to be together" to "red- letter denied relationship" in a single Plan revision a few years back
As for why, specifically, that's apparently above even my pay grade
-- David and Elise dance
He sucks, but doesn't care
couple of people in the club recognize him and give him thumbs up
--' Burdensky and a dejected Richardson walk down the hall
You spend your whole career hoping that one day you'll get a "red- letter" case
Something you can really make a name for yourself with
Finally  get one
and it's
booby-trapped
' Another set of shot glasses hit the bar
to  David and Elise
Okay, we've al-ready used up an hour, we >etter hurry
She pills him toward the exit
Hurry where
-- Elise does a sexy, street variation on a two-step to an up- tempo pop-country ballad
David tries to follow along, mostly by bobbing his head with the beat
Sort of with the beat
You've got to let yourself feel the music
2/12/09 78
've been told  have trouble feeling
Whoever said that hasn't seen you speak
That's different
mean-- What
In private
With women AlthOugh that might be changing
Is there any style of dance you can:'t do
' ,  -- David and Elise walk from the waterfront to the street
Next stop, the best 80s club in the city
You ready
To make an ass of myself for the third time in one night
A4`r, 6'
() Race me to that light
You lose, you dance,  watch
You win, dance, you watch ' What are'the rules of the race--- No rules
Hmmm, could get ugly
He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something
When she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell-- You bastard
He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards
2/12/09 79
Quit complaining and run
She catches up
He spins and digs it out
He can't dance, but he sure can run
He pulls away and wins
Yes
He pumps his arms in a victory dance
( ) That was good
That was very good
You said "no rules"
She punches him in the stomach
Hard
He crumples, completely unprepared for it
( ) Sweet Jesus
Christ on a crutch
() You said you had trouble feeling
You're insane
We
need a cab
He'laughing through the'pain
'm serious
You're a maniac
You should come with a warning label
do
You just can't see it with my clothes on
David biting his lip
and - the music-- /
,   ,  -- David and Elise walk into the synthesizer prelude to " Can't Wait" by Nu Shooz
2/12/09 80
Doesn't this song make you feel like you're at your high school prom
was six when it came out
So, not really
Brutal
David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls him to the dance floor
Baby
1-- can't wait-- As the song kicks in and David and Elise start dancing couple of kids next to them notice David and start pointing and signaling their approval- The kids who first spotted David have alerted a few others
More people in the crowd cheer him on
'S_OFFICE -- Donaldson stares pensively out the , window,: looking down over the city
' So we're going operational
This is exciting
It's been a while
We r t no ti go p etational No one ever
mad& to my job by taking stupit i12Aris,s
' --= ' We're going to kick this case upstairs
to someone with the latitude to clean up this mess without breaking into a sweat
We're going to walk this upstairs to Thompson
' Thompson
Are we even allowed to go to him directly
He's a Senior 2/12/09 81
Exec
' Isn't he the one
when he was in the field his nickname was-- "The Hammer
" Yes
He'll crush this romance with the flick of his hand
And he'll thank me for giving him the opportunity
David and Elise dancing
Cause  can't wait,
this
is what 've been waiting for-- People on the dance floor are literally screaming in support
-- ; David and Elise stand on the pier outside the dance club
You grew up over there
She indicatesa residential area just behind the docks
() spent any, entire childhood three blocks up Carroll Street
We didn'
t move-` around a lot
What were you like as a
kid
Before sixth grade  spent about half my time in the principal's office
You
Really
The only person who spent as much time down there as me was a girl had a huge crush on so  didn't mind too much
2/12/09 82
smile spreads on Elise's face
(re: the docks) Did your dad work here
No
My dad filled vending machines
And you're going to be a senator
After my brother died my Dad wanted to get me out of town for a while
We went to Washington and the day we arrived he took meto the
Capitol
We ended up sitting in the Senate gallery;,all day
(re: Financial' District across the river) We could see that from the end of my block, but-be never once encouraged me to go to Wall Street
His idol was
He thought business guys were selfish
So
areyou doing all this-:f
or him
want to matter
don't think that's just forrhim
Elise,
tucks her head into his shoulder
don't want tonight to mess anything
up for you, for the campaign
Just make sure  make it to Diane Sawyer on time and 'll be fine
Elise looks at him for a long beat
You're different
somehow you make me believe
Believe what
2/12/09 83
Just
believe, period
'   -- on the window of an apartment
'  -- David and Elise make love,  so  that even their faces are not always sharp
'  -- David and Elise lie together, spent
(vulnerability we barely glimpsed before this) don't let people in, David
And never let them in this quickly
David pulls her close
, He-,can't see her eyes
But we can
She's struggling with something more
haven'::t lead a perfect life don't want perfect
,
, :(emotion,weI9ing) 'm trying to say
'm not sure somebody running
for office can have, me in their life
David turns her around so he can see her face, so he knows for sure she hears this: haven't stopped thinking about you since the moment  met you want you in my life-- There are skeletons in my closet, David
The kind that-- Listen to me-- 2/12/09 84
The kind that people use against-- Elise, listen
don't care
We'll work it out
've spent my whole life wondering why it takes auditoriums of people to fill the empty space inside me
Then  met you
and realized it doesn't
She looks at him
He means it
You scare me
(after a beat) That wasn't the effect  was going for
She smiles
then laughs out-loud-- -- David and Eliseirsleep peacefully
, late 50s, standing next to the bed in a suit, with a fedora on
'   -- Thompson
exits through the frt door
Three aides are waiting for him
Mft ' What do you aiat to do
Let it happen again
7 Thompson's aides seem surprised by the answer
'  --  -- David wakes to find Elise looking at him
You been up long
No
2/12/09 85
Did you wake up in
the middle of the night
Slept straight through
thought you never sleep through
don't
() told you, you scare me
He kisses her
won't hurt you
They kiss more
and then get swept up by it
They lie in bed, post-coital, drained
Blissful
Until the phone rings
It's 6:17 am
Early for a call
Hello
:Why, are you calling
() No
Look,  have to go
She hangs up
David looks at her
What's wrong
That was my , ex
Adrian
Oh
didn't--  guess we hadn't gotten to that stuff yet
He hasn't called since we broke up
How long
Three months
Was it serious
2/12/09 86
An awkward beat
Elise opts for complete honesty
We were engaged
What happened
Complete honesty
He left
David can feel this in the pit of his stomach now
What an idiot
You don't know me that well yet
You're still in the wishful thinking phase
() Truth is  should
;-Have left him a long time before he left me
It was a ,ain' l relationship
It hurt tb be i-h it every day
But it was:h'ard to leave
& knew what buttons
, tb push
`' that him
DtTid paints at pica re of Elise with an attractive man, arms wound each other
lis'e looks surprised, shocked even, to tY%'e photo on her b okcase
She nods
David
It's not
It's over between us
Completely over want to be clear about that
'm pretty sure yesterday was the most perfect day 've ever had
Me too
David looks at the clock
have this Diane Sawyer interview
2/12/09 87
It comes out awkward
know
So did that
They look at each other
Then David reaches for his clothes-- Can  come
My dress rehearsal's not until nine
David's face lights up
'm afraid if  let you out of my sight
you know
might never see you again
smile creeps across his face
-- Diane Sawyer interviewsDavid
You've overcome enormous obstacles in your life and risen to-such heights so quickly
People are fascinated by you
Only people who haven't spent enough time with ' me to know the 'truth
-- - Elise watches the:nterview on a big monitor
soundproof window allows her tb see directly into the studio
As a speaker and politician you've been repeatedly compared to
By my campaign manager mostly
( ) () You're the youngest person ever elected to Congress
Which you celebrated by getting in a bar fight on inauguration night
2/12/09 88
With a childhood friend
So don't think that counts
And, truthfully, that's how we celebrate things we're 'm from
-- (grinning bigger now) Let's just say you have a habit of getting into the press for
other uniquely human things as well-- that a euphemism, Diane
She laughs
Most politicians
-- ( ) run aw ay from the embarrassing things they've done Yoti,crack, jokes about them
You embrace, them
Especially since your
;, concession speech thr ee years ago which started as a `sstd-up routine and brought tears to my,eyes by the ,end when you talked about losing Your mother to Lancer and then your older brother,,Pdt, to an overdose, both whei
you:were only ten years old
:,
-- think Americans are tired of electing automatons whose every word and move is stage-managed so as not to offend anyone
think they want somebody who doesn't hide who he is or what he really believes
guess 'm hoping they want to elect someone who's actually like them
() But  could be very wrong about that
2/12/09 89
And if you are
You'd be surprised at the number of underwear companies that have approached me to be their spokesman
Diane bursts out laughing
The floor techs are laughing too
-- And so is Elise
She's completely smitten
: Diane turns to the camera, trying to stop laughing
( ) Unfortunately, we're out of time
David Norris, announced his candidacy for  Senate yesterday
Thanks for stopping by
It goes to commercial
-- David stays to speak to Diane for a moment-as we  to find a stagehand'who is shifting the position of one of the big video cameras sed to tape the show
We catch a glimpse of his face and see it's Thompson's aide
Ma'am, Congressman Norris asked me to give you a message
We   from his  to  that the man is another one of Thompson's aides
#2 ( ) He was just called into a meeting that he says is urgent
He says he'll call you later and see you at your show tonight
2/12/09 90
-- David and Diane say goodbye to each other
He salutes the floor staff, who actually applaud
They love him
(to David, re: earpiece) They're saying your girlfriend -- can we call her that
Is this one going to last more than a month
You can call her that
And yes
Definitely
David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks
It says: " want to go to bed with you
" They're saying she's getting a tour of the control room in studio
Can somebody take Congressman Norris to studio
Thompson's aide signals David to follow him
David does
They walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor
-- Thompson's aide leads him through a heavy door marked "Studio " into a, vestibule and then through another heavy door into-- '': " -- partially-built set in the center of an empty stage
Elise isn't here
Thompson's aide feigns surprise
'  #2 They said she was here
Hang on
David pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal
He looks up to see Thompson's aide exit through the stage door
It suddenly clicks for David, and he rushes to the door
Yanks on it
It's locked
God dammit
2/12/09 91
-- Through the thick window of the outer door we can see David pounding on the window of the inner door
But we can't hear a sound
to  Thompson's aide removing the"Studio " placard
Beneath is the true designation: "Studio
" to  three Thompson aides removing a false wall that was hiding a bunch of construction equipment and setting up "No Entry -- Construction Zone" signs
-- 1) David across the room tugs on another exit
It's locked
2) David pulls a fire alarm
Nothing
3) David slams on the door with a two-by-four
-- 1) Diane Sawyet talks about the issue of the day as we pull back and show her
co-hosts on the couch
2) Elise arrives in the lobby of the Manhattan Modern Ballet for her company's dress rehearsal
( "
'
") -- David sits
His tie
loose now
His jacket off
He glances at his blackberry
the time reads 4:13 pm
He yells in frustration
If people could hear you out there it wouldn't be a very good soundstage, would it
David turns to see Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit and fedora
My name's Thompson
What happened to Free Will
2/12/09 92
Who said anything about Free Will
David stares back at him
You know, we actually tried Free Will before
After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire we stepped back to see how you'd do on your own
You gave us the Dark Ages -- for five centuries -- until finally we: decided we should come back in
() The Chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off again
So we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revoluton
:i12we spent six hundred years tempering your passions with reason
,then in 1910 we stepped ba i12c again
Within fifty yearsi12you brought us World War , the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the Holocaust ani capped it off by bringingtheentire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban Missile Crisis
decisiOfl was taken atthat point that we' should stop in again before Aou did _soittething even we Cduldn't fix
() You on't have_ Free Will, David, you have the appearance of Free =Will
You expect me
'to believe that
( ) You have Free Will over what tie you pick in the morning, or what beverage to order at lunch
But humanity just isn't mature enough to have control over the important things
If you're in control of the important things then you're incompetent cause when  look around at the world these days it seems pretty fucked
2/12/09 93
It's still here
If we'd left things in your hands, it wouldn't be
Why are you trying to keep me from Elise
Or are you just another lackey who doesn't really know
Thompson studies David for a long beat
Then decides it's time to level with him
We put Elise in front of you three years ago to inspire you to,
g `ve that speech -- the speech that pulled you back from the brink of oblivion and, overnight, itiade
you the front runner for this coming election
The intervention on Charlie was to prevent the hedge fund you had just become vice chairman of from going belly up in the sub-prime=crisis, bringing two major banks down
with it, arid in , the process making you unelectable
David blinks
Tries to, process this
:
bAVID Are you s aying you warit me to win this election
THOMP50N, This 'one and six mom, after it
And t'm not just talking about `elections ' for Senate
lowly dawns on David what Thompson is saying
You can matter, David
Really matter
What you wanted your whole life
What your father wanted when he took you to the Senate gallery when you were ten
What your brother wanted when he made you promise, the day before he overdosed, that you wouldn't be like him
Stop
Don't tell me this
2/12/09 94
Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people
and that terrible emptiness when you're not
Stop
David you are meant to change the world
But that doesn't happen if you stay with her
Why does it matter to you who love
Some skeleton of hers `is so bad  won't get elected
don't believe that
It's not about her-:
it's about you, what being with her does to - - What does that mean
'm better with her than  ever was alone
, You just said it
That speech-- 1HOMPSON Yes
The speech
Put it this wad: in small doses, Elise was the cure
But in large doses
When you're enthralledwith someone she ' rubs off on you:
Stop
Just: stop
David, the president can't be a -- Stop talking
It's not working
() 'm a politician
spend my life with professional liars
With people who decide what they want and then figure out the story they have to tell to get it
2/12/09 95
Why do you refuse to accept what should be completely obvious by now
You've seen what we can do
You can't doubt we are who we say we are
don't care who you are
don't care who's orders you're following
You can't outrun your fate, David
Who said anything about running
Maybe we should just reset you
We both know if you could have we wouldn't be standing here having this conversation
Thompson stares back
He's never dealt with such temerity
You fight us, we will take everything from you
You already did once
' And 'm still standing
() always knew you were out there
We all do
It's the one thing we have in common
Whether we call it God or the Devil or Fate we all know you're out there, fucking with us
You'd still be living in caves if it weren't for us
( ) You crush our dreams because they don't fit with your Plan
Your Plan that has no space for me falling in love but somehow has room for Tsunamis and cyclones and Darfur and
Fuck your plan
reject it
reject you
() 2/12/09 96
(') The only thing we have in this fucked up world are the choices we make
And there's nothing you can do to me that will get me sign them away
() Kill me
Or erase me
Or let me go
Thompson stares back at him, dumbfounded
long silence, : It's 6:20
If you leave now, you'll make Elise's show
David's eyebrows go up
Huh
Thompson is letting him go
:
-- David jumps into a taxi
-- David sits in the back seat, taking everything in, turning it over and over in his head
' -- ' Elise and twb of her colleagues "finish a dance piece
The audience explodes into applause
The house lights come up half way as the stage is readied for the next piece,
David is startled to see that the man in the aisle seat next to-him is Thompson
-4 She's a beautiful dancer
What do you want
There's one more piece to all this haven't told you
guess didn't have the heart
If you stay with her, it doesn't just kill your dreams, it kills hers
What
2/12/09 97
Elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country
and eventually one of the greatest choreographers in the world
() If she stays with you
she ends up teaching dance to eight year-olds
don't believe you
thought we already established that
beat
When you look back at all this, David, just remember, we tried to reason with you
Thompson gets up and leaves
just as the lights go down for the next dance
David watches him go
then turns around just in time to catch Elise's entrance into the dance -- a graceful jump
When she lands, her ankle cracks, and she falls
The audience gasps
: a floor board tilted oddly
It goes back to normal
: His hand slightly outstretched
instantly knows something is wrong
David jumps up and runs down to the
: stage door
dancer comes from off stage and helps Elise off the floor as the show continues
-- company staff member is examining Elise's ankle while the show goes on
David arrives
Sees Elise's face
Tears streaming down her cheeks
Seeing David
If it's broken
my career's over
Don't say that
Don't
2/12/09 98
-- The taxi rushes to the hospital
David holds her
Silently trying to comfort her
But he can't look at her
-- David carries her from the taxi into the emergency room
-- David sits in a black chair, alone, staring at the floor
-- Elise lies on an exam table as -a tech x-rays her ankle
David is still staring at the floor
He looks-up to see Thompson
always hear people saying "you yourself for what can't bla M4' hpens fih other people," but in this case, really, you can
David stands up
and punnhesThompson in `the face
h  ompson is knocked onto his ass
People in the waiting room stare at David
Almost everyone here knows his fade
He looks at them, unable to summon his usual wit
This is what you do, David
( ) This is what you did the first night you got elected
This is what you did at that college reunion
We give you opportunities people would kill for and you squander them with impulse
It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly going to help you with that
() 2/12/09 99
(') You want to know why you can't have her
Look in the mirror
Thompson leaves
-- More -rays of Elise's ankle
An orthopedic surgeon enters and examines the images on the computer screen
Elise, her face, still red and tear stained tries to read the ' How bad is it
The surgeon turns to her with a classic doctor's detachment: -- -- David sits alone on a bench
Thompson arrives
You're an educated man
You've read the Greek tragedies`
In the end Fate always wins
David looks back at him in steely silence
It a sprain
Really
This time
(') Do you really want to watch her lose the only thing she's ever cared about
You just got the tiniest taste of what that looks like
The thought makes David ill
Walk away
If you truly love her, walk away
She'll hate you for it
but that way she'll be able to let you go quickly
You can give her that at least
2/12/09 100
-- David stands alone
Stares at the floor
Finally confronting the fact that he can't beat the forces arrayed against him
Finally ready to make the choice being forced upon him
-- David enters to find Elise with a huge smile on her face
It's a sprain
It's just a sprain
David gives her a tight hug
It's going to be okay
The doctor said it would heal in' a month
maybe even less
You're going to: be fine
They want to do an
to assess the ligament
damage but
: -
They break from them hug
It's; going to be fine
And as incredible of a dancer as you already are, yot're just going to get better and better
DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling in his eyes
have to go make a few calls
His voice cracks
Elise notices
You okay
'm just
happy for you
-- David walks down a long corridor away from Elise's room
2/12/09 101
-- David exits the building
Thompson is waiting by the door
You're doing the right thing, David
Not just for her, and the world
but for yourself
David looks at him for a beat, then turns and walks away into the night
--    -- on a  screen, then   to  the diner
( ): David Norris, who'has spent the last two days campaigning in the tri-lakes area, got some welcome news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll gave him a sixteen point lead over his opponent less than
a month before election dg t
Charlie
He sits` at a booth eating breakfast as he watches  behind the counter
Charlie glan ces out the window ad we  David standing on the back of apickup truck speaking to eighty people in the parking lot
`:It's Autumn now
So etthing about his{,speaking style has changed
He's not as ima ea or passion te
:Hedoesn't seem to enjoy it as much is he Adid three years ago
Just then a campaign aide arrives at Charlie's table
How's he doing
They still love him
Papers
The aide hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers, the Times, the Journal, and the three big  tabloids
Thanks
2/12/09 102
The aide leaves
Charlie glances at the front page of the Times, then reaches for the New York / Region section
As he does the front page of the Arts section catches his eye
There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split," accompanying an article titled "Dance Takes a Quantum Leap
" Charlie glances through the window at David who is climbing down from the pickup truck to applause from his parking lot audience
-- David shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his speech
They really do love him
, Charlie reads the New York Times
article
It begins: "Once in a generation a piece is created of such astounding originality and virtuosity that it single-handedly reshapes
the
world of dance
" As he makes his way, towards the diner'f-tom the parking lot, shaking handb and allowing his picture to be taken
: ,    -- David sits down with Charlie
'm started
'm going to show you this because you'd find out eventually and because  want to be here when you do
Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it
Elise's photo has a noticeable impact on David
He glances at the article for a moment
Then Charlie points down near the bottom, at a particular : 2/12/09 103
"The show's choreographer, Adrian Troussant, and lead dancer, Elise Sellas, are partners on and off stage and plan to marry in New York next week
" David stares at the words
David
(off no response) David
think  need
Take a day off
Take a couple
We're sixteen points up
( ) Even  can't blow a lead that big
, It's pouring rain
David walks down Carroll Street
Most of the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs
Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is clearly in the early'stages of gentrification
David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes by
Was this his house
/
-- There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in the window
David enters this classic dive bar and goes to the bartender
Do you still serve neighborhood guys here or just the tourists
The bartender smiles big
couple people at the bar notice him
Then others notice and they start whooping it up for him
He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him
-- David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers, holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag
2/12/09 104
There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls
figure in a suit approaches David from behind
He turns to see the man
Why are you here
to  Harry, in a suit and raincoat
would have come earlier but  had to wait for the rain
(off David's confusion) Water interferes with their ability to sense your decision tree
That's why we met on a boat last time
() guess 'm here to set the record straight
About what
- Thompson was lying when he said they couldn't let you be with 8lise because :it would bring out your reckless side
Why, then
Why do they care so much
8ecause
,
she's enough, David
If you have =her r tau rtt
ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplause'and dreams of one day becoming p sident
if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul
've watched you a long time
They're right to want you in the White House
It would be good for the world
That's important but it can't be the only thing that matters
Why are you so different than they are
2/12/09 105
long beat, then: You know, your Dad was a smart man
He could have been a lot more -- and he wanted to be
So did your brother
But the Plan didn't call for that
This hits David hard
In my job, you implement the Plan
() And most of the time
you don't even know why
() 'm sorry
My mom
That wasn't me
that wasn't us at all
David takes all this in
After a;long be t he takes a drink
Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes a drink as well
When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or the White House barely hesitated
D1 But the trt t i `is after making that choice  went into a free-fall
Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to see Thompson hurt her
but  used it as an excuse
think  left her more to save my career than hers
() Thompson wasn't lying
The press is already talking about me as a future president
'm phoning in my speeches and 'm still sixteen points up in the polls
The public loves you
2/12/09 106
Before  met Elise that was all that mattered
Now  hardly notice
She's all  think about
() Do you know where she's getting married
Front of a judge
Tomorrow morning
Is she happy with him
Tell me she is and 'll walk away
Thompson won't let you get near that courthouse
Harry
is she happy
No
beat
- have to get her back
Harry knows how unlikely that is
Will you help me:i12 Just help me get to her
They'll sense )tOu coming a mile away
' What if Icould move as fast as you can
What do you mean
Teach me about the doors
How do you know about that
2/12/09 107
The first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one thought it was a hallucination at first
Eventually  realized it's how you move around so fast
(off Harry's reluctance) If you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you
okay, that's your choice
But if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine
Do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors
how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey
You know, when  do town hall meetings  usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when  walk, through' the door and when  start speaking
But when 'm done with the speech  can call on each one of them by `game
beat
've seen you do that (taking tl leap ) The rain is supposed to stop in the nexthou'r
We're going to need all night to do this
And we're going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it
Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the end of the pier
Harry dons his hat
Put your hand on my shoulder
And don't let go until we've crossed the threshold
2/12/09 108
David complies
Harry opens the door
Are they ever locked
Maybe if you have a defective hat
They step through the door and onto-- -- Harry notices as the rain slows to a drizzle
Hurry
Harry runs David to the front dooraf a brownstone
Opens the door
They move through i into-- :  -- Harry stops
David takes-his hand off Harry's shoulder
Still amazed by what they just did
We're underneath Canal Street, which c as ,, canal before rt, was a street
This is the jcity's':pumping station for downtown Manhattan
We're ten blocks from the courthouse
/
' '
-  -- Elise enters, smiles at the receptionist
Floor open
(seeing Elise's red eyes) You okay, sweetie
just feel like being on the floor
Everything still on for tomorrow
Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence
2/12/09 109
-- : something that recalls the sensei-pupil scenes in martial arts movies, but at the same time something fluid and lyrical (e
g
Yoshida Brothers, "Beyond the Deep Sea
") Harry rolls out a block-by-block map of lower Manhattan
There are intricate red pen markings all over the map
Lower Manhattan is a nightmare
Layer upon layer of substrate -- that's what we call the system of doors -- has been added over time
That makes it a lot more complex to navigate down here than it is uptown
And a lot slower
Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and exterior, all below Canal Street
You ready
Let's go
Harry smiles and hblds,
up a photograph of
the Manhattan County Court Building in Foley Squa:e:
Your destination
Courtroom Six
` '  -'; -- The  "
music here-
Elise dances to it, freestyle
The fluidity and extension of ballet, but none of its formality or stiffness
-- (struggling to remember) North Moore St
Just south of the coffee shop
Red door
come out on Broadway, near Leonard St
Harry looks at a photo of what David just described
Good
Keep going
2/12/09 110
-- Elise continues to dance
-- (eyes closed, trying to ) There's an alley in front of me
Third door on-- Thompson's there
Okay
so
(thinks, then has it) hightail it East-to Lafayette no, it's Crosby Street there
-- Nit; Elise dances
-- one wearing a hat Is
a threat
vv1Le
h e rea lizes w hat' = g oin g on , Thompson is gong to pull out all the stops
going to get reinforcement Jots of them don't care if u'see a auv wearing a Yankees ca a"yarmulke, or a bowler, as he's working for them
' Okay, you said he's right in front of me, right
Harry nods
'd knock the Yankees cap off his head and go through the door before he has a chance to pick it up
thinsmile forms on Harry's face and grows
2/12/09 111
Good
good
improvisation
We have trouble with that
-- Elise dances
-- How am  doing
Don't get cocky
You know ten permutations out of ten thousand
Get back to work
Harry drilling David with photd'after photo of Manhattan doors  with Elise dancing
until she finally quits from physical and emotional exhaustion
--
David rubs his head
He's exhausted-too
Mentally
Yourbrain can only put so much in at once
Take- a brreak
Da :} , nods
His eyg6,0s' to: Harry' s leather Planbook
He btio#ts to it -- a question: can he look at it
, Harry opens tt up to a page in the middle
David's eyes look over the impossibly complex circ$t diagram
Could  ever learn to read that
Harry shakes his head
Impossible
No matter how hard  tried
For the same reason you can't breathe underwater or flap your arms and fly
You're not built to do it
2/12/09 112
(re: circuit diagram) Is that me
Elise
Her decision tree
What it was a few hours ago, before the rain, before we were down here
David looks at it, then looks away
want to ask you what it says
what she's thinking
bit somehow that feels
wrong
You know what she's thinkin-g,'David -- as much as you need to know
The rest
well
you're`built to feel that
-- Elise exits to the street, pulls a scarf around her neck
- David closes the P14nbook
ready to get back to work
Sometl`ing about that strikes Harry
Your father used to say that
Off David's reaction-- '  -- Elise enters, turns on the light
She picks up the computer printout of her court appointment to be married
Post-it note on top of the printout reads: "Our last night apart
Love, Adrian
" 2/12/09 113
-- David and Harry examine photos of a blue door at the side of a Tribeca restaurant
The fastest path is getting to the blue door right off the bat
But you're exposed the whole way there
It's a lot riskier than leapfrogging through doors-- But if  can make it
'
Il have caught them completely bysurprise
Assuming you make it
'  -- Elise turns out the light, curling up in her bed -  : -- The early morning sun slices through the urban canyons
-- 5TH  -- the guy from'the photo in Elise's apartment -- dtands at the  f2EGTSTRPsR' s window
Do you have your license
Adrian hands her his marriage license
Is your fiancee here
Getting out of a cab downstairs
The registrar glances at the license to make sure it's in order
Then stamps it: "Judge Williams, Docket #23"
Courtroom Six
2/12/09 114
-- Harry comes down from topside, with his Planbook in hand
David is waiting anxiously down here
You got lucky
It's raining again
The marriage is scheduled for ten minutes from now
You can't jump the gun on this,,
Getting there too early is almost as bad as getting there too late
Harry looks at his updated Planbook and consults his watch
--  -- Elise and Lauren step into a-polished brass elevator from New York's Tammany Hall days
Her look is distant, disconnected
Not what you're suppoeed to look like on your wedding day
--, David is rearing to go
Finally, Harm's watch alarm beeps
It ',
t time
David breathes a sigh of relief
Harry takes the hat off h1znrhead wand hands it to -David
'm going for the blue door
Of course
(something with relentless, pounding energy of the Verve Remix of Sarah Vaughn's "Fever")
Run fast
2/12/09 115
--  -- David blows through a drab utility door into an alley
He careens around a corner onto Greenwich Street and starts an all out sprint-- '  -- Rain pelts the window as Thompson reads the newspaper
Thompson's Aide rushes in
' It was a momentary flash, and given the weather we can't be sure, but it looks like Mr
Norris may be-- -- David runs through a puddle as he races down Greenwich St
through the pouring rain
'  -- Thompson rushes
out of his office followed by his aide
- Do we have a proctor -at the wedding
--   -- Adrian kisses Elise
Hi, honey
(notices her face) You okay
Just a little queasy
Why
'm not sure
Nervous
just need a minute in the bathroom
2/12/09 116
-- Big old marble sinks, heavy wood doors
Elise enters, tears welling in her eyes
-- Thompson rushes down the hall
Three aides with him now
Cars
Cars
From here it's faster in the cars
-- David can see the blue door
He races toward it

-- Thompson and McManus speeding North
' Whoa
2/12/09 117
What
Thompson's Aide is speechless as he stares at his Planbook
What
' He just went into the substrate
Off Thompson's reaction: -- -- soaking wet David blows through the front door and skids to a stop at the security line-- -- Adrian and Lauren wait in the courtroom
Docket #22 please come forward The guy next to Adrian stands up
Adrian: throws a panicked look at Lauren
We're next
Will you check on her
:   --  -- Tht epeople in lima in front of him
He's not going to 9 1 ke 41t
David goes to the front
' It's an emergency
We all have emergencies, pal
( ) Are you David Norris

Am  making the biggest mistake of my life
2/12/09 118
() can't answer that question for you, Elise
But  will say-- (pulling self together) If you have doubts-- 'm okay
'm just nervous
You haven't done this yet
It's overwhelming
-- 'm okay

5TH     -- Lauren exits the courtroom just as David bounds up the last few stairs to reach the fifth floor
David
Where is she
Water drips from his clothes onto the marble floor
You want to explain to me-- ( ) Where is she
() 'll

David nods "thanks" and -- -- Elise turns to see him and stops cold
Hi
Why are you doing this to me
Just then the door bursts open
The suspicious man from the -- David elbows him in the face
The man drops
David
2/12/09 120
David calmly turns back to her
You're not supposed to be weeping on your wedding day, Elise
Elise fights the emotion again welling inside
You were never happy with Adrian
You told me that
Elise puts her head in her hands
This is so screwed up
Oh,-God
love you
know 've acted strangely
But,  love you
Don't do this to me
've never felt anything like
this in my life
If you care 'so much, why the hell did you disappear on me in that hospital
What are you ha
d1 g from me
Why did you diS pp`ear " Again
You fucking bastard
Why
Tears are streaming down her face
They'll reset me
-- They'll scramble my brain-- David, stop talking like this
Stop
2/12/09 121
David looks back at her
Just looks at her
Then he leans over and wipes a tear from her face
And he decides
He just decides
But at least you'll know the truth
() saw behind the curtain, Elise saw this
He opens up Harry's Planbook
Elise sees the intricate "wiring diagrams
" Sees the lines shift on the page
It startles her
It's not in their "Plan" for us to be together
So they're trying to stop us
-- Thompson and minions rush up the stairs
' Oh myGod
He just revealed us
-- Elise stares back at him
Stop talking like a crazy person
Stop making things up-- They said if we were together they'`d take dance from you and politic,s,from me
They hurt your ankle that night
They-- The door flies open again
David picks up a trash can and clobbers the fedora-wearing man who enters
He drops
-- Thompson spins to his aide, finger in his face
Call the Intervention Team
Tell them it's a square-one reset
2/12/09 122
-- An  shield on the belt of one guy David knocked out
Jesus
the cops are after you
David grabs the shield and uses it to wedge the door closed
Kicks it in so it's jammed tight
He's not a cop
He's one of them
Another body slams into the door now
But the shield holds it shut
Who's "them
" The door cracks-- Jesus, David
What's going on
David is impossibly calm
He puts his hat back on
'm going to: show you
He takes Elise's hand, opens the bathroom door, and walks her across the threshold into-- ; -- Davidand Elise step
thhgtgh
a door onto a street in Soho
She stops
Awed
Unable to speak
Come on
We need to lose them
David walks her across the street and picks a door at random, -- -- David and Elise exit through a door
Her jaw drops
Central Park's Sheep Meadow spread before them
(They've exited from the building on its north edge)
Elise steps out onto the grass, touches it, falls to her knees in the rain, completely overwhelmed
2/12/09 123
5TH   /
-- bevy of men in hats push the ladies room door open and rush in
They're shocked to see it's empty
'  -- Eliselooks at David The rain slows them down but they can track us
We have two orthree minutes
Maybe less
Elise is still speechless
He takes her hand
The ten year-old in me always mixed up winning elections with being loved
Then  met` you;,
() The thing is, if they'd let me be with you  wouldn'tk have left politipe
t, just would have beef in it, or
all the right reasons
David pauses for a moment
He can see this' so clearly in his head
How can it notbe right
Now you know
Youknota everything
And you have to leave mitie
) They'll take` dance from you
You saw what they-'did before
'fihe foundations of her world have just collapsed
but somehow she pulls herself together to say this: No
You're not safe with me
If you ' -- She puts her finger to his lip
Shhhh

It doesn't make any sense but, right now  feel safer than 've ever felt before
() 'm staying
'  -- The Chairman's Office is the size of the reading room at the New York Public Library
Thirty foot high
ceilings
dozen assistants perform various tasks very quietly, giving it more the feel of a papal court, than a corporate office
We see   from behind only
but we can still tell he is utterly calm and in complete control
An aide comes to The Chairman's--desk,
sets two open leather folios in front of him
-'" Mr
Thompson has made an emergency request for the Intervention Team
One of the folio
::documents is titled "Reset Authorization
" -- dressing room door opens
David and Elise, both soaking, exit past a startled attendant
- They walk through the store and out onto -- Tiey`look for another door
Every door
tavid nods
as they walk into another
-- Thompson and a dozen other men with hats step out into the rain, scan the horizon for any sign of their quarry
'  -- The Chairman holds a silver pen as he flips through the case file
2/12/09 125
-- David and Elise head towards a door across the street from the Banana Republic
-- They emerge through a door on the 125th Street Metro-North platform
Run down the stairs to street level
-- Thompson and a half-dozen minions emerge from the same dressing room David and Elise did
The seventeen year-old attendant presses back against the wall, totally freaked now
-- David and Elise head toward a storefront church
-- Thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing badges and asking questions
/ -- David and Elise enter the church and-- -- -- exit from a metal door in a stone facade
to that they are standing at the base of the Statue of Liberty
Elise looks out at the harbor and the city
Rain pelts her face
And she smiles
Exhilarated
Like a prisoner who has just broken her chains
-- Rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by Thompson and his men
black Suburban with under-grill police lights pulls up fast
2/12/09 126
The Intervention Team has pinpointed an interception point
Thompson circles his finger in the air to tell his men to saddle up, they're moving out-- -- Elise isstill smiling
Let's go
We can't keep running forever,
David
If they find us
they'll take you from me
won't let
them
They'll take you from here
David touches his head'
No,  won't let them
She leans,-
over and kisses hi's forehead
'   -- David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it
Perfect
David picks a door
It's locked
He tries another
It's -- locked too
He tries a third
Locked
Elise tries shakes her head
They're not supposed to be locked
David hears sounds coming from the building's central staircase
He looks down it to see four men in silver suits climbing up the stairs
2/12/09 127
The elevator door down the hall opens
More men in silver suits
This one's open
Elise is standing at the door to the roof
David runs to her and they go up the stairs together to-- -- David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some concrete blocks sitting on the roof
Rain pours down on them
They rush to the edge of the roof
,Three Con Edison vans are parked haphazardly on the street below
And a dozen civilians on the sidewalk are frozen
11: ; David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the roof of the building next door is ten feet below them
They hang their legs over the edge and jump
They sprint across the roof of the building next door -- except somehow they find themselves running across the same roof they were just on
David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a moment ago
The door bangs against theme being shoved open from inside
David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction
At the building's edge they climb over again and
run
Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were on
It's like they're in an
Escher painting
They stop, and look at each other
David takes her hand as Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent roofs
They're completely surrounded
Kiss me
Tears well in her eyes
And his
Close your eyes and kiss me
He does
And they kiss in the rain
love you, David Norris
2/12/09 128
They hold each other for a long beat
and then, finally, open their eyes
ready to accept their fate-- They see an empty roof
The Silver Suits are gone
And the rain has stopped
strange silence envelopes them
They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing there, alone
Hello, David
Good morning, Elise
His voice is gentle, paternal
Who are you
think you know
David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize
You can't oti{rn Fate
Tft , It's
more- complicated t,}an that, Fate am Free Will coexist They're;in tension with each other
And pure chance
beat
David looks back at him
TH2;
>i12HAT, could control 'everything
You'd be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets try to
keep things from getting too out of control
But that has a cost
Most people go through life like pinballs, reacting predictably to the stimuli  apply
They accept the path they find themselves on
And perform accordingly
But every once in a while someone comes along who refuses to be bound by his fate, someone who understands that Free Will is a gift most people are too afraid to use
() Which, you see, is partly the point of all this

(cont'd) Or maybe you don't see it
Maybe you just feel it
And that's even better
Because that's the other part
David and Elise take it in
And all the misery, all the pain
sit up there and  watch it and it hurts me
but if you could see the incredible courage people show, the random acts of kindness, the love
If you could see huitan beings choosing every moment every day to be better thAn''  made them, you would know it's all worthwhile
() Good luck, David
And good luck to you, Elise
You're a-beautiful dancer
And so much more
The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there
Their case isclosed
But, Sir,isn't this a majtr
deviation from The Plan
The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper
Not anymc3e
David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by what=they've just experienced
As He disappears around a corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds
After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say "what do we do now
" Maybe we should go dancing
smile slowly spreads across her face
