Written by Nicolas Winding Refn Second draft script With the support of the Media Programme of the European Union The  of Muay Thai boxing
The Art of Eight Limbs
Thrust and move
Feet shuffling across the ring
: - a pair of hands from
The  of the fighting grow
Punches, kicks, elbows
The hands tense into fists
They're strong hands
Fighter's hands
Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands
Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time
The  of the boxing match gets   as Julian continues staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating
Suddenly he breaths in
Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this is Liang, barely sixteen
He looks nervous, occasionally glancing at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the far wall
Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a tight fist
: - The  of the boxing match reach   as we Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring
: - Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other
The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which way the fight will turn
One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts changing hands
The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes
They know him here
Again bets are placed
a face in the crowd
Billy
Julian's older brother (late thirties)
Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing his arm around him, pulling him in close
love violence
Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey
Julian refuses
He's more interested in the fight
where the fight has just started
Liang is immediately on the ropes
Julian watches, concerned
Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear
He nods to Julian and takes it outside
where Liang pulls an amazing move
Turns the tables
Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings and backfists
As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the auditorium
Liang wins the fight with a knock out
The crowd go wild with adulation
Julian watches, transfixed
Liang is lit up by a beatific white light
As he stands triumphant in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him
Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him
Which is almost like a religious ceremony
The audience bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light
look of calm washing over his face
sense of stillness and peace
Enlightenment through victory and violence
: - Billy stalks the streets of the city of vice
man on a mission
: - Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes
We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have gained his approval
Two fifty, three hundred
Liang takes the money
Julian pulls off two more notes
bonus
(') You did well out there
You've got something, Liang
Potential, yeah
Liang nods
(') Don't spend it all in once place
: - Billy comes down a back ally and knocks on a door
After a moment the door opens
The Doorman recognises him and lets him enter
: - with Billy as he makes his way through the small subterranean nightclub
Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few locals gambling
He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to gamble
Billy moves across to a small private corner
where he meets various men and women, all smoking Methamphetamine
Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts up between him and another Thai Man
The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it suddenly gets out of control
Billy starts viciously hitting the Thai Man and quickly the room  in a frenzy of violence
: - fan does what it can to cool Julian down as he counts out money at his desk
Sitting opposite him, feet on the table, is Gordon, Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got
Julian's phone rings
He interrupts his counting
Picks up and listens
(  ) Hold on, hold on
What did he say
Beat as Julian listens
He glances over at Gordon who looks up, concerned
(') (  ) No, tell him to stay there
Tell them both to stay there
Beat
(') (  ) 'm coming over
: - The Lizard sits outside the nightclub, somehow managing to smoke a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from his nose with a handkerchief
Julian and Gordon arrive
He still in there
No
Beat
Julian glances at Gordon
You told him  was coming
Wouldn't listen
Julian stares at him
Well maybe you didn't try hard enough
The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose
Shows the bloodstain to Julian
(') When was the last time you slept
The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes
Just cause  ain't slept for three days, don't mean  don't know right from wrong
and your brother has become a real problem
Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist
The Lizard notices this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly
(') You're not going to cause another ruckus in my club now - are you
long pause as Julian considers it
No
Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and then he broke my face
Julian turns to Gordon
Like  always said
One day he's going to meet the devil
Beat
You know where he is now
The Lizard stares at Julian
Bangkok has millions of people my friend
You and your brother, you're lost to my world
The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian
(') So what you going to do
You wanna come in
Very good amphetamine in here
Julian looks over to Gordon
Sees he's keen
You go
'm gonna look around
See if can find him
Sure--
Go on
He turns back to The Lizard
(') Which way'd he go
The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street
Julian turns and heads off
Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club
The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way
His brother didn't pay
So
That's his problem
Now it's your problem
'm with you mate
Billy's fucked-- You don't pay his debt - you don't enter
Gordon thinks for beat
Takes out his money
How much
and The Lizard smiles for the first time
: '  - Julian is talking to Ma Long, fifties, the mother figure to a group of girls who stand in the background
You seen Billy
Not this evening
particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye
He stares at her, stone faced
Well if he comes in, tell him 'm looking for him, yeah
He's not coming in
tell him to stay away
He hurt one of my girls Julian
Not good
Julian considers
Pulls out his wad of notes again
Hands a few to Ma Long
Yeah, well
if you see him, tell him 'm looking for him
Ma Long nods as she takes the money
Julian is about to leave
He looks at the pretty prostitute again
Stares at her for a moment
Then walks out
: - Billy's so wasted he's bumping into people
He starts window shopping the various brothels that line the street: groups of girls smiling at him
Anything for a price
one particularly young-looking girl
Just fifteen
She makes eye contact with Billy
He smiles
Pulls out a roll of notes
: - Julian out in the middle of the road
Girls on the pavement, girls in the windows
steady line of punters cruising past
He stands alone
Focussed
Watchful
An island in a sea of neon
It feels ominous
Like something really bad's about to happen
: : - Chang, mid-forties, a man who looks like he's carved out of stone
The neon lights bleed over his face in a seemingly unending flow as he's driven towards his destination
: - Police cars are parked up outside
Chang gets out of his taxi
Pays the driver
Makes his way inside
: - Chang makes his way up the stairs to a landing where a are gathered
Their circle opens up as Chang approaches and they bow as he joins them - like he's a God
One of the group, Kim Han Ho, gestures towards the door of Room 610 where stand guard
Chang gives a nod and the door is opened
: 610 - Chang stands silhouetted in the doorway
Stepping into the room he moves into the light in
His face is a mask
The bed is drenched in blood
The fifteen year old prostitute lies naked on her back
She's dead, her body having been savagely beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong
Billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants, his eyes glazed, staring at , a bottle of Mehkong whiskey in his hand, a crack pipe on the floor
Chang stares at him, giving nothing away
: 611 - The Hotel Owner serves tea to Chang who sits in silence with Lieutenant Kim
The door is open and we can see into room 610 across the corridor where Billy is still sat staring at the television
: - young cop, Daeng, who has been watching Chang, summons up courage to whisper to his superior officer, Phaiban
( ) Who is that guy
Phaiban says nothing
(') ( ) Is he a cop
( ) He was
Before Daeng can ask another questions, two more cops lead an older Thai man, Choi Yan Lee (50's, overweight, dragged straight from his bed) down the corridor towards the crime scene
: 611 - As Choi Yan Lee is delivered to the doorway, Chang gets up and goes over to him
moment of uncertainty in Choi Yan Lee's face
Fear
He doesn't know why he's been brought here
He looks for some comfort from Chang
Chang gives him nothing
: 610 - Chang leads Choi Yan Lee to the doorway
Slowly Choi Yan Lee realises what he's looking at
His daughter
Dead
Mutilated
Every father's worst nightmare
( ) Is this your daughter
Beat
( ) Yes
( ) How could you
but Choi Yan Lee just stares at his daughter
Finally: ( ) What
( ) How could you let this happen
( ) didn't do anything
( ) Well now's your chance
long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand what Chang is suggesting
Chang stands back
(') ( ) Do what thou will
Choi Yan Lee nods
Chang leaves the room, closing the door behind him
: 611 - Chang sits drinking tea in silence with Lieutenant Kim
The guards in the corridor stare at the closed door of Room 610 from where we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death
: Daeng who's starting to look scared
Phaiban puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder
As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck snapping
And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down on his body
: 610 - Chang opens the door and looks through
Choi Yan Lee is sitting breathlessly on the floor covered in blood
In his hand he holds a piece of wood he has ripped from a chair
Billy lies dead, his head completely smashed in
: - police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town
: - The bloodied Choi Yan Lee sits in the back, Chang on one side, Kim on the other
As the police car turns onto a more major road, Choi Yan Lee starts to get nervous
( ) You missed my turning
live that way
Beat
Chang says nothing
Phaiban is driving, Daeng in the passenger seat
Daeng looks back at them through the rearview mirror
( ) We'll get you there
: - The Police Car heads over the Mega Bridge and continues its way out of town
: - The bright white headlights of the stationary police car blind Choi Yan Lee who's caught in their glare, rigid with fear
( ) 'm so sorry
Please
Please
Please don't hurt me
'm so sorry
( ) What are you sorry for
( ) thought
You were there
He killed my daughter
thought you were letting me
( ) Answer the question
What are you sorry for
Beat
Choi Yan Lee is wrongfooted
Tentatively
( ) killed the Westerner
( ) And why did you do that
( ) He killed my daughter
( ) And why did he do that
Choi Yan Lee can't answer
(') ( ) How old was she
( ) Fifteen
( ) You knew what she was doing and you did nothing
( ) How else can we make money
Four daughters
No sons
What else could do
Daeng watches as Kim opens the boot and pulls something out
He walks towards Chang and hands it to him
Daeng sees that it's an axe
(') ( ) What did you expect me to do
You have to have pity on me
My daughter's just been murdered
( ) This isn't about her
This is about your other three daughters and making sure you don't forget them
Chang nods to Kim and Phaiban who grab hold of Choi Yan Lee
Kim slips a plastic strap around Choi Yan Lee's arm, using it as a tourniquet
They wrestle him to the ground and pull his arm out
( ) won't forget
promise
Forgive me
Chang approaches with the axe
He stops for a moment
Looks down at him
(') ( ) 'll change
'll be a better man
( ) know
Chang slams down the axe, severing Choi Yan Lee's arm at the elbow
Choi Yan Lee  in agony
: - The anonymity of a hotel room
Julian opens the curtains and we see the sky line of Bangkok - he looks out
He lies back on the bed, surfing through two hundred  channels
Settles on a boxing match
Starts drifting off
As he drifts we hear the
karaoke rendition of ' Hung My Head' by Johnny Cash
set off running to wake from the dream My brother's rifle went into the sheen kept on running Into the south lands That's where they found me My head in my hands : - that the voice is that of Chang and he's not half bad either: deeper than you'd have though, and with it comes a stage presence, a sort of John Wayne swagger
The sheriff he asked me Why  had run And then it came to me Just what  had done And all for no reason Just one piece of lead hung my head hung my head
The policemen, still dressed in their uniforms, watch in respectful silence
Daeng sits with them
He too watches in awe
: - Chang travels home across the city
: '  /  - Chang opens the door as quietly as he can
He slips off his shoes and walks gingerly into the apartment
: '  /  - On the kitchen table Chang sees a picture
badly-drawn house with a man, a woman and a child
Across the bottom: " ' Chang stares at it and smiles - picks it up and pins it to the fridge with a magnet
: '  / '  - Chang and Kanita, his eight year old daughter, are playing with her dolls who have captured a soft toy
( ) So now that they've caught him
What are they going to do
Kanita thinks for a moment
( ) Put him in jail
( ) Come on
They haven't got a jail big enough
Look at the size of him
Again Kanita thinks
( ) Keep him as a pet
( ) But he blew down all their houses
Would you want to keep a pet that could do that
Kanita shakes her head
( ) What if they just let him go
( ) How could they be sure he wouldn't do it again
( ) They could ask him
Very nicely
Chang picks up the soft toy
Peels off a sticker from a sheet and places it between its eyes
Satisfied with his work he puts the soft toy back in the middle of the game
( ) "And so the king and the fairies that lived in the village said to the creature: this is your mark which will stay with you forever
If you ever try and blow down our village again, it will heat up until it boils your brains, for it has magical properties
Go in peace
Kanita nods, happy with the judgement
She picks the soft toy up and 'walks' it away from the village of the dolls
: '  /   - Chang walks into his bedroom where his wife Nadee is just waking up
He kisses her good morning
As he starts to undress, she starts to get dressed
They share a smile about this
Finally Chang lies down on the bed and closes his eyes
Nadee kisses him good night
: '  /  - Nadee starts making breakfast as Kanita watches cartoons
: '  /  - As Chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light of the day - but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside as it goes about its frenetic everyday business
The   through the apartment, briefly settling on the sleeping Chang, then roaming through the various rooms, different objects
We see that Chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector - the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs and other bits of movie memorabilia
Amongst the many family photos we also   several pictures of Chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like a very successful career as a Thai boxer
At the end of the tour we're back with Chang
We   to a tight
: - We see a hotel room door and hear a knock - Julian and opens to reveal
Two Thai girls - one being Mai - standing in the hallway
Julian lets them enter
Mai embraces Julian, kissing him on the mouth as Julian closes the door
They turn to consider the other girl who is starting to undress
She smiles compliantly, eager to please
Julian turns back to Mai and kisses her again
As the kiss becomes more passionate, the other girl joins them and the three of them begin to have sex
: '  - Chang is sitting eating alone at the dinning table, watching an old western on
: - Chang walks down the streets towards a school
Standing at the gate, Kanita is waiting for him
He hugs her and they hold hands as they continue down the crowded street
: - Chang waits patiently at the counter as Kanita sorts through various dolls, trying to choose which one to buy
Chang looks round and gazes out the window into the street where pedestrians stream past
Suddenly Chang has a strange : All the women disappear
In the street there are only men
We cut to a   of Chang and then back to his  again: Now all the men have gone and he can see only women
Back to the   of Chang who continues staring out of the : where everything is back to normal
Men and women walking up and down the sidewalk
: - The remnants of various room service orders litter the floor along with the trappings of a heavy session: empty bottles of alcohol, drug paraphernalia, etc
Julian lies sleeping, entwined in the limbs of the girl
There is a knock on the door
Julian and the girl ignore it
pause and then Julian's mobile phone starts ringing
He doesn't answer
The knocking starts up again, this time louder
Finally: Julian's not here mate
Fuck off
Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door
(
) Julian
Still they ignore him
Either too wasted or too tired to do anything else
(
) (') Julian
need to talk with you
Beat
Finally Julian answers with zero energy
What is it
(
) It's about Billy
can't deal with my brother right now
Beat
(
) He's dead
Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs
What
No answer
Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his body and slowly opens the door
Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's crew
(') What happened
They found his body in a hotel room
Julian doesn't know what to say
Neither does Gordon
(') Look, get dressed and 'll see you downstairs
Julian nods and closes the door
He stands still - glances out the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in
He glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed
He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on make up
What happened
Julian looks at her
Someone killed Billy
The camera   on Mai
: - Mortuary Attendant pulls a sheet back to reveal - Billy
His body completely mutilated
Julian stares at his brother's corpse intensely, not betraying any emotion
He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him
What do we do
For now
We wait
Julian glances back at the body
: - Julian stares up at the night sky, his mobile phone gripped tightly in his hand
He puts the phone down
He looks out across the city again then back to the phone
It's like he's scared
He picks it up quickly and dials
moment as it rings then it's answered
Hello Mum
Beat
(') It's me
Julian
Something's happened
: '  - The  tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her forties and could actually pass for late thirties
She strides towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her
This is Jenna Hopkins
Head of a notorious London Crime Family
Mother of both Julian and Billy
Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok
She hands her passport over to the Concierge
'd like to check in now please
The Concierge checks the computer
'm afraid the room won't be ready until four o'clock
Beat
Jenna just stares at him
(') It's policy 'd like to speak to your manager
Beat
Yes of course
The Concierge retreats
Jenna lights a cigarette
Good afternoon madam, what seems to be the problem
Listen to me
've just travelled six thousand miles to see the corpse of my first born son and  haven't slept for thirty hours and he says  can't go to my room
The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her force
'm sorry madam
How much
it simply isn't possible
Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes
Peels off a couple of hundred dollar bills
Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the fucking key
She lays the money on the desk
The manager looks around
Well  might be able to arrange something
The Manager turns to the Concierge
Don't leave the money there
Some cunt'll nick it
Put it in your pocket
The Manager hesitates
(') Put it in your pocket
There's really no need-- Put it in your fucking pocket
The Manager takes the money
Pockets it
Places the key on the desk
Room 300
: '  /  - The lift doors open and Jenna walks out, the Porter struggling to keep up with her as she swishes down the corridor
: '  /  300 - The struggling Porter opens the door and lets Jenna in
She walks into the suite and gives it the once over
Satisfactory
The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece
As soon as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room
Hey
Open this
Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath, beginning to undress
(') need a drink
The Porter is stunned
(') Well don't just stand there
The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail
Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and takes a huge slug
The Porter is terrified, stunned
Rooted to the spot
Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window
Just as the Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she starts talking to him
(') loved him so much you know
Billy
Beat
The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about
(') Everyone loves their children don't they
Well, not everyone, but
She looks over at him
The Porter smiles at her
(') Do you want to see a picture
The Porter nods, uncertain
Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse
Opens it up
picture of Billy
She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it, not knowing what to do
Jenna starts to cry
For a long time
Finally
Madam
have to return to my station
Jenna snaps out of it in an instant
What, yeah, thanks
She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse
She hands the money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares
: We hear Dave Berry singing 'Mama'
: - The elevator doors open
Julian steps out into the empty hallway
Everything is normal
But everything is also not normal
The  tracks from behind as Julian walks - looking at the doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one: He knocks but there is no answer
Realizing the door isn't locked, he pushes it open and steps in
: - The room is exactly the same as the one Jenna's staying in
However, instead of her, Julian sees a man sitting on the bed, his back to him
His features are obscured
Julian slowly begins to walk towards him, but before he can reach out, the figure turns to face him
It's Chang
But there is blood smeared all over his face
Julian stares at him in horror
Slowly he looks down at his hands only to discover that they're dripping in blood
We   on his hands
: - Julian wakes from his nightmare - covered in sweat
He is alone
He sits up
Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare
We hear the traffic of Bangkok
Julian gets up and walks to the table
Light up and begins to smoke morphine
He walks to the window and looks out over Bangkok
His phone rings - Julian answers
(  ) Hello
(
) It's me
(  ) Hi Mum
Where are you
(
) 'm in Bangkok
(  ) What
Julian looks at his watch
(') (  ) thought you didn't get in til midnight
Beat
(
) needed to be by myself
(  ) Okay
so, what d'you want to do
(
) Raise Hell
Julian turns his back to the window
: '  / Jenna looks immaculate
She stubs out her cigarette when she spots Julian making his way towards her
She gets up and they embrace
She holds on to him
little too long
Finally she pulls away
She looks at him for a long time
Could it be have been one of the gangs
Maybe
Take your pick
Billy wasn't popular
What do you mean
You know Billy
He was eccentric
Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian even smiles
Both sit in silence for a moment
But you're going to find out who did it, right
'll make sure it gets done
No, it needs to be you that does it
We need to show them
Do you understand what 'm saying
Yeah, okay, 'll do it
Good
Julian as we bring up the  of Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire
Love is a burning thing And it makes a firey ring Bound by wild desire fell into a ring of fire : - Chang is singing again
fell into a burning ring of fire went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire And the cops are all there, Daeng included, watching him
: - Chang's singing continues as we see an assortment of tough looking Thai Men listening to Gordon ()
` (
) fell into a burning ring of fire went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire Gordon explains the situation: what information they're after, how much they'll get paid for good leads
All the while Julian watches from the background
: - montage of Julian's crew spreading out, shaking down their various contacts: doormen, pimps, dirty cops, stall holders, barmen
(
) The taste of love is sweet When hearts like ours meet fell for you like a child Oh, but the fire went wild
One of the crew, the rat faced Charlie Ling, starts talking to the Hotel Owner who was there the night of the murder
couple of hundred Bhat notes and he starts talking
: - Chang reaches the climax of the song
fell into a burning ring of fire went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire The Cops watch with total devotion
: - Tuck-tuck makes its way through the crowded streets driven by one of Choi Yan Lee's Three Daughter's
In the back sits Choi Yan Lee, his stump of an arm in a sling, a daughter either side of him
His arm's only just been bandaged up and he's clearly still in a lot of pain, his face going into spasm with every bump in the road
: '  - Julian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink
Waiting
Behind him Gordon, his phone glued to his face
On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering wife Kim Yan Lee
She serves a chilled coconut to a man
As he turns round we reveal
he's a particularly murderous looking member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam
We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's selling
They're all counting down the minutes
Biding their time
Waiting for Choi Yan Lee to turn up
Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching
Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the bottom
Letting the empty shell fall to the floor
Charlie Ling stands up
Feels the gun under his jacket
The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into the kiosk that doubles as their home
Julian and his men close in
: ' As Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk, followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian
Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in the air
( ) You can't kill me
'm a cripple
( ) Who are you
What do you think you're doing
Get out or we'll call the police
Ko Sam shakes his head at her
Not a good idea
Julian turns to Charlie Ling
Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee
At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's face
His eyes lock with Julian's
( ) Is your name Choi Yan Lee
Choi Yan Lee nods his head
Ask him why he killed my brother
( ) You killed his brother
Big mistake fat man
Why'd you do it
Beat
Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught
( ) He murdered my daughter
He says he killed his daughter
Julian considers him for a moment
Slowly he pulls out a gun
Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face
( ) Oh God
Please don't kill me
Please
'll give you anything
Anything you want
My daughters
My shop
Please
've paid for what  did
Look at me
In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward, brandishing his wounded arm at Julian
He pulls the bandages off, exposing the bloody stump
(') ( ) 've paid for what  did
Don't you see
Julian turns to Charlie Ling
What's he saying
Beat
He says
He says he's paid for what he's done
That he's been punished already
Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically
( ) He told me to do it
Then he took my hand
Look
Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him
Who did that to him
Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then stares directly at Julian
( ) The Angel of Vengeance
Charlie Ling looks at him surprised
yet there's a sense that deep down he knows what he's talking about
( ) It's a lie - he doesn't exist
( ) 'm telling the truth
It was the Angel of Vengeance
What's he saying
He's lying
Tell me
It's a story old women tell their grand children
'The Angel of Vengeance' is supposed to come down from the heavens and judge the living
restore karma to the world
Gordon laughs
but Julian listens with great interest
How does he do that
Leads people to their destiny
That's the myth anyway
Ko Sam smiles
Julian doesn't
Finally: Ask him who cut his hand off
Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further
Julian insists
(') Do it
( ) Who turned you into a cripple - and no bullshit this time
Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically
( , ) 'm telling you the truth
The Angel of Vengeance is real
He made me do it
You've got to believe me
've already been judged
He says it was The Angel of Vengeance
Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably
( ) The Angel of Vengeance
Yes
You don't find the Angel of Vengeance
No
He finds you
What's he saying
( ) Pull yourself together fat man
If you don't talk sense 'll cut off your cock and shove it down your throat
( ) 'm telling you the truth
He'll find you
Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room
What did he say
Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee
Realizes he's not going to get a better answer out of him
He said you don't find The Angel of Vengeance
He finds you
Julian considers this for a long time
He realises he's not pointing his gun anymore
Puts it away
Are we going to kill him or what
The room suddenly feels stuffy
The atmosphere oppressive
Julian's got to get out
(') What are you doing
But Julian's already stumbling out of the kiosk
Nothing
We're not going to do anything
Just leave him
Leave them all
: - Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air
Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha flying
He falls to the ground
When he gets to his feet everything around him seems intense and incredibly vibrant
The dogs fighting on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of the kiosk, hiding their guns
Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings
Finally he stands up, but as he does he feels different
As if the axis of his world has shifted
: - The   from the side as we see Jenna walk through the boxing gym
All around her people are fighting and sparring
She spots Julian and Gordon through the large windows of the office
They see her and stand up
We   in the training area as Jenna goes through : - Boxers train in the background
Jenna, Julian and Gordon sit in silence
Finally: Did you kill him
Beat
shared look between Gordon and Julian
It's a little bit more complicated than that Mum
Complicated
He killed my son
What's so fucking complicated about that
Mum, calm down
Don't tell me to calm down
want him dead
Beat
Julian does not know how to explain the situation
Jenna stares at him
(') We don't forgive
Only God does
know, you always say that - but this is different
How
Silence
Julian doesn't know how to answer
Jenna watches him carefully
Maybe
Maybe Billy had it coming
What are you talking about
because of what he did
Jenna thinks it over for a moment
don't care
Why
Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it
What if
What if it was The Angel of Vengeance
Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot
The Angel of fucking what
it - or he - restores karma and order in the world
'Restores' things
Who said anything about 'restoring' things
Beat
He loves all humans
don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will kill -- 'm not, 'm just
Julian can't get the words out
He gets up
(') 've got to go
and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open
We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly on Jenna
She turns to Gordon
How's business
It's alright, yeah
Well, what with Billy not being around, it's tricky to be honest
What d'you mean
Well, we're supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week
But Billy's not here, is he
'm here
Julian's here
Gordon shrugs
Jenna clocks it
(') What's gotten into him
Is he high or something
don't know
Earlier today - we had the guy
The guy that killed Billy
Had a gun against his face
But then - nothing
Nothing
Julian let him go
Now there's all this stuff about angels
don't know what the fuck's wrong with him
Not like you
Gordon smiles at her uncertainly
know how to do what needs to be done
That's all
She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable
So tell me
What did he mean when he said it was complicated
There's this other guy
Might have been involved
So we kill them both
We don't know who the other guy is yet
Okay
Well how about we start with the guy we do know
: - girl sings 'Another Woman's Man' by Dolly Parton
Julian's sitting alone at a table, nursing a drink
Mai enters, looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her in the hotel
She sits next to Julian and gives him a kiss on the cheek
Sorry 'm late
It's alright
He drinks his drink
Silence
What's wrong
Nothing
Mai looks around the bar
It's half empty - some girls and men spread out
The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink
They sit in silence, listening to the song
See anyone you want us to take home tonight
Julian glances round but shakes his head
Looks at Mai
(') What
Nothing
What's with you
You want to get high
Beat
Silence
Finally
want you to meet my Mum
pause, Mai slightly taken about
Is she here
Julian nods
(') 'you want me to
Julian nods
Mai studies him
(') Why d'you want me to meet her
To show her
To show that 've got something here
What, like we're a couple
Julian stares at her for a long time
Can't quite say it out loud, but the answer's yes
: '  - Choi Yan Lee oversees his daughter's serving hot food to customers
Liang, the young kick boxer, watching him from across the street
Liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light of the street lamps
He heads over to the shack
Liang asks Choi Yan Lee a question
Choi Yan Lee leans over to hear him better
Liang  hold of his hair and  him over the counter,  his throat with the knife
Choi Yan Lee's wife and daughters look on as blood floods from his neck, over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground below
Life slips away from Choi Yan Lee in a matter of seconds
Liang holds onto him until he's dead and then lets go of his head and runs off into the night
: - Gordon is waiting on a street corner smoking cigarettes
Liang comes up to him, breathless
Gordon pulls out several hundred dollars
Never come back - you understand me
Liang nods
(') Good
Liang takes the money
proper pay out
(') You're a fighter, kid
No doubt about it
Good luck with that
: - Julian's talking to Liang's Mother and Sister who are sitting in front of him, both upset
Gordon hovers in the background
When did you last see him
' Last night
He went out
Did he have any enemies
' None
' ( ) Someone called him
' Someone called his mobile
Who
' She doesn't know
They spoke in English
Liang's Mother pulls out a mobile phone
Passes it to Julian
This his phone
Liang's Sister nods
Julian scrolls through the numbers
All have Thai names against them - except one
Julian considers the number, then redials
beat
Then the  of a phone ringing in the same room
Gordon looks round
Realises he's busted
Takes his phone out
Kills it
Julian stares at him
Before he gets a chance to say anything, there is a knock on the door
(') What is it
(
) There's some cops here to see you
What do they want
(
) Probably just money
You want me to find out how much
Julian thinks it over
No, 'll talk to them
: - Julian clocks the cops who are waiting for him
He walks over, strangely on edge
As he gets closer he sees Chang - standing on the other side of the room by the boxing ring, his back to him, watching the sparring fighters
Julian stares at him
Turns back to the cops
Good morning officers
How can  help you
Slowly Chang turns to face him
Julian stares at him as if he's in a trance
We're investigating the murder of Choi Yan Lee
Julian recovers
Turns to Kim and shrugs
Never heard of him
His arm was cut off
Here
Julian manages to cover his reaction
run a boxing club
Not much call for one armed men
beat
Mexican stand off
(') What's this got to do with me
He was the father of the girl that was found dead with your brother
Then  guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have , so if you'll excuse me
That's why we're here Mr Hopkins
If you could just answer our questions
Sure, sorry
What do you want to know
Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers
The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted
Where were you last night
With my mum
Some of the boxers come over to Chang
They know him
They're reverential
With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian like they're bowing down before a God
(') You want to speak to her
That wont be necessary at the moment
Am  suspect
Chang turns round to face Julian
His presence is magnetic
Julian stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of Vengeance
Chang walks over to them
Studies Julian for a long moment and then turns to Kim
( ) This is not the man
And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves
The cops back off and away
on Julian
Deflated and strangely disappointed
He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him
want you to find out who that guy is
Okay
Sure
No problem
Now
The  of Nadee singing '  ' by Dolly Parton
: Chang sits on his own drinking apple juice as he watches his wife sing on stage
Julian enters, sees Chang but can only see the back of his face
He walks over to the bar, orders a drink
Julian starts to watch Nadee
When he turns back to the bar he sees Chang reflected in the optics - somehow standing right next to him, staring at him
Julian turns to face him
Why are you here
You're him
Aren't you
Who
The one who killed my brother
Chang says nothing for a long time
love all living things
Beat
(') restore karma
Is that why you came
came here to kill you
What's stopping you
don't know
Would you like me to tell you
Julian nods
(') You want the Angel of Vengeance
Yes
Why
Cause, all my life
don't know
Yes you do
My mother wants me to kill you
Chang stares back at him
And what do you want
love violence
You want to fight me
Julian nods
Thai style
: - Three cops sit eating noodles
( ) What about his brain
( ) It's a risk
One hit in the wrong place and he'll be straight back in hospital
And maybe he wont be so lucky as last time
( ) Then why's he going to fight the Westerner
The question hangs in the air
It's what they're all wondering
He used to be a great boxer
He has to do it
Since he came out of the coma, that's what he's done
Whatever's been asked of him, he's done it
He can't help it
It's all a mystery
mutual pause
And if he loses
He can't lose
He's the Angel of Vengeance
: '  - Nadee is standing behind Chang
They're playing a game in which they speak in English
She points out the window
View
Window
`She points at the table
Table
Do you like the table
Yes
like the table
Chang stiffens
Nadee detects the change in him
What is it
Chang takes her in his arms
He starts kissing her neck
need to speak to you in Thai
pause
( ) What is it
( ) love you
She stares at him for a long moment
It's odd for him to have confessed his feelings in such a way
Not bad, just odd
And then she starts to kiss him back
: - Julian is anxiously waiting outside
He looks up as Mai comes out of her appartment in a red dress
Julian's face drops
What is it
You can't wear that
Why not
My mother's
Very particular about colours
You're kidding
She hates red
Come on, we'll get you something else
Mai stares at him, reluctant to give in
(') Come on
This is insane
Look, 'm telling you
It's easier this way
Trust me
Mai gives in
Takes his hand
: - Chang picks out a dress for Mai
She takes it, finding it hard to believe that he's making her do this
: - Three people sit around a table awkwardly
Julian, Jenna and Mai (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup
long silence
So
May, isn't it
It's Mai, Mum
How long have you two known each other then
Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first
year and a half isn't it
Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head
that sounds about right
Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends
Mum, please
So, where did you two meet
saw her walking down the street
Jenna raises an eyebrow
(') And  thought - this is the most beautiful girl 've ever seen - so just walked up to her and started talking
hear that happens a lot in this part of the world
Tell me, what's your line of work, Mai
work in the service industry
bet you do
But tell me Mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving
Was it over a thousand
Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief
(') know girls like you
Just because you might be pulling the wool over my son's eyes don't think it's going to work with me
Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake
'm sorry Julian, but  won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth
Leave her alone Mum
You've got her wrong
She's a good girl
What do you know about what's good
Beat
Julian says nothing
He's good to me
Well that's nice isn't it, 'm really happy for you-- Mum
pause
(') The cops came by my club today
Beat
She stares at him
(') They're investigating a murder
The guy that killed Billy turned up dead this morning
Jenna looks bored
Lights a cigarette
Oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword
know it was you, Mum
did what had to be done
He was there
He was with them
Who
The Angel of Vengeance
'you kill him
No
Cause he as good as killed Billy
What want to know is, what are you going to do about it
'm not going to kill him
Yes you are
You're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your brother
This isn't about Billy
This is about me
All my life 've been running
That's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem
just like you're running away from killing this fucking Angel of whatever - his name is Chang- Chang
Mai stands up
should be going now
Sit down you cunt
Mum, don't talk to her like that
Mai sits down
So what am  left with
Julian stares at her
Me
Jenna calms down
She looks at their reflections in the mirror behind the bar
We  in on the mirror, their faces refracted by the glass
You're right
We're family
We stick together
But Billy was family too
Billy was a fuck up
He deserved everything he got
You know it and know it
That's it
'm not listening to this
don't ever want to hear you mention his name again
Do you hear me
Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close
And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him
So you sent him to me-- (') -- So you sent him to me and what could do
You could have protected him
did what  could
And that's more than you ever did
would've done anything for him
Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were
He struggled with things
But  always stood by him
And what did that get him
'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me
Don't you dare blame me for what happened back then
'm only here 'cause of you
If you didn't exist,  wouldn't be here
Beat
(') could've been someone, Mum
was on my way
Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like having
You would've been a great fighter
You could've gone pro
Don't you think  know that
And look at me now
'm a front for a drugs smuggling
He turns to Mai
(') It's true
The whole thing's a front
Every day  see kids coming in with great potential
And every day  see kilos of heroin going out
And it's all because of you, Ma
You and the money and the drugs
Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up
He quietens down
At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me
Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say this
That's right Mum
That's what's more important to you
But what about me
Sometimes  think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you
Jenna stares at him
Her face a mask
(') that's right Mum
Think about it
With me gone you were safe
And it turned out to be good for business as well
All very convenient
Silence between them
Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands now shaking
(') Is that what happened with Billy
Did Billy become a problem like  did
Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here
Still, at least you didn't have him killed
Jenna slaps him hard on the face
Julian recovers
Looks up at her
Very intense
(') 'm not going to kill him for you, Mum
Doesn't matter what you say
And do you want to know why
Surprise me
'Cause 'm going to fight him
In the ring
Me versus him
Well that seems sensible
And what do you hope that's going to achieve
don't expect you to understand
Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you
And when you lose, what's going to happen then
don't know
But maybe this time 'll win
Like you say, only God forgives
Maybe this time he'll forgive me
Jenna turns to Mai
Do you understand what he's talking about
'Cause  haven't got a fucking a clue
You never did, Mum
pause
Julian's touched a nerve
Jenna recovers
hope you find what you're looking for
'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and 'm not always going to be there to look after you
Jenna composes herself
Suddenly brightens
different person
(') Nice to meet you Mai
Hope to see you again soon
Jenna shakes her hand
Mai's too shocked to resist
And then, as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves
Julian covers his face with his napkin
Are you alright
He's not
He's crying
But he doesn't want anyone to see
'm fine
Beat
(') 'll be fine
In a minute
Julian wipes his face clean
Pulls himself together
(') Sorry about that
: '  - Jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception, a look of steely determination in her eyes
: '  - The Concierge and the Manager see Jenna coming towards them and brace themselves
However, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where Gordon is waiting for her
Nice evening
Lovely, yeah
Just catching up, you know
Jenna sits down
Lights a cigarette
(') You're a piece of work, aren't you
Gordon blushes
Jenna blows out her match
(') No fucking hanging about with you, is there
Well,  don't know about that
Just been out here a while
Know how to get things done
bet you do
But things are going to shit
Since Billy died, Julian's all over the place
We'll have to something about that the, wont we
But, first things first, what about Chang
Who
My son's guardian angel
He's just a retired cop
Good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he
It's not that simple
Is there somewhere we can go that's a little more private
Beat
She raises her eyebrows
What did you have in mind
Gordon blushes
Moves closer, conspiratorial
You can't just going round killing cops here anymore
It's not that easy
didn't say it was easy
But then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you
looked into it
Chang's a hard man to get to
None of the Thais'll go near him
Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you
There might be a way
But Julian can't find out
Jenna looks at Gordon - smiles and crosses her legs
Don't you worry about that
There are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't - and don't - discuss
Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure
: - Julian sits on a chair, holding his hand over a flame
Mai finishes applying make up, comes out of the bathroom wearing her red dress
She watches him for a moment
What are you doing
Seeing when it hurts
Mai watches him
He doesn't flinch
'm going to go
Julian takes his hand off the flame
Sees she's left the clothes he bought her behind
Didn't you like what  got you
It's fine, but you know
It's not my style
What do you mean
Maybe you should give it to your mother
Don't to be so hard on her
Her life hasn't been easy
Come on Julian
She's a fucking bitch
Don't say that, okay
You don't know what you're talking about
She'd do anything for me
The way she talks to you -- Don't go there
What
'Don't talk about my mother'
Come on Julian
Julian stands up, angry
(') Why don't you fuck her instead of me
Julian grabs hold her neck
Throws her hard against the wall
You don't get to judge her
You think she's bad
You should've met my dad
But he's not around anymore, and do you know why
Cause she loved me too much
He lets go of her neck
Mai rubs her neck
You're fucked
He pulls money out of his pocket
How much do  owe you
He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it
Fuck you
She opens the door, sets fire to the money, and walks out of the room
As she walks down the hotel corridor, Julian slams his fists into the wall
: - mixed clientele
High class
Asian and European
But there's an edge to the atmosphere
The music's that bit too loud, that bit too aggressive
And the people inside don't look like they're having a good time
It seems evil
Sleazy
Jenna introduces herself to Yuri Karkov, a well dressed and charismatic Russian in his forties who is surrounded by Thai girls and fellow Russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard, Dimitri
As the camera   to them we start to hear what they're saying
so why do you want to kill a policeman
Policemen are good
They mind their own business and keep the streets safe
Stop people stealing my cars
You really want to know
Yes
It may effect the price
He killed my son
Revenge
Pricey
This is Bangkok
Nothing's that expensive
You're right
Most things are cheap in Bangkok
Especially life
We'll take care of this business for you
But it won't be easy and it won't be cheap
: - Chang and his crew eat dinner together
: - crappy van pulls up outside
Out get three Cambodian men
Very poor, badly clothed
They look like farmers
Only they pull out semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant
: - Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng and Phaiban
Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen walk in
He looks up just as they
An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering the room with broken glass
Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover
Chang's men are completely pinned down
Phaiban's been hit and his white shirt has turned dark red with blood
Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair
In it, his pistol
The Gunmen keep firing
As soon as a clip is finished, they pull it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting
stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's jacket's on
It falls to the ground
With it, his pistol
He grabs it and returns fire, letting off four rounds
He takes Gunman One
Head shot, right between the eyes
Gunman Two sees this and sprays at Chang - - but Chang manages to dive to cover
He rolls and fires again, shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times
Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload
Gunman Three's weapon jams
He drops his weapon and runs
Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him
He sees Phaiban
Dead
Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood from his chest
Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man
: - The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat as he waits
As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken, running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and starts to pull away
Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down
The Driver slows
Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open doors
Chang bursts out of the restaurant
Stops dead
Aims and fires off two rounds
Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen
The Driver falls forward, dead
The back door of the van slams shut
Gunman Three thinks he's made it
He's wrong
The van isn't going anywhere
Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire
( ) Do you want to die
Do you want me to kill you
For what you've done
long pause
Finally: (
) ( ) No
Please
Don't kill me
( ) Tell me why not
Tell me why  shouldn't shoot you as soon as you come out of that door
(
) ( ) 'm sorry
( ) Not good enough
(
) ( ) It's my first time
've never done anything like this before
( ) know that
You're wearing sandals
Hitmen don't wear sandals
The door opens
Sandaled feet step out of the van
Gunman Three comes out with his hands up, falling to his knees
Chang continues to point his weapon at the unarmed man
(') ( ) Give me a reason
The Cops appear behind him in the doorway
Chang holds his ground
His finger twitches
It looks like he's going to pull the trigger
( ) 'm begging you
Please-- ( ) You showed no mercy in there
Why should mercy be shown to you
( ) don't know
( ) Yes you do
long beat
( ) don't know his name
( ) But you know where he is
Gunman Three looks up
Nods
: - Flanked by the Cops, Chang frog marches Gunman Three through the crowds, passing various stalls that seem to sell anything you could ever want for your , computer or Hi-fi
Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the warren-like market
Finally they reach the entrance to a particular shop
: - Chang enters, followed by the others
Gunman Three is incredibly relieved to have found it
Li Po stands behind the counter - beside him sits Pan, a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped
As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three next to them he knows the game's up
He can't run
His kid's sitting there
He approaches them with a heavy sigh
( ) You know why we're here
( ) Yes
( ) He set it up
He knows who ordered the hit
He'll tell you
( ) Don't talk unless  ask you to
Understood
( ) Yes
Completely understood
Chang turns to Li Po
( ) Do you have anything to say for yourself
( ) 'm a salesman
Some of the things sell aren't exactly legal
But 'll give you the man that hired the hit
Chang stares at him
( ) Good
Li Po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile phone
Proffers it to Chang
( ) As for myself, 'm not scared of paying for what 've done
just
just don't hurt my son
Chang looks down at Pan - who is just staring at them, not understanding the situation
Chang takes the phone from Li Po
( ) You see
He knows
He's got the details
told you he would
( ) And  told you not to talk unless  asked you
Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three
( ) Wait
You said if  took you to him you'd let me live
Chang shakes his head
( ) never said that
Chang fires
Gunman Three's brains spatter across the  screens on the far side of the wall
Pan begins to cry and Li Po hugs him and tells him how much he loves him
thinking they're next
Chang studies the mobile phone
(') ( ) This him
Li Po nods - scared
(') ( ) Where do  find him
( ) Skylight bar at the Jupiter
Every night
Chang studies Li Po making sure he speaks the truth
then nods
( ) 'm taking your phone
Chang turns to leave
( ) What about me
Beat
Chang considers
Looks at Pan who's staring at Chang in fear
Looks back at Li Po
( ) forgive you
: - people carrier pulls up outside the hotel
The doormen open the side door and step back when they see the heavily armed and bloodstained policemen get out, led by Chang
: - Dimitri and the group of Russian Criminals
Yuri Karkov is in the centre of them, a girl on either arm
Chang leads the Cops into the bar
He fires two shots into the ceiling
That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals up and ready for a confrontation
Half the bar's emptied by the time Chang reaches Yuri Karkov
You better have a fucking good reason for doing this
Don't you know who you're fucking with
Chang looks at him
( ) You live in my country
Can't speak my language
Too bad the one guy on my team that could speak English got murdered today
Yuri looks round for help
He can't understand a word
Can someone tell me what the fuck this guy's trying to say
Chang calls over to the barman
( ) Can you turn the music off
It won't be long,  promise
The music's killed
(') ( ) That's better
Thank you very much
Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone
Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white
Chang calls a number
beat
Then a phone starts ringing in Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone)
Dimitri winces
Chang shakes his head
Yuri pulls a gun
Kim shoots him dead
Chang moves his gun across to Dimitri
Holds his mobile phone up to his ear
Dimitri answers
Chang speaks through the phone
(') ( ) You're under arrest
: - on Dimitri as he stares at Chang, a rabbit in the headlights
Chang slowly sits down next to him
Talks to him in English
(') need information
Phaiban spins a spotlight onto Dimitri
(') And you're going to help me
Suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts
It's as if Dimitri and Chang are locked into some kind of surreal performance
(') Whether you like it or not
Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear
It was an English woman - she wanted you dead
beat
Not what Chang expected
Why
Said you
murdered her son
Who was she
don't know
How did she know me
Dimitri shakes his head
He really doesn't know
She asked for you by name
And what's my name
-- Chang starts to circle him
Dimitri's terrified
Doesn't know what the fuck he's on about
Suddenly he's grabbed from behind by Phaiban
Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri
( ) see the way you look at my people
The way you abuse them with your eyes
For this,  take your sight
He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes
Gauges them out
Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in Russian
(') ( ) You live in my country, but you fail to learn our language
You don't even try
For this  take your tongue
Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind
Chang presses down on his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off
Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying animal
Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around the room like a chicken without a head
(') ( ) You had opportunities
You could have chosen other paths
But you wouldn't listen
For this  give you silence
Chang grabs Dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear
First one side, then the other
We can't hear Dimitri's screaming
We can't hear anything at all
Beat
Painful and beautiful, but also tacky
The opening bars to one of Dolly Parton's classics
Karaoke style
(
) If  should stay,  would only be in your way
So 'll go, but  know 'll think of you every step of the way
And Chang with his crew just stare at the tortured Russian as he screams until his lungs are ready to burst
: - Nadee and Chang on stage
Singing their hearts out
And  will always love you
will always love you
You, my darling you
Hmm
His crew watch, emotion etched on their faces
: '  / '  - Gordon is sitting on a chair in Jenna's hotel room, a whiskey in his hand, the Bangkok skyline behind him
(
) Bittersweet memories that is all 'm taking with me
So, goodbye
Please don't cry, Jenna walks in from the bedroom wearing her dressing gown and walks over to him - a commanding presence
He makes to get up but she pushes him down and then leans down and kisses him hard on the mouth
(
) We both know that 'm not what you, you need
: - Nadee and Chang continue singing - a spotlight beaming down on them, singling them out in the shadowy bar
And  will always love you
will always love you
: '  / '  - Jenna and Gordon are still kissing as the guitar solo of the instrumental section kicks in
: - As Chang waits for the instrumental section to end, he starts to cry, letting the tears flow without embarrassment
Nadee puts her arm around him to comfort him
The rest of the crew start crying as well, Daeng in particular
hope life treats you kind And  hope you have all you've dreamed of
And  wish you, joy and happiness
But above all this,  wish you love
And  will always love you
: - Julian trains alone in the night
(
) will always love you
(
) will always love you
: - Nadee and Chang holding hands
/  (
) will always love you
will always love you
,  will always love you
: - Julian stares at his reflection
/  (
) You, darling,  love you
Ooh, 'll always, 'll always love you
Julian lifts his fists up
The same fighting pose we saw him in at the very beginning
He's ready
Ready as he'll ever be
: : - Two figures kneel on either side of the ring
Julian and Chang
Both wearing Mongkol
Totally still
The ceremonial music begins
Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient, traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried out before a fight takes place
It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing shapes and outlining fighting positions
As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative; now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches that they're about to perform
but all carried out with an almost beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about to follow
The Music Ends
moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring up the  of the baying crowd
Chanting
Screaming
Wild excitement
Ready for the fight they've all been waiting for
: - The crowd is packed
In one corner: Julian
Charlie Ling beside him along with Ko Sam
He looks focussed
Confident
In the other corner: Chang
Kim next to him along with a couple of his crew
He looks incredibly calm
The first bell sounds
Five second warning
Chang looks over into the crowd
Kanita with Nadee
Kanita offers him a 'thumbs up'
Chang smiles
Returns it
Julian looks over
Sees Mai take a seat
She holds his gaze
The second bell sounds
The first of five rounds
Julian and Chang walk up to the centre of the ring
The Referee stands between them
Brings them together
quick look down to the Three Judges
Then a look between the two fighters
Julian eyes Chang
Steely determination in his eyes
Chang looks back at him without emotion
( ) Fight
Julian and Chang circle each other
Julian moves in to attack first
He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps his left foot forward at the same time
Chang bends his right leg, dodging the attack
He then pounces on the upper part of Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his left hand
He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's too strong
This is a surprise for Chang
He breaks and steps back
Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an attack on Chang's head
Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut, connecting hard with Julian's chin
Julian moves back, dazed
Takes a moment to get his bearings back
That hurt
Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack
He hangs back
Waiting for Julian to come at him again
This pisses Julian off
He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot
Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike with a counter attack
He moves too slow
The right footed attack was a feint
Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back
Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards
He bounds over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs and punches to his upper body and face
Chang's almost on the ropes
Julian comes in hard with kicks to the shins with his right foot
Chang bends his body to pass under Julian's right foot
Julian misses the target
Chang manages to place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him fall down
Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make the killer blow
He steps back to let him recover
Again this enrages Julian
He gets up and moves forward towards Chang
He comes in with a high right kick
Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee
Julian swivels, punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut
His guard's down
But again no killer punch
Come on
Chang retreats
Shrugs at Julian
You come on
Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take out his frustrations, the bell goes
End of round one
Julian stalks back to his corner
He turns to look at Chang, a look of intense anger and frustration
: - Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting
Julian waits for Chang this time
Chang is reluctant to attack
waiting game
Who will strike first
Chang wins
Julian moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as he moves in
Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own kick as it comes in
Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels, using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike with his left foot
Chang goes flying backwards
the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and Kanita
Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches and elbows
Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten
He clings on to Julian to limit the damage
( ) Break
The two fighters step back from each other
Chang's face is damaged
Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds
End of the second round
Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang
Nadee comforting Kanita
Telling her it'll be okay
Chang responding with kicks and elbows
Defensive blocks and counter attacks
Mai willing Julian on
Jenna watching with Gordon
End of round: Julian feeling more confident
Again his eyes scan the crowd
This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna
Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner
Sees him staring into the crowd
Looks over
Tries to see what he's looking at but can't make it out
from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian
When she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the fight - urging him to hit harder
Jenna then walks back to Gordon
On Chang
Deep in thought
He gets up early
Walks around the ring
Looking into the crowd
Jenna sees him
Stares at him
Suddenly nervous
Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again
The colours of the room change from blue to yellow to red
He's seen her and she knows she's been seen
And he knows
And she knows that he knows
The bell goes off
Back to reality
Chang turns round
Too late
He gets a massive blow to his head
He goes down hard
The Referee starts counting
Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful
Jenna holds her breath
Hopeful that he might be down and out
Kim watches on, concerned
( ) Get up
Please get up
After a long, terrible pause
Chang gets up
He looks over into the crowd
Makes eye contact with his wife
It's okay
She shakes her head
She can't bear it
Tears running down her face
Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard
Julian hesitates, confused
Chang leans in close to him
Winks
It wasn't you, was it
Julian shrugs, puts his guard up
(') You're innocent
What are you talking about
It's not your fault
Chang raises his arms again
Ready to fight
Julian gets ready to attack but something's changed
The fire's gone out of him
He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in his mind
It's not his fault
Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches
Left, right, left, right
Julian just takes them
Chang pauses in the onslaught
Julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring
Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out a roundhouse left kick - - which makes contact with Julian's draw
as Julian's head takes the impact
He's out cold before he hits the floor
: : - Jenna hurries down the corridor
She reaches the dressing room door
She's about to knock but she stops
She opens the door silently and lets herself in
: - Julian's sitting on the treatment table, his face covered in cuts and bruises
Jenna watches him in silence from the shadows, steadies her breathing and then slips back out of the room
: - Jenna comes out of the changing rooms as Mai approaches
Jenna shakes her head
He doesn't want to see anyone
Mai is disappointed
Doesn't know what to say
(') Just give him time
tell him  came
Of course
Jenna hugs Mai close
(') We'll get him through this together
: - Julian turns when he hears a knock at the door
Says nothing
Jenna enters and closes the door behind her
She stands there for a moment as if considering what to say
You deserved to win
You should've -- Give it a break mum
Just
give it as rest
He steps into the light
She reaches out to touch him
'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win
Yeah, well  lost
And did it make a difference
Julian says nothing
(') want to know
Did it make a difference
Slowly he shakes his head
No
it didn't make a difference
No difference at all
And how do you feel now
Nothing
don't feel anything at all
Don't you see, that's how  felt when Billy died
Julian studies his mother
What do you want, Mum
Beat
What d'you think  want
want it to be like it used to be
don't want to lose you
Jenna starts crying
Could be real, could be an act - hard to tell she's so good
What's wrong Mum
She shakes her head
Can't say it
(') What's wrong
He knows
He knows it was me
Who does
Beat
Jenna says nothing
Julian thinks
Cogs turn
(') Chang
Jenna nods
(') What did you do, Mum
What did you do
Jenna makes her hand into a pistol
Pretends to fire it into her skull
She tried to have Chang killed
Julian's speechless
He's going to come after me
And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you
Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone
(') 'm scared, Julian
Julian stares at his mother
(') What are we going to do
Julian begins to realize what he has to do
and he looks at his hands
Finally
We'll be okay - 'll do it, 'll take him out
Not just him
We've got to take them all out
Julian stares at her - the power she has over him
(') Kill them all
The final solution
: '  /  - Chang, Nadee and Kanita are having a nice dinner - happy that Chang won and enjoying each other's company in silence
: '  / ' Chang tucks in his daughter
Nadee watches from the doorway
Kanita still has some dolls on her bed
He starts taking them off
Notices one of them is broken
( ) What happened to the princess' head
( ) The monsters were angry
They bit it off
( ) thought the King banished them all from his kingdom
( ) These were new monsters
The woods are full of them
Chang holds the broken princess' body
sudden wave of fear washes over him
sense of doom
(') ( ) What's wrong Dad
( ) Nothing's wrong
Go to sleep
: '  / Chang speaks on the phone
( ) They're going to come after me
Okay
Good
He ends the call
Stares at his reflection in the window
: '  /   - Chang gets into bed next to his wife
Switches off the light
The two of them are bathed in moonlight
He holds his wife's hand
: - It's still early - the sun is only just starting to rise over he city
Charlie Ling's driving, Ko Sam beside him
Julian's in the back street
His face is a mask, his eyes hidden by his sunglasses
next to him is a silver shining motorcycle helmet
: '  /  - Chang is eating breakfast as he watches a western on
: - Nadee and Kanita walk through the various stalls buying groceries
: '  - Chang is dressed - finishing putting on his tie - ready for the day
He walks into his sitting room as he hears his mobile ring
( ) Hello
( ) She is in her room
( ) You sure it's her
( ) Yes
( ) Good
see you very soon
and Chang hangs up
The Angel of Vengeance getting ready to strike again
: '   - Chang steps out of his apartment into the hallway where a uniformed policeman sits on guard reading a Manga comic
( ) What's your name
( ) Li Hom
( ) Listen Li Hom
You see anyone you don't like
You call me, okay
Li Hom nods
Chang leaves
( ) And by the way
Chang turns
(') ( ) Congratulations
Last night
Everyone in the station's talking about it
Chang nods
Leaves
: /
- The car's parked outside Gordon's apartment block
Gordon's not shown
Julian's calling him
We're outside
(
) Sorry mate, something's come up
Julian pauses
Can't believe it
need you here
Right now
(
) know but
'm busy
What 'm doing, it's important
'm sorry mate
Julian's incredibly frustrated but hasn't got time to argue
Okay
Julian kills his phone
He's still for a moment, then: (') Let's make a move
: '  - Chang and the Cops walk into the hotel
Chang heads for the elevators while Kim approaches reception
Chang calls the lift and waits
Kim comes back
They wont disturb us
Chang nods
The elevator door opens
What floor
Top
: - Chang and the Cops are standing in the elevator waiting to get off
Elevator music plays
: '  - Julian is walking around Chang's apartment
looking at all family pictures
getting a sense of how they live
He opens drawers and closets and studies all the photos of Chang as a boxer and soldier
on a wall is a framed article in Thai that Charlie Ling is reading
What's it say
Charlie starts reading the article out: "Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave"
One of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah, came out of a coma that lasted for an entire year, waking up as if nothing had happened
Wife was really happy, blah blah blah
"It's hard to describe" Chang said, "but  do feel different
" Charlie starts to sneer as he reads
Julian is listening intently
(') " experienced something metaphysical, impossible to explain
travelled to many places and saw many things
And when  woke up  was no longer the man  once was
" The Angel Of Vengeance
: '   - Nadee and Kanita come out of the elevator and Nadee quickly sees that police guard from before has been replaced by someone else (Ko Sam)
Ko Sam smiles
( ) 'm the new guard
Please, go on in
Nadee looks at him suspiciously but enters the apartment with Kanita
Ko Sam pretends to go back to reading his Manga comic
: '  / '  - Jenna sips tea from a China cup
She puts it back down on to her saucer
Kim is sitting opposite her
Chang stands in the background
came here to collect my son's body
Now it's released, my business in Bangkok is completed
When are you leaving
Tonight
And your other son - is he going with you
've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away
You watched him fight
Jenna looks over to Chang
watched him lose
And he deserved to
You were the better fighter
My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here
And paid for it with his life
Kim and the rest of the crew take this in
(') 'll never testify against my own flesh and blood, Officer Chang
But he's a killer
Chang senses something
Starts to become agitated
(') It pains me to say it, but my own son is a killer
He killed a cop back in England ten years ago
He's been on the run ever since
say son
But he hasn't been a son to me
Chang stares at the door to the bedroom
Feels the presence of someone the other side of the door
(') Not for a long time
Not since he killed that cop back home
That was ten years ago
He's been running ever since
And he'll never stop until he's caught
Until you catch him
Chang starts to push the door open
Behind him Jenna stands up
Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings
It sounds  loud
He takes it out and looks at the display with a feeling of dread
He answers
( ) (
) ( ) It's me
Did you change the guard
: '  /  - Nadee is in the kitchen putting away the groceries as she is speaking with Chang
(
) ( ) No
( ) Someone else is out there now
: '  / '  - Chang begins to panic
His eyes fall upon Jenna
( ) Get out of the apartment
: '  / Nadee hear's Kanita call for her from the living room
( ) Hold on
: '  / '  - Chang screams down the phone: ( ) : '  /  - But Nadee is holding the phone against her chest and can't hear Chang as she walks into the living room
: '  /   - where Julian is sitting on the couch wearing the motorcycle helmet, a shotgun on his lap
Kanita is standing in the middle of the room, staring at Julian
Charlie Ling leans against the opposite wall, a pistol in his hand
Nadee remains silent, trying to think fast
: '  / '  - Chang listens to the phone, knowing something's wrong
Jenna stares at him, defiant
Their eyes lock briefly
But Chang hasn't got time for this
He barges past her and out of the room
: '  /  - The   with Chang as he runs down the corridor in total desperation
: '   - The   towards the main door
: '  - Nadee who stares at the main door then slowly turns back to Julian
She knows they're trapped
Beat
( ) Kanita - go to your room
But Kanita stands still - fear in her eyes
(') ( ) go to your room now
And slowly Kanita walks towards her room as Charlie Ling watches her
Kanita closes the door
Beat - silence
Julian stands up and walks toward Nadee - raises his shotgun and blows her head off
Blood spatters onto the wall, bits of brain and skull everywhere as her body falls to the ground
: - Chang stops in his tracks
It's as if he can feel the shotgun blast in his heart
He knows what's just happened
He stands still
He closes his eyes as if he had only to wish to make it all go away
He opens them again to see
The street is completely deserted
Chang stands alone in the middle of a ghost town
: '  - Julian takes off his helmet that's covered in blood, throws it onto the floor and walks toward the front door
Wait
Julian turns back
Charlie Ling nods towards Kanita's room
(') The kid
Julian shakes his head
No way
-- Who said
Beat
(') My mother
Charlie Ling nods
(') What kind of a mother says that
If you've got a problem, talk to her
No
We're not doing it
You don't have to
will
Charlie Ling kicks open the door
Julian realises he can't let him do it
And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita
Julian shoots him in the back
Charlie Ling slumps to the floor
Julian approaches the doorway
He looks in
Sees Kanita sitting on her bed
She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at his feet
They hold each other's gaze
and then Julian slowly bows his head and leaves
: '   - Julian walks out of the apartment with the shotgun raised, expecting to shoot Ko Sam
But the hallway is empty
: - Julian stumbles out of the apartment, desperately catching his breath
He ends up leaning on a stall - similar to the one he knocked over outside Choi Yan Lee's kiosk
Candles and incense
Buddha's smiling back at him
Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and incredibly vibrant
group of school children, all of whom are Downs Syndrome, are crossing the road
Smiles plastered across their faces
Julian stares at them
Their presence seems to have a calming effect on him, as if they're giving him new energy to do what he's starting to realize he has to do next
: '  - Chang stares at the body of his dead wife
Perfectly still
His crew in the background
: '  /  - Julian walks across towards the lift, the shotgun hidden inside his shirt
: - Lift music
Julian stands perfectly still in the lift as it goes up
Just like Chang did before
: - As Julian walks down the corridor he takes the shotgun out - holds it out in front of him as if it were a sacred weapon
He reaches the door to his mother's room and pauses
Julian stares at the door as if it was heaven's gate
He loads the shotgun with two fresh cartridges
Only God forgives
And now mother - you will die
He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot
The door - - but it's Gordon who opens it, dressed in a bathrobe
Confused, Julian continues to level the weapon at his head
Gordon backs away into the room
Easy
Julian says nothing
Edges into the room
The gun still pointed at Gordon's head
Julian says nothing
Kicks the door closed with his foot
Where's is she
She's gone
Picked up Billy's body
She's gone home
Finally Julian lowers the shotgun
(') Didn't she tell you
Julian sits down
(') You alright mate
'you want something
Julian mumbles to himself
then turns to Gordon
Realisation dawning on him: 'm so fucked
: /   - Kanita sits in a chair, her father standing behind her
Very formal
Kim is showing her various head shots of criminals
Kanita shakes her head until Chang puts down a picture of Julian
She looks up at her father - nods
: - Jenna gazes out of the window
She takes out her compact and adjusts her make up
: - Jenna's taxi heads over the Mega Bridge, taking her away towards the airport
: - Gordon and Julian walk towards Gordon's car, the sounds of their footsteps ricocheting off the concrete walls
Reaching the car, Gordon stands by the driver's door as Julian heads for the passenger's side
Gordon pauses before unlocking the door
Looks over to Julian, talking across the roof of the car
We're good mates aren't we
Beat
Julian's instantly suspicious
Yeah
'm sorry about this Julian
wish there was another way
Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head
What did she say
What did she promise you
Don't make this harder-- bullet  through Julian's shoulder
He falls back on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms
Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow
(') You've become a liability
You can see that, can't you
Julian looks at the wound
It's deep but he's not totally incapacitated
He pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt
It clatters to the floor
(') And now she wants me to take over
She wants me to be the favoured son
What am  supposed to say
Julian sinks to his knees, leaning over to pick up the shotgun
He's got seconds
(') didn't want it to end like this
First fuck your mother
Then -- Gordon turns the corner - but Julian's in position
Two shots in quick succession
Both barrels fired at Gordon's chest
The force of the explosion  Gordon's body against the far wall of the car park
Dead instantly
Julian pulls himself up and stands there, the smoking shotgun acting as a makeshift crutch
He gazes at Gordon's steaming corpse, appalled by the turn of events
: - Julian falls out into a side street
He's badly wounded but he's going to make it
: - Julian takes the top off a vodka bottle with his teeth
He pours the spirit over his wound
It stings like hell and Julian screams in agony
: - Julian walks out into the night, the neon glow turning the streets into a modern day Hades
Although the wound isn't life threatening, Julian's face is pale from the loss of blood
He looks like a ghost
He sees two cops chatting on a street corner
They don't see him, they're not even looking for him, but they remind him
Chang
It's just a matter of time
Julian keeps walking
Wipes sweat from his face
Looking for a place to hide
hole in the ground
Anything
Then suddenly it comes to him
single idea
possible way of escape
: - series of napkins are rolled and placed in a steadily growing pile
The work is being carried out by Mai who has a lowly position in a massive and sterile industrial kitchen
Not the sort of life she planed on having
Co-Worker calls out to her
- ( ) Mai
Some guy's out there asking for you
Mai finishes the last napkin and places it on the pile
She walks towards the exit, passing her Co-Worker
- (') ( ) Don't forget it's supposed to be my break next
: - Mai comes from round a corner and sees Julian leaning against the wall
She checks that they're alone, knowing instinctively that he's in trouble
What happened to you
Beat
Julian almost smiles
've got to get out of Bangkok
Didn't want to leave
He winces
(') without saying goodbye
Who did this to you
pause
My mother
She made me what  am
And now 've got nothing
And they're after me
Mai stares at him
Come with me
Julian looks at her
(') to Cambodia - we can hide there
You'll be safe there
Mai and Julian smile at each other
It's sweet
Innocent
got about twelve grand at the club
Should be enough to get us there
Set ourselves up
Disappear
Now
Right now
Mai looks around - they're alone
Wait outside
: /
- Julian watches as Mai comes into the Restaurant from the kitchen and walks over to the bar area
Making sure no one's watching, Mai starts to pull money out of the til
Julian looks over at the shop front next to him
Travel Agency
Pictures of holidays and beaches
Paradise
It all seems in his grasp
Mai comes up to him
Let's go
: - Mai and Julian are in the Taxi
He puts his arm around her
They're on their way
: - The taxi pulls up outside Juilan's club
: - Julian gets out of the taxi
Stay here
If 'm not out in five minutes
Go
Mai nods
Five minutes
Julian nods and slams the door shut
Mai watches Juilan disappear into the building
: - We   Julian's empty club
It's silent and empty like a tomb
We   Julian as he hurries through towards his office
: - Back where we first met him
Julian flings open the door to his safe and starts pulling wads of money into a canvas hold all
He's about to leave when he notices someone standing in the shadows behind him
Slowly, out of the darkness, a series of figures appear like vampires
Chang and the Cops
Impossible to say how long they've been standing there
Chang and Julian stare at each other
Let's go
We   to a   on Julian
It's almost as if this moment was inevitable
: - Chang brings Julian out of the club
police car is waiting outside
Mai sits in the back seat
: - The police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town
: - Daeng is driving
Kim sits next to him
Daeng looks into the rearview mirror to see-- Julian and Mai sitting next to Chang
Mai looks scared
Julian more accepting of his fate
: - The Police Car heads over the Mega Bridge and continues its way out of town
: - They all sit in the car in silence
: - The Police Car pulls up
: - Chang leads Juilan across the field
The Cops follow a few steps behind with Mai
Suddenly, and completely unexpectedly, Chang punches Julian in the gut
Julian falls to the floor and Chang starts to viciously attack him, punching and kicking him
Finally Julian, unable to defend himself, is lying on the ground, immobile
( ) Get up
Julian rolls over
Eyes Chang
Slowly he starts to get up onto his knees
They continue, Chang forcing Julian to crawl as they make their way further into the field
Then Chang stops
(') ( ) Get up
Now
Julian struggles to get up to his feet, but before he does, Chang kicks him hard in the chest, sending him back down to the floor
'm sorry
( ) Do you have anything to say
Don't hurt her
He kicks him in the stomach
( ) Do you have anything to say
'm sorry
Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog
Juilan groans
Chang squats down next to him
( ) What do you expect me to do
don't know
'm sorry
Chang gets up and walks on
He stops and turns round
( ) Come on
Julian stumbles to his feet
The party continue
We see that one of the crew is carrying an axe
: /   - couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point
Chang looks down at Julian who is lying on the ground
The crew stand in the background with Mai
Chang sits next to Julian
( ) When you were born - what's the first thing you remember seeing
beat as Julian struggles to understand Chang's question
Chang stares at him
(') ( ) What do you remember
Beat
Dark
Darkness
Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some meaning for him
( ) And do you ever see light
Julian shakes he's head
No
Never
Chang considers this answer for a long moment
He gets up and returns to Mai - stares at her
( ) am the Angel of Vengeance
restore order and karma
love all living things
Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move
(') ( ) want you to walk away from here now
Do you understand
Mai nods
(') ( ) Good
Chang smiles at her
(') ( ) Go with God
Mai turns and leaves
Chang watches her disappear into the field
Chang takes the axe off Phaiban and turns back to Julian
: - Mai walks through the field, alone
: /   - Chang leans down next to Julian and whispers something into Julian's ear - so softly that we cannot hear it
Whatever it says it instantly has an effect on Julian
He visibly relaxes
He doesn't make a sound as he's held down
plastic strap is tied around his arm as a tourniquet
His arm is pulled out
Chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then his right
Julian grits his teeth throughout
Doesn't scream
Chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs
The dogs tear into the meat, fighting over their prize
: - Chang and his men walk back towards the car
once again
the Karaoke version of John Denver's country and western ballad
(
) Almost heaven, West Virginia Blue ridge mountains Shenandoah river - Life is old there Older than the trees Younger than the mountains Growin' like the breeze
: - We see various scenes of every day life in Bangkok
(
) Country roads, take me home To the place  belong West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads : - We see kids waiting outside the school for their parents to pick them up
Kanita spots Chang, runs towards him and they embrace
(
) All my memories gathered round her Miners lady, stranger to blue water Dark and dusty, painted on the sky Misty taste of moonshine Teardrops in my eye
Chang and Kanita disappear into a crowd of policemen
: - Chang is in his element
Singing like a cowboy
Country roads, take me home to the place  belong West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads
The Cops sit and watch him
Their leader
Their God
: - Julian is lying in hospital
Bandages covering the terrible wounds where his hands once were
Mai is sitting beside him
Spoon feeding him food
(
) hear my voice In the mornin' hour she calls me The radio reminds me of my home far away And drivin' down the road  get a feelin' That  should have been home yesterday, : - An aeroplane lands
(
) Country roads, take me home To the place  belong - Jenna is in the process of being strip searched by the authorities
Zero dignity
(
) West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads As one of the Custom's Officers puts on a rubber glove, Jenna starts to scream out obscenities at them
Mask off, a real monster underneath, flailing around for all to see
: - Chang keeps singing
Country roads, take me home to the place  belong West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads Take me home, country roads Take me home, country roads And we end  on Chang
With the sense that the 'country roads' have kind of taken both of them home
