Written by John August November 2006 One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors: 1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel 2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra 3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary It'll make more sense in context

We're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus
It's like the first moments after a dream -- just fragments
Scissors cut the string
The man wraps it around his left wrist

We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight
His fingers pull against the string
Solid
It won't break easily

No sound at all, really, except for some distant birds

He's 30, effortlessly fit, with movie-star good looks
(Although for now, he's merely a  star
) Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a car
Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running
Gary spots what he was looking for
: 102                                                                    102 /    -   () Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle
One of its wheels is broken,  against the deck
, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the city
He couldn't fucking care less
He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it down the canyon

He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames
There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip-flopped foot
He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside
He sprays until the container is  air
He shakes it, making sure it's really empty
Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying
And spraying
We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of Gary and a
Her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable
Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck
Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside
He takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket

On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet
: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us through these
In  -, we follow the burning match as it sails through the air, tumbling end-over-end
Just as it's about to reach its target, we

It's the display of Gary's Prius
We are

take us out of Hollywood, heading downtown
Our   is serving us well
Gary stops at a light
He looks left and sees himself on the side of a bus
It's an ad for   ("This fall, Mondays are killer
") Gary watches himself drive away

106   Further along, Gary spots two   sitting on a 106 low wall
He calls out to them: Hey
Do you sell crack
The boys look wary
(') It's cool
'm only a cop on
: Money changes hands
Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do with its lumpy beige contents
: 107                                                                   107 Gary pulls up to a curb
He's now on Sunset Blvd matronly black streetwalker (, 35) approaches the passenger window
Gary holds up the little bag
Is this crack
She takes a closer look
(') Do you know how to do it
: 108                                                                   108 - Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to bounce higher than the other,  all the while
Gary bounces so high that he  his head against the ceiling
He crumples, falling off the bed
But he's still laughing
: 109                                                                   109 , Octavia is sleeping

He notices something odd
He tries to wake Octavia up, but she's down for the count
Looking around, he finds his cell phone
Dials 911
Pacing, he tries to sober up while it rings
The far side answers
Yes, hello
'm having a medical situation
Yes
Okay
don't have a belly button
(explaining carefully) do not have a belly button where should, on my belly
And 'm concerned, because  don't know if that's
He sits down on the edge of the bed
(') Can a person live without a belly button
Because if you think about it, you're born with one
So if you don't have one, you're unborn and it's really hazy whether you're alive or not
guess 'm wondering: am  alive
(a sudden thought) Or what if 'm God
beat
(') No, no
'm totally sober

(') No,  don't think  need an ambulance
don't seem to be dying any faster than usual
But should probably go to the hospital, don't you think
Yeah,  should

He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two A113                                                                  A113 sitting in the back seat
All three Garys give each other thumbs-up
Driver-Gary looks out the driver-side window, where he sees shoes and asphalt
Only now do we  to reveal we're B113                                                                  B113 -

La la la la la
Like you've never done worse
From a  , we see she's using a cell phone earpiece

He totalled a car
But it was an environmentally friendly car
Why doesn't that get reported

(') Please
He was heartbroken, betrayed
You say you understand but you don't
You can't
You're like a big giant Vulcan

Noticing something to her right
(') He's coming
'll call you later
She hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone
We reveal being escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand

She's been here before
Are there reporters out front
few
Not Hugh Grant level
More like Robert Downey, Jr
when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks
"This bed is just right

This sort of thing is my specialty

Famous fuck-ups
Don't worry

The phone on the counter is
Answer it
Gary picks it up
Hello
Yes
Yes
He looks to Margaret while the other end of the call talks at length
Then, very deliberately
(') The weather in Toledo is rainy
He says this like a sleeper agent repeating his trigger phrase
Use your normal voice
(to the phone) Nine dogs ran through the field
The koala sits in the tree
The Parole Officer takes the phone from him, punching in a series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet
It's computer voice recognition
The system can call you any time day or night
If you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your ass off
What if 'm not here
Catching the officer's concerned look
That's why it's called house arrest
You stay inside your house

Gary wanders, checking it all out
Okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable
didn't mean to burn down my house
Yeah,  didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it
(moving on) This flammable house belongs to one of Lola's other fabulous clients, who is currently shooting a pilot in Toronto

He'll probably get a sick thrill of out it
The gays
Noticing two crates
He has dogs
They're away at summer camp
Now, try the bed
He lies back on it, feeling it out
It's fine
Comfortable
Sure
She massages his besocked feet

Look, Gary,  know this has been crazy and stressful
want you to feel safe
And comfortable
do
'm a fan of yours, you know
Your number-one fan
Gary looks over his toes at Margaret
From this angle, she looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery
(') But if you fuck this up,  will smash your ankles with a sledge hammer

(') That wouldn't be comfortable for either of us

'll be coming by twice a day to check up on you
'm the only person who should be coming by
No buddies, no pals, no heroin dealers
don't do heroin
Yeah, crack is classy
And 'm not buying you porn
There's spray-per- view on cable
Good
really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future
just wanted to jack off
Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone
10
Let me see your phone
He hands over his cell phone
She drops it in the contraband box
'mon
All my numbers are in that
Dial ten digits at random
Whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone
She picks up the liquor box, ready to go
(') You have my cell number
You have delivery menus
You're fine
Right
guess
As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the stove
She adds it to the box, just to be sure

He plays a few  on the piano
He looks up at the painting over the staircase:    a cliff near the ocean
He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots
There isn't
He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the dining room, which show the same thing in three different ways
120                                                                    120 - Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself
He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet

122                                                                     122 /   - He takes a bag of food from a college-age  , who seems to recognize him
Gary pays him, shuts the door
As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk
The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to being stared at
123                                                                     123 - Gary unwraps the Thai food
Makes himself a plate
He watches   on the plasma screen while eating dinner
(
) Once we get these samples back to the Crime Lab, we'll know who the real killer is
124                                                                     124 /   - Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read
There are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his lifetime
He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide
He lies back on the couch, reading it
He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more interesting

We're   Gary's straining face, but we can hear the pleasured  of the actresses as they go down on each other
Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on
He can't find anything

126                                                                     126 - His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from the  room to the downstairs bathroom
We hear as he washes his hands
Then it shuts off
We hear a
Something hard was dropped on the wood floor
Gary hears it too
He steps out of the bathroom, looks around
He takes a few silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he reaches the two-story section of the foyer
That's when he hears it: --- on the wooden floor
of metal
We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway
We can hear the little , toe nails
Faint But there's no dog
Gary, increasingly unsettled
He's directly below the walkway, and can't see up into it
Is somebody there
Hello
He  his hands twice
Listens
Nothing
He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly He nearly jumps out of his skin
It  two more times before he ducks into the  room to answer it
(') Hello
(relieved) Yes
Yes
He turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions on the phone
(') Nine leopards run through the jungle
(listening) bought two cakes at the store
His identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up
He looks back into the foyer

(-) (') The house is haunted
There's a zeitgeist, or something

Poltergeist, and no
Maybe they were rats
is teaming with rats
They live in the palm trees
Sure
Maybe
He's obviously not convinced
Okay
You know 'm a licensed psychotherapist
Really
No
'm a publicist
My job is what other people think of you, not what you think of yourself
So pull your shit together
am thisclose to getting Christine Walsh to do your piece in Parade
Parade
fucking hate Parade
Everyone hates Parade
But the people who watch "Crime Lab," they love their Marilyn Vos Savant
Give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee-haw heaven
Okay
One heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner won't kill off your character between seasons
He nods
He gets it

(') swear to God, if you go batshit on me
'm not crazy
Exactly
Exactly

Suddenly, a golf ball hits him on the head
He sits up, perplexed
For a long moment, he has no idea where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond the wall that separates the properties
' Sorry
Really sorry
( practiced ear notices a Canadian accent
) '  (') Over here
To your left
(correcting) Right
Sorry
Right
He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner of the yard, finding
Late 30's, fresh- scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really is
'm working on my putting, if you can believe it
Indeed, she's holding a putter
Not really
Okay
Maybe  was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor
You see, 'm under house arrest, too
What did you do

That's awful
Nine months later,  had Jaden
That's her over there

She sounds really boring

You're rich
Shouldn't you have a nanny from Ecuador

Plus, want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself
Very Canadian
Thanks
Another pregnant pause

(') Listen, Jaden goes down again at 2:30
Maybe  could stop by
'm pretty sure 'll be here
It's a date
Is it
She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house
Suddenly, she realizes
Oh
'm Sarah, by the way
Gary
Yeah

He plumps pillows
He looks up at the clock:      2:30
He sits, trying to read Candide again
He fidgets
He looks at the clock again:     2:49

But there's no one in there

He turns it on
He opens the piano bench, finding computer disks
red disk is labelled "Knowing
" He puts it in
Hits play
The piano begins playing by itself, a sensuous but melancholy Gary lies on the floor, listening to it
He stares up at the elaborate chandelier

He looks over to see Sarah coming up the steps, carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay
She stops beside him
The best of all possible worlds

Candide
(off his reaction) Are you actually reading it

They're both on the couch
The baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them
so it's kind of hard to prove that  only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house
Yeah
Fire's tricky that way
How about you
Any history of arson
Strangely enough
knew it
could see that little spark
It wasn't arson
Probably

(') Okay
When  was a little girl, our house caught on fire

Oh shit

'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the burning building, out onto the pavement

And when it was all over,  said to myself, "Is that all there is to a fire
" Is that all there is
As she starts to , Gary realizes the story isn't hers at all
It's Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is

If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
She leans closer
(') Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
Standing up, Sarah takes Gary's hands, pulling him off the couch
She leads him to an open area -- more space for dancing

If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball, If that's all there is

It's not going well
Her eyes are tearing up

She's (futilely) trying to match a specific light switch plate

If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all

They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up and down over clothing
Sarah isn't singing anymore, though her voice continues

' Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball, If that's all there

Sarah pushes back

He dries them and puts them back in the cabinet
Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it down the sink
Instead, he chugs it from the bottle
He wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the recycling

It reads: Look for the Nines

The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab
("This fall, Mondays are murder
") The bench side is a promo poster for a show called Knowing
("Some fates are chosen for you
") It's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his toes where the rat trap snapped
He's hobbled his way here from the house, which is probably a block away
There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt
Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl (Noelle) watching him with concern
She  on the shelter to get his attention
Gary nearly jumps out of his skin

We see that Gary's left foot also features bandaged toes
Think of it like an electronic leash
Basically, if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station
She points to an electronic device by the wall

He starts circling things with a red Sharpie
His pen circles the number nine every time it appears
As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the rounded trellis, just a few feet away
She's holding her own newspaper, still in the wrapper
Hey neighbor
Hi

Sorry for the psychotic episode
'll blame it on hormones
Okay
Are you alright
You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish
He almost deflects it, but decides to trust her: How many times should the number nine come up
Probablistically
Probablistically
(annoyed) You know what  mean
One time out of ten
How about every time
He hands her the paper through the bars

It's some sort of motion detector
Gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough that the light never engages

Margaret enters, carrying two mugs
She watches him warily
You okay
No
Oh
Tell me about the Nines
The Nines
The Nines
Sort of hard to start there

He takes the mug, then reconsiders
Maybe it's laced with something

Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about to happen

The Moderator directs her next question to the Agitated Man

She doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot
There's so much to set up, you don't get a lot of Melissa- time

That's one of the challenges with a premise pilot

Why are you focusing on Melissa

Because she's the biggest concern
She's also the biggest star in the show
No, you're the biggest star
Roger made a huge deal with you, and he went along with casting Melissa when that wasn't his instinct
Well, hooray for Roger
don't understand what you want me to do
Meet with someone

Dahlia Salem
Gavin drops his fork so that it will  on his plate
(') The network has a holding deal with her
Yes
And you put her in Gatin's pilot
It's dead
It's dying
But the network loves Dahlia
So if she could jump over to your show
Replace Melissa and reshoot the pilot
Roger would pay for it
Gavin is nauseous
He has to take a drink to be able to speak
So is this even about Melissa

It's about getting your show on the air

He's trying to get away from the camera, but it keeps following him
He reaches a crosswalk
He has to wait for the light

Gavin looks left, where an African-American woman is waiting for the same crosswalk
(We recognize her as Octavia, the streetwalker from Part One
) 'm fine
Who were you talking to
Gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression
We see Gavin and the woman on the corner
There's no camera Gavin could have been talking to

Was there ever anyone there
Our  style has changed:    instead of handheld and jerky, we're smooth and slow
The  has completely changed, underscoring a sense of creeping dread

Still a little unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street
Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her head: , we see that everyone on the street has the same kind of sphere floating a foot above their heads
No one seems to see the lights other than Gavin
Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just landed on an alien world

Above his own head, he sees the same sphere of light -- only his is bright white

By instinct, he sits back
Everything is what it is

Okay, then

Her daughter is nowhere to be seen

Maybe if  just cut back, didn't get so involved
We both know that'll never work
Next week, you'll be back here redesigning the pinecones
You have to quit cold-turkey
can't

You can
But  can't force you to leave
You have to want it
She takes his hand, running a finger through the green string bracelet around his wrist
She kisses him
And then she's gone
Gabriel stands there for a long beat, considering his decision

Noelle
She's nowhere to be found
Then, from behind her
She's here
Gabriel is walking up the gravel road, with Noelle holding his hand
(') didn't forget you guys
Mary regards him as a familiar stranger, a beloved imposter
Everything okay
Absolutely
Let's go home

Both Mary and Noelle watch with interest as he pushes the "" button
The car and engages without any problem
Everyone fastens their seatbelts

Mary tries to keep her eyes on the scenery, but they keep drifting over to Gabriel, trying to read what he's thinking
321                                                                   321 - The Prius turns on to the paved road

He spoons Mary, who kisses his hand
On both Mary and Gabriel's faces, we see anxiety
Things left unsaid

- Gabriel stands in the doorway, looking out at the inky-blue sky
His eyes are red, tired
He hasn't slept at all
It's very quiet, except for the occasional precocious Mary enters from the living room, still in her pajamas
He knows she's there
Neither wants to speak
You need to go, don't you
No
can stay
How long
Forever
Every day, you'd know what you were missing
He smiles, a little
(') What happens
If you go
Worst-case scenario
Spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void
Oblivio accebit
The end of everything
That's all
Both smile
That probably wouldn't happen
The basic structure of the universe should hold
guess 'm just worried about the human factor
You guys kill each other a lot
92
In fairness, that's usually in your name
Plus we've gotten much more efficient at it
beat
like this world
like my life, here, with you and Noelle
But it's not real
'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband
On some level, it's all pretend
It's not pretend
There's a reason you were there, in every version
You were my sister, my wife, my best friend
That's a little creepy
wanted you close
In one version,  even told you
warned you that some day they might come for me, and
You'd have to leave
How many versions were there
Ninety
This is the last one
Wow
've destroyed billions of people with a thought
Obliterated them
And you'd like to think it's painless
Stop
You don't have to explain, or apologize
Everything that is, is because of you
If that's all, that's enough
With that, there's really nothing more to say
93
(') So
So
Guess you don't really need to pack anything
'm good
You're great
It's been a pleasure
Likewise
love you
Love you, too
Ya big lug
He kisses her
It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell
At the end of it, he into her ear: You're my favorite
She smiles
With two fingers, Gabriel  the green string bracelet around his left wrist
And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary between water and air
He's stepped out of this dimension
Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two- dimensional images
She and everything around her has become like wallpaper, slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath
Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light
The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that ripple through the tissue-thin walls
Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window, heading west

Reaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the end of the pier
We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness
We see three lights in the distance
We join them, moving with them
Further ahead, more lights, circling
It's a loose spiral made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9
As we get closer and closer, we

As we  , we reveal it's not Mary, Melissa or Margaret, but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of them
We'll call her
She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing
Empty
'  (
) Honey, do we have nutmeg

We should
Coming around from behind Ben, Noelle checks through the spice drawer

Cinnamon, too

Notices she looks different than she expected

Noelle turns back with the spices, handing them to Ben one at a time
(') would name her Cinnamon
Really
And if  had another horse
Nutmeg
No, Flash
Sweetie
She beckons Noelle over
Tucks back the little girl's hair
Keeping her voice low enough so Ben can't hear: (') This is going to sound really strange, but
what's my name
Noelle only gives her a half-crazy look
Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy
Noelle smiles
smiles too, a little embarrassed
Right
Exactly
Noelle looks her right in the eye
He's not coming back
But it's gonna be okay
He put the pieces together, it's like
The best of all possible worlds
Noelle taps her nose
96
Honey
Is it supposed to stick like this
Sharing a look
We should help him
Noelle agrees
They head over to assist
We   the family as they work on the pancakes, Noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be
We leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen, gooey pancakes, and a good life

The following scene (Scene 99) is the conversation between and  that plays near the end of Part Three
The plan is to shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three
So we'll be shooting this scene a lot
We'll then be intercutting the best of all these moments to create one sequence
99                                                                    99 / It's not that hard to make a universe
At first, you just checked in every once in a while
See how the Neanderthals were doing
Move some continents around
But then you got more into it
Starting playing a couple of characters of your own
Kings
Slaves
Messiahs
Pretty soon, you were playing 24/7
How long have
You've been gone for four thousand years
Not that time means the same for us, but
You came looking for me
That's what a girl does
Why now
We couldn't just storm in on a fiery chariot
It's your universe
We had to play by your rules
We had to make you see how limited and corrupt your little world was
Don't get me wrong, this world is nice
It's cozy
But do you remember where you came from
few beats while it comes back to him
Tears start to build in his eyes
What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful
98
It was warm
And white
Like
You can't describe it with human words
You can't think it with human thoughts
(beat) That's why you have to come back
Come back with us
With me
