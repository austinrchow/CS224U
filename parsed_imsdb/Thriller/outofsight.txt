"Out Of Sight", production draft, by Scott Frank "Out of Sight" Screenplay by Scott Frank from the novel by Elmore Leonard White Final:        08/05/97 Blue Revised:       09/17/97 Pink Revised:       11/11/97 Green Revised:      12/15/97 Goldenrod Revised:  12/16/97 Buff Revised:       03/17/98 Salmon Revised:     03/23/98 We hear , some  , then
:    - The financial district
Lots of people in suits
shaky, spasmodic   finds
-- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter
He starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then
: As Foley goes inside, we then
:
'
We then     that we're now
as Foley stands at a counter holding the above while he studies the bank layout
Foley watches a    , carrying an attache-case, enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business area at the front
An  rises from his desk, shakes hands with the man and they both sit down
Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is
/ How can  help you, sir
Loretta, you see that guy talking to your manager, has his case open
Foley takes out a   and casually, yet expertly, begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank
That's Mr
Guindon, one of our assistant managers
Our manager is Mr
Schoen, but he's not in today
But you see the guy with the attache case
(looks again) Yes
That's my partner
He has a gun in there
And if you don't do exactly what  tell you, or you give me any kind of a problem, 'll look over at my partner and he'll shoot your Mr
Guindon between the eyes
Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley
(') Now take one of those big envelopes and put as many hundreds, fifties and twenties as you can pack into it
Nothing with bank straps or rubber bands
don't want any dye packs don't want any bait money
Start with the second drawer and then the one over there, under the computer
Come on, Loretta, the key's right there next to you
No bills off the bottom of the drawer
(as she works) First time being robbed
(she nods) You're doing great
Just smile, Loretta, so you won't look like you're being held up
(she smiles awkwardly) That's the way, you're doing fine
We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the front door
When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope
(') Here, give me the twenties
'll put 'em in my pocket
Okay,  haven't had to give my partner a sign; that's good
Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds till after 'm out the door, make sure you haven't set off the alarm
If you have, he's gonna shoot Mr
Guindon between the eyes
Okay
think that'll do it
Thank you, Loretta, and have a nice day
You, too
Foley heads for the door
He pauses by Mr
Guindon's desk, looks back at Loretta
Foley smiles at her, then turns to the Man sitting with Mr
Guindon, indicates Loretta
She's cute, isn't she
The man looks across the bank at Loretta
Uh, yeah,  guess so
Foley winks at Loretta and walks out
(') (to Mr
Guindon) Who was that
- As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in
- As Foley tries to start the car
No go
He tries again
Come on
But the car won't start
Foley bangs on the wheel
(') Fuck
Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open window into Foley's ear
think you flooded it
Foley looks to the passenger window, where  , smiling, now has his gun pointing at him
Get out've the car, sir
Wanna hear a funny story
Shut up and get out've the car
And as Foley obliges, we then
We hear a
Then see Foley in   as he jumps through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as we realize he's on his way to the rim when
rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down
- in progress
All of the men, Foley included, are dressed in blue coveralls and white -shirts
The game is rough
Hair is pulled
Eyes are poked
Faces punched
title reads: "
, " Foley is the oldest player here
He's getting tired, starts to lose his breath
He finally walks off the court, breathing so hard he can't even talk
He simply motions to to come in and take his place
Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath
He looks across the yard to where
sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards
All of them are over sixty
One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we
: As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal Mal and Lucky Strike packs
Another tends to a tomato bush in a tiny patch of garden near the wall
Another one sits nearby painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat
Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches his eye
He watches as
both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop and begin stretching out
One of them nods to Foley
Foley nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks over to a guard,  (""), heavy-set, dumb as dirt
You want something, Foley
Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game
Some people are going out of here
What if  told you where and when
How many
expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details
Okay
How many going out
hear six
When
Looks like tonight
You know who they are
do, but  won't tell you just yet
Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down
- As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea of white -shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting at a table full of other little Latins
-- fifties, in shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth
Chino's "wife", , nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down with a bunch of bikers
Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too
- Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette
He puts an arm around Lulu, starts to walk off
() Today's the day, huh
Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt
the next thing to having him on a leash
You excited
told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday
Yeah, but  see you moved it up
(beat) Why you think is today
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice
But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five
Saving yourself for the main event
Then  see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni
Carbohydrates for endurance
Chino and Lulu exchange looks
You want,  tole you you can come
You all right, Foley
like you
You told me  can come 'cause  caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out
Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him
(') So what, you finish ahead of schedule
Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard
You see what they doing, those posts out there
Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there
We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days
So we going soon as it's dark
You want --  mean it -- you can still come
appreciate the offer
And it's tempting
Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence not twenty yards away
(') But, man, it's a long run to civilization
hundred miles to Miami
'm too old to start acting crazy, try a stunt like that
You make it out, send me a postcard
: where we see someone has written "'
" then crossed out the "'" and replaced it with the word ""
We hear :
'  - Miami Beach Moderne
-- mid-thirties, pretty, Foley's ex -- sits at her kitchen table writing on a pad
She grabs the phone
Hello
(then, sighs) Yeah,  accept
- Foley on the phone
' Hey, Adele, how you doing
& : Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice
Next time, leave the engine running
That's funny, Adele
How many more times you gonna gimme that one
Till it's not funny any more
What do you want, Jack
You know that Super Bowl party
They changed the date
It's on tonight eight-thirty
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored
said not as a rule
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth
Out there in the free world
What's free about it
'm looking for work
What happened to Mandrake the Magician
Emil the Amazing
The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead
'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes
How's this sound-- (cuts her off) Listen, Adele, the reason  called, that party is today instead of Sunday
About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now
So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing
And the one driving the other car
What're you talking about
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two
He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something
Glenn Michaels
Yeah, that's him
Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool
He did, huh
Well, tell Buddy  see Glenn wearing his sunglasses 'll step on 'em
might not even take 'em off first
- As   -- fifty -- slides a small wrapped box across a table
Happy birthday
to where   -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair, a knockout -- sits
She picks up the box and shakes it
You fit another Chanel suit in here
Something better
Open it
Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present
Marshall watches, takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how everyone's looking at the two of them
(opens the box) Oh my God
She pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box
(') It's beautiful
It's a -- --Sig-Sauer
38
love it
She leans across the table and kisses him
(') Thanks, Dad
Happy birthday, kid
(then) You want another Coke
(checks her watch) Can't
gotta drive out to Glades, then 'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten
Which one is that
The  guy
He was
Ray's with the
now, he switched over
He's still married though, huh
Technically
They're separated
Oh, he's moved out
He's about to
Then they're not separated, are they
Can we change the subject
What're you doing at Glades
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint
Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese
He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators
No thanks
You used to like it
Dad
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced
Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife
That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em
really gotta go
We don't get to talk much any more
How 'bout  come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you
'd like that
She gets up, kisses him again
Thanks for the gun, Dad
'  -   - Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk
He looks about the cell
All he's got to show for himself
It's now quiet on the cellblock
Foley closes his eyes and we
: few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as "" , a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook
Title reads: ,
And then
Foley leans in a doorway watching with   -- black, Foley's age, shaved head
The   and the white guy staggers to his corner, as does Maurice
-- surfer look, dark shades -- counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the fighter's ear
Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's gonna send this guy out in a body bag
Foley watches a  -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking as those around him
The guy looks nervous, can feel the other cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat
The   and the white boxer staggers to his feet
Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling
Foley turns and watches the fight now
Anyone ever tell you why they call him Snoopy
Buddy shakes his head
Maurice dances around the other guy now
Teases him
(') He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back when he was pro
Now you pet him, he goes down
The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely glances off Maurice's jaw
Sure enough, Maurice makes a big show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally goes down
don't believe it
Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there
- Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as nearby, the "winning"  -- still wearing last night's pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons
He throws a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning technique
Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight
Fuckin' pathetic
Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one hand thrust into his pocket
Foley watches as Maurice stops the   -- the older guy who looked out of place at the fights -- as he comes out into the yard
It's Richard Ripley
(looking now) The Wall Street guy
Oh, yeah didn't recognize him without his rug
Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy nodding, acquiescent, respectful
Dick the Ripper they called him, on account of all the people he ripped off
Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a
What's he doin' here
() Three years
They look to where Glenn Michaels, the blond guy in dark shades we saw in Maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few feet away
He's shirtless, tan, in shape
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check
Like that, fifty mil, signed his name
(struggles with the bar) Whoa-- little help here
Who you talkin' to, Studs
Me, or Buddy
can't tell, you got those shades on
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy
guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights
'll take the shades off
Just get this fuckin' thing off me
Foley helps him get the bar up
Glenn sits up
How do you know he wrote a check
He told me
He works the laundry with me
The guy loves to talk
Yeah, to the
Attorney
hear he rolled over on all the snitches he was doing business with and got 'em all brought up
He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley, one eye always on the swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket
Hey, anybody that can write a check for fifty mil, he says any thing 'm all fucking ears
Like the other day, he tells me how he's got all this money in foreign banks, plus around five mil in uncut diamonds at his house
He said, quote, "Where  can put my hands on it anytime
" Cool
Where's the guy live
Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley
Again, Ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making notations
Detroit
Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs
They look like plain old rocks
So
What's your point
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with
You think he's lying
Use your head
The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it
Everyone starts walking for the gate
Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate, Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket
the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him
his left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket and we see the long metal shiv-- (watching Snoopy) Here it comes
Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away
The Boxer stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement
(') guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose, even if it's on purpose
We hear a   as a  spots the body
And now everyone moves like hell for the gate
except for
Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the body
Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks to him as they walk into the block
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer
Oh, uh, right, thanks
Foley then moves away
He sees Maurice looking back at him, giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd
: '  -   -  () He lies there another moment when
swings down over the side from the top bunk
Foley's  jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the bathroom
Foley shakes his head and turns away
- As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door, when he sees
-- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries
Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman is opening her trunk before coming forward
Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am
She doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock
didn't ask for your help, so don't expect a tip
Buddy smiles, waves her off
That's okay, ma'am
'll just take your car
She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off
- In the midst of a remodel
As door opens and Pup comes in
Foley puts a finger to his lips
They're right underneath you, Pup
They dug a tunnel
Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the chapel, eyes on the floor, listening
don't hear 'em
Where's the tunnel come out
Pup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of the pews to a window
Second fence post from the tower out there
Go on, take a look
As Pup stares out the window
don't see nothing there
Foley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a - He picks it up, starts up the aisle
You will directly
Keep watching
'  - As the high beams from her car show the prison parking area, then the fence strung with razor wire
Karen parks near the fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone
Hi
Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet
(beat) He's not
Could you tell him that
never mind
'll call back
Headlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind her
The lights go off, then come on again
She adjusts the mirror to deflect the glare
- As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field
He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen checks her face out in the rear-view
- As Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor, holds the crucifix down against his leg
There some car headlights out there
(then) Jesus Christ
Now he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it
(') Man outside the fence
By tower six
(responds to radio) This is Officer Pupko
(then) 'm looking at him, for Christ's sake
Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it smack against the side of Pup's head
Drops him clean with one swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him
'  - As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees   there, crouching down
Karen turns on her headlights
No, not crouched
The guy is coming out of the ground On this side of the fence
Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the ground
Right in front of her
Karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised there for a moment before taking off into the dark
Karen gets out of the car
'  - As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow the two cons as we then hear the sound of   before the men disappear into the dark
Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her trunk
What's she doing
He watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a holstered pistol
(') Uh-oh
But then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there again and comes out this time racking a shotgun
(') Uh oh And now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and raise the shotgun as we hear
Buddy gets out of the car
- As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty, standing by the hole they just crawled out of
Get your hands in the air
Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds, start edging away -- shit, they've come this far
They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark, then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate, to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it for the cons
They take off running
Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't fire
The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run
The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more interested in the hole the convicts had come out of
Now they're standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other as
head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited, pointing towards the orange grove
They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to see if they're alive, then keep going
The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out
He takes his time, puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes
Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the shotgun on Buddy
Buddy raises the palm of his hand
It's okay, honey, we're good guys
What're you doing here
Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when they're already pretty sure what you're doing
She glances around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck
She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip
They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence, past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange grove
moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence
bet that's all the hacks they send out
Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store
Why don't we talk about it later
He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid
Why you're just a girl
What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun
'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys
Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious thought, but what he says is
bet  smell, don't
(then) Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll get out of here
Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk
She's reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when
Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're cuddled up in bed
He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the gun in his face
Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then everything goes
Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing
Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along
() You comfy
() If  could have a little more room
() There isn't any
All this shit you got in here
What is all this stuff anyway
Handcuffs, chains
what's this can
() For your breath
You could use it
Squirt some in your mouth
() You devil, it's mace, huh
What've you got here, a billy
Use it on poor unfortunate offenders
appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it on
He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he looks at all of her now and finally says
() Where's your gun, your pistol
In my bag, in the car
They go over some bumps
We hear men's voices from somewhere far off, outside
(') You know you don't have a chance of making it
Guards are out here already, they'll stop the car
He runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also, just, well, looking
They're off in the cane by now chasing Cubans
timed it to slip between the cracks, you might say
- As Buddy floors it away from the prison, checks the rearview mirror
- As Jack tries to wipe some of the mud off his face
Boy, it stunk in there
believe it
You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too
(then) Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me
Guys like me, huh
Well, listen, even though 've been celibate lately, 'm not gonna force myself on you
've never done that in my life
You wouldn't have time anyway
We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to
If they get set up in time, which doubt
And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this
More bumps
Then picking up speed as the road smooths out
Who, Buddy
Yeah
He's a good guy
Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail
She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist
Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob
Buddy
That's his given name
(woops, beat) One  gave him, yeah
(mouths) Fuck
- As Buddy rifles through Karen's bag while he drives
He looks up from her badge and  case at the road
- So, what's your name
It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway
Jack Foley
You've probably heard of me
Why, are you famous
Time  was convicted in California
told me 'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer
How many was that
Tell you the truth,  don't know started when  was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus
They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg
All three of us ended up in Angola
That's funny
thought so, too
It was me,  woulda left ol' Gus on the floor
believe you would have
Another fall, did seven years at Lompoc
And don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went
know the difference
You were in Lompoc , the federal penitentiary
've delivered people there
So basically you've spent half your life in prison
(beat) Basically
Yeah
If  go back now, do a full thirty years, no time off
Can you imagine looking at that
don't have to
don't rob banks
He looks at her, then looks away as we
- As the car turns into a main highway now
- As Foley plays the light down the length of her
You don't seem all that scared
Of course  am
You don't act like it
What do you want me to do
Scream don't think it would help much
(then) 'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife
You were married
All those falls, 'm surprised you had time
It was just a year, give or take a few days
mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything
We had fun, we just didn't have that
that thing, you know
That spark, you know what mean
You gotta have that
(thinking) Uh-huh
We still talk, though
Sure
- As Buddy passes a sign that says ", 74
" - As she tries to get a look at him
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do
Yeah, well, if it turns out  get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow
And for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on the road
Then
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde
Hm
You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat
You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him
don't recall his hat, but 've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers
Did you know he didn't have his shoes on
Is that right
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving
Bonnie was eating a sandwich
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana
- Quiet
Empty
moment later the car flies past
- That part in the movie where they get shot
Warren Beatty and
can't think of her name
Faye Dunaway
Yeah,  liked her in that movie about Network Yeah, she was good
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody
Peter Finch
Yeah, right
Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot
remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to
Bleeding on a country road
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you
We
- As Buddy sees   approach from the opposite direction
He stays cool as the green and whites get closer
closer
then fly right on past
- As the       , then
You're sure easy to talk to
wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and  came up to you --  wonder what would happen
Nothing
mean if you didn't know who  was
You'd probably tell me
'm just saying  think if we met under different circumstances
You have to be kidding
Silence
Foley tries to get back to where it was working
Another one Faye Dunaway was in  liked, Three Days of the Condor With Robert Redford, when he was young
Yeah
They lie there a moment, think about that as we hear , coasting, then bumping along the shoulder of the road to a stop
never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick
Really
mean, romantically
Uh-huh
(then) Well, but if -- The trunk goes dark again as the car's turned off
() You still alive in there
And the trunk lid raises so that we see Karen and Foley lying in the back
Foley gets out
Karen doesn't move
() Where in the hell are we
That's the turnpike up there
Glenn's waiting with the other car
Okay, honey, come on out of there
Karen pushes off, rolls from her right side to her left, brings up her Sig Sauer in both hands to put it on them, both standing in the opening, in the dark, but right there
Get your hands up and turn around
Now Shit
Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite directions as she begins firing from the inside
As Buddy and Foley hook up again in front of the car
We can see they're beneath an overpass
Foley stares at the trunk
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where
She's coming with us
Foley walks to the passenger seat, reaches in the window
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there
Get the shotgun
And her purse
'd like to know who she is
Foley takes her wallet, looks at her driver's licence photo
already looked
Her name is Karen Sisco
Like the Cisco Kid only spelled different, -i-s-c-o
sheriff's green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment of the overpass
When the road quiets down, Foley moves to the trunk and bangs on it once with his fist
Karen
Be a good girl now, you hear
Now, 'm gonna open the-- Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot
(') You're putting holes in your car
He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him
He settles down, then
(') We're not leaving you
'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to throw the gun out
Okay
You shoot -- Buddy's got your shotgun, says he'll shoot back if you do and  can't stop him
So it's up to you
Foley puts his hand out and Buddy, still looking at him funny, gives him the keys
Hey
Coming from somewhere above them
(') It's me, Glenn
Foley steps out into the open, Buddy close behind him
They look up to see a figure, head and shoulders against the evening sky, leaning on the concrete overpass rail
We can see his long blond hair falling beside his face, now half-concealed behind dark sunglasses
Hey, Jack, good to see you, man
The fuck're you guys shooting at
Foley looks at Buddy
Do we need him
The green-and-whites saw us
One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there
Ties it to the break and turns around
Foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again
Oh, hey, Studs
We thought you were somebody else
Studs
Man,  haven't heard that since Lompoc
What's going on
Oh, nuthin'
Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs on the trunk
(') You coming out
Foley sticks the key in the lock as Buddy steps up to the trunk and racks the pump on the shotgun
Foley leans close to the metal
(') You hear that
He turns the key and raises the lid
Karen, bunched in there, extends her arm, her hand holding the Sig Sauer by the barrel
You win, Jack
"Jack
"  Buddy gives him another funny look
- As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen Audi that reads "
" Have your clothes cleaned and send me the bill
Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade, move through the scrub
Glenn leans against the car, flashers blinking
'll send it to you at Glades
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer
Take your sunglasses off
see better with them on
You don't take 'em off, 'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head
Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans
(') Wait in the car
You're in civilization now, man, ease up
'd like you to go wait in the car
How's that
Take her with you and put her in back
In the trunk
The backseat
Foley stares at him, waiting
Glenn motions to Karen
Come on
have to do what 'm told
She walks past Foley without looking at him
Wait a minute
Let me have your raincoat
(looks at Buddy) Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes
brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac
You wanted to take her car
You can blame me if you want
don't mind
He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds it up, then throws it at Foley's feet
Here you are, sir
Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back on and takes Karen by the arm
What's wrong with you
Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the backseat
Why you brought Glenn into this, 'll never know
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with
His idea
Gimme a break
Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head
Was you and me figured the whole thing out
Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform, all of them caked with muck
You're pulling at it
Here
He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and tearing the shirt
don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth  want to punch him out
He ain't the problem, Jack
Foley looks at him
(') You wanna pull your head outta your ass and tell me why we're bringing her with us
- As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door
He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs his hand through his hair
if he thinks he can talk to me like this
Shit,  don't even know what need them for
Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against the dark foliage
(') got a big score lined up up north
They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me
could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January-- Glenn
His head turns so that we can see his designer shades
(') You don't remember me, do you
(beat) It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking
was never out there
No, that's not what 'm thinking
He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face
But you're sure we've met, huh
Last fall,  drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice
You're Glenn Michaels
(then) never forget anyone 've cuffed and shackled
He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's been turned to stone
(') Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if we can work this out
He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead
(') Do we have a gun in the car
remember you now
Shit
Foley's not going to make it
And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him
She touches his shoulder and he jumps
(') Look,  can understand if you and Foley are close
We're not
'm helping him, yeah-- Wait
Have you helped him, Glenn
At this point, technically,  doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive
So you still have a choice
You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on
Or, if you want to play it another way
She pauses
He turns and looks at her
Like how
- Foley watches a car pass on the highway
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up
You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh,  had you all wrong"
want to talk to her again, that's all
See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances
You're too late, Jack
Foley doesn't say anything
Just takes a deep breath as we and they both look over
(') He wants to get out of here and  don't blame him
They start towards the car
Then stop and watch as it takes off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement
Their backs to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word
We hear
: As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named -- strut purposefully up the hall
They step into
Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big coffee-table book called "
" Dick
My man
Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley
(') got your fishies for you
He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the table
(reaches for them) Thank you
(pulls them back) Not so fast, Dick
(off Ripley's look) Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase
What
Year ago,  come in here on credit card fraud, but after  shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up
think it's Dunn & Brad street
But then,  could be wrong
Whoever
The point is, prices are goin' up, too
Better get your little black book out, Richard
We got some business to talk about
Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it
(') Let's start with the fish
They was two grand, but now they's three
Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag
(') That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks
(writing) Well,  need that
and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's
Hey
They all look to where
Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of some kind
Himey gives him a mean stare
Foley points to a sign that says "
" Sign says "Shut the fuck up
"  Or can't you guys read
(beat) There a problem, Foley
Yeah
Foley shuts the big book -- '
Yeah,  got a problem
This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns
Three hundred bucks for a pillow
That's right
Sounds high, doesn't it
Must be a real soft pillow
Faux goose down
Still
How much for your company at chow
Company, shit
watch the man's back
bet
How much
Another
Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off
Really
Well,  uhhh
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you
Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point
Man doesn't have to get killed
He could accidentally fall on something sharp, like a shiv
Or my dick
Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point
You stick anything in this guy, Snoop, they transfer his ass outta here faster'n you can throw a fight, and you still end up with nothing
Ripley nods, takes this in
This doesn't concern you, Foley
Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke
don't smoke
(slowly rising) You heard the man
Go on outta here
Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine
He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system
(looking at Himey) Thirty-two outta what, twenty
Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock Foley in the head when
in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand, like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor back-first with a loud thud
Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear They all freeze, look to
Who nods towards the door
We   just as   , takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up, covers his now bleeding nose
What's going on here
Oh, you know, reading's funnamental an' shit, we just excited
Clear outta here
The guard exits
Maurice and Foley are still staring at each other
Excuse me
Snoopy
Did we settle the fish thing
(looks at Foley) Yeah
Sure
It's all settled
He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into Ripley's open hand
Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a fist, crushing the fish
He taps his fist to Ripley's
That's how you do it
Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with Himey
Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at Foley
Thanks for your help
Any time
We hear a   and then
:  '  -   - () As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television
Stick and jab, fool
Stick and jab
frisbee whizzes past the television We hear
(') Hey
Watch that shit
Maurice's girlfriend  - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as on the bedside table right next to Maurice
(calls ) Tuffy
'mere, boy
You gonna answer the phone
What for
It's not for me
Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's head
(') Bad dog
(scoops up the dog) Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my little Tuffy
He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child
'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra money
He looks at her
That's the dumbest thing  heard in my life
Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't pay for shit
You gonna get a gig, it's gotta be for one of the big three: Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit for the fat dogs
Now answer the fuckin phone
She comes over, picks up the phone
Hello
(hands it to Maurice) For you
(takes it) This is me
-   - An antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone
Snoopy
Glenn Michaels
& : Studs
Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends
was just thinkin' about you
Glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car and jogs to the john
Listen, Snoopy, 'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash
You crazy, come up here It's fuckin one degree outside
wanna talk to you about a job
Uh-huh
can't really go into it right now
'll just tell you it's someone big
Some one Gimme a hint
It's a guy you know
Gimme another hint
It's Richard Ripley
Maurice doesn't say a word
(') You there
Oh, 'm here, all right
'm very here
Question is, why aren't you here
'  -    - As Foley and Buddy hurry up the front steps
'm just saying she wasn't scared
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move
Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you
You're right
'  - "hideout
"  Not much in the way of furnishings
Foley follows Buddy inside, watches as he bolts the door
First thing 'm gonna do is get all this mud off me
Foley starts for the bathroom
(') 've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months
Soak the prison off me
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink
Oh, man
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person
It's not just about opening up your pores, know what  mean
There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know
Settles me in a way that  really can't articulate
know exactly what you mean
It's just a feeling
(beat) You know,  could go for some wine tonight
There's a store around the corner, 'll be right back
Sounds great
Foley goes into the bathroom
moment later - As Buddy leaves the apartment, starts down the hall, , watches as he disappears down the stairs
Gun drawn, she then moves towards the apartment
- As Foley undresses, picks up a candle off the sink and smells it
He notices his nude image in the mirror and checks himself out
- As Karen slips the door
She looks around, She racks the slide on her gun, snicks off the safety and starts for the bathroom
Suddenly, the water is turned off
She stops where she is
She then moves a careful step at a time towards the open doorway
Gradually the tub comes into view, beginning with Foley's feet resting crossed on the other end, then the middle of the tub, then she's in the doorway, looking down at
Foley, lying there in the tub, his eyes closed
Karen cuts her eyes down the length of him, taking a moment here to check him out, long enough for Foley to open his eyes and grab her hand, the one holding the gun
Hey
They look at each other a moment
He then pulls her down to him and kisses her
She kisses him back
He then pulls her into the tub with him as we now hear
() Karen
: As she opens her eyes
What
:    - Flowers everywhere
Karen -- bruises on her face -- lies in bed
Her father, Marshall, sits on the chair beside her
You were talking in your sleep
(beat) What'd  say
"Hey, yourself
" Huh
We hear   at the door
They look to where Special Agent -- black, forties, expensive suit -- stands in the doorway, file in one hand
(') Hello, Daniel
(to Marshall) Daniel Burdon,
Marshall Sisco
Karen's dad
You mind please waiting outside
We have some business to do here
Marshall looks at him a moment
Then, to Karen
need to go to the john anyway
Burdon waits for Marshall to walk out, then sits down
wanna be on the task force, Daniel
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but  got all the help  can use right now
Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head
(indicates file) Isn't that my report you're holding onto
Yes, but  want to hear you tell it
Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this
Coming to the Okeechobee exit
And now we see it
Going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars
Take the next exit
What am  supposed to do now Glenn, take the exit
No way, man, no fuckin' way am  gonna turn myself in
She reaches over and grabs the wheel
(') The fuck are you doing
He hits the brakes
The car goes off the road, down the grade, the abutment coming right at us as we go back to
As Burdon sets the file down, sits back now
The next thing  knew, the paramedics were taking me out the car
Burdon looks at Karen a moment, then
There's a couple of points  keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you
Buddy is it
And this fella Jack Foley swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time
Really
Huh
He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed
You talked to him
In the trunk, yeah
What'd you talk about
Oh
different things, prison, movies
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies
It was an unusual experience
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks
You recall that
When  was seeing Carl Tillman,  didn't know he robbed banks
Yeah, but  had enough reason to believe he did, and  told you
So you had to at least suspect him
And what happened to Carl
The time came, you shot him
But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk
Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand
You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down
But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then
Is that what you would've done
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud
Go after crooked bookkeepers
Karen, 've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations
Have you ever shot a man
How many times have you been primary through the door
have to qualify, is that it
You have to know what you're talking about
We hear
Burdon glances at the doorway where we see Marshall now standing, enjoying this
We'll talk another time, Karen
All right
'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more
You'll have to ask him
Sounds to me like he liked having you around
'll see you, Karen
Mr
Sisco
Agent Burdon
Marshall waits for him to walk out
(') The white man's Burdon
That's what everybody calls him in Miami
The Metro-Dade guys
He's got a knack for pissing people off
She's not listening
He sits down, takes her hand
(') What are you thinking about
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas
She looks at him
'll get it back when  get Foley
'   - dozen   sit on chairs out front as Buddy climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm, newspaper under the other
An old woman comes out the door as Buddy opens it and squints at him
Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen
Uh, no, ma'am
Sorry
'  - Buddy's  apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream
This one's nicer, with a view of the beach
Jack stands on the balcony going through '
He pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo
He does the same with her gym
card
He finds her address book and opens it up
photo of her father slips out
Jack examines it a moment, then flips through the book
He stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in and comes up with her us Marshal
He slips it open and studies the badge and the picture opposite
He holds on to it, looks out at the ocean, but really sees
- As Karen gets out, saying
You win, Jack
Foley turns away from the view as Buddy walks in, sets the grocery bag down on the coffee table
You made the front page
He holds up the newspaper so that Foley can see his picture on the front page: an unflattering mug shot that doesn't look all that much like him
(') They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you
wasn't feeling my best that day
'd just drawn thirty to life
Maybe this'll make you feel better
Buddy reaches into the bag, tosses Foley a
Thanks
Foley catches the lighter, immediately begins playing with it
He looks at the paper on the coffee table as Buddy sits down, pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco
Just that she got away
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn
You'll have to ask Glenn
And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be
Foley walks back out on to the balcony, looks at the contents of Karen's bag spread out on the table
(') You realize what you're doing
Worrying about a person that works in law enforcement
You want to sit down and have cocktails with a girl that tried to shoot you
You hear what 'm saying
Foley holds up the picture of Marshall Sisco
Think this old guy is her boyfriend
It's the only picture she carries
Am  going to Detroit by myself
Foley picks up her drivers licence photo
(') Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both
We'll leave first thing in the morning
'  - Right on a marina
Boats bobbing on the water
() Is this Foley
'  - Marshall sits in his chair holding up a newspaper as Karen hands him a drink
She stares at the photograph
He doesn't even look like that
No
No, he looks a lot
She realizes Marshall's watching her
(') Different
The doorbell
She ignores his look, gets up
Walks to the door and opens it to reveal  , boots, leather jacket, etc
Cowboy Cop
(') Hi, Ray
You look great
Your dad taking good care of you
He took the week off so we'd have time together
So far he's worked on his boat every day
Dad
Ray Nicolet
Marshall gets up, shakes his head
've heard a lot about you, Mr
Sisco
Likewise
Ray's with the
Task Force, working on the prison break
(eyeing his -shirt) see that
Ray turns to Karen, holding his jacket open to show the task force inscription on his -shirt in red, the guy's
357 tucked into his waistband
(') In case no one knows what he does
Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"
No
Course not
(changing the subject) How's it going
Great
We got one of 'em
Karen looks at him
Was it Foley
(before he can answer) Off a tip
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number-- knew it, soon as  saw they were offering a reward
She grabs Nicolet by the arm
Was it Foley
Marshall looks at her
Foley
Oh
No, it was one of the Cubans
Linares
Oh
We went out there, full , two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway
We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away
Did you pay the guy the reward
Yeah, as soon as we got back
Foley hadn't been there
Her father gives her a look
This place was strictly Cuban
If Foley had a ride he must have his own agenda
He seems to be the only one knows what he's doing
Marshall moves to it
Hello
(beat) Yeah, she is
Just a minute
(hands her the phone) For you
Hello
:     - On the balcony
Flipping through a copy of Vogue while Buddy watches television inside
Hi
&  - Karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray drones on
You know who this is
Yes
She walks out to her father's balcony now
just wanted to see if you're okay, make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or, you know, anything
Something 've been wondering, Ray
Marshall picks up the newspaper
(') It says in the headline, " slept with a murderer, says shaken Miami woman
" She lives in Little Havana, her husband's out of town working when one of the escapees shows up at her door
She closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her
How'd you get this number
Who was it answered the phone
None of your business
'm just worried maybe 'm not old enough for you
That's my dad
Really
He has a cop's face
How do you know
Wait-- you have my wallet
And your gun
Think  could have them back
How do we do that
Let's see
You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off
Sure
'll just leave 'em with the guy answers the door
Foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's been looking for: an ad for Defiance perfume
There's a guy here on the task force right now
Maybe  should put him on the phone, let you two work it out
You won't do that
Why not
Because you're having too much fun
She doesn't know what to say to that
Foley smells the ad
She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa
She says he was very gentle
spoke to her
The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him
That's how you score now
: Karen looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet
My dad's retired
He was a Private Investigator
Forty years
used to work for him
can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters
Something 've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully
Why
You think he might tell you where am
Unless you wanna tell me
He's dead
He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital,  think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed
(then) That's not gonna be me
One last score, that the idea
Move to some island
'm partial to mountains myself
But if you like islands, we'll make it an island
Whatta you mean we'll make it an island
just thought maybe you and me could-- Buddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles Foley
Who you talking to
Is that Buddy
Foley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone
He looks at Buddy
What
You better come see this
'  - As Karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up, opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes
So the woman's married
She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it
But you don't reveal her name, you protect her
It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it
Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her
Dad
He looks over at her now
Gives her an innocent look
What
'  - As Foley and Buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at the hobo camp
We catch a glimpse of  , ,
Foley shakes his head as they show a shot of Lulu's body covered with a sheet
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you
He's gotta know by now that  gave him up back at Glades
He does, he's gonna try to find me
Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows
He knows where she lives
Foley doesn't answer
Buddy mutes the set
Turns to Foley
(') Jack
We were talking one time, drinking rum
may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician
Chino got interested
He's like, Yeah
How does he saw the woman in half
He wanted to meet her
Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit
So call her up
Tell her don't talk to any Cubans
Her phone's probably tapped
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel
Shit
'  - Karen stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints the trim on the boat
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone
Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon
Tell her you think he's a nice guy
No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it
If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her bet nothing
So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out
You think that's possible
What kind of guy is he
He's pretty laid back, confident
He remind you of that guy, Tillman
Not at all
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again
want to bust his ass, put him in shackles
Maybe
But you're also curious about the man
Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him
You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity
couldn't believe it
You like the wild ones, don't you
Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley
You know, 've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack
Foley kid napped me
Yeah, but you talked all the way from to the turnpike
It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping
She gives him a look
He goes back to his painting
(') Go talk to the ex-wife
'  - As Adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass-topped dining table and turns on the window air-conditioner when She grabs it
Hi, this is Adele speaking
- Adele's neighbourhood
Near the beach
Chino on the phone
He wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit
Oh, is this Adele
() Yes, it is
Uh-- sorry
Wrong number
He hangs up, glances about, then checks the little
22 stuck in one of his pockets
As he then starts off down the street, we can see the name "   " on the back of the jumpsuit
'  - Buddy drives
Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit -- is beside him
Buddy looks at him, shakes his head
Nice disguise
'm a tourist
You at least bring the gun
(lifts straw bag) In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel
(points) That's her place
As they drive past, Buddy indicates a  on the steps out front, obviously
There
You see the guy sitting on the porch
The old ladies and one guy
You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere
(watching something else) Uh-huh
Buddy follows Foley's gaze to
As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse for change
She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh
Oh, my
Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under the car and grab it
(') Okay, you saw her
That's all you get
They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the her
guess Adele's in good hands
Sure looks that way
(finally) Let's go to Detroit
Now you're talkin'
'  - Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the narrow opening
You were both in the trunk
Together
From Glades to the turnpike
Then left with Glenn
Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up, heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss
The  didn't tell you  was with them
They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions
But you know what 'm talking about, don't you
About Glenn, don't you, and the second car
know a Glenn
She thinks a moment
The door closes and opens again, all the way
Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties, but no bra
(') 'm getting ready to go out
You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute
Would you like a Diet Coke
No, thanks
She comes in, checks out the place
She turns a chair from the glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes
Those are cute shoes
The kind of jobs  get,  have to wear these killer spikes, they ruin your feet
She walks away, comes back with an ashtray
(') When you were in the trunk with Jack
Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette
(') He didn't hurt you or anything, did he
You mean, did he try to jump me
No, but he was kind of talkative
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes
Adele sits down at the other end of the table
You didn't visit him in prison
He didn't want me to
Why not
don't know
He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years
Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer
But you spoke to him on the phone
He'd call every once in a while
He called the day he escaped
He did
don't remember
Did he say about me
In the trunk
(beat, lies) He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life
Huh
Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks
It's all he's ever done
Did you know that when you married him
He said he was a card player
could live with that
never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire
did go see him in jail to tell him was filing for divorce
He said, "Okay
"  Jack's so easy going
(then) He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband
Adele looks out the window
Karen waits, looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere ten years back
(') 'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much
He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what  mean
Really
(looking at the picture) Hm
She realizes Adele is looking at her
(') Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught
'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself
Buddy'll take care of him
Keep him out've trouble
He's Jack's conscience
Always has been
(chuckles) He tell you how they met
Karen shakes her head
(') Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start
Battery was dead
He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump
Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing
Buddy says, 'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in
(then) They musta robbed fifty banks together
Till they got busted
That wasn't Jack's fault
No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after
She called the and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc
(then) think Buddy felt kinda bad about that
Any idea where  could find Buddy
Or Glenn
Adele looks at Karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick raps on the door
' Adele
You in there
Yes
want to speak with you, please
Who is it
' talk to the guy you work for, Emil
He tole me your number and where you live
See, 'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you
Oh
Uh-huh
' You did work for Emil, right
Yeah,  was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years
' You were his what, his box
His assistant
Karen looks at the door
Something's wrong
through the glass bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement on the other side, someone doing something (') You say you perform in the Miami area
' Yes, around here
was a mayishan in Cuba before  come here
Manuel the Mayishan was my name
And now Karen and Adele look at each other
'  (') Can you open the door
Karen shakes her head "no
" 'm not dressed
' Listen to me
(lowers his voice) 'm a good friend of Jack Foley
Boom
Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of the table, sees Adele staring at her
Ask him his name
Who are you
' (beat) Jose Chirino
Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag
'  (') Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me Chino
'm the same person
Karen moves along the table to Adele
(soft) Tell him to wait in the hall, you have to get dressed
Say it loud
As Adele speaks, Karen racks the slide on her 9mm
Wait in the hall
have to get dressed
' Tell me where is Jack Foley,  don't bother you no more
Karen motions for Adele to keep talking as she takes a position beside the door, where we now see Chino's silhouette in one of the three glass panels in the centre of the door
don't know where he is
' Listen, 'm the one help Jack escape from prison
He tole me,  can't find him to see you
So why don't you open this fucking door
Okay
So we can speak
(staring at Karen) Go away, or 'll call the police
' Why you want to do that, to a frien'
Adele says nothing
Then
'  (') Okay, you don't want to help me, 'm leaving
(then) 'm going now
see you maybe some time, okay
Bye bye
(low) Go in the bedroom and -- Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes through one of the glass panels
Adele and Karen both jump as Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob
but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm still sticking through the glass
the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he bangs against a wall and falls to the floor
Dazed, Chino reaches for his
22 as he now tries to get to his feet
Karen brings up her Beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the front sight on his chest
(') Leave it where it is
(frowning) Wait
You not Adele
'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest
Put the gun on the table mean, now
Oh
Then this must be Adele
He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele
Put it down or 'll shoot
You wouldn't shoot me, would you
What do you want to bet
(beat) could walk out of here
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead
Chino doesn't move
Keeps his gun on Adele
Karen starts walking towards him
(') You can live or die, it's up to you
Oh, is that right
You going to shoot me
Nice girl like you
(smiles) don't think so
You don't, huh
And with that, she kicks him in the knee
Chino buckles over and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun
(') On your knees
He does as he's told
Karen raises his jacket, feels around his waist from behind
(') Lie face down on the floor
(hurting) What
She kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there
She puts her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials
She sees Adele staring at her
(') (to Adele) Excuse me
Karen looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone
Daniel Burdon, please
Karen Sisco
Excuse me, Adele
Yes
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside
(beat) Yes
Tell me, how do you do that
Adele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with her foot
Shut up
() Karen
Where are you
been trying to get a hold of you
Daniel
Listen -- () Where are you
been trying to reach you
'm at Adele Delisi's
() What-- we already talked to her
That's a dead end
(looking at Chino) Yeah,  know
was just leaving
Why were you trying to reach me
() There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there
We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale
want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i
d
him as the other guy
If he does, you call me right away
All right, but
() But don't you do anything
You just have a seat, wait for me to get there
Sure, Daniel
() Now
What is it you wanted to tell me
Oh,  was just wondering, if  were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force
() (impatient) What
Is that what you're calling me about
Yes or no, Daniel
If  get him, will you let me go after Foley
() Yeah, sure, Karen
You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force
That's all  wanted to know
() Good
Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel
Karen hangs up, looks at Adele
Adele nods
You're good
Thank you
'  - As Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of
been thinkin', if  was Glenn,  was up there to take down the Ripper, where would  go
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc
Snoopy
Christ,  thought he'd be brain dead by now
He isn't fighting no more
Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk
-  - The ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags
Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator
You get the key
They're in 7D
She hands it to him as they wait for the elevator
want two men outside, front and back
Conway and Jessup go on up to seven, cover both ends of the hall
Burdon, Karen and the remaining four  team agents
Burden looks at them one at a time
(') You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man
You're gonna use a ram
Yeah, why
The manager's door is metal
They all look at her
(') You know what  mean
They might all be
And a ram on a metal door makes an awful lot of noise for what good it does
Burdon looks at her, not all that happy she spoke up
The fourth man raises the shotgun, a three-inch strip of metal taped to the muzzle
got a shock-lock round in my shotgun oughta do the trick
Fine
Whatever
He sees the elevator still hasn't come down
(') Fuck it
Let's take the stairs
Karen
Burdon pauses, looks at Karen, hands her a radio
(') Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator
What
Daniel,  wanna go upstairs
You can go wait out in the car, you want to
She doesn't say anything
(') Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do
(pissed) Call and tell you
And you let them come up
You don't try to make the bust yourself
You understand
Before she can answer, an old woman steps in, asks Burdon
Are you delivering the oxygen
Burdon looks at her, then nods for his men to start up the stairs
- Everyone's in position as Burdon eases the key into the lock, turns it
The door won't budge, a dead bolt holds it shut
The guy with the shotgun puts the strip of metal against the seam, where the lock enters the frame, the muzzle of the shotgun exactly three inches now from the dead bolt, and looks over his shoulder at Burdon
With the sound of the blast, we then
:     - As Foley and Buddy ride down with an old lady
The doors open
The woman doesn't move
Is this your floor, mother
Oh
Yes, it is
-   - As an old gent in a golf cap smiles at Karen sitting there on the couch in front of the elevator
Like to play some gin
No, thank you
He creeps off towards the elevator
'  - As Burdon and his men fan out through the place
- As we hear Burdon's voice
() Karen
They're not up here
Keep your eyes open
Karen looks off towards the street entrance, then back at the elevator where the man is still waiting, leaning on his cane
The elevator door opens to reveal Buddy and Foley
Going up
Buddy and Foley don't answer
The old man starts to get on, feeling with his cane, taking forever
Karen and Foley are staring at each other
He doesn't move
Not until the elevator door begins to close
Buddy sees Karen, helps the old man aboard as
Karen picks up her radio, is about to speak into it when
Foley raises his hand
And waves as the door closes - As the elevator resumes going down
Shit,  wanted to go up
Let's just hope there's no one in the garage
She looked right at me
She didn't yell or get excited
She didn't move
'  - As they get in and Buddy starts the car
They know where  live,  guess they know what  drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way
She just sat there, looking right at me
Buddy gives him a look, shakes his head and then burns rubber out of the garage as we
:  -   - Staring straight ahead
(  ) Karen
Report
You see anything
Karen
You there
Karen
- As Marshall walks Karen to the gate
He waved to you
couldn't swear to it, but 'm pretty sure he did
You wave back
didn't have time
imagine you would've though
She shakes her head
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon
She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address
So
So what  want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge
(then) What want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long
(looks at her) Any thoughts on that one
None 'd like to share
She gives him a kiss
(') 'll call soon as  get in
: -  - Snow
Everywhere
black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes
() don't just manage fighters, or deal product any more
- Glenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka "Snoopy" -- wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses
've diversified since the last time you saw me
've vertically integrated and now 'm into home invasions and the occasional grand larceny
Glenn just nods, stares out the window
(') White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my bodyguard when  feel  need one, and my driver
Maurice indicates   , a fucking huge, depraved- looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel
(') Watch the road, boy
(then) like this Town Car
We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros
could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players
Okay, here comes Mr
Ripley's house up on the left
Yeah
The brick wall
There's his drive, right there
The car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house
(') You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be
(then) It's wide open
/
-     - People on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and snow-covered trash
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it
'll show you, soon as  get one more guy 'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth
Along with White Boy there
What
The car pulls to the kerb and  -- a wiry black man in a bright yellow -shirt and red baseball cap backward, always seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in
You get everything
Kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat
Glenn stares at it
Something about the bag makes him uneasy
Maybe it's the that sticks partially out of the opening
(') Cool
Kenneth, this is the man  told you about, Glenn
The one gonna help us rip off the rich guy
That's right
Help you White Boy Bob pulls out again
Glenn looks at the two psychos in front, then turns to Maurice
(') Wait a minute
'm letting you in on this, not all your friends
You just ask me how we gonna do it
That's what 'm here for, tell you how
We the experts
Glenn can't believe this is happening
(') Thing 'm worried about is you
Me
Yeah
If you can step up and actually do it
Understand
'Stead of just talking the talk
Can  do what
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon used to sell to been dealin' on his own
What-- when
Right now, son
don't have to prove shit to you
The Ripley job is my job
You're either in or you're not
You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine
Look, Glenn,  know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay
You don't like what 'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want
think you're forgetting, this is my car
drove it up here
Hey, shit, come on
say  want this car, man, it's mine
You go get yourself another one
say 'm in on Ripley
'm in, with or without your ass
say  want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do
Glenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades
We're here
Glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit- looking two-story house
Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the hack saw and a   up to White Boy Bob, a - to Kenneth, and takes out a big
45 for himself
Let's go see Eddie
Glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear
(
) Must take balls, do what you do
-  - As Foley walks with Ripley across the yard
Tell me something
What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up
don't know
never used a gun
Really
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way
(smiles) You're the reason, Jack,  don't keep all my money in banks
No
Where do you keep it, Dick
(Ripley smiles) 'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about
(still smiling) know what you're talking about
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn
Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn
mean, do you believe Glenn
Of course not
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where  keep 'em
Doesn't have to figure out shit
You told him you keep 'em at your house
(shrugs, big smile) It's a big house
Ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the yard
(') Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours
Why
was just thinking that  could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way
'm talkin' about when you're outta here
mean, you can't rob banks for ever
Foley looks at Ripley
It's a little late for me
Hey, Jack
Bullshit
didn't make my first million until  was forty- two
Forty-two
You really want to change, it's never too late
don't know
'm not exactly the nine-to-five type
Who is
But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work
You gotta look at it as peace of mind
As security , you know what  mean
got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick
My ex-wife's in Miami
It's nice down there
No need to decide now
Be like the fish
Let whatever happens happen
The fish
Yeah, fish live in the present
They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow
Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved
No guilt afterward
No whining on some fish-shrink's couch
They just do it
They accept
can't say that 've paid that much attention to 'em before
The fish saved my life
Two years ago,  found out  had high blood pressure
So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time  felt myself stressing out
And the guy sent you a bill for this
It works
You should try it sometime
The next time  walk into a bank
Ripley shakes his head, then gets up
Think about my offer, Jack
Foley watches him go
(
) Hey, Jack
: As he turns to us
What
: ' Across the street from the    -- a red- brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood
You see this one
Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym
(') "Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying
"  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge
Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him
They'd been together ten years
Love is funny
Buddy looks at him
Notices something over Foley's shoulder
Hey-- And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car pulls into the Kronk parking lot
- Kenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the front seat
Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging himself, shaking
Maurice looks out the window
Was a time you see a gold Mercedes over in the parking lot has a license plate on it say
You know Tommy Hearns is inside
Seeing the car would get our juices flowing
Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins
(') You already got your juices flowing, huh
Pissed your pants back there at Eddie's house, didn't you
Glenn just looks at Maurice
(') That was some shit, huh
(indicates Kenneth) Why'd he have to do that to that girl
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl
(smiles) Do what
Glenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth
Just wait till we get inside Ripley's house
And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car
It's all right with you, 'll just hang in the car
(beat) No
You gonna stay close to me from now on
So you don't disappear on me
Why would  do that
Maurice looks at him, starts laughing
White Boy Bob and Kenneth join in
Maurice leans over
Glenn flinches as Maurice opens Glenn's jacket so that we can see the  splattered on his - shirt
Was worse than you imagined, wasn't it
(then, smiles) Baby, you with the bad boys now
'  - As they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the car
Whatta you think
think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner
Or two
- Glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring
Kenneth grabs a magazine, walks into the john
shirtless White Boy Bob lifts weights while Maurice moves around the ring calling to the boxers inside
Stick and jab
Hey, Studs, how you doing
He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way
Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing here
They sit down on either side of him, close
Weren't you expecting us
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a  Marshal, for Christ sake
Now he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat and sits down again
(') She knew me from some bullshit dope bust
She drove me to court
Twice
You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike
" never forget anybody 've cuffed and shackled
" Yeah
She said that to you
Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face, almost smiling
(') What happened to your shades
Someone finally step on 'em
(touches his head) don't know
Foley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt
Whose blood you got all over you
These guys, man, they're crazy
(looks off) Shit
Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy Bob beside him, carrying his shirts
Is that Snoopy
In the purple doo rag
What's he do now, tell fortunes
Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it
We have a problem here
(walking over) Jack Foley, famous bank robber
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower
It seems to me  been reading about you in the newspaper
Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh
Low class of people there, Snoop
You call him that again 'll put your head through the wall
What
You mean Snoop
Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy, is what White Boy's trying to say
He's a little crude, you understand
No,  left that Snoopy shit behind me
But you call this bozo White Boy
White Boy Bob
(baiting) White Boy used to be a fighter
What's he do now outside of shoot his mouth off
White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit
Like being back in the yard, huh
Just like it
Nobody backing down
You back down, you pussy
Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold
Glenn didn't tell you
thought you guys were busted
Why
Just because you left us standing on the side of the road
Foley looks at Glenn
Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously
Foley smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard
Now Maurice starts laughing
Buddy, too
White Boy's lost, looking from one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile going away as he says
(') Look, Snoop,  don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand
How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you
Let's go outside and talk
What's the matter with right here
It's nice and warm
Warm
Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns
No,  ain't talking any business in here
To me this is holy ground, man
You understand
got to be someplace anyway
'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good
The State Theater
Foley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up
We'll see you tomorrow then
Maurice then watches as they walk out
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again
Ten gees
Uh-huh
(then) You recall, did it say dead or alive
- The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier
Now it's a
of neighbourhood gawkers stand just behind the yellow tape
lights up the front yard
Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly- freezing  at the tape, working crowd control
'm looking for Ray Cruz
He's inside
(pissed) With everybody else
Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk
She pauses to watch as two '  cover with a sheet a who lies just below a broken upstairs window
- Hell
Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in the doorway
Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, , head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the chest
He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist
Congealed blood runs down the stairs
and are everywhere
Karen looks at the guy on the stairs
Called themselves the Youngboys
Karen looks over as  , a stocky, genial-looking detective comes out of the kitchen
Ironic, isn't it
How are you, Raymond
Freezing
But 'm getting warmer
He kisses her on the cheek
She indicates the body by the door
Quite a mess
Yeah
And  thought everyone liked Eddie
Who
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself
Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation
What is it with crack and transsexuals
Yeah, Eddie was a real character
Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes
Yeah
saw one of 'em outside
Yonelle
Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window
(shakes his head) Fuckin' animals
This shuts them both up
Cruz indicates the door
(') Let's get some air
She starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on the ground
Wrap-around
a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing
Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out
- As Cruz and Karen walk to his car,   as press photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together
You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the
report to the , first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee
You know, 'm not in homicide any more
No,  didn't know that
Yeah, 'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse
Detroit, you must be pretty busy
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too
Listen, Raymond, a year ago,  had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick
In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that
Who was the friend
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter
Christ,  know Snoopy Miller
He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard
Hangs out with a couple other Grade- nutcases over on the West side
'll need a last known address
That's fine, but  don't want you to talk to Miller alone
Come on, Raymond, 'm a federal officer, 'm armed
He turns and looks at her
Yes, you are
'll call you tomorrow with the address
As he gets into his car, we then: : The crime scene from the night before
shot of Karen and Ray Cruz as they exit the house
headline reads " " blah-blah-blah
() You have the paper
: '   - Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the newspaper photograph of Karen
It's a terrific shot of her
'  - Buddy looking at the same shot
Outside of that
& Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but  don't think it has anything to do with us
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather
Foley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center and pulls out a tie
think she's after Glenn
The girl still with you
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it
You tell your sister about it
Just hung up
How long you talk to her
Two hours
How long were you with the girl
Forty-five minutes
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you
'Cause  don't wanna go through that again
Forget about my sister
If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked
Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look
Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it
Foley hangs up
He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie
(
) guess next time  see you, you'll be wearing a suit and tie
'  - Foley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of  , gathers up his belongings
He's going home
still haven't made up my mind yet
What's to think about
You goin' right back to work
First, 'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz
then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons
He tears a picture off the wall
(') Here
(hands it to Foley) Something to remember me by
Foley stares at the photograph of sea life
(') It's not the real thing, but it's still nice to look at
Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand
(') See you on the outside, Jack
'   - Foley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in the overall effect
(smiles) Hi
just broke outta jail
His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside, grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to , and dials the phone
() Atheneum Hotel
Karen Sisco, please
(pause, then) 'm sorry, but there's no one by that name registered
Thank you
He dials the next number
Best Western
"" '  - Red brick, showing its age
Karen rings the doorbell and then waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy coat
The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe holding her arms close against the cold
Moselle Miller
What do you want
'm looking for Maurice
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and 'm out of grocery money
Moselle
Who you talking to
Lady looking for Maurice
What's she want
Hasn't said
That's not Maurice
That's Kenneth, my brother
He's talking on the phone
Ask what she want with him
You ask her
Maurice's business is none of my business
Sounding tired or bored
She turns from the door and walks into the living room
Karen steps inside, pushes the door closed and steps into the foyer
How do  know
Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on the phone
The State, huh
Who's fighting
Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa lighting a cigarette
You like to sit down
Thanks
Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box
(') 'm looking for a friend of mine  think Maurice knows
You not with probation, one of those
No
You a lawyer
(smiles) No, 'm not
Maybe you know him
Glenn Michaels
Moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke
Glenn
No,  don't know any Glenn
He said he stayed here last November
Here
In this house
He said he stayed with Maurice
Well, he ain't even here that much like to know where he goes, but at the same time  don't want to know, you understand
(beat) Your dog was killed
Got run over by a car
What did you call it
Moselle looks at the couch, where a   sits
Was a she, name Tuffy
(nods, then) Where do you think  might find Maurice
don't know -- the gym, the fights
know he don't miss the fights
Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater
He use to take me
The State Theater
What you want with Maurice
Karen turns, sees Kenneth standing in the arched entrance from the foyer
She looking for a man name of Glenn
Did  ask you
Go on out of here
Do something with yourself
He waits until Moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away from them through the dining room
Karen watches him come toward her now in kind of an easy strut
She indicates the scar over his eye
You're a fighter
How you know that
can tell
was He moves his head in what might be a feint
(') Till  got my retina detached two time
He's standing so close to her, Karen has to look up at him
What'd you fight, middleweight
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed
You go about what, bantam
Flyweight
You know your divisions
You like the fights
Like the rough stuff
Yeah, bet you do
(moves closer) Like to get down and tussle a little bit
Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle
say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you
"  And  give Tuffy what every dog love best
You know what that is
bone
(real close) can give you a bone, too, girl
You're not my type
Don't matter
let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants
Just a minute
Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair
Bring your own rubbers with you
Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip on a golf club
Kenneth grins at her
(') What else you have in there, mace
Have a whistle, different kinds of female-protection shit
Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face
have to go, Kenneth
She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's like a golf club grip
(') Maybe we'll see each other again, okay
She steps aside and brushes past him
He grabs her left wrist
We gonna tussle first
Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots out of the grip
She pulls an arm's length away from him and chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking away
(') God damn He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear
(') What's wrong with you
You wanted to tussle, we tussled
And she walks out
She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer
Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and comes out with a business card
(') wrote my hotel number on there -- in case you run into Glenn
Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe
Karen smiles at her and walks out the door
'  - It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front
'  - Buddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see the house
Now that's a really big house
Jesus, look at that wall
Place almost looks like a prison
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system
Time comes, we knock on the door
See if he wants to talk about old times
Go in the easy way
Yeah
You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us
Who says anybody's gonna be with us
say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life
Tell me something, Buddy
You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life
Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but don't know anyone who's actually gone and done it
Do you
(beat) What about that
Cooper guy
Foley looks at him
(') mean, they don't know for sure he's dead
(then) Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing
say let fate decide
Let fate decide
What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now
My sister believes in fate, but not hell
That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore
But every day she asks her boss to pray  don't fuck up
Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and 'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it
You might not have a choice
Foley looks at him
(') They put a gun on you, you'll go back
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you
Foley turns back to the house
And now we hear
() think you're gonna fit right in
- The personnel guy,
, sits behind his desk, squeezing a grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty suit and tie
Now Mr Ripley and  have had a long discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that you would be happiest working down here in Miami
How's that sound to you
Great
Mr
Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley
You're about a 42 long, right
What
But Mr
Hearn walks out without answering
Foley looks at the desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the- bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar
Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with it
Okay
Let's see how she fits
Foley turns as Mr
Hearn bounces back into the room with what looks like a  draped over one arm
What is this
Your uniform
My what
Mr
Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads  on one arm
Foley smiles
amused
angry
hurt
(') Are you kidding me
' View
Wet bar
Huge fucking aquarium
() Sir, you can't go in there
Ripley looks up from his desk as Foley steps in, the receptionist right behind him now
Jack
Whoa-- what's the problem
Take it easy, let's talk
Meanwhile, Ripley pushes a   beneath his desk
security guard
Are you fucking kidding me
Ripley considers Foley a moment, then
You know,  wasn't sure you'd show up
But  was pretty sure that, if you did, you'd throw the job in my face
(then) Understand something, Jack
Up to this point, everything you've done with your life means absolutely nothing in the real world
Less than nothing
Foley says nothing
(') You're a bank robber
This is not a marketable skill
There are no old bank robbers out in the world living on pensions
You know this
That's why you're here right now
Still Foley says nothing
(') Today, 'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage
You think you're better than that
Fine
Show me
Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better
lot better
But first, Jack, you gotta earn it
How, Dick
The way you earned it
By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her
What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit
Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks
You were a goddamn dumpling
Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing
Till you were nothing
saved your ass
So you'll pardon me if  don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there
"  Okay, Dick
can't do it
Jack, 'm disappointed
guess misjudged you
Two massive   appear in the doorway
Hey, what job he promise you guys
There's two ways we can do this
Yeah
What are they
Gentlemen
think we've calmed down now
Haven't we, Jack
Oh, yeah, 'm calm
In fact, 'm totally "relaxed
" And with that he picks up a paperweight (  ) and wings it at the aquarium, shattering the glass
'  -  - As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two guards
He picks himself up
He kicks at the guards, who wave him off, go back inside
Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees
The one from the opening Foley looks at it a moment, then calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he starts across the street
: '  - As Buddy pulls away from the house, Foley pulls out the clipping of Karen he tore out of the morning paper
He's written the name "" on it
Listen,  gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow
Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later
Yeah, and  better call my sister
: It's really coming down
We then     we're looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of the Westin
table of three young -  in suits are laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a  to an adjacent table
Jack Daniel's, please, water on the side
She turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above the city, down there somewhere
' Celeste, do us again, please, and put the lady's drink on our bill
She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling, pleasant-looking guys in dark suits
Thanks anyway
(drifting over) They want to buy you a drink
get that
Tell them 'd rather pay for my own
She then watches the three guys looking at the waitress delivering the message
Then they look at Karen
She gives them a shrug, turns to watch the snow
Her drink arrives
She takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over
Excuse me
My associates and  made a bet on what you do for a living
She glances at the table, the other two watching
(') And  won
Hi, 'm Philip
If it's okay with you, Philip, 'd like to just have a quiet drink and leave
Okay
Don't you want to know what  guessed
How  know what you do for a living
Tell you the truth, 'm not even mildly curious
Really,  don't want to be rude, Philip, 'd just like to be left alone
She turns back to the snowstorm
She sees his reflection turn and leave
moment later, the next one appears at the table
#2 think  know why you're depressed -- if  may offer an observation
She just looks at him
So sure of himself
#2 (') have a hunch you're the new sales rep and your customer isn't exactly knocked out by the idea of a young lady, even one as stunning as you, handling the account
Am  close
Hi, 'm Andy
She says nothing to him
We're ad guys
We flew in from New York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker Distillery, present this test-market campaign for their new margarita mix
What we do, we show this guy who looks like a Mexican bandido, you know, with the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts-- Andy
Really
Who gives a shit
He gives her a sympathetic expression
Want to tell me what happened
Beat it, will you
She stares at the guy until he turns away
She sips her drink, stares once more out at the blizzard
After a few moments, another dark suit appears, reflected in the window
Can  buy you a drink
Boom
Not one of the executive guys
She stares at the reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at now standing there in his new navy blue suit
(beat) Yeah, 'd love one
(then) Would you like to sit down
He pulls the chair out, looking at her
The three guys at the other table now staring as he sits down
Foley offers his hand
'm Gary
She hesitates, then shakes his hand
'm Celeste
She smiles with him
When she lowers her hand to the table, his hand comes down to cover hers
She watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers, and lays her hand on his
The tips of her fingers brush his knuckles, lightly back and forth
(') It takes hours to get a drink around here
There's only one waitress
can go to the bar
Don't leave me
Those guys bother you
No, they're all right
meant, you just got here
She picks up her drink and places it in front of him
(') Help yourself
She watches him take a sip, smack his lips
You like bourbon
Love it
(passes the glass back) Well, we got that out of the way
(then) Tell me, Celeste
What do you do for a living
'm a sales rep
came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because 'm a girl
Is that how you think of yourself
What, as a sales rep
girl
don't have a problem with it
like your hair
And that suit
had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but  had to get rid of it
You did
It smelled
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh
No
(then) What do you do for a living, Gary
(beat) How far do we go with this
This stops her, throws her off balance
Not yet
Don't say anything yet
Okay
don't think it works if we're somebody else
You know what  mean
Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything
It's your game
've never played this before
It's not a game
Something you play
Well, does it make sense to you
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens
It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition
Like you both know something
But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if  had stopped and said something
"  It might happen only a few times in your life
Or once
They look at each other a moment, then
Why don't we get out of here
They both get up
The ad guys at the table watch as she follows Foley to the elevator
Karen winks at them
- As they ride down to Karen's room
She looks at him, looks away
The doors open and they exit
As he follows her in
She walks to the bar, fixes them each a drink
He checks out the room, takes in her view
How'd you find me
He comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her picture and shows it to her
(') Oh, God
called your room from downstairs
If  had answered, what were you gonna say
Well, 'd say who  was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink
If  remembered you
came looking for you
would've said sure, let's do it
But for all you knew  could show up with a  team
Why would you trust me
It would be worth the risk
She looks at him, touches his face with her hand
You like taking risks
So do you
He kisses her now, puts his arms around her
What's the hurry, Jack
You have to be somewhere
She hands him his drink
They both drink, then
(') Sooner or later
She stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass
(') You really wear that suit
That's not what you were about to say
She shrugs, lets it go
He puts down his drink, kisses her
She lets him, then moves to the couch
Remember how talkative you were
In the trunk
Adele said you do that when you're nervous
She did, huh
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh
Yeah, but in a nice way
He sits down and they kiss again
This time she peels his jacket off
He does the same with hers
He's starting to unbutton her blouse when-- (') (unbuttoning) might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell  was a gentleman
They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy
He killed a police officer
He stops
Looks at her
hear he didn't mean to
The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart
You believe that
Why not
She looks at him, decides to get off this subject
Anyway he's finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands inside her shirt
She closes her eyes
You know that Sig
380 you took was my favourite
My father gave it to me
As he kisses her on the neck
(') What were you gonna do with me
don't know
hadn't worked that part out yet
All  knew was that liked you, and  didn't want to leave you there, never see you again
You waved to me in the elevator
She's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt
wasn't sure you caught that
couldn't believe it
was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet
Like if we could take a time-out
Really
was thinking the same thing
If we could call time and get together for a while
They look at each other a moment
(') You know  saw you on the street
Where
Outside Adele's
He starts to kiss her again, but-- You were going to see her
To warn her about Chino
So she did help you
don't think we should get into that
No, you're right
Or Buddy
won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit
Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet
Don't talk like that, okay
You scare me
And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand
Come on
He gets up and she leads him across the room
- Jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to take off his pants
Are you gonna leave your tie on
He looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him, standing close to help him with the tie
My God, look at you
When her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck again and then as she turns off the light
She kisses him
He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with him, the only light now coming from the sitting room
(') You having fun
She smiles and then they start to make love as we then
: Eyes open, serious now
She's lying in Jack's arms
She looks at him a moment, then moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed
You coming back
'm just going to the bathroom
She gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the door
Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table
- She comes in
Looks at herself in the mirror
Suddenly feels self-conscious
She grabs a bathrobe off the door
- Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the ceiling
She comes out again and stands looking down at him
want you to know something
wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking
Why are you mad
Or  did it for some kind of kinky thrill
Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade
What about my motive
Now  can say fucked a  Marshal
You think will
don't know
He raises the covers, but she just stands there
know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin
He scores some cash off a teller, he's on his way out when he drops the bottle
It shatters on the tile floor, he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they've got him
The nitro was canola oil
know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing
doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one
Most bank robbers are fucking morons
To go to bed with a bank robber for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd have to be as dumb as they are know you're not dumb, so why would think that
Why would you think might think that
She comes over and sits down on the bed
You're not dumb
don't know about that
You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain
They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him
He senses this, looks at her
(') You getting serious on me now
'm trying not to
just wanna know what's gonna happen
(beat) You know
And he kisses her
- The sun is out
The snow has stopped falling
white blanket covers everything
'   - Karen opens her eyes, wakes up
She closes them again, lies on her side, but doesn't move for a moment
Then
Oh, for Christ sake, grow up
She opens her eyes and rolls on to her back
She turns her head: Foley's gone
She gets out of bed
- Karen comes into the room tying her robe
She looks at the coffee table where
Something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and the ice bucket
She picks it up and slowly unfolds the "gift" from Foley:  Her Sig-Sauer
38
'   - Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room- service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes
saw Karen Sisco
Buddy turns to him
And she saw you
Yes, she did
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a
Marshal
You know how  felt about her
Did you give her a jump
If you did might begin to understand where your head's at
It wasn't about getting laid
just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different
You find out
Yeah,  did
Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee
So what's that mean
That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks
don't know
'   - Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of glasses
She reaches for the phone, dials
moment later, we hear  '   and she hangs up
- ring set up on stage
Men hang out on the side
Where movie seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through the theatre to the bar
Rap music booms out of speakers as fighters are announced
Everyone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along the apron of the stage
Stick and jab, stick and jab
White Boy Bob throws down a beer and gives Glenn's shoulder a jab
You drink like a girl
White Boy looks around to see if there are any other morons sitting nearby who think it's funny
Kenneth comes through for his pal and laughs
- As Karen walks through the bar, pauses as she sees Glenn sitting with White Boy and Kenneth
She steps back into the shadows as Glenn glances anxiously about
As he pushes his chair back
got to go take a piss
He hesitates, sees the car keys on the table in front of White Boy Bob
But before he can grab them
What're you telling us for
You want somebody to hold your little pecker
Glenn gets up, sees his coat on the back of the chair, but knows he can't take it with him
He walks away from the table
-   - Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot
Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car
- Glenn behind the wheel, half lying on his right side as he tries to rip open the locked glove compartment
His head jerks around as Karen opens the door
He sits up straight as she gets in with him
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car
Jesus,  don't believe it
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right
He raises his empty hands
don't have the keys
see that
mean 'm not stealing the fucking car
You're not
already stole it
Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm
can't be stealing it again, can
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it
've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him
Jesus
How'd you know about Snoopy
Karen looks at him, shakes her head
Glenn,  know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going
Put your hands on the wheel
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me
They're fucking animals
What's going on, Glenn
Nothing
just wanna get the fuck outta here
But  thought the whole thing was your idea
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit can't handle
Ripley
You mean the wall street guy
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills
Now, don't give a shit what they do
And is Foley a part of this
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him
Why's that
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward
(beat) But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out
don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me
Gee,  wonder why not
'm freezing my ass off
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up
Really
But listen, Glenn
If you're lying to me
know, you'll find me
Jesus, believe it
keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who am
If  didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead
Look at it that way
Go on
And he takes off
She sits there another moment, then flicks her cigarette out the door, gets out the car
- Karen looks across the street at the theatre, sees people leaving
few seconds later, she steps behind a car and watches as Buddy and Foley pull into the lot
- Maurice sits with White Boy and Kenneth as Foley and Buddy come down the aisle to their table
Where you been
You miss the big boys, come in time for the walkout fights
Well, shit, you may as well pull up a chair
Foley and Buddy remain standing
(') Kenneth, this is Mr
Jack Foley and this is Mr
Buddy, famous bank robbers
Foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair
Who's sitting here
Your homie, Glenn
Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back
Foley gives Buddy a look
White Boy Bob grins at them
think he must've fell in
sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads
Well, if he left his coat and he's been gone a while
The car's still there
looked
(to the ring) Reggie, push off and hit, man
Push him off
We're leaving
The fuck you talking about
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is
Maurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table
Look, what you worried about Glenn for
What's he know
thought everything
Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while the other one takes wild swings and misses
Glenn knows everything we suppose to do tomorrow Glenn could tell somebody that, yeah, but it don't mean shit
You understand
'Cause Glenn don't know  changed the plan
(then) It's happening tonight
Foley looks at Maurice now
(') Soon as we leave here
Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it
(beat) Give me a minute, talk to Buddy
You got two minutes, that's all
Make up your mind
wasn't asking permission
Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy
(') They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth
Whatta you wanna do
Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it
(') You know they gonna set us up
get that feeling, yeah
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do
Foley looks at him a moment, then
'll make you a deal
Get out of here
Right now
'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half
Half for doing what
Getting me out of Glades for starters
And who watches your back
As he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy and Foley talk up at the bar
Man has all that reward on his head and still talks like a con in the yard
You know what 'm saying
Like he's a man you don't mess with
Yeah, well, what  say to Jack Foley is buuull shit '  - It's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing and heating company on the side
We     that we're watching from inside Karen's car
She waits for the van to pull away, then follows
- Kenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel
Buddy and Foley piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and equipment
Maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter
Break and enter, shit
Take it and git, how it's done
Don't waste any time
That's how you do it
So you've done this before, huh
Shit, yeah
White Boy even got busted for it
(then) White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time
left my wallet in the house  robbed
The guy grins at them
Foley can't believe it
Takes the , the , some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor
That's a wonderful story, Snoop
'm very excited about tonight
Hey
You learn from doing
Foley and Buddy exchange looks
Maurice turns around, a Beretta in his hand
Foley looks at him
Buddy tenses
(') You know how to use one a these
've seen 'em used on
Maurice hands Foley the Beretta
Then reaches into a bag, comes up with a
38 he hands to Buddy
'  - As Karen tries to keep up with the van
But with the snow and the way Kenneth drives, she starts to lose them
She speeds up around a corner and loses control of the car
- As Karen's car does a 360 in the ice and snow
- Buddy and Foley are jostled about the back from Kenneth's insane driving
Slow down
Kenneth grins in the mirror, punches it more
Buddy gets out the
38 and touches it to the back of Kenneth's head
(') Get ready to grab the wheel when shoot this asshole
Kenneth, his eyes freaked with speed, glares at Buddy in the mirror
Do like he says, man
Slow down
'  - As a pissed-off Karen gets out of her car, watches the van disappear
Shit -- '  - She takes out her cellphone, punches a number, re-orients her car at the same time
'  - As the van creeps by one way, then the other, then pulls into the driveway
/
- ' All five of them in the back end of the van now, bumping into each other until Maurice lets White Boy out the rear end, leaving the doors open enough so he can watch
He then racks the slide on a
45
"An army
45 will stop all jive
" Huey
said that
You think he was talking about walking into people's houses when he said it
Maurice looks at Buddy
Buddy holds his gaze
Then the coach lights on either side of the front entrance come on
(pulls his mask down) Get ready to go skiing
Now the front door opens
(') Here we go
We catch a glimpse of a  in the doorway, arms folded over her bathrobe as White Boy gives her a push and steps inside the house with her
Maurice is out of the truck and Kenneth, with a shotgun, is scrambling to be next
Buddy catches him by his jacket collar and holds him squirming until Foley is out
The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge on Buddy, still in the truck
Foley takes the barrel in one hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face
Go on in the house before you get hurt
Kenneth puts his face up close to Foley's and stares at him good before going inside
Foley turns to Buddy
(') There's still time, take me up on my offer
'm not leaving you alone with these assholes
-  - Where Maurice has the woman backed against a table
She's in her forties, with thick red hair hanging free
She looks ready to take a swing at whoever approaches
work here
'm the maid
Kenneth reaches out, opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy bra and low-cut panties before she slaps him away
/ Fuck off
Hey, shit, we're gonna have a party
Not yet
Where's Mr
Ripley
told you, he isn't here
Out for the evening
He's in Florida
Palm Beach
(beat) When's he due back
Jesus Christ, what difference does it make
You want to wait for him
Mr
Ripley's down for the season
Christmas to Easter
You here all by yourself
(beat) That's right, just me
Foley catches the hesitation, glances at Buddy
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in
don't have any idea
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom
All right now, you and Mr
Buddy check the rooms down here
Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it
Look at the walls in the closets
The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere
How about his place in Florida
If you'd called, we could've checked his walls down there before we left
That is, if you'd checked to see where he was
You follow me
Maurice gives him a look, pulls the maid up the stairs
Kenneth and White Boy Bob follow
You set off any kind of alarm and you're a dead Hazel
Understand
Kenneth puts his arm around the maid
What's you name, mama
He hooks a finger in the waist of her panties, pulls on the elastic, is about to look in there when Maurice backhands him across the face
First money, then pussy
Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head
You ever wear one of these
don't ski
Stay with the maid
'm gonna have a look around
'  - Karen on the phone
snow falling all around her
() 'll send a unit over there, see if there's anything going on
Tell me where Ripley's house is
'll meet them there
() Karen, you gonna promise me you're not gonna go in, do anything stupid till get there
- Full of fat, cushy chairs and a sofa, everything white or black, a wet bar, a big ,  player
Buddy moves into the doorway, peers inside
Kenneth is trying to find a radio station while Maurice and White Boy Bob ransack the place
White Boy Bob checks under the mattress
Hey-- Maurice and Kenneth look over expectantly
(') found a rubber
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress
Maurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway
(') Where's Foley
Checkin' the other rooms, like you said
(to White Boy) Go keep an eye on him
White Boy Bob slips out of the room
Maurice turns to Kenneth, who's still playing with the stereo
(') Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a
(looking them over) don't recognize none of these bands
Just pick one, put it on
- White Boy Bob watches from the end of the hall as Foley peers into each of the bedrooms
Foley sees a back staircase and starts down
moment later White Boy Bob follows
- White Boy Bob comes down the stairs
No sign of Foley
White Boy starts down one hallway, then turns back
Now he's lost
He opens a door, starts to walk into a closet, then backs out
He goes down the hall, turns into
- Where White Boy Bob enters, calls out tentatively
Uh, Foley
He takes in the huge room, the massive sub-zero refrigerator
He moves to the freezer, opens it, takes in the
(') Cool
() - As Foley quietly moves to the doorway, peers into the kitchen, watches White Boy Bob starts going through the freezer, taking out steaks and stacking them up on the counter
Foley shakes his head and moves on
() - Dark
As Foley steps into the doorway, we   to reveal a   in f
g
He comes into the room, sits down in an armchair beside the fish tank
He leans close to the glass, stares at the fish a moment
He sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room, sees how the phone cord disappears underneath
They cut the lines, Richard
Silence
The door opens and we see a terrified Richard Ripley sitting on top of a toilet, the phone in his lap
Foley
That you
How are you, Richard
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here
What's going on
Who's upstairs
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends
Maurice
From Lompoc
Good God
Ripley moves to the doorway
(') Have they got Midge up there
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night
We thought it might be her husband
Sometimes he comes and checks up on her
She told him  was down in Florida
minute or two, you're gonna wish you were
Ripley looks at him
Foley pats the back of a chair
(') Why don't you come on over here, sit down, Richard, have a look at your fish
-  - As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm
'  - The music   (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi)
Buddy stands in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look them over
He tries on a coat, turns to the maid
How do  look, mama
Like a fag
Maurice smiles at her, goes back into the closet
Kenneth stares at the maid, nodding slowly
think she like to tussle with me
Get boned a way she gonna remember
She looks to the doorway, where Buddy now starts to take a step into the room, when Maurice comes out of the closet
() Motherfucker
He sticks his head out of the closet
(') found the safe
Buddy backs out of the room
'  - As Karen drives slowly past the house
White Boy Bob emerges with an armload of steaks and sets them on the front steps
White Boy
Get your ass up here
White Boy Bob hurries back into the house
'  - Ripley sits on the couch across from Foley
He keeps looking up at the ceiling
What do you want from me, Jack
Name it
You want money
You gonna write me a check
We'll go to my bank
'll make a withdrawal
Foley just looks at him
Buddy sticks his head in the room
They found the safe
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard
Yeah, hi
Nice house
Thank you
-   - White Boy Bob comes in as Kenneth and Maurice are getting ready to blast the safe with the shotgun and pistol
We gonna open up this fucker
Maurice and his boys open fire on the safe
The maid covers up as bullets begin ricocheting all over the room
(') Jesus
- Karen sees the muzzle flashes in the upstairs window and quickly gets out of the car
- As Buddy and Ripley look up
(gets up) Good God
they're shooting Midge
(pushes him down) Siddown, Dick
They're trying to open the safe, not your maid
As Maurice, Kenneth and White Boy Bob get ready to fire again
'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right
(pause) Okay, on three:  One
Two
The combination is three-ten-forty-four
They all turn to look at her, guns still pointing at the safe
(') Richard's birthday
- As Karen cautiously makes her way towards the front door
- As Maurice finally gets the safe open
They all anxiously peer inside
Maurice narrows his eyes, reaches in, pulls out one of three toupees
He stares at it
the fuck is this
Are they dead
He looks at White Boy Bob
Go find Foley
'  - As Foley leans forward in the chair now
can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time
'm not angry, Richard
(staring at the tank) In fact, 'm completely relaxed
Thing is,  can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there
Ripley sags, closes his eyes
Damn-- And now Buddy takes a closer look and now we, too, see that strewn about the bottom of the aquarium are dozens of uncut diamonds of various sizes
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard
Five point two
They look like plain old rocks
They sure do
He gets up, looks at Buddy
(') Go get a bag
Foley turns to Richard as Buddy comes back into the room with a plastic bag, starts reaching into the tank
(') were you, 'd get up and run
'm not leaving Midge
Don't be an asshole, Richard
They're gonna kill you
If that's my fate, so be it
'm not leaving
(then) love her, Jack
Foley looks at Buddy
Now what
'mon
Foley just looks at Ripley, who doesn't move
Good luck, Richard
() Someone down here
Buddy and Foley slip out the other door, down the hall, just as Maurice walks in, some of Ripley's clothes over his arm
(') Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself
Are those my suits
Where you been hiding, Dick
- now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley and Buddy emerge from the house
As Buddy leans under the dash
Foley looks up at the house where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear the faint pumping of the music
We hear the
Okay
Buddy straightens up, looks at Foley
(') Come on Shit
What
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too
And then they'll kill 'em
At least
Foley looks at the diamonds in the bag
We made it, didn't we
All you gotta do is get in
Again Foley looks at the diamonds, then
'm going back inside
'll go with you
Foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport
'll take one of Ripley's cars
Jack -- Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month
Let me do this part alone
Buddy just looks at him
(') 'm saying this isn't your problem
Far as 'm concerned, we're square
Foley turns to go
Hey
Buddy hands him his gun
Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back of his pants, and then turns back to the house
Now get outta here
As she watches Foley go back inside
moment later, the van pulls out of the driveway
Karen makes a decision, starts for the side of the house
'  -   - Foley enters and we hear the maid scream
Foley starts up the stairs
' Maurice and White Boy Bob both have their guns to Ripley's head
(hears the scream) Midge
Forget about her
Tell me where the money's at
Foley's got it
Where the fuck is Foley
- Foley comes up the stairs, heads for Ripley's bedroom
The door is closed now
Midge
He steps to one side, is about to reach for the knob when suddenly the
() - Karen comes through the door, hears the gunshot, stops cold
() - As Foley steps into the doorway and we see Kenneth and the maid bare, both sitting up in bed, Kenneth racking the shotgun, the maid turning away from him, gathering the covers that hang off her side of the bed
and coming around to throw them like a net at Kenneth as the shotgun goes off and the covers catch fire as Foley pumps one two three shots into Kenneth somewhere under there
'  - As Ripley tries to get away
Midge
Maurice grabs him by the collar, spins him around and whips him across the face with his gun
He and White Boy Bob then both hit Ripley on the head until he goes down and stays down
(to ) You take the front stairs, 'll take the back
'  - As the maid jumps up and drags the burning covers from the bed and sees Kenneth now, the bullet holes in his chest, staring blankly back at him
She then looks at Foley
(cold) Where's Dick
Downstairs
(then) But wait here
There's two more
- As Foley starts out of the room and immediately hears
Hold it, asshole
Foley sees White Boy Bob at the bottom of the stairs
(') Drop the gun
Nowhere to go, Foley has to comply
(') Now stay right there
Don't move
White Boy Bob starts to jog up the stairs two at a time, all the while keeping his eyes fixed on Foley
(') Maurice
got Foley
'   - As Maurice starts up the backstairs
Maurice
Up here
and a moment later, Karen comes out of the kitchen into the downstairs hallway -- just missing each other
- As White Boy Bob gets maybe half way up when he catches a toe on one of the risers and pitches forward
Stupidly, he tries to break his fall with the elbow of his gun hand and ends up jamming his chin down onto the muzzle of his gun which, unfortunately for him, goes off, firing a bullet through his head and killing him instantly
To say the least, Foley is stunned by this freak accident
He stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs
(finally) You learn from doing
Foley bends down to pick up his gun and we see , his gun raised, and now firing away
Foley is forced to jump back behind a pillar as Maurice keeps firing at him, shots ricocheting off the pillar, the railing, the wall
- As Karen hugs the wall at the sound of gunshots, sees Ripley lying on the floor of the study
- As we hear  as the breech opens on Maurice's now empty
45 And now Foley steps out from behind the pillar and calmly bends down, picks up his gun, Maurice still walking forward
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you
Not until recently
(still coming) Nervous
little
(getting close) This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you
You're right
So why take a chance-- Foley pulls the trigger
Maurice hesitates, surprised that Foley would pull the trigger, then the two of them at the same time rush each other, begin a messy mano a mano , now using their spent guns as bludgeons
'  - As Karen carefully comes into the room, Ripley lets out a low She's bending down to check him when
- As Foley and Maurice grapple on the floor near the head of the stairs
- As Karen answers her phone, checks Ripley
Hello
() We're a few minutes away
Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand
Oh-kay
- As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs
Maurice rolls down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as
Foley gets up, runs back to the bedroom
'  - As Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over the body, etc) with no success
Shit
- As Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk of White Boy Bob
'  - As Foley, exasperated, stands back up
(
) This what you want
Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe, but more importantly, clutching the shotgun
Foley crosses and takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when -- (') It's empty
Foley just looks at her
- As Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun
'  - As Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut
- As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs
() Maurice-- Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him
- As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive
'  - As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he   , then a
He stands still
Not sure who was just shot
After a long moment, we then hear: () Jack
He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the wall
() (') know you're up there
- As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down over his face
He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his pistol in another
Come on, Jack -- don't
Pretend 'm somebody else
You think 'd shoot you
Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun If you don't, one of those guys will
What're you now, a desperado
Put the guns down
told you, 'm not going back
He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen, but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or look around
Don't do this
Please
They stand there staring at each other
No more time outs
He raises the guns
She sadly shakes her head
You win, Jack
She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns, grabbing hold of his right thigh
And now Cruz and several other cops enter
Karen motions them to stop
Karen,  told you not to-- Wait,  know him --okay
She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes
(') 'm sorry, Jack, but  can't shoot you
You just did, for Christ sake
You know what  mean
She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer to him
(') wish things were different
'm sorry, Jack
Foley looks like he's in pain
He watches as she walks back down the stairs
As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer
Richard
She comes running down the stairs into his arms
They embrace
He looks at Foley over her shoulder
(sympathetic) Listen, Jack
(but then) What'd you do with my diamonds
Foley just looks at him
- As Buddy pulls the van into an alley
He jumps out, jogs back to the street and hails a cab
- Buddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass
The airport
The cab pulls away
Buddy glances up front, then pulls the Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up
There's a bit of water in along with the diamonds
tiny fish swims in the water
Something about this makes Buddy smile as we
: '  - The sun is out
The sky is clear
() They don't know yet if they want to bring him up on the homicides
'   - Karen on the phone
Her suitcase on the bed
doubt if they will
The Bureau's put a detainer on him, so when they're through with him here he'll go back to Florida
'   - Marshall on the phone
You gonna go get him
It's possible
Why
was just thinking
you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off
And then throw him in the can
He knew what he was doing
Nobody forced him to rob banks
My little girl, the tough babe
Karen hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window
- Where Foley stands staring out of his window
Foley
As Foley turns around and faces a   in the doorway, we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled
/
- The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black government van waits
The Marshal helps Foley inside
Have a nice trip
(looks ) 'll get the other one
/
- As Foley sits down, stares at the floor
He looks depressed
We hear the front door open, then close
() Jack
He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that separates the front from the back
got you a present, something for the road
She pushes    the grate
(') have to take it away, though, soon as the ride's over
Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once more and the Marshal helps   -- a black man with a shaved head -- into the back of the van
Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry
An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the door then gets in up front with Karen
Hejira
What kinda name is that
Islamic
What's it mean, "No Hair"
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622
The flight
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name
You were at Leavenworth, huh
For a time
Meaning
Meaning time came,  left
You busted out
prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place
(interested now) And how long was it before they caught up with you
That time
There were others
Yeah
That was the ninth
(really interested) The ninth Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio  walked away from
You must be some kinda walker, Henry
Hejira
And so now you're off to Glades
Apparently, yeah
was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait
(looks at Karen) She did, huh
Cheaper  guess, take us both down in one van
Yeah, could be
Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about
Like what
don't know
(then) It's a long way down to Florida
Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little higher than when he first sat down, as we then
