Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty thousand feet of water
But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon
Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm

The Bathysaphe is now mobile
It glides down the side of an enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below

Then, dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked by a rock-encrusted embankment
The  builds
The Shinkai approaches the embankment
Slowly starts to glide up the side
The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized by all the lonely creepiness
They crest the embankment
And the plexi-domed   with an unimaginable horror
As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is filled with
valley of death
Cluttered here and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of several ships
Seemingly ripped apart
Clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts
The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them
: 9      9000 -                                      9 The vessel cruises through the valley of death
Everyone is nervously taking readings, making calculations and adjusting equipment
Gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking
Several Crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi dome
Giant skeletons everywhere
: 10      9000 -                                     10 The Shinkai approaches an eerie-looking rock formation
The robotic arm comes out
The laser cutter steadies, aims, then shoots out its blue beam and cuts into the rock

And then, like a slow-motion earthquake, large boulders and giant crevices begin to shift in the murky waters
and
Several feet under the ancient silt, something is coming alive

Everyone is staring at the position board, which shows a large section of the     , its contours incongruous with the rest of the graphic representation
The Science Officers look stunned
The Captain barks commands
The Crew leaps into high gear

, bathed in the last light of day, all taut muscle and sinew, all business, with every one of his 38 years etched on his rugged, good looking face, is harnessed into the steering pylon, wrestling with his steering-sticks, holding the bouncing jetfoil steady as he can, hauling ass, propelled, it seems, by the music blasting out of four state of the art speakers bolted to the metal walls
Light from the laser imagers plays across Finnegan's face
The face of a man in his element, on the edge, in control
He barks commands into his
How we doing out there
we see , a muscular Filipina clambering over the foredeck
She's dripping wet
Tough as nails
She turns to Finnegan and "mouths" something into her headset
Finnegan flashes her his most charming smile

His  comes alive withe the  of  bitching in an unintelligible foreign tongue

He watches as Leila fights the  and  and dogs tight a series of hatch-latches across the foredeck
(') Missed one darling
Leila turns and gives him a "jerking-off" sign with her hand
(') love you too
The Radar Imager suddenly blinks, and goes to black
Dead
Finnegan taps on the screen
Nothing
Taps on the console
Still nothing
Simultaneously two more imagers shut down
His mouth screws tight
: 16       -                                      16 Crammed wall to wall with enough horsepower to fly a 747
Pumped out of two thumping engines
The domain of a scruffy, shifty-eyed, likeable little weasel of a mechanical genius
Wearing a mechanic's toolbelt, slung sideways across the hips like a gunslinger, singing the theme to "Gilligan's Island" over the engine's roar
Way off-key
His hands crammed deep in a tangle of wires
On the walls are a few pictures: Of a few major league engines
Of a few major league pinups, and a few of Pantucci and Finnegan
together in the
Navy
in front of the Saipan in shinier days
(singing) " -- if not for the courage of the fearless crew -- " He tugs at the wires
(') " -- the Minnow would be lost, the Minowwww would be lost
" Finnegan's voice explodes through his headset
(
) (radio filtered) Unperturbed, Pantucci works at the wires
(into radio) Can we use our indoor voice please
(
) (radio filtered) 'm flying blind here God damn it
Pantucci pulls two wires from the tangle
You trying to make me feel guilty
He begins to strip the wires with his teeth
: 17       -                                     17 Finnegan peers out of the windscreen, trying to see ahead of himself
Guilty will be the least of what you feel when  run my rig into one of these god damn no name islands
Get me well here
: 18                                                   18 Pantucci twists one wire around another
All better
19       -                                     19 The console lights up
The screens come back on line
Finnegan is pleased
(
) Now tell me again
: 20                                                   20 Pantucci works his wrench around an engine mount
And his nervous eyes around six men, big, bad men, standing on the far side of the engines out in a narrow passage
Maori()
Two Aussies( and ) Samoan()
Chinese()
And an Aborigine ()
Tattooed, armed to the teeth, packed in Kevlar body armor
Mercenaries
Who would as soon wring your neck as shake your hand
And a sixth man
The obvious leader
Smoother than the rest, but still showing the edge of a man risen from their ranks
He consults his watch with a growing concern
why we took this job
: 21       -                                     21 Finnegan hits a button on his console
The Stones are replaced by the first chords of
If  told you once
told you a thousand times

know
if the cash is there we don't care
(nervous) Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried
Pantucci notices Hanover impatiently looking at his watch again, and nods for a mass of Aussie mean and muscle named to follow him up a ladder
(') and some of it's coming your way
He quickly pulls out a wrench, slaps it over a bolt and tightens it down
The leak stops
He blows on the  like it's a six-shooter, then spins it at the speed of light and holsters it into his toolbelt
: 23       -                                     23 As Finnegan is watching the sea ahead, swathed in the shrieking Clapton guitar solos, the hatch opens
Hanover enters, followed by Mason, who leaves the hatch door ajar
Finnegan's eyes remain fixed on the sea
His ears on the Clapton
Hanover and Mason hold onto any available rail as the boat slams over the waves
You remember the first time we met Finnegan
think you were just starting out
smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese
what did we use to call them
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two
are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason
No, it just struck me as odd don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box
You know what they say
the classics are eternal
Hanover looks at the Topo Imager
Holding onto the rail to keep his balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea
So where are we
Finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map
Right here
middle of nowhere
And where is our point of arrival
Finnegan points to another spot on the map
Right here
middle of nowhere
and the answer to your question is yes
Which question is that
The one you came up to ask
are we on schedule
(to Mason) Take note Mr
Mason
this is why you hire a professional
No whining
No excuses
(attitude) 've heard a lot of stories about you mate
All of them flattering 'm sure
They were
but they musta been talking about another Finnegan
because the one  heard about was as rough as they came
the one 'm looking at is, well, about as current as the music
Don't mind him Finnegan
you remember 25
balls of steel
splashing around in a sea of testosterone
don't mind him
but  do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup
And who's gonna make me
Finnegan looks at Mason
at the open hatchway just behind him
The Finnegan you heard about
and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead
The force of acceleration tumbles Hanover into the console
Mason tumbles out the open hatchway, down the stairs behind him
As he rises, Hanover regards Finnegan for a moment
smile flits across his face
That's why we're sill around Finnegan
you and me
Nothing gets the feathers up
Business is business
Eh
Finnegan's hand finds the console
He hits a button
The first strains of Led Zepplin's    comes roaring out of the speakers
And the classics are eternal
Finnegan cranks the sound to the max, pulls back on both steer sticks, and holds on, as the force of acceleration hammers him into the pylon
: 24       -                                        24 The Saipan roars off into the setting sun, hell bent for leather
Zepplin screaming in its wake
: 25        -                                  25 Sailing through the mild waters of the South China Sea, a luxury cruise liner

And absolutely
No expense has been spared
Breathtaking
Gunfire shatters the serenity of the night

Chinese lanterns sway in the breeze

Hundreds of wealthy Passengers, the men in tuxedos, the women in drop dead gowns, dripping with jewelry, dance, flirt, gossip, as an endless stream of waiters ply the floor with champagne laden trays
: The sexiest pair of spiked heels ever to grace the foot of a woman, stopping at the top of the deck
: shimmering golden gown, high slit on the sides to reveal a perfect set of legs, a runway model's body, a cover girl's face
and a thief's sharp ferret eyes
class act from top to bottom
head turner for either sex, and knows it
She holds an orchid in her hand
Trillian scans the crowd, looking for her prey
and finds him
Her
The Ship's smug Captain
She fixes the orchid in her hair just so, about to move
He said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together
It was our first date
Trillian looks down to a petite old woman, dressed impeccably, delicate, frail, her beauty long faded except from her eyes
Kindness becomes her, like moonlight does the night
(') He said that it was the orchid wore that made him fall in love with me
He sounds like a real gentleman
The best of the best he was
This cruise was supposed to be our 60th anniversary gift to each other
He died last Spring
'm so sorry
was going to wear one
special for him
like a memory
The Old Woman looks at the orchid
And then at Trillian
(') But without him here  don't know why  should
Trillian takes the orchid from her hair, and places it in the lapel of the woman's jacket
Because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together
The smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving, sincere
The moment between them is broken by the keen clear sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute
(
) Ladies and gentlemen
: The deck where the band stops playing
Voices hush
Everyone turns to  , 65, tall, elegant, every white hair perfectly in place, impeccably turned out, with the energy, and enthusiasm of a man half his age
Canton stands at the head of the pool, in front of a wall sized aquarium, flanked by his Captain
(') All my life  had the dream of building the greatest pleasure ship ever to sail the seven seas
tonight, seeing all of you here
so elegant
so beautiful
so rich
The crowd roars with laughter
(') realize my dream has come true
thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making it so
Canton lifts his glass
(') To the Fuji Maru
Good times forever
Forever
Here
Here
The crowd swells around Canton
: The Captain chatting up some passengers when a woman's voice, seductive, beguiling, turns his head to
(French) Is it true what they say about a captain and his boat
The Captain's libido rises as he gazes into Trillian's come hither eyes
Is what true madame
Trillian takes one step closer, until her moist lips are pursed inches from the captain's
(French) Madamoiselle
that the bigger the boat
the bigger the man
His breath catches
It is a theory  would be glad to put to the test
Trillian draws even closer
If looks could cause a man to climax
(French) In school, the Sisters said testing was my specialty
Captain
Driven to distraction, The Captain turns his attention for a moment to a passenger introducing his wife
(') My wife
Enchante
: Trillian, turning from the captain into the crowd
on her hand by the side of her dress
man's wallet held surreptitiously
Her fingers open the wallet, extract a thin gold card with a black stripe
She discards the wallet, keeps the card, and disappears into the crowd
: 28        -                                 28 Top of the line
State of the art
The crew is multinational
English is the common language, but everyone has an accent
Canton, the picture of self-satisfaction, enters, sipping champagne
You wanted to see me Captain
The Captain stands next to a bank of
Canton steps up
Looks down at the
Multi-colored
We have a storm rising behind us
we may have to close the canopy, hope it doesn't ruin your party
(self-satisfied) Ruin my party
Captain, this ship was built to withstand a typhoon can't imagine there's anything on the sea today that could possibly ruin my party
: 29      -                                          29 crowbar quietly pops the top off a wooden crate to reveal the lethal looking tip of a torpedo
: Pantucci in the storage hold, surrounded by half a dozen crates, his wily eyes popped wide with apprehension
He licks his lips nervously, looks around and whispers into his headset
(whispers) Finnegan
Finnegan
hand falls on his shoulder, spinning him around to a fist coming right into his face
: 30       -                                      30 Jimi Hendrix
Blasting
As the Jet foil rockets across the waves
Leila, stripped out of her soaking wet clothes, down to her panties and bra, stands wiping her dripping wet, magnificently ripped body, with a dry towel
Leila puts her fingers in her ears
Gum kwa she bam dok
It's not noise
it's genius
And then over the headset, over the Hendrix
(
) Followed by the unmistakable sound of fist hitting flesh
Finnegan and Leila trade a look
: 31      -                                             31 massive fist plows into Pantucci's stomach
He drops from the arms of , a scar-faced Irishman with a buzz cut
As quickly as he is doubled over he is yanked up straight by the man who hit him, , a merciless Maori, covered by tattoos, topped off with venom
You know what my goal is
Before die  want to make love to a woman from every country on earth
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the
or like made up countries too
What the hell does that mean
Like Mamooli's country
What you talkin'
Samoa's a county
It's a dot on a map
Map
no map
don't give a shit they got women on Samoa, it's on the list
Mr
Billy you're in the batter's box
Hanover watches calmly as , the Aborigine, cracks his fist against the side of Pantucci's head, knocking him out of Vivo's arms
At home we denosy the nosy
hoists Pantucci
He draws his knife under Pantucci's bloody nose
We're not savage here Mr
Billy
we're professionals
Hold him
Mr
Chin
The Chinese merc steps forward, and whaps Pantucci upside the head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick
Pantucci hits the wall hard, crumbling
Chin lifts him
(') Anyone else
Massive Mason steps forward
'll take a go and the  vote we throw the little weasel overboard
vote we slit his throat throw him overboard
Mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm back, taking dead aim at Pantucci's face
He never gets the punch off
His arm is caught from behind
He looks over his shoulder to Finnegan
Gripping his wrist
Right in his face
this is not a democracy
You don't get a vote
Mason, enraged, swings with his free hand
Finnegan twists his arm sharply, sending Mason's head into the steel wall, knocking the big man senseless
The other mercenaries go to draw their weapons
Before the guns are out of holsters, Finnegan swings a spear gun into Hanover's face, an inch from his eye
(') 'll say it again for the hearing impaired
Finnegan cocks the spear
Hanover does not blink
Everyone freezes
With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised
Finnegan backs out of the room
This isn't right Finnegan
've got a contract
() 20 hours on the clock
Out and back
Double for overtime
And no questions asked
Who asked any
He did
with a crowbar
you know the rules on a broken contract
know it
but you want to get where you want to get, and back need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, 'd highly recommend overlooking the indiscretion
With that Finnegan leads Pantucci out of the hold, slamming the door behind him
Thanks
Finnegan turns his gaze to Pantucci
It makes the smaller man quiver
You put me in that position again 'll throw you overboard myself
Finnegan stalks off
Pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means it

The party is wilder
The  louder
The people drunker
Rain begins to fall
Everybody moans and heads for cover
The deck's huge hydralic canopy begins to close, reviving the party spirit

Lights blink
Tumblers roll
One after another the electronic locks unlock
Trillian stands back as the massive vault door swings open
With a quick look over her shoulder, she enters the vault
: 36      -                                            36 Trillian consults a list, looking for one very specific vault box
Finding it, she pulls a lock pick from her fabulous coiffure, and picks the lock in nothing flat
pro
Flipping open the box, Trillian removes the only thing she came for
dazzling diamond ring with the center stone the size of an egg
With a twist, she pops the stone from the setting, holds it up to admire it in the light
(
) It is an amazing stone
Trillian grits her teeth, and turns to
Canton, the Captain, and two burly Chinese security men
(') what were you planning on doing with it
Retiring
Well you can still proceed with your plans then
in prison
Captain
escort the lady
Canton exits
The Captain steps forward, and removes the diamond ring from Trillian's hand
Mademoiselle
you are not a lady
He slaps her across the face
Trillian flushes, touches the drop of blood at her lip
and decks the Captain with a vicious right cross
And you
Monsieur
you are not a gentleman
: 37       -                                 37 hatch door bursts open
Trillian is thrown inside
The Trillian looks around
No windows
One door
Lots of fruit and vegetables
Trillian accepts the hopelessness of her situation
She takes an apple, sits down and bites deeply, running her options

The Allman Brothers Band pulses out of the speakers
Finnegan is prepping the wound over Pantucci's eye for sutures
As he swabs it carefully, Leila is at the helm keeping the speeding, bouncing, boat on course
Here's what  think
think these mokes below are a hit squad
saw these guy perform
at Altmont
you know that
They opened for the Stones
He carefully threads the surgical needle
Right now
there's some bozo sitting on his yacht at those coordinates they gave us, sipping his scotch and soda
totally unawares that we are about to deliver 500 kgs of high power torpedo to light up his ass
that's what's down there in that hold and who knows what the hell else

Pulse rifles
Hand held gatling guns with laser sightings
Oblong grenades
The latest in death delivery systems
Hanover and his men lift and load
Slamming shells into chambers

You don't give a shit about anything do you
Sure  do

That's it
That's all you give a shit about
Oh yeah

Canton hurries onto the bridge

Communication systems have failed
Radar

The disquieted crowd turns to Canton

Fire spews out of the engines
Pantucci sprays a fire extinguisher frantically
Where the shrapnel entered the hull water now spurts with every wave
Smoke and water, oil and fire
Jezebel's dead

Where Pantucci is beside himself in smoke and sputtering flame
What did you do to my kids
Me
No
The man in the moon
Who's driving this thing
Finnegan notices something on the floor
He picks up a shard of the speedboat propeller
Strange
Hanover steps into the room
What happened
Finnegan looks at the piece of speedboat in his hand
We ran into a speedboat
He shows the piece of speed boat to Hanover
Who stares at it
Finnegan sees the hint of recognition in his eyes
(') Speedboat in the middle of the ocean
How soon can we get up and running
We can't
we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly
have a schedule
spent two years building these things
screw your schedule
Mason grabs Pantucci by the throat, lifting him off the ground
You little weasel
Finnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of Mason's knees buckling him to the floor
In the blink of an eye there is the barrel of a
45 pressed hard against his head, Hanover at the trigger end
We were talking about my schedule
You're going to have to get a new one
Not an option
Then you better start swimming
Hanover cracks Finnegan across the face with the barrel of the gun
Finnegan's head spins
He touches the corner of his mouth, and comes away with blood, and a look of murder in his eyes
Hanover slams a round in the chamber
One more joke and your comedy career is over
Now fix this

Look at them
they need gears
cylinder heads
oil pans
we're in the middle of the goddamn ocean

The first mercs reach the Fuji Maru's deck, and toss life lines down to Hanover
(') Mum and me we used to sit by our front door and watch them
she used to say "one day you're going to make your fortune in life on one of them
" Hanover hands one line to Finnegan, one to Pantucci
The third he attaches around his waist
Great woman your mother
Real foresight
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot
Belt up
You'll find all the parts you need up there
Finnegan and Pantucci comply
assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent
'd say that's a pretty good assumption

Martinis and tanning oil
Hanover hand signals to his men above
The lines go taut
Finnegan, Pantucci, and Hanover are hoisted to the deck of the Fuji Maru

Billy sits on the stairs trying to stay dry
He goes to light a cigarette

Kwam bat
Booom
She points the acetalyne tank she works with
(bothered) Yeah

Billy heads for the deck
Leila looks after him in disgust
Asshole
She ignites her torch, is about to flick her visor down again when a loud gurgling, a sucking sound, stops her
She cuts the torch
Looks around nervously
and then she spots the suction hose sucking away
She smiles to herself
Flips the visor, fires the torch, and goes back to work
: 66         -                        66 An alert Mulligan leads Finnegan and Pantucci around a corner
Vivo brings up the rear
You'd think they'd set a deck watch
: The deck full of people partying, carousing
The railing is lined with 15 lifeboats suspended in their harnesses
: Mulligan, Finnegan, Pantucci and Vivo staring at a completely deserted deck
The lifeboat harnesses swing in the breeze, eerily empty
Mulligan looks back to Vivo
thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through
Maybe plans changed
Plans don't change
Maybe it's the wrong ship
Shut up
And then a strange yowl echoes from somewhere deep in the bowels of the ship
Finnegan and Pantucci trade a look
Let's just keep going
(nervous) You ain't giving the orders here
And again the yowl
Everyone freezes
(') Let's keep going
: 67        -                                67 Hanover, Mason, and Chin set foot on the deserted pool deck
: The pool deck is jammed with people partying
The band playing
Two kids toss a beach ball back and forth
The ball flies over one boy's head
: The ball falls into the empty pool
Where the band's instruments litter the bottom along a big jagged crack
What the
Uneasy, Hanover and his men look around at the over turned chairs
The smashed aquarium
Chin bends down and picks up a small squid from the bottom of the smashed aquarium
The squid wraps its tentacles around Chin's hand almost immediately
Chin regards it with curiosity
Focus on the task Mr
Chin
and then the yowl freezes them

His eyes flicker with uncertainty
and a tinge of fear

: Mulligan, Vivo, Pantucci, and Finnegan, standing amidst the shattered glass and broken furniture, whirling to the elevator door opening
Mulligan, nerves ajangle, and Vivo, swing their pulse rifles up hard as the door opens to reveal
and empty elevator

The mercs watch it go with growing uneasiness

Tables and chairs are upended
Glasses and bottles are shattered everywhere
And there's on the floor

Next stop, Chinatown
Everyone jumps, freaked
Mulligan and Vivo spin around and Start  the shit out of the

They start to drift away
Spooky quiet

The Finnegan yells at Mulligan and Vivo -- Guys
Whoa
Finnegan finally tilts the muzzle of Mulligan's gun to the ceiling
They stop firing

Their professional demeanor going by the boards
All goes quiet
They look at Finnegan, who is the picture of calm

Mulligan whirls, his gun poised
Just then his headset crackles

Her elegant gown is ripped
coming from behind the wall
Wet
Gooey
Slithery
Ominous
Trillian freezes
Hello
The  slowly  across the wall
Then another starts to
Trillian spins around
She forces herself not to panic
Very cautiously, taking small measured steps she reaches the handle to the freezer, and tries to open it
No go
The gurgling ripples above her
Her mouth goes dry as her eyes follow the sound across the ceiling
Her hand goes to her hair
She pulls her lock pick out, and very slowly kneels down until she is eye level with the door lock
She begins to pick her way out, her ears and eyes following the gurgling above
Suddenly the sound stops
The silence makes Trillian's heart sound that much louder
She sidles close to the wall
(') Hello
Still silence
Cautious, she taps on the wall
For a moment nothing
And then
Something slams against the wall from the other side in response
Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in her throat

Dark
Damp
Eerie
Ominous
Mulligan and Vivo, looking more nervous by the moment, lead the way
Finnegan and Pantucci follow
(rattling, nervous) You know what 'm gonna do after this
'm gonna get a normal life
(calm) Joey
Like a house in the suburbs
maybe a couple of kids
some sort of business
be in the bowling league
go to the ball games
Finnegan turns to Pantucci, his voice even, calm, almost kind
Joey
it's okay
What
You don't think  can have a normal life
Joey
look at me
He forces Pantucci to look him in the eyes
(') We're gonna get what we gotta get
do what we gotta do
and get the hell outta here
okay
Pantucci draws his strength from Finnegan
He forces himself to take a deep breath
Okay
Suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the wall
What the
He and Vivo spin their guns at the pipes
The red dots of their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal
Nothing
(') Come on
the sooner we get outta here the better 'll feel
Mulligan and Vivo move forward
(quiet) Finnegan
Finnegan turns to Pantucci, who has not moved from where he hit the wall
It's okay
come on
(scared) 'm stuck
Pantucci tries to pull away from the wall
He is stuck
(jumpy) Hey
What are you trying to pull
(pleading) John
Finnegan takes Pantucci by the front of his shirt, ignoring Mulligan
Relax your arms
slowly
that's it
As Finnegan pulls, Pantucci does as he is told
He slips away from the wall
The jacket doesn't
What the
He reaches out to touch the wall
Finnegan grabs his wrist, grabs a flashlight from Vivo's utility belt and shines it on the wall
Their  -- the entire wall is covered in a strange, yellow, secreted
Laid on in some sort of weird, inhuman, geometric pattern
Like a spider web

Wipes her brow

Bloody murder
Scared shitless
Quickly backs away
Actually, it's only half a corpse
The bottom half having been eaten away
It's wearing a tuxedo
The corpse's face is tightly constricted, eyes wide open, a grotesque death mask
Leila shakes like a leaf, waist-deep in seawater

Leila slowly starts edging her way around the corpse

Her back is to the gaping hole as she slowly starts to pass in front of it

The water swirls around her waist

She's almost past the gaping hole now

Then something grabs her
She
And falls back towards the gaping hole -- But it's only a twisted piece of metal off a strut

: 79         -                           79 Knee deep in water, an edgy Mulligan watches Finnegan as he disassembles pieces of a thermal carburetor from an auxiliary generator
His eyes keep shifting around
Over in the far corner Vivo is watching Pantucci working over a metal lathe, repairing the cylinder head
Metal-on-metal
Vivo sits up on a barrel, trying to keep his feet out of the water
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable
So
So
If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head
Vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel
What  want to know is why the goddamn ocean is always cold
since 'm a kid  hate god damn cold water
Then out of the corner of his eye, Vivo sees
He spins around
Nothing but pipes and hoses
(nervous) What was that
Nothing
Someone's back there
Hey
Come out here
Finnegan and Pantucci stop working
All eyes are focused on the maze of pipes
are ,  and
Nothing moves
Check it out
Hey
You hear me
Come out
Still no response
Will you check it the hell out
Disgusted, Vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly
Man this shit is cold
He walks toward the mass of hissing pipes
His pulse rifle rising
(') 'm gonna kick your ass for putting me through this
Then he hears a strange  and   coming from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway
(') 'm not screwing around with you man
hate the cold water
What is it man
'm looking
Vivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading down the little alleyway
He looks behind some pipes
The gets
Then he sees it
His eyes widen -- (') On shit
And that's the last thing he ever says
Because just then, from a dark area between the pipes,
Mulligan, Finnegan, and Pantucci stare in horrified amazement as Vivo is viciously  into the pipes
moment later a    is  across a wall
Mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes
Vivo
Vivo
As Mulligan's attention diverts, Finnegan instinctively heads for Vivo's rifle, lying on the floor
Mulligan swings around
His rifle is armed
The laser dot fixes on Finnegan's forehead
(') Touch it and you're dead, asshole
Finnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out Mulligan
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot
What happened to Vivo
What the hell happened to Vivo
Everybody's breathing hard
Freaked out
Major tension
Blood drips down the wall
: 80       -                                       80 Trillian steps up to the vault, looking around, a bit nervous, something is definitely not right here
Helloooo
She shrugs, must be her imagination
From inside her low cut dress she pulls the Captain's gold security card
She is about to run it through the reader slot when
Ahem
She spins to
Hanover, Mason, Mamooli and Chin
Looking grim
(recovering) 'm sorry
This area is for authorized personnel only
As the assistant to the Purser, 'm afraid 'll have to ask you to vacate
Mason and Chin lift their pulse-rifles
(') Or maybe not
Where is everybody
Trillian is confused -- What do you mean
Hanover steps forward, right in her face
(threatening) mean
where is everybody
Poolside
Hanover grabs Trillian by the throat and slams her against the wall
He rams his gun against her forehead
You tell it straight or  pull the trigger
Who are you
(choking) passenger
Hanover blinks
Where are the other passengers
Trillian shrugs
Mason grabs the card out of her hand
Forget her
let's get what we came for and get the hell out of here
Mason runs the card through the slot
The It unlocks
Hanover's comes alive with Mulligan
Mulligan
What
can't hear you
Repeat
-- Mason  the vault door open
- into his head,
Kills him instantly
Eyes wide open
Everybody freaks out
Jumps back
Hanover lets go of Trillian, and stares into the vault directly at Nigel Canton
Holding the axe
Oh my God
didn't mean to
Behind Canton the Captain is on the floor, in severe pain, his clothes are ripped up,  nasty looking  , blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms
(') thought it was one of them
Chin jams his rifle to the middle of Canton's forehead, and cocks a round into the chamber
Stand down soldier
But this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order
Hanover grabs Chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal yank
(') said
He slams Chin against the wall
In the process he loses his headset
(') Stand down
Chin and Hanover stare at each other, their chests heaving
Mason finally drops to the ground
All she wrote

One of who
: 81       -                                     81 The machinery is sputtering, and sparking, shorting, steaming as the sea rises
Mulligan, in a panic, has backed Finnegan and Pantucci into a corner
He screams over his headset
Hanover
Hanover
Come in
Come in you son-of-a-bitch
No response
sucking sound comes from the dark mass of pipes
Mulligan spins
(') Hanover
Hanover
Forget them
Mulligan spins back to Finnegan and Pantucci
(fried) Shut up
You hear me
we gotta get outta here --
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up
gotta think
gotta think
What's there to think about
That back there
There ain't no thing here
No thing
There's you him and me
Got it
You him and
Suddenly, Mulligan's  are suddenly   from under him
He hits the floor hard
Starts
Finnegan and Pantucci hit the watery deck
everywhere
Mulligan is  across the floor
in fear
His pulse-rifle goes flying
He's into a metal pylon, then  into a dark void in the pipes
All in the blink of an eye
Finnegan grabs Mulligan's pulse-rifle the shit out of anything and everything that moves
Grab the parts
Pantucci grabs the knapsack, cramming as many parts as he can into it as Finnegan keeps firing into the steaming, creaking, sparking machinery
(') 'll cover
Move
Move
Pantucci doesn't have to be told twice
He runs like hell, with Finnegan firing a final burst, and following
: 82      -                                            82 Everyone hears the
Hanover looks around for the source of the sound
He finds it in his discarded headset
This is Red one
Come in Red two
The gunfire stops, replaced by an ominous, horrifying, sucking sound
(panicked) It's them
We've got to get off
He runs out of the vault
The Captain follows close behind
Hanover listens to the sucking sound getting louder and louder
Let's find them
What about the vault
It's not going anywhere
Hanover rushes out with Chin right behind
Only Trillian remains, breathing deeply, scared
but not scared enough to forget the reason she came cruising in the first place
She goes right to the vault, opens one of the boxes, removes the giant diamond, drops it down her decolletage, pulls her high heels off, and runs out
: 83       -                                      83 Finnegan and Pantucci run to the end of a long section of metal grating, right below a staircase, to catch their breath
Everything has gone dead quiet, except for the billowing and clanging of the engines
Smoke and sparks obscure their vision
Finnegan, what the hell was that
don't know
you got what we need
If  don't,  ain't going back to get it
you think we're safe
Both of them listen to the silence
And then, at the far end of the grating, one grate rises
and falls
Finnegan and Pantucci watch, transfixed
Then, like a locomotive gathering speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two of them
Come on
Finnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they can
just as the grate they were standing on rises and falls
Silence returns
Except for the steaming, creaking machinery
and an ominous sucking sound
: 84      -                                       84 Trillian comes running down the passageway to a freight elevator
Looking over her shoulder, she hits the button
The elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to hold a dozen people
Trillian rushes in and hits the up button
She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors close
until the elevator starts going down
Up
want to go up
She panics
And starts pushing the up button frantically, her heart pounding in her chest
There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator descending
until something drops on the roof with a
Trillian screams
The elevator comes to a bumps stop
(') No
No
Trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator
and then the car starts to move again
(') Go up
please go up
Trillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail
The car continues its inexorable descent
Finally, in desperation, she hits the emergency stop button
The elevator stops
The emergency
Nothing moves
and then
Something beats on the roof, trying to break in
And again --
The   and continues its descent
Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the ceiling, scared
The
Startled,
The  start to
Panicked, Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal
a high heel
The
--
Trillian swings her high heel
right into Pantucci's face
Finnegan plows in right behind him
Trillian tries to run out
Finnegan grabs her
'm not staying here
It ain't any better out there
Trillian struggles
Finnegan does not let go of her
(') Lady, 'm telling you
Trillian buries her high heel into the back of Finnegan's hand, breaking his grip
(') Just then, the doors to the elevator shut, and the car starts to ascend
Now look what you did
saved your life is what  did
Who asked you to
What the hell's going on here
You're with that other bunch, right
What other bunch
The thieves
'm not a thief
Then who are you
'm their ride
Trillian hears music to her ears
You have a boat
Her demeanor changes, her voice goes to honey
Finnegan
Trillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the ceiling
All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the ceiling
followed by a sucking sound
It's up there
Finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling
The sucking sound stops
Not anymore
The elevator stops
The door opens
Finnegan whirls his rifle, rising
Trillian lifts her high heel, ready to strike
Hanover, Chin, and Mamooli have their massive guns trained on the car
The Captain and Canton quiver behind them
There is a momentary stand off
Where are my men
Dead
Chin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash Finnegan's skull
Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the rear wall of the elevator
Mamooli jumps Finnegan from behind, wrapping his rifle against Finnegan's throat
Pantucci jumps on Mamooli's massive back, ripping at his face
Finnegan drops, buries his elbow in Mamooli's solar plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at Mamooli's throat in a flash
: Trillian
Impressed
She had no idea
Drop it
Finnegan looks up into the barrel of Hanover's gun
and a pair of eyes that will use it
Finnegan does as he is told
(') Now, back up
Again, Finnegan does as he is told
(') Everybody in
The Captain and Canton are only to happy to comply
As they slip in, Trillian tries to slip out
Hanover swings his gun on her
(') Where are you going
(freezing) Nowhere
Hanover, listen
Shut up
Hanover hit the elevator button
The elevator starts to rise
(') Now, where's Mulligan
Where's Vivo
told you
Man, there's something here
On the boat
You see
You see
Shut up
Shut up all of you
Now here's what we're doing
Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and  are staying here to finish the job
Did you clear this
With who
All of a sudden, the car is jerked to a halt, as if some giant hand was yanking on the cable
With that
And then, the elevator jerks down again
And up
Everyone is thrown about like straw
Everyone is shouting, panicked
And then the jerking stops
and the sound of sucking surrounds the car
The cable starts twisting, creaking sickeningly above their heads
It's gonna snap the cable
Trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically
Open
Open
God damn it
Finnegan is at the doors, pulling them with all his might
Help me
Pantucci, then Mamooli, then Hanover and Chin pull at the doors as Trillian keeps hitting the buttons
The doors part a bit
(') They're coming
They're coming
The doors fly open to
a solid wall
(') Oh shit
And silence
until the doors slam shut
the cable snaps
and the car plummets
Screaming and shouting mixes with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame against the shaft
Finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator

13 An   rapidly   right along with it -- 4th floor

Down, down, down it goes
Faster and faster
But the elevator doesn't stop at the first floor
It keeps dropping

For a long moment nothing moves, then Finnegan tumbles out of the elevator
Rising painfully
One after another the others exit into the dark lobby
Where are we
The sublevel lobby
Finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles
Don't touch it
Finnegan looks up to Hanover standing a bit shakily, his own rifle trained on Finnegan
You shoot me and you got no ride home
And with that, Finnegan picks up the gun
test of wills
Finnegan wins, and then turns to the Captain
(') You the Captain
Yes
How do we get out of here
We have to make it to the third deck
Pantucci steps on something
He looks down, his eyes widen
Oh no
Oh no
Finnegan
He starts dancing around, trying not to step on whatever it is
Trillian looks down and
Everybody freaks -- Finnegan grabs a flashlight from Chin's utility belt, and sweeps the beam over the lobby
The entire floor of the lobby is littered with shattered
Picked clean and spit out
Just like the earlier whale bones
Then suddenly, at the far end of the hallway, one of the metal  suddenly  and
Everybody feezes
And then the  suddenly comes  down either side of the hallway, accompanied by the most god-awful This way
Everybody else right behind him
The and   into the walls
: 86       &  -                                 86 on the Fuji Maru and the Saipan as they bob in the waves, surrounded by endless choppy ocean waters
: 87        -                                 87 Billy comes down the steps, gun out front, looking around
Hey you
Muscles
Out here
There is no reply
The only sound is the sucking of the pump
(') You want it that way
He  the waist-high water
(') when  find you, you pay
Billy heads deeper into the hold
: 88       -                              88 Damp, dark and disgusting
of pipes and gears lines the walls
Finnegan  the  shut
Dogs it tight
Everyone's gathering themselves around the room: Trillian, Pantucci, Hanover, Mamooli, Chin, the Captain and Canton
We've gotta call for help
Yeah man, no shit, call in the Marines
We can't
all the communication systems went down
So get them back up
don't know how
Hey  can fix any damn thing
where's the comm
center
We should get off as soon as possible
But if we can at least send a message
say we evacuate as soon as
(to Canton) Who are you
He's the owner
Why don't you want a message sent
just think that
Because you know a message can't be sent
There is a moment of silence
(') You're the inside guy aren't you
The guy who knocked out the communications
Hanover sets Mason's pulse-rifle down and claps his hands
Bravo
Canton flashes Hanover a look
The Captain is confused
Trillian suddenly  , spins him around and him against the hull
How the hell do we fix it
tense moment as Canton debates his situation, then relents
You can't
All the systems were melted at their core by nitric acid
(confused) This was your life's work
your dreams
My dreams cost more than they would make
miscalculated the market
there was no way  could recoup
Unless you collected on the insurance
What are you people talking about
He's with them
He motions to the mercenaries
(') They rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom
He collects the insurance, and sails off into the sunset clean as a whistle
Finnegan fixes Hanover with a look of certainty
(') Right
The Captain blows
He leaps on Canton
His hands find the older man's throat
All these people dead
Because you screwed up on the math
Finnegan pulls the Captain off
It's not going to help us
We're going to die here
We're going to die
Finnegan holds the Captain with both hands, calming him
was born in a City housing project in the Bronx
It's not in the cards that  die on a luxury cruise ship
now which way up
(alarmed) You hear that
Unseen by anyone, there is  within the
The walls start to come alive with dark,
within the maze of machinery,  by the bad lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes
The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror
They are
they are everywhere
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves
Everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch
Then a loud  is
Everybody looks up at the ceiling
Hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large translucent -like thing  the ceiling
Inside it are strange, disgusting biological workings
The suddenly gets dramatically
And then we   and , being sucked down the entire length of the fatty intestine
Still alive
And squirming wildly freaks out and   for the hatch
Finnegan and Hanover Covering their asses
: 89       -                                  89 Everybody pours out of the machine shop and fans out into this mechanical
The engine chambers are a labyrinth of pipe-lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and pillars of steel
The  is very poor, very dark
Hanover, Pantucci, Chin and Mamooli
blindly and wildly at anything and everything that seems to move in the darkness
The   and   light up the chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau
We catch more of the translucent -, strange , groping ,  and
: 90        -                                     90 Finnegan rounds a corner and crouch-runs down a narrow alley
Alone now
White-knuckling his rifle
He turns another corner and runs right into Trillian
Spins, gun ready to fire at
Noooo
Jesus Christ lady
(scared) What are those things
don't know
Finnegan looks around to the engine room, a labyrinth of pipe lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and pillars of steel
The  is very poor, very dark
He takes off
Hey
Hey
Where are you going
there's got to be a way to access out back there
He motions into the deep shadows
But what makes you think there aren't more of hose
things
back there
Nothing
you want to come, come
you don't
Trillian weighs her options, and takes off after Finnegan
You don't have to be so touchy
Look lady,  know you people are used to getting your way
What's that supposed to mean
You people
You people
rich people
'm not rich people
Well, you sure do a good imitation
Thank you,  work at it
Finnegan comes to a ladderstair leading to a catwalk
He starts to climb
Trillian, hampered by her long slinky dress, rips at the bottom, making it maxi to mini in a flash, and scoots after Finnegan
(') heard you say you grew up in the projects in the Bronx
Reaching the top of the ladder, she clambers onto the catwalk next to Finnegan, who is deciding which way to go
(') Trillian Daley
She holds out her hand
(') Projects
South Chicago
Finnegan ignores her hand
Finnegan
John
now that we've been properly introduced, can we get the hell out of here
Finnegan starts to walk down the catwalk
So this boat of yours
that's what you do
Give people
rides
That's what  do
Seen a lot of islands
Quite a few
Since 'm a kid,  had this dream
want to own my own tropical island
Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes
population of one
Anti social
Self sufficient
With the emphasis on , and in selfish, right
Takes one to know one
between Finnegan and Trillian
Just missing them as it  into a wall
Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed
Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt
Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- The  slowly  across the wall like a big leach
Trying to find its prey
Finnegan is frozen in place
Watching
Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees -- Hideous little worm-like  and  protrude up and down the Tentacle
and  and feeling their way across the wall
Getting closer and closer to Finnegan
Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's feet
He motions for her to push it toward him
But, frozen in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her
Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall
as they squirm over his head
Then he against some dirt, making a
Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm
He leaps to his feet
So does Trillian
She grabs the rifle, turns and bolts off down the dark alley
Finnegan tries to run, but the Feelers hold him tight
Two more Feelers slap onto his arm
The Creature starts reeling him in
: Trillian, running
Finnegan's  reaches her
She stops cold
Looking back the way she came, torn
: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle
When
out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running back
Panting hard, she aims the gun
Shoot it
Shoot it
Spurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the tentacle and pulls the trigger
Nothing happens
(') The safety
The safety
Trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to find it
don't know where it is
On the side
Desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best thing
she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat the
into its flesh
It  ink blood, releases Finnegan and recoils
Finnegan drops to his knees
Grabbing his arm, in pain
The tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again
Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to his feet, and starts to drag him backward
The tentacle coils, ready to strike
Just before it does so, Finnegan grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces
(') Let's get the hell out of here
Finnegan staggers to his feet
He and Trillian run off
: 91       -                                      91 Trillian and Finnegan come running around a corner, and stop to catch their breath
(annoyed) The safety
the safety
He flicks the safety on and off
(') Got it
(pissed) Hey
didn't have to come back
Yeah you did
(defensive) Right
You have a boat
Boat or no boat
You woulda come back anyway
You're that kind of gal
Oh yeah
What kind is that
The "come back" kind
How do you know that
Takes one to know one
Finnegan's small smile makes Trillian acutely uncomfortable
: 92       -                                      92 The Captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web
Struggling, frantic
But the more he struggles, the more enmeshed he gets
He holds his hands out beseechingly to Canton, who stands looking at him in terror
Help me
But Canton does not move
All of a sudden Canton sees something deep in the web, behind the Captain, which makes his blood freeze
(') What is it
Canton takes a few steps back
(') What
The Captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it is
There is a   deep within the spider web
(') ,
: Finnegan and Trillian racing across a catwalk
Below them, they can see Canton backing away from the Captain
Grab his hands
Canton looks up, stunned, as he sees Finnegan and Trillian rushing down from the catwalk
Canton backs away from the Captain, as the Captain's struggle draws him further into the web
The Captain's eyes bulge, horrified, as he feels  inside the spider web him from behind
(') He struggles
Then starts to freeze up as the tentacles wrap around him
Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body bady constricting, paralyzed
His  is
Hanover, Chin, Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another alleyway
Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his is  into the gelatinous web
They skid to a stop
Everybody piles up
Eyes wide
Watching as the Captain's body is pulled deeper into the dark web
Tentacles enveloping him
(to Canton) Where is the closest hatch
Canton still pressed against the wall, staring at the spot the Captain disappeared, talking to himself
never meant for anyone to get hurt
it was supposed to be clean
Hanover grabs Canton by the front of his tattered tuxedo jacket
You hypocritical bastard
all you gave a shit about was the money
where's the hatch
Canton points down a darkened passageway
(') Alright let's move out
you two on point
He looks at an uneasy Mamooli and Chin
Joey
Which way's aft
That way
He points in the opposite direction
Who gives a shit about aft
That's where my boat's moored
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do
Just trying to get to my boat
Finnegan takes off down a catwalk in the opposite direction that disappears in the dark
Pantucci is right with him
Trillian, a step behind
(yelling) You stay away from that vault
You hear me
Just before he steps into the darkness, Finnegan calls over his shoulder
They respond to sound
He disappears into the dark
Canton looks at Hanover for a long moment, and then takes off after Finnegan
The other two mercs look at Hanover, wavering
(tense) What
The sound of his voice makes the two mercs look around nervously
(whispered) He made sense
(loud) He's a bloody
And then conscious of his voice reverberating
(') (whispered) he's a bloody taxi driver
Chin breaks for the catwalk, hurrying after Finnegan
Hanover stands with a very antsy Mamooli, steaming
After a long moment, he strides off after Finnegan as well
: 93       -                                 93 In -, Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened, pipe-lined passageway
Guns out front
Sight beams sweeping the path ahead
Eyes wide open
Sweat sliding down their faces
Breath coming in short nervous bursts
Hearts pounding out of chests
The ominous   adds to the tension
Then the
creepy-looking reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship
Finnegan continues on
Followed by the others
All sweating hard
Eyes nervously shifting
Fear thick in the air
, we  Finnegan, Trillian and the others passing below
Then suddenly, in the dark foreground --    across the gate
They come to a door
Finnegan tries the handle
No go
Finnegan turns to Canton, and mimes for keys
Canton shakes his head
He has none
(whispered) Very good Finnegan
very good
Trillian moves up to Finnegan
She reaches into her hair, and pulls out her trusty lockpick
As he watches, somewhat mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times, and depresses the handle
Click
The door opens
Finnegan looks at her curiously, but with respect
: 94       -                                    94 They  the rear ballast section, where the walls are indeed far apart, half of which is now a small
Obviously flooded
The only way out of this room is down some which  beneath the seawater, or through a single violently twisted
Finnegan tries to push the hatch
It will not give
Mamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle to the task
The hatch holds tight
Finnegan turns to Canton, who stands slumped against a railing
He does not look well at all
What's on the far side
don't know
(nerves) It's your damn ship
What the hell do you mean you don't know
Finnegan touches Pantucci's shoulder
Joey, what difference does it make
Finnegan enters the water
(') If you hear one shot, you know made it
start coming
Pantucci follows Finnegan to the water
How do we know you're going to signal
how do we know you're not going to just take off
Finnegan stops
'll wait here
You go check it out
Hanover does not move
(') (contemptuous) didn't think so
Finnegan wades into the water
Just before he sinks beneath the surface
Finnegan
He looks back
(') Be careful
With a smile, Finnegan dives under
Pantucci right behind him
The others stand looking around, nervous
: 95      -                                       95 Finnegan  down to the floor of the ballast
Then into a passageway lined with black pipes
Pantucci right behind him
through the  waters
and
Spooky shit
Both men are wide-eyed as they swim
Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts
The  could come out of almost anywhere
Bubbles drift up from the darkness below
The
Pantucci falls behind
He swims around a curve and right into a
out of his mouth as he
The fingers on the dead hand seem to reach out for him
He fights his way past and swims off in a panic
: 96      -                                          96 Trillian stares down into the water
Hanover keeps a sharp, nervous eye back down the catwalk, white-knuckling his pulse rifle
Chin and Mamooli keep watch, tight lipped
Canton paces back and forth, driven by anxiety
Stop pacing
Canton acts as if he does not hear
He keeps pacing
Hanover chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into Canton's arm
Canton crumbles against the railing, in pain
You deaf
Why don't you back off
You want some too
Hanover's jaw clenches
He releases the safety on his rifle, the click resounding ominously in the hollow room
How brave we are
Trillian's eyes fix on Hanover's, unwavering
Mexican standoff
Hanover
Everyone turn to
giant ball of black, wet, down the gangway
Coming straight at them
mass of glistening striated
Fire
The three men open up with their pulse rifles
The gets
Red and blue - everywhere
But onward it comes
Down the gangway
Trillian grabs the pistol off Chin's utility belt, and opens fire
Canton jumps into the water and disappears
: 97      -                                          97 Finnegan explodes to the surface
for air
He reaches down and yanks a half drowned Pantucci up next to him
They both look up to gunfire exploding in the distance
: 98       -                                     98 The creature keeps coming
The mercs keep firing
Then without warning Hanover drops his rifle and dives into the water, disappearing beneath the surface
Trillian is astounded
She throws down her pistol, picks up the pulse rifle, and slams on the trigger
The recoil of the rifle throws her into the water
When she surfaces, she sees Chin and Mamooli, firing as they retreat to the water's edge
Still holding her rifle, she dives
: 99      -                                       99 Trillian swims down a violently
Eyes wide
Filled with fear
All around,   through the water
Primordial   off the walls
Lots of and  --
wildly
The water fills with and
Trillian looks around
Scared shitless
The bubbles clear just in time for her to see -- Chin, mouth open, eyes wide, screaming in agony, being ripped past her
She tries to fire her rifle

No one sees it

Mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to strike

The tentacle retreats into the pipes
Mamooli looks around
The room is empty
He runs out

Mamooli racing down the hallway, looking over his shoulder in fear, as the tentacle comes racing after him

Mamooli leaps through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift motion
The tentacle slams into the glass portal
Stopped
Mamooli keeps his eye on the portal, and backs up two steps
He lets out a long deep breath of relief, turns
Another tentacle envelops his face

They're herding us
Finnegan and company keep going
What are you talking about
As they round a corner, the   right in front of them
and    down
Cutting them off
Leaving only one route open
a slim passageway
Like cattle
You're saying they can think
'm saying they're calling the shots
Finnegan heads toward the passageway
Do we have to go there
The ceiling left above them begins to torque, and splits
The answer is plain
Everyone runs into the passage just as the ceiling comes down
: 103      -                                      103 Finnegan leads them single-file, they quickly head into a narrow void
Fear has led to silence, and unbearable tension
The walls on either side creak, and moan with strange noises

All the   suddenly
Everything gets quiet
Finnegan freezes
Something's wrong
Everybody looks around
from multiple pipes
The air is thick with
What's the matter
The quiet
Maybe we lost them
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be
Finnegan moves on
The others follow
Guns out front
They round a huge metal pillar and come face-to-face with a soul-wrenching nightmare
The '  --
Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow -, with hundreds of   running through it

Inside the womb,   , passengers, float around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living dead
They all seem to be breathing the gelatin
Several through the stuff; which divides and re forms in some sort of strange mitosis
Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified
But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at them
Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as their hands ooze through the thick gelatin
Trillian looks sick, trembles in fear

She tries to scream, but her face is already starting to constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed
Pantucci is so horrified he's about to cry
Oh no

The only thing she can move are her , which are bugging-out in absolute horror as she is imbibed alive
Our heroes are frozen in fear
Until the Lady's
Trillian burries her head in Finnegan's shoulder, trying to shut out the horror
We can't do anything for them
Let's go
He begins to lead her toward the hatch
when her eyes recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair
The old lady seems to see her too
Her hands read out,
Her mouth silently shapes the words:
Just as a tentacle comes creeping toward her
Her rage rises
She hefts her rifle, and starts blasting away

You won't

Finnegan and Trillian also look up

Looking good

The engines go dead An expectant hush

They down a hallway

He looks back --   , hurl themselves down the passageway right towards him
Pantucci , and splashes away
: 112       -                                 112 Trillian and Finnegan pull with all their might on a tiny portal
Finnegan tries to insert the blade of his knife in the crack
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living
The knife blade slips into the crack
(') 'll break the seal
Pull
He yanks the blade
Trillian pulls
The seal pops
The portal flies open
Waist-high in water, Trillian sticks her arm out, tries to get her shoulder out, but there's no chance in hell of that
Too small
She pulls her arm out
And a

Pantucci panics and grabs for them
Gimme one

He knocks both of them out of Hanover's hands

You idiot
They quickly fumble around in the water, trying to find them
around the corner
Partially obscured by the wave in front of it

Now only inches from the ceiling
Trapped
They're about to drown
Finnegan keeps looking around, trying to figure a way out

So goddamn close to my island could almost taste the sand

And blasts away until part of the ceiling falls out and into the water

Hanover takes his pistol and  Pantucci in the leg,

Pantucci doesn't even have time to deal with the pain
He starts  through the water

Pantucci throws himself into the opening of a dumbwaiter

Pantucci is scared beyond his pain
Pushing back as far as he can against the rear wall, he sees the control button
He presses the up arrow
The dumbwaiter starts to move

Canton doesn't notice this as he slips and slides his way up to the railing
He sees the Saipan and smiles

Tries to spin free
The hook hangs onto his leg for a long, agonizing  as Canton continues to

Canton drops to the deck, holding his leg and whimpering in pain

Tries to catch her breath
It's

You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship million little things like this

Off to one side of a wall, behind the bar, the dumbwaiter door opens, and Pantucci tumbles out, looks around, and then hears
(
) Help
Help
Pantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed bandits
rounds a corner, comes face-to-face with Hanover
Hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair
His face is badly constricted
His body paralyzed
He clings to a black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg
It's already to his hip
He grasps desperately for his pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor
This guy ain't gonna survive
and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally tense
He looks around, sees that there's only one Tentacle, and it's completely occupied with devouring Hanover
Pantucci is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover
Then he looks at the Sac, filled with regurgitated flesh
even you don't deserve this
Pantucci picks up Hanover's pistol
Then slowly, cautiously, he creeps forward, and sticks the gun into Hanover's (') 'm sorry man
He turns and quickly limps off
Hanover's  look down at the gun in his hand
Then, with all the strength he has left, he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his head
: Hanover's trembling
As it slowly squeezes the trigger
He want to kill himself
Needs to hill himself
He squeezes harder
The

The gun is empty
Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream

Canton sits inside, fiddling with the ignition

Oh my god
How do we do it
How do we get there
Not like him
Finnegan points to the water
and an racing after the speedboat underwater
(') It's the engine
it can hear the engine
it goes for the loudest sound
The Tentacle quickly picks up speed, going faster and faster, getting closer and closer, stretching further and further
Suddenly, behind them, a    is
They turn around and look -- The hook, the tow-line, and the entire railing have dropped down onto the watersports platform and are tangled up around the two jet skis, trying to tear free -- The Saipan is still clinging by its fingernails to the Fuji Maru
Finnegan races over to a and grabs the winch- line
: 126      -                                       126 Canton, smiling brightly, peers at the approaching island through the speedboat's windscreen
So relieved he sings to himself, from the operetta
Oh we sail the ocean blue, and our mighty ship's a beauty
We are strong men, yes it's true, and responsive to our duty
When

Canton is  through the windscreen and onto the hood

The whole   is and  and
His every joint is being ripped out of socket as he strains to get the clip on the line before the entire rig tears away into the sea
With one last heroic effort of will and grit, he snaps the clip in place just as it all

He half collapses on top of her
You know, Finnegan, 'm starting to believe what you said about you not being born to die on a luxury liner
Despite the grimness of their position, the closeness of their bodies is
a turn on

Canton backs away from it as far as he can
Another   up next to him
Canton crawls away from that one
Its Feelers and Suckers unsheathe, dripping mucus
Canton's eyes widen, horrified
Then another up
Canton crawls to the center of the hood
And another
Canton has nowhere to go
The Tentacles close in on him
No
No
No
All the tentacles rise over him, about to descend

It's quiet in here
Maybe too quiet

Yeah

Trillian looks around nervously

once this baby's set
'll rev it up
that slimy bastard will come for it like candy
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island
Jet ski
there's one left up there
The plate comes loose
Revealing a gaggle of wires, and parts
(') let's see, it was red wire cross compressor blue wire
or blue cross red
He starts to fiddle with the wires
-- Suddenly, there's a right behind them
More pulse rifles spill out
Trillian spins, ready to blast away with the pulse rifle, to
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
Just the man  wanted to see
On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red
He refers to the wires
Not even a Joey, 'm glad to see you
Joey, what happened to your leg
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid
(fast) Red cross over to blue double blue is that what it is
squid
Squid
squid like

eighty foot clams
60 foot sharks

can you get me more juice out of Hercules

For juice,  gotta rebuild
That's not fast
How about noise
Can you get noise
We don't need speed, just noise, right
Right
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here
Seafood salad
(to Trillian) You ever operate a jet ski
(nervous) You want  to go up there
Not unless you can wire a missile or fix an engine
And what if  run into one of those things
Finnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate
Don't forget the safety
She hits the safety, slams a shell into chamber
Don't take too long
'm not planning on being on the menu tonight

(razzing) 've never seen you so congenial with a member of the opposite sex
The two of you got a nice patter going

Just barely manages to catch herself
Hangs there for a moment
Something  in the water below her
Trillian's scan the darkness; scared sick
: 135      '   -                        135 Finnegan  the - as hard left as they'll go
The rudder locks tight
Pantucci enters
gerry-rigged the ignition
all you gotta do is start her up
it won't go fast but it'll go loud
Trillian's scream tears through the night
Finnegan's eyes go to the Fuji Maru
He kicks open a box by the side of the console, and pulls out a sawed off shot gun with a pistol handle in a holster
(') Man, don't go up there
One whistle
Start the engine
Finnegan slams shells into the shotgun
She's gone
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed
and for what
Some chick
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey
Finnegan hefts a pulse rifle, and runs out of the pilothouse
: 136        -                                  136 Finnegan drops onto the deck from the tow line
Pulse-rifle leveled
Adrenaline rushing through his veins
man on a mission
The  is in its final death throes
and Trillian's scream pierces the night, followed by several shots
Finnegan takes off in it's direction
: 137        -                            137 Finnegan
Ready to be jumped
The scary  builds
Again shots fired
This time closer
Finnegan throws caution to the winds, and runs for all he is worth
: 138      -                                         138 Trillian is being dragged down the dark hallway by a tentacle wrapped around her legs
She struggles frantically, trying to get a clear shot off
But her shot goes wild as she is pulled this way and that, slammed against the walls on either side
She loses her rifle
: 139       -                                    139 Finnegan  the glass-domed atrium
Sloshes through the water
Stops in the middle and looks around
Sees a Tentacle, writhing up a glass wall of the atrium
Finnegan hears He quickly plants his feet and  from the hip
He arcs around Finnegan lets out a low, angry, guttural The   from the

Freed, Trillian gets up, grabs her rifle, and

Disoriented, Trillian runs towards a dark exit door -- and into a geometric gelatinous Sticks
: 142      -                                          142 Finnegan is slamming another clip into his pulse rifle when he hears ,  for help
He takes off running through a hatch
: 143       -                                      143 Trillian struggles in the web, but she's only getting herself more stuck
Behind her, deep in the web, Tentacles slowly start squirming their way towards her
Trillian feels the start to
She struggles wildly
Panicked
Finnegan  the room
Spots Trillian
Starts sloshing his way through the water
Trillian sees him coming
Finnegan
Trillian looks back
Sees the Tentacles coming out of the darkness of the web
Twenty feet back and closing
(') Hurry
Hurry
Finnegan runs up and grabs her
Tries to pull her free
But she's stuck good
He looks behind her to the tentacles quickly closing in on her
Now fifteen feet away
(') Get me out of here
As she struggles, Finnegan pulls out his knife, and starts to hack away at the sticky webbing
Trillian tries to look behind her
Don't look
Push
Trillian struggles with every last ounce of her strength
Now ten feet away
Finnegan hacks away with desperate urgency
Now five feet
Grab my hands
Finnegan plunges his hands into the goo
Trillian latches onto Finnegan's wrists, he onto hers
Four feet
(') Push
Push
Finnegan strains, pulling, until every muscle in his body keens with the effort, every vein pops to the surface
Trillian pushes for all she is worth
Three feet
two feet
one foot
With a last gargantuan effort, Finnegan yanks
Trillian comes tearing out of the webbing
the remnants of her gown doesn't
in the nick of time
The tentacle rushes forward
Finnegan jams his pulse-rifle into the web and
Blasting the entire clip into the goo
Tearing the shit out of it
And that's when the whole  starts to
And
Finnegan and Trillian both look down at their feet as they hear the    , one at a time --
-
--
Something is rising up through the ship
He grabs Trillain and pulls her toward the exit
She scoops her fallen pulse rifle off the floor
Go
Go
Go
He shoves her out the door, and is about to follow when the door is slammed shut in his face
(
) Finnegan
Get to the jet ski
Go
: 144      -                                         144 Trillian stands there, pulling on the door, half naked
The door is bolted tight
She has not other options
She runs off
: 145       -                                      145 Finnegan turns as the   and the as    from below them
His eyes widen
And there it is -- The huge, horrible, mutated, mucus-covered, sucker-faced
giant mutated protoplasm
Jutting up from a breach in the floor
The trunk of the Creature, the part where all the Tentacles come from, is below the next deck
slimy, translucent  slowly ,  what appears to be some sort of
It seems to stare right at Finnegan, who is transfixed by the sight
Tentacle slowly starts to move in on Finnegan
Finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris that blocks his shot
The -type organism follows him
Another Tentacle starts to move
Silently undulating through the water towards Finnegan
The membrane over the  moves
And another Tentacle starts to close in for the kill
They are surrounding Finnegan
Finnegan comes around the shattered booth
Faces the Creature full-on
He can't miss
He gives it a wicked smile
Get a good look
In -, Finnegan lifts his pulse-rifle
It He jams the gun-butt into his hip
Takes aim --
But he only gets off one quick  before a and  him
him into the air
His pulse-rifle goes flying
Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into the floor, and the death that awaits him
He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer, closer
He is about to disappear down the hole of no return, when his hand comes up with his knife
He slashes the tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door
As he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him
Huge
Blocking his way
It's maw opens wide
terrifying sight of jaws and teeth and death
About to devour him
As it strikes forward, Finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the vile thing to smithereens
He bolts through the door, several Tentacles already after him
: 146       -                            146 Trillian sits up on the jet ski
She hears the

He rounds a corner - him
Hard

Finnegan  the shotgun
Hits the floor running
Another him
Sends him  through a hatch
Finnegan  in
Face-first
Quickly rolls over and looks back --    in through the doorway
Finnegan back-pedals on his hands and feet, stumbling over various sports equipment
The  homes-in on him Finnegan hurls himself backwards
anything that comes to hand at the Tentacle
But onward it comes
Finnegan back pedals faster
Over diving gear
Scuba tanks
Fins and masks

About to
Finnegan backs into the wall
Trapped
He spots a
Grabs it
The
Finnegan

Finnegan scrambles past the furiously and runs out of the room
: 148       -                             148 Trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into the dark water
She frantically whispers to herself: Oh my God, oh my God
Suddenly, twenty feet from the jet ski, through the water
Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it
Eyes wide
Knuckles white
Breathing hard
Something drops onto the ski behind her
(') She turns, ghost white
to Finnegan
don't mean to drop in unannounced you ready
Soon as  get over the heart attack
Finnegan whistles
Waits
No engine goes on
He whistles again
Still no response
Removes his watch, gives it to Trillian
Three minutes
'm not back
no matter what
you go
No
You don't take orders very well, do you
don't take orders at all
This time, make an exception
He grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, and leaps up on the side of the Saipan, and scales up to the deck
Trillian watches him, and then looks at the watch
: 149        -                              149 Finnegan bursts in
Pantucci
Then he spots something on the floor
He reaches down and picks it up
It's Pantucci's leather tool belt
It's been Finnegan stares at it
His grip tightening
Tears rising in his eyes
His jaw clenching
Then he flings the belt aside
Filled with rage
(') Time to die, motherfucker
Finnegan hits the ignition button
desperate moment of dry cranking
and then the one remaining engine catches, sputters, and fires to life
: 150       -                                       150 Trillian hears the Saipan's engine come to life
She hits the ignition on the jet ski
Right next to her something drops from the deck of the Saipan into the water
Finnegan clambers up in front of her
His pulse rifle still in hand
Where's you friend
He's not coming
The Saipan strains on its leashes
Finnegan swings his rifle around
on the tie-lines
All the -
The Saipan starts to break free
(') Hold on
He  the ski
and it stalls
The jet ski stalls
Goes dead in the water
(') Oh shit
Nearby, the   violently
He hammers the starter button
(') Come on
The
He tries again
(') Come on
Another
More  , getting closer now
But the third time's a charm
The jet ski comes to life and shoots off along the side of the ship
Just as a tentacle comes shooting out of the water
Finnegan fires at it, blowing it to pieces
The last -
The from the Fuji Maru
The jammed steering-sticks force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle
151     :                                                  151 Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski
Pedal to the metal
Looking straight ahead
Trillian holds on for dead life
Suddenly, a   in front of the jet ski
Finnegan cranks the handlebars
The
The Saipan starts to arc around
The  gleams in the Dripping water
Finnegan   away from the Fuji Maru
Throwing water
Another tentacle rears up
Right in front of the jet ski
Finnegan and Trillian lean hard
The    sideways across the water
Trillian can't hold on
Flips off the back
Skips across the water
Finnegan  away
tentacle hard on his ass
Trillian pops to the surface
Treads water
Panicked
Watches Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind
Finnegan looks back at Trillian
Bobbing in the water
The he looks at the Saipan
Continuing its arc
Its deadly payload racing for the Fuji Maru
Finnegan  the
through a wave and heads for Trillian
Trillian sees him and swims hard
The   straight at the Fuji Maru
The warhead perfectly positioned to strike its hull
Only fifty meters away
Now forty
Now thirty-five
152     :                                                152 Finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski
Slides up next to Trillian
Grabs her by her arm
Rips her out of the water
Throws her onto the back of the jet ski
Just as a tentacles rises up, lashing out
He
through the waves
The   through the water
The jet ski hauls ass
Faster and faster
in front of the jet ski
tentacle slaps down hard
Finnegan cuts hard
Too late
The    through the geyser
They and the    and  across the water
The Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru
No twenty meters away
Now fifteen
Finnegan pops to the surface
Looks around
Can't find Trillian
He  under the water
His : Tentacles converging on him from the murky depths
The "retrieve" feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards where Finnegan and Trillian fell off
Finnegan  to the surface
Holding Trillian
She looks nearly lifeless
The jet ski heads right at them
Finnegan swims for it
Dragging Trillian
As tentacles converge from all sides
The   is suddenly  under the water
Swallowed whole
Finnegan quickly reverses
Backstrokes like mad
The through the water
Now only ten meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru
Now nine meters away
Now eight
Seven
Six
Five
153       -  :                                 153 Finnegan paddles hard
Sucking in as much water as he is air
out of the water
Looms above Finnegan and Trillian
Dripping water
About to strike
There's nowhere to hide
Finnegan paddles harder
154        - :                                154 The  starts its
And that's when the the Fuji Maru
The   into its hull
-
The
the night sky
The   of the Fuji Maru across the waves
The Tentacle above Finnegan drops like lead
And just lies there
Quivering
Another the remains of the   out of the sea
Sends shock waves across the water
Blows Finnegan's hair back
He swims on
Towards the island
Pulling Trillian
The remains of the  and the and
to the surface
couple dozen small  dot the waves
and drifts into the night sky
Debris coats the water
: 155      -                                         155 Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the beach of the island
They collapse next to each other
Finnegan is exhausted
Trillian coughs up seawater
They both turn and look out to sea, and the rising sun
Trillian reaches into her bra, and pulls out the egg sized diamond
She holds it up
The sun refracts off it brilliantly
Trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture perfect island, the picture perfect sunset
and then she heaves it as far as she can into the sea
For the first time since they know each other there is nobody around
No people
No tentacles
And when they look at each other, something else comes to mind besides survival
Finnegan moves towards Trillian
Trillian moves towards Finnegan
Their lips move closer, closer
And then, down by their feet -- Scares the shit out of them
The audience too
But it's just Pantucci
Looking waterlogged and shell- shocked
Coughing up half the sea
Finnegan and Trillian help him to his feet
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to
Joey
Because it's cool, you know,  can always take a walk or something down the beach
Joey
Or  could go for a swim
although,  gotta tell you
if  never get in the water again
Joey
you don't have to beg me 'll stick around
And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling, teeth- shattering  ever
Pure primeval
Like no sound or animal or thing we've ever hear beofre
Coming from (') Or maybe not
Finnegan, Trillian, and Pantucci slowly turn and look
We     as they all stand up more of this creepy-looking island
And leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach
pieces of the smoldering ship
Nearly the whole island is  now
Dark jungles
Craggy mountains
Maybe the scariest-looking place on earth
(
) What now
The ""  again
It's hellacious
