My parents were killed in Kosovo
It was my brother who sold me here

We can only send you home, but what you choose to do after that is up to you

Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a investigation

Irka can stay
But  can't keep Raya here
She is refusing to cooperate in the repatriation program
Please, just let her stay two weeks

Kathy takes out the photo of Fred Murray and lays it on the table

There was a protection racket
Americans, Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make sure the place wasn't busted

Locked up in the hills

Okay, but if the girls testify in a Bosnian court against their trafficker

Of course

Some do, some don't
Fifty-fifty chance
Disappointing
Viko lights a smoke, offers one to the cop

You might be lucky
Lanky guy in their archives loves to send files

And that's just a drop in the ocean

Photos, corroborated statements
We can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission-- Bill shakes his head
If  could give you a piece of advice it would be to think of the future
These girls-- Are Collateral Damage
Whores of War
It's nothing new
Every conflict produces them
You know as well as  do, those girls aren't a product of the war

For the peace-keepers
Kathy is repulsed
Bill takes a seat
This is your first mission
You're eager
But we work in a very grey area and that can get messy
Everybody wants the  to take the gloves off but they don't want us to get our hands dirty
It's a fucking Catch-22
So what do we do
We prioritize
We do our best and we always look at the bigger picture
You're a mother
Fine
see what you're doing with these girls
Maybe that's why you're thinking with your heart not your head
But you have a chance at a career in the international sector
Ride this out
Get a promotion
Human Rights in Liberia, Afghanistan
don't give a shit
And then, when you're running the show, you can implement whatever changes you see fit
But right now be smart and shut this bullshit down
The veil is lifted

The girls look at one another

The steps forward
He looks like he's had a few drinks
Fuck you
Kathy eyes the girls
Their confusion, their fear

Let's get these girls out
But the girls still don't move
Raya
Fractured with despair
After all she has been through, all the punishment, all the pain
Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced
And Raya starts to step to Kathy
When
Behind Kathy, an  officer removes his helmet
Mike Sears
He stares at Raya
Petrifying her
Kathy sees it in her --  around
Mike Sears avoids her gaze
Kathy turns back to Raya
Moving closer, quietly, out of earshot of the others

That you do not work here voluntarily
And we will get you to safety
Raya wants so badly to answer

Raya eyes Mike Sears - He looks to Luba
Luba turns back to Raya - Pleading -- Don't do it

Raya can't look at Kathy
Tears stream down her face

Raya
With her heart breaking
No
Kathy looks at the all girls
Their eyes flitting between Mike and Kathy
And she understands

Grabs Mike by the collar --  him to the door --  him against the wall
Who the fuck are you

Mike pushes back
Get off me, you crazy bitch

We can't leave them here
We're supposed to-- If they won't come, we can't force them
Nothing will hold up in court
They'll be returned and punished
Do you want blood on your hands
The girls all return to their positions behind the bar, cleaning, sitting around the edges
Not one will catch
Kathy's eye
She glares at Mike Sears
Kathy watches across the room, devastated
As Raya turns, giving up her last chance to leave, and exits to a back room
