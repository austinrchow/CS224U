href <b>// --> </b> Phone Booth by Larry Cohen : -      - - The sidewalks crowded as usual
sea of humanity
People come and go -- always in a hurry
Oblivious of one another
--   being torn up by construction workers;    loading up refuse; nuts and salted pretzels;  blocking a passerby
Intimidating
Demanding
Almost mocking
We're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound
-- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East Side and West Side -- uptown and down
One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters into a dozen pieces
There are 237,911 pay telephones in the five burroughs of the city of New York
Many of them are still in working order
-- on the phone in extreme close up
We don't hear the words
Only the facial expressions inform us that these are human beings under tremendous pressure
Life in the city is wearing them down
- Lips jabbering into receivers
Cross-cut against one another
Despite increased usage of cellular devices, an estimated four and a half million New Yorkers and two million visitors still utilize pay telephones on a regular basis
At thirty-five cents a pop
for the first three minutes
- - There's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the street
You're looking at the telephone booth at the corner of 45th Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of the Manhattan theatrical district
It has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by a kiosk
It's one of the few remaining phone booths left in the city
on the irate caller in the booth -- a very well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in appearance
(into receiver) You have lied to me for the last time, you lowlife prick bastard don't ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again
(listens) Yes, well fuck you, too
She slams down the receiver and exits
The booth remains vacant for a brief interval
At least three hundred calls daily originate from this booth
The coins are collected twice a day
This booth has been burglarized forty-one times in the last six months
Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for coins
This is  , snappily dressed, his hair styled and his nails manicured
Here is a man who clearly takes excellent care of himself
He sports a Donna Karen suit and silk Armani tie
He's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby restaurant and has finally caught up with him
Stu, we got to talk
Wish  could accommodate you, Mario, but this is my busy time of day
How come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant
Why don't  stop in later for some lunch
There's no more drinks or free meals until the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said
'm doing my level best for you people
One lousy mention in the Post and you expect to eat for six months
got the food critic from the Village Voice all lined up to give you a review
That's what you tell me last July
And he never shows
was allowing you time to expand the menu
Wallpaper the bathrooms, for God sakes
You get only one shot with these fucking critics and don't want you to blow a rare opportunity
You the one blowing it
How long you think you can fuck everybody
Hold on right there
've got a very excellent reputation around this town
So how come you take two nice suits of clothes from Harry and never get his daughter on David Letterman
Hell, 'm not an agent
'm a publicist
Mister, you're nothing
Believe me, Valerie's on the waiting list to audition
Harry's got no complaints
He just let me pick out this tie the other day
That Harry's a damn fool
Mario, please let me make this up to you
How about  arrange for the opening night party for this new off-Broadway show 'm handling -- to be held at your place with local  coverage on nine and eleven
mean  had it promised to another client -- who actually pays me money
But it isn't firmed up yet
And  could throw it your way
Maybe
What is involved
You'd toss in the buffet for say seventy or eighty
The producers would supply their own vino, of course
'd deliver you a truckload of celebrities
And if they like the food, they'll all come back, naturally
What celebrities
You want Liza Minelli
An Oscar winner
Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr
Is he still alive
saw him last night going into the Four Seasons
'll bring you over a whole  list when we come by for dinner
How come everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to pay
You can't think small like that
Hey, you still feature musicians Fridays and Saturdays
At least they work for their meals
What about Harry's daughter as an extra added attraction
She'll belt out five or six showtunes -- two sets a night -- and it won't cost you a fucking nickel
How come
Star Showcase
Let me handle setting that up
And when she eventually goes on Letterman, she'll announce 'm currently appearing over at Mario's fine supper club
Right over  she'll say that, Mario
You're full of shit
You know that
All bullshit
That's just a vulgar word for
(placing an arm around him) Mario, you can't hurt my feelings
Even when  was a kid and they hurled certain invectives my way, it never bothered me
Other kids would fall apart if anybody called them a fucking name
Me,  just loved the attention
'Shit-for- brains' -- that's what the bigger kids named me
And  answered to it
Hey, 'shit-for brains' reporting for duty
Everybody loved me for that
could take abuse
After a while,  kind of wore them down
There was nothing more they could say to me
So they stopped
kind of missed it
'm sorry  even talked to you
'll bet your loving wife put you up to this
She saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street
But  don't hold it against you personally -- you still serve up superior veal chop
(entering phone booth) Now  got urgent business to conduct, Mario
He slides the booth closed in Mario's face
The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he goes up the block
, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and dials
Hello, Mavis, sweet creature
' Where have you been
Do you think have nothing to do but wait around for you to call
'm only a few minutes late, loveliest individual on earth
' Stu, 'm so lonely
When can  see you
Good news in that arena
Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday
You know how dedicated she is
By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep
We'll have both our days and certain nights
Not to mention when they take the show on the road
' How long is that for
Four to five weeks -- minimum
' Maybe  should quit my job so we can be together full time
wouldn't do that
' Sometimes  think if  have to give one more fucking manicure
That's how you met me
' never saw a worse set of nails
Bit right down to the quick
'm much better groomed since you've been looking after me
' 'm glad you admit it
Even Kelly remarked on it when first met her
' She could care less how you look
She's only interested in pushing her own career
Some wife you're stuck with
The marriage is not without its compensations
Do you imagine could afford that apartment on what 'm earning
Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity
Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out
And one thing you can't expect from your clients is loyalty
They get a couple of bad notices, they dump you
Goodbye
' Don't go
wasn't saying goodbye to you was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month's notice
conservative businessman now stands outside the booth waiting to use it
He deliberately glances at his watch a few times to demonstrate his impatience
This bothers Stu who slides the booth open a crack
(yelling) What
Is your watch busted
It's twenty after eleven and 'm gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction
So get out of my face
He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the gentleman who gives up and departs
Sorry, honey
There will be no further interruption
' Why must you always be calling me from some booth
On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings
And  don't want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either
She gets the mail
She looks these items over
Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is
' Then she suspects something
It's only because her last husband, the choreographer, ran around on her
She can't get that out of her head
That's how she caught onto him
The phone bills
' She hasn't developed much skill at holding a man
You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is
She was so sure  was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you thought 'd feel all guilty about it -- but  guess it hasn't kicked in yet
(beat) Still,  wouldn't do anything to hurt her
Basically, Kelly's a decent individual
' What about hurting me
Like last time
Hurt
You were glad to be rid of me
' For a while  was, 'til  took stock of what was around
You're the lesser of many evils
That's about the nicest thing you ever said
' 'll have it engraved
We've been up front with each other from the beginning
Let's keep it that way
How about a drink
Say seven o'clock
The Monkey Bar
' Meet me in front
don't like walking in there unescorted
Yeah, you're great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls
' It happens all the time lately
And wear that short black number bought you from Bendel's
' Again
don't know if it's me or that dress you like
Have a good day
Make plenty of tips
And leave the whole evening open
She thinks 've got Knicks tickets
He hangs up
Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and dials
Someone answers on the first ring
(
) Speak
(into cellular) It's your boy Stuart
When was the last time  called you for a favor
(
) The column is already full
just need one line
Anybody you wanna say was seen dining out at Mario's Stromboli restaurant
(
) Maybe you don't hear so good got no space for you
Who's asking any favors
'm offering reciprocal information
(
) Since when were you ever a reliable source
Check it out
Tony award-winning producer Willie Beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence at the San Remo
got it from the doorman
(
) got it from their maid yesterday
It's in the paper today
Or don't you bother to read my shit
Louis, my intentions were entirely honorable
(
) 'll drop your item in sometime next week
If you promise not to call me for a month
He hangs up
Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone and tucks it away
Then he starts to vacate the booth
The phone rings
And rings
Curious, he picks up the receiver
There's a voice on the other end of the line
Don't even think about leaving that booth
What
Stay exactly where you are and listen carefully
've got a heavy day, mister
You know better than to disobey me
don't know you at all
Are you absolutely sure
Who is this
Someone who's watching you
Get lost
Love the gray suit
That red and black tie makes a nice combination
Stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel
He looks around nervously
Where
Where are you
Closer than you think
don't see you
There are any number of windows
Check them out
Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise buildings and hotels
Okay, you had your little joke
'm not sufficiently amused
Not yet
We have more to talk about
Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him not to
Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice
Do me a favor
Call up somebody else
But it's you 'm interested in
You know how many people use that booth every day
Why don't you tell me
Better than two-hundred people on average
Is that what you do
Count them
What else do  have to do
It's interesting watching people
Trying to guess who they are
And what they're up to
What are you -- a shut-in of some kind
You might say that
can't go out
might be seen
Somebody's looking for you
Desperately
The cops
Not yet
The ex-wife
What'd you do -- run out on child support
What kind of man do you think  am
Frankly,  could care less
You had your fun
Now goodbye
It's not in your best interests to hang up on me
That would make me angry
Isn't that just too bad
For you
There's ten million names in the phonebook
Pester somebody else
never talk to people  can't see
need to study their reactions
Alright, bullshit artist, what am doing right now
Scratching your forehead with your left hand
Now you're brushing your hair back
Okay, okay, you got me in your scrutiny
So what
So let's talk
Only  got nothing to say
Oh, you will
You'll do a lot of talking before this conversation is over
And it'll only end when want it to
Is that a fact
Well if you watch closely, you will see me hang up
don't think you will
Why not
interest you
Why should  be interested in some creep who gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths
But you're not a stranger, Stu
The sound of his own name sends a chill through him
Who put you up to this
You were my very own selection
Why me in particular
Because you're so afraid
Ha
What've  got to be afraid of
Just about everything
You have so much to hide
How do you figure that
Why else would a man with a perfectly good cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth
That's my business
've made it mine
All of a sudden 'm required to give explanations to you
In explicit detail
What is this
Some kind of candid camera gag
Or like that thing on where the cab driver is taping what goes on in the back seat
This is not showbusiness, my friend
This is reality
Your reality
Not mine, you lowlife fuck
Stu, you'll be made to suffer for your attitude, so let's dispense with the vulgarities
Now you're threatening me
Fuck you
Could that be any clearer
You're only making it easier for me to do you harm
Oh yeah
Right
Can you see how 'm trembling
You will be
Shit, this is a new one
Fucking threatening calls in a goddam phone booth
When are you going to start with the heavy breathing
'm not the degenerate
You are, Stu
You don't know anything about me
Infinitely more than you know about me
Like what
Like the number you dialed when you first entered the booth
How would you know that
'm watching through a scope and could clearly read the buttons you pushed
have another extension here by the window
Shall  dial that same number back for you
Would that convince you
Stu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall buildings that surround the street corner
' up at thousands of windows
The Voice could be coming from anywhere
Let's see who's on the other end of the line
Don't
Too late
(beat) It's already ringing
'll hold the receiver up so you can listen in
Stu can hear the beeping as the other line rings
Then Mavis' voice can be heard answering
Stu listens helplessly
' Hello
Well, hello
' Who is this
Someone who's really tight with your boyfriend -- who just called you from his favorite phone booth
' You know Stu
Stu
Oh,  know him better than anyone
What he does -- how he thinks
How he lies
' Who the hell is this
Stu is listening in
He knows what we're both saying
' Stu
Is that true
Are you there
He doesn't feel like talking
(shouts) Mavis
Just hang up the goddam phone
She can't hear you, Stu
Only me
(a pause) Mavis, 'm afraid Stu hasn't been totally honest with you
But then he can't be honest with anyone, can he
' What's your name
To whom am speaking
You've never heard of me, Mavis
He doesn't want you to know exist
He wishes  didn't exist
But there isn't anything he can do about that
(beat) Still there, Stu
All you can do is listen
Mavis -- the guy is a fucking nutcase
Hang the fuck up
She doesn't want to
She wants to know all about us
Don't you, Mavis
' Did his wife put you up to this
That bitch, Kelly
Oh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly
My very next call
(yells) He doesn't know my wife
Don't tell him anything else
Outside the booth, a huge, heavy-set black woman in a too tight dress, now appears with the clear desire to use the phone
Her name is
She taps on the glass
Could you hurry it along
Stu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass with hostility
Stu has no inclination to deal with anybody else
He's too distracted by the madness happening over the telephone
Can you hear me, Mavis
Keep your big mouth shut
Is that any way to talk to a woman you love
(beat) Mavis, is he always that abusive to you
' You're getting me all upset don't know who you are or how you know all this -- find out things -- from watching people and listening to them
' Just what is your relationship to Stu
That's all  want to know
Well, what do you think
' Answer me, goddam it
Well alright
Stu and  are -- longtime companions
pair
Two of a kind
Closer than close
Peas in a pod
Spoons in a drawer
' You pervert
That, too
Don't believe a word of it
It's all lies
Too late, Stu
She already believes it
' You can tell that scumbag never to bother me again
He won't care
He'll still have me
It's not true
do care
From outside the booth, there's a louder rapping on the glass
Felicia really wants in
Get done in there, mister
got me an important call
Go away
Shit  will
Finish up
She continues to rap on the glass as Stu tries to focus on the two-way phone call
Why don't you tell me what you think of us
' You're both disgusting
That's what he said about you
Well, if Stu didn't have the balls to come out and tell you the truth, felt it was my responsibility to clear the air
Goodbye now, Mavis
Thanks for your time
(the phone clicks off; we hear only a dial tone) Back to you again, Stu
You total asshole
How could you do that
Speaking of females, that woman hovering outside the booth -- may as well tell her that you'll be on the line forever
Like hell  will
'm ready for you to take out your cellular and phone home
And this time, 'll listen in
There's no chance of that
Or should  call Kelly and make up something totally outrageous
You must realize by now  have a vivid imagination
You don't know our phone number
Are you absolutely sure
may have been watching you on a regular basis
Keeping track of all the numbers  see you dial
And 'm supposed to believe that
've put a great deal of preparation into this -- prior to actually saying hello
Now do you want to dial 832-7165 -- or should The sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even more than the earlier mention of his name
What are you going to tell her
You'll do the talking
What am  supposed to say
Try telling her the truth
Look,  don't want to hurt Kelly
She's always there for me
It's just my nature to have a little 'strange' on the side
It doesn't mean shit
But you still find it necessary
Kind of like having a beautiful home
With everything you ever dreamed of
But you still need that vacation now and then
Some nice hotel room with a great view
Maybe a pool
Only you wouldn't want to spend more than a few days in any hotel
Eventually, you want to go back to your home and all your stuff
You're real glad to check out
Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel
'm sure they'll both appreciate that explanation
You're ruining my fucking life, you sonofabitch
Didn't  warn you about calling me names
It makes me vindictive
What else can you do to me
We haven't even begun
She's not home
She went out
'll bet she's back
Now hold the cellular up where  can see it -- so  can be certain you don't misdial on me
(pause) little higher and to your left
Now  have it in perfect view
Dial slowly
More violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black lady outside
If you got you a cell phone, how come you taking up the whole fucking booth
This here's an emergency
There's another booth on the next block
It's busted
Every damn phone on Eighth Avenue is busted but this one
Well, 'm not through
Go in a restaurant or someplace, but get away from me
'm gonna pull you out of that booth and snatch you ballheaded
She tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu jams it shut, right on her hand
You assaulted my person
Let me hear from your lawyer
You're hear alright
'm coming back
And your ass better not be around
She stalks off obviously in search of assistance
Good work, Stu
Now let me see you dial
Tuck the receiver under your chin and dial your remote
'm doing it
He punches in the digits
The phone rings -- and rings
told you she was out
Let it ring
Then a girl's voice is heard
' Shepard residence
Hold it close to the receiver so can hear
' Hello
Honey, it's me
' What's taking you so long thought we were having some lunch at Mario's
Change of plan
We're not eating in that dump any more
' How come
The Health Department gave them a '' rating -- that's how come
Here 'm trying to put the place on the map and he fucks it all up with a major roach problem
' That's disgusting
Okay, 'll fix us a sandwich
Where are you now
Just in a phone booth
' How come
The caller  says you're on your cellular
Oh yeah,  am
' But you're also in some phone booth
Explain that one, Stu
only stepped in because the traffic was so loud outside
' Well just hurry on back
Tell her you can't
Not for a few minutes
' Are you sure you're alone
hear somebody in the background
The guy in the next booth
He's got a bad connection and he's hollering his fool head off
You've got an answer for everything
love you, baby
' Do you
You know that
' Stu -- who was that man
What man
' Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago -- just after you went out
don't understand
' This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone -- because you'd be calling me in a few minutes -- from a booth
And said what would he be doing in any phone booth
And what did this guy say
' He said you'd be making phone calls
What else
Making calls is part of my business
' To whom
Clients
People
Planting items like  do
' Women
Once in a while one of them could be a woman
just called "Elaine's" and talked to her to see who was in there last night
' You know exactly what  mean
You're not going to start that shit again
' just feel something is wrong
What could be wrong
' The way you sound
You don't sound like yourself
Yeah
Who do  sound like
' Someone who's scared
There's fear in your voice like 've never heard before
See, Stu
Kelly agrees with me
' want you to come back home
Now
told you
In a while
' No
want you here now
In case he calls back,  don't want to answer again
Why should he call back
' feel like he's going to
You're the one that sounds frightened
And of nobody
' He's not a nobody
He knows about us
You're not telling me all he said
What are you holding back
' can't discuss it on the phone
Just get over here
She hangs up
(into pay phone) Why did you do that to her
She never did you any harm
How would you know
Everybody does harm to somebody
And then they try their best to forget it
Maybe me -- but not her
Whatever 've done, there's no reason to take it out on her
Suppose that's the only way  can get to you
You claim you love her
Yeah,  do
You don't even love yourself
But Kelly
would never hurt
Still you have to uphold your status as an honorary asshole
Listen, 've treated all my women decent
never laid a hand on any of them, even when provoked
And always let them down easy
(beat) 'm not ready to let Kelly go
Maybe  never will be
What if she dumps you first
What's the odds she's already taken up with somebody
One day soon you'll come home and find her gone along with the  player and the 'm not gonna let you mind-fuck me all day
That's it
This call is ended
Not until  say it is
What happens if  hang up
You don't really want to find out
'm dying to hear this
What the fuck can you do about it -- up in your fucking high window with your goddam binoculars
never indicated  had binoculars
said  had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that brought you up so close  could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this morning
Oh -- while you're at it, have a look up my ass
may very well do that, Stu
In the meantime, think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it
What
You mean
like a rifle
high-powered
30 calibre bolt action Remington 700 with a carbon one modification and a state of the art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope
And you're in the cross hairs, Stu
'm supposed to believe that
There's only one way  can prove it to you
Hang up the receiver and find out
At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine
And you're just going to kill me for no reason
For plenty of reasons
Because you hung up
For years  hated people hanging up on me
Ex-girlfriends
Women  didn't even know
Prospective employers
get hung up on all the time
You get used to it
Or else you don't
worked for months getting people to switch to -- being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day
The ones that cursed me out for invading their privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply
Then why didn't you go after one of them
Maybe you are one of them
Hey,  have worked in a boiler room myself peddling "Term Life
" Would never be rude to a fellow salesperson
Can you feel it on you now
The heat of it
'm moving the strike zone down to your stomach area
Now 'm raising it up again
Directly above the chest cavity -- sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear
Shit --  do feel it
Tell me where 'm going with it now
Across my forehead -- now back where it was before
'm amazed how you can do that
You're amazingly accurate
(beat) Now  know what you're thinking
If  drop down on the floor of the booth and flatten myself out
No, 'm not thinking that
Oh yes you are
Can  crawl out using the booth as a shield
Can crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away
The shattering glass may cut me, but it'll only be superficial
Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive
No
You will
know you will
If  just cooperate
Where is it now
Think and feel for the warm spot
Below the shoulder
Which one
The right shoulder
Remarkable how we're in tune
You're doing far better than the others
What others
What do you mean
(no reply) You said 'others
' (finally) 'm sure you read about the Italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth
saw it on the news
And where are we now
Oh, God
Forty-fifth and Eighth
What else do you remember about that killing
don't know
Try
He was gunned down
And nobody was caught
And they didn't even bother to take his wallet or his watch
or anything
Now you know why
It wasn't a robbery
What did he do
He hung up -- so  disconnected him permanently
Please -- don't do it to me
You got no reason to do it to me
Don't give me reason
'm not looking to
Tell me what you want
Tell me about your job
What's to tell
'm in Public Relations
They used to call us "flacks
"  Now we're media consultants
What do you do, exactly
Plant items in the paper and on the tube
More important sometimes, keep stuff out
What've you kept out
One of my people got nailed for indecent exposure
managed for the cops to use his real name instead of his stage name so nobody picked up on it
You saved the little deviate's ass, didn't you
He's in major therapy now
swear he is
You must hang with some major celebrities
Journalists, newscasters -- those types
'm real close with Larry King
And the "Hard Copy" people
Could you get him down here
Larry King
Why would he want to come here
Because you asked him to
He comes from Atlanta
Well, who could you get
don't know
Wolf Blitzer
Probably not
Regis
Definitely no chance
You'd be offering them an exclusive newsbreak
'm talking about more than one homicide
How many
don't answer questions
ask them
gotta have the facts
They might not believe me
My record isn't too good when it comes to hard news
You're not considered a reliable source
On a divorce or separation, maybe
Or who's gay, or who isn't gay any more
kind of specialize in that kind of material
mean  could probably get you Joe Franklin
How about Cindy Adams
might have a shot
Are you familiar with Liz Smith
Do you know her number
Want  should call her
How much can  say
Tell her you're in direct touch with a killer who's willing to speak honestly if she shows up here alone and without notifying the authorities
She usually likes to have a celebrity involved
If you had an actor or a sports figure held prisoner instead of me, there'd be better odds she's come
Then lie
Pick a celebrity and put them in the booth
Let's see
Who does she like
Who couldn't be reached to deny it
'm anxious to see you in action
Don't keep me waiting
Stu uses his cellular again
(dialing) Sometimes you only get her service
(into cellular) Hi -- Stu Shepard
Put me through
've got hard news for her
can only talk to her directly
But say it regards -- Liza
Liza
That was imaginative
(into cellular) No,  can't call back
'll have to lay in on somebody else
Alright, but  can't hang on long
(to pay phone) She's coming on
(to cellular) Liz, hello
Sure 'll make it brief
Killing two weeks ago in the theatre district
Turn out a sniper did the job
Yeah, a sniper with a rifle
Now he's got another victim lined up
Not just your anonymous New Yorker, but Liza
Now you can't call anybody or Ms
Minelli's dead meat and so am
She's hostage in a phone booth right in the sniper's sights
But he says he'll talk to you and let her walk
know it'll take balls to do this, but you're a fine and courageous newspaper woman
There's a click
Silence
Hello
Hello
(to pay phone) Either she's on her way over or she doesn't believe me
You weren't particularly convincing
didn't really believe in what was saying
Because you don't really believe my Remington is pointed at you
do
You're ninety percent sure
At least ninety-five percent, easy
Let me erase all doubt
No
Don't shoot
Control yourself, Stu
Glance down at your chest
What do you see
Oh, my God
dot
fucking red dot
tiny red dot now moves across Stu's chest
Like you've seen in the movies
The laser dot
Just before some poor bastard always gets blown away
Usually a supporting player
That lovely but by now generic special effect of the bullet piercing the forehead
The tiny red laser dot dances around Stu's chest and stomach -- the jumps up and remains between his eyes
This takes all the guesswork out of it
You know exactly where to expect it before  even tighten my finger on the trigger
Don't tighten
Don't even tickle that fucking finger
How about Geraldo
He's run his ass off to get in on this
You're talking about the old Geraldo
Look,  can try and reach cable
They're hungry
'm disappointed
wanted to go first class
They do a great job
They'll haul a whole crew over to cover your surrender "live
" never expressed interest in giving myself up
There are so many other phone booths in the city
'm just getting warmed up
That's entirely up to you
Your choice
'm just trying to set you up with the proper communicator
(beat) suppose Liza wasn't strong enough
should've said Madonna
Now you're being creative
Outside the booth, the angry black woman has returned, bringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named  who looks like he means business
He slams his fist against the glass, nearly shattering it
Drag your baggy butt out of that booth
We got business to conduct out of there
He been in there all day
'm not through
Hang up that receiver or 'll make you eat the fucking thing
Fuck off or 'll call a cop
Do you see one around here
What you think 'm gonna be doing while you're waiting for a prowl car to get assigned
'm about to cut you a second asshole if you don't vacate those premises
can't
He's got him a fucking cellular
What's he need to be on our booth for
can't explain it
'm not interested in your explanations even if you had any
He withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesn't open it -- yet
If  flick this,  use it
'll make it worth your while to go away
How much do you want
Make me an offer
Thirty dollars
It's all 've got in cash
Take it and go
You're offering to rent my phone booth
For how long
don't know
For as long as it takes
What's so special in there
Do you want the money
Is that a genuine Rolex you've got on
Come on, man
That's my good watch
That's what it's gonna take
Then here
Take the damn thing
And the thirty
Take it all
The pimp pockets the watch and the money
But doesn't go away
Now 'm satisfied
But you still got to deal with Felicia here believe you spoke harshly to her
apologize
And did her some injury
An accident
'm sorry about that, too
The man don't sound like he means it
agree
(to Stu) Why don't you hang up a minute so we can discuss this matter at length
It's long distance
can't lose the call --  might not get them back
Do  have to rip that fucking phone out of there
That wouldn't be a good idea
(into pay phone) Would it
Not at all
gave you everything 've got
That pinky ring looks attractive
Felicia might like that
It might fit
You want the ring, you've got the ring
If  can get it off
can get it off you
Leon reaches in and grabs Stu's ring hand
Let go of me
It's coming loose
There
(he tosses it) Okay, Felicia, with my deepest apologies
Goodbye now
What's really going on in that booth -- that escapes the naked eye
Nothing
Talk
That's all
That your connection on the end of the line
Or are you dealing
This has nothing to do with drugs
You gotta be high on something to willingly divest yourself of your valuables -- just to maintain occupancy of a fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night
knew it smelled for some reason
You look like you're ready to piss yourself
Because  am
Maybe if the city provided decent public toilets, folks wouldn't relieve themselves in the subway stations and phone booths
'll take it up with the mayor
Next thing you know you're gonna claim we mugged you -- took your billfold and watch
No, you didn't
It was a fair and equitable deal
You had territorial rights to this booth and  paid a license fee
Fair is fair
Now leave me in peace
You sure you're alright
(to Felicia) He don't look well
Kind of pale
Even for a white man
Jaundice they calls it
Probably advanced liver trouble
(to Stu) If it's cirrhosis, you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick
Thanks for your interest but 'm in perfect health
So how come his hand is shaking
The man is cracking up
Lookit the sweat pouring off the sonofabitch
That's one sick mother you started up with, Leon
Me
You're the one that brought me over and exposed me to all his germs
'm terminal, okay
Now can close the booth and continue my conversation
'm worried now it might be catching
All that money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and incurable disease
Fine
Give it back
What good's that
We done touched it
Well go wash your hands
Come on now
Own up to what you're carrying
Is it some of that sexually transmitted shit
Cause in that case, we can relax
'm sick of you
Now get out of my face
Here we's being solicitous as to your health and you respond by heaping abuse
Whip his arrogant ass
Leon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu's jacket
Touch me and 'll throw up on you
At the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly
It looks like a stalemate
Stu isn't vacating the booth and Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further
He does indeed look sick
(into pay phone) You can see what 'm up against here
Want me to get rid of him for you
What do you have in mind
'll think of something
Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp
Leon doesn't realize it's there
The hooker behind him has no way of seeing it
But to Stu, there's no way to miss it
He reacts
God -- no
(into pay phone) Don't
It's not necessary
You asked for my help
'll handle it myself
You're not doing too well
can settle it in a fraction of a second
Shall  demonstrate
No
(to Leon) For your own safety, mister, just walk away
Now the man is turning aggressive
issuing threats upon my person
You're making this happen
If you don't hang up and step out, 'm about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it
Reluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself
He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its foundation
And the rickety booth is not too sturdy
It starts rocking back and forth
Stu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing
(into pay phone) This isn't my fault
(shouts) Stop that
But Leon continues rocking the booth
It won't come loose -- so in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass
The glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to shield himself from the slivers
(into pay phone) The guy's insane
Only one way to stop a mad dog
Give me permission
can't
If he forces you out of that booth, 've told you what to expect
You or him, Stu
Leon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after another -- as Stu cowers inside
Don't cut yourself, honey
crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth and its occupant
Looks like the fucker is comin' loose
Shove it out into the oncoming traffic
What'll you bet the bus could knock that fifty feet
The booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone
(into pay phone) Hello
Hello
(with heavy static) You're breaking up
We're about to be cut off
can't help it
That counts as a hang-up
No
It can't
That's not fair
can still make him stop
Say the word
Can you hear me
Yes
Stu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues to barrage the booth with punches and kicks
Then Leon recoils, staggers a step backward
He doesn't realize he's been shot
There's been no sound of gunfire
Perhaps a silencer was used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary discharge
Leon looks confused at first
His ladyfriend has no idea he's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people who've assembled on the corner
Even Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the wound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest
He isn't assaulting the booth anymore
He's trying to keep his balance
He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for support -- only a few inches from Stu's face
The blood runs down the side of the booth
(into pay phone) You did it
You said 'yes
' said 'Yes,  can hear you
'  Not 'Yes -- kill the motherfucker
' Don't try to renege on it
was following orders
You're twisting it all around didn't do this
Meanwhile, Leon leans upright against the booth
Then his legs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees
Felicia runs up beside him
She sees the blood
warned you not to cut yourself
(to crowd) Look at all that blood
He must've hit an artery
She screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement
Now his chest wound is evident
Oh, Jesus
What is that
Talk to me
What happened
The crowd tightens around the fallen body
Street people who are fascinated but not shocked
Gunshot
Yeah
Sucking chest wound right over the heart
Somebody call an ambulance
Call the meatwagon
He's fucked up
You shut the fuck up
Her focus turns to Stu in the battered phone booth
Why did you do that to him
didn't
(to crowd) You all saw it
He shot my man without no provocation
Yeah
Pumped one right into him at close range
How could
don't even have a gun
Look
Everybody get the fuck back
They shoot one -- then they shoot everybody in sight
Kill all the fucking witnesses
The crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner -- out of immediate range
Come back
You've got to see -- 'm not armed
Only Felicia remains, leaning over the pimp's body, staring helplessly
Hang up and dial 911
Get a doctor
can't hang up
That's what this is all about
You're gonna stand there and let him die
(takes out cellular) can use this
(he dials) Emergency
Yes
There's been a shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth -- on the corner
man is down
What's the difference who  am don't want to be involved
(shouts) That's bullshit
He's the shooter
You're talking to the shooter
Stu quickly disconnects the cellular
That wasn't nice
Go ahead -- make a fucking run for it
hope they gun you down -- like you did him
'm not going anyplace
'm staying right here in this booth
(into pay phone) Unless you give me permission
You're attracting a lot of attention
suppose when the police get there, you'll accuse me
What do you expect me to say
That's up to you
But any mention of me will not be appreciated
You mean
You won't even get to finish your sentence
Oh look, that little red dot is dancing around all over you again
You saw how quickly it can happen
And how accurate  can be
They can't blame me -- 'm not armed
Who's going to believe that
With all those witnesses to the contrary
They can see with their own eyes
Not far away, we hear the  of   drawing closer
Remember to leave me out of it
How can
You'll put the proper spin on it
Isn't that your specialty
Feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of truth -- and making it totally believable
This isn't a story
This is real
This is murder
If you'd only dealt with the man reasonably, shown him some respect, this might not have been necessary
gave him my money, my watch
But not your respect
Which is what he required of you
He was a fucking thief
And now he's a fucking dead thief
Do you feel better about that
don't feel a bit guilty
This is all your doing
Now you're being disrespectful of me
You never learn
Your job is to deal with people -- but you're not good at it
Hey, 'm not taking any more criticism from some lunatic sniper who gets his kicks killing strangers
You keep insisting 'm a stranger
Probably because you don't recognize the voice
But there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice
might not even be a man
might be one of those many women you've almost totally forgotten
One who doesn't forgive easily
One who wants to watch you squirm
You're a man
know you're a man
Women don't kill with telescopic rifles
They stab you
You sound so sure of that
But you've never provoked any man as much as have the women in your life
And so many of them, Stu
(a beat) Do you even remember their names
've got no time to rehash my whole life
Oh my God
The cops are here
Police cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue
Traffic has suddenly been shut down
Prowl cars have now blocked the streets
: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective without intercuts
Half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns
(pointing) That's him -- in the booth
He's got a gun
As she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body out into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue
It's a bright afternoon
In the distance, we hear the maddening  of uptown traffic that is now being rerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their simplest form of protest
It's a discordant concert that echoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels
As the cops surround the booth -- at a distance
(into bullhorn) Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised
(into phone) They're ordering me to come out
can see that
Ignore them
What if they open fire
They probably won't
Look across on the east side of the street
Do you see the tourist with the home video camera
' distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner behind the police cars
Some tourist is capturing the event on video
What about him
He's going to keep the police on their best behavior
So long as you don't take what could be interpreted as hostile action, you'll be safe
You call this safe
Six cops with guns pointed my way
You want me to reduce them to three -- or two
Absolutely no more shooting
Now is that clear
You can always change your mind
(with bullhorn) You know the drill
Hands clasped behind the back of your neck -- moving slowly -- step out of the booth
If we see any sign of a weapon, we will respond
(shouts) You won't, because there isn't any
(bullhorn) repeat
Raise your hands
can't
'm on a phone call
Now a black   arrives and takes full command of the situation
You have thirty seconds to comply
told you
'm busy
Come back later
Very good, Stu
The cops take cover behind parked cars, keeping Stu clearly in their sights
He has no place to hide
He's in the battered phone booth in plain view from all sides
You've been given an order
The Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer
: We remain in   of the cops -- always from Stu's
But we can hear their voices and all that is said as if they were in close up
It has an odd, unreal and distancing effect
We're dealing with a mental case
He's looking for us to kill him
Well he's not getting his wish
In the center of the street, an ambulance pulls up and a team of medics jump out
They rush to Leon's body
(Again we hear their voices close, even though visually they are far off
) Tell me he's gonna be alright
Step aside
Let us look at him
The medics push her aside -- then examine the victim
He's Nothing we can do
Don't touch the body
They'll need it to mark the crime scene
Far across the street, the Captain confers with his subordinates
They are small figures on the screen but we hear them sharply
Same corner as two weeks ago
Maybe it's more than a coincidence
Cover me
need to talk to him
You've got your vest on
What do you think
The Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the phone booth
He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away
'm not armed
Neither am
Yeah, sure
need to know what happened
Can't talk about it
Sure you can
My name's Ramey
Captain Ed Ramey
What's yours
Look,  don't want to be friends
You look like you need a friend
Tell him you've already got a friend
(yells) 've got a friend, okay
Is that who you're talking to on the phone
None of your business
When somebody gets shot, it becomes my business
Let's not have anybody else killed
want to hear your side of it
've got no side of it
Don't worry, Stu
've got him fixed right in my sights
won't let him hurt you
Has this happened to you before
The need to hurt someone
To put a bullet in them
You won't believe anything  say
Try me
couldn't shoot anybody
'm not armed
You're right
don't believe you
What's that bulge in your pants pocket
That
That's my cellular
cellular
Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls
Do you want to see it
Don't reach for it, mister
Then how can  show it to you
don't need to see it
know what's there
All these witnesses saw you use it on him
From behind a parked car, a   calls out
(hollers) Damn straight
Another , crouched in a doorway, joins in
(shouts) Yeah
Shot him down like a dog
They're all lying
Nobody saw it because it didn't happen
man is dead but it didn't happen
Not on account of me
This is like some bad dream
You're walking through a bad dream and you can't wake up
Do you want to wake up
'm trying
And in this dream, you killed that man
He was bothering you so you iced him
No
Then who did
Don't tell him, Stu
Or it'll be the last thing he ever hears
His blood will be on your hands
(to Ramey) don't know
But you saw it happen
Yes
You were the closest one to him
You must've seen who did it
No
We're trying to be honest with each other, aren't we
Not necessarily
'm losing patience with this cop
(into phone) 'm handling this
Who do you keep talking to on the phone
Nobody
My psychiatrist
Excellent, Stu
You're getting good at this
What's this doctor's name
It's important we know
He says not to tell you
It's privileged information
Damn good reply
Now you're having fun
Admit it
Whatever you say
Playing it so close to the edge
'll bet you've never felt so alive
That's how  feel when look through the sight and select somebody
The Captain begins advancing a few steps closer
respect your right to privacy
've been to therapy myself
The department provides it
know it's not good form for a cop to be admitting that, but
Tell him not to come any closer
Stop right there
Back up a few steps
Back where you were
If it makes you more comfortable
Tell him to read you your rights
want you to read me my rights and stop asking questions
Al least tell me your first name
It's my right not to have any name
No gun and no name
You're a highly underprivileged person
Demand a lawyer
And get me a lawyer, too
want a lawyer brought down here to negotiate my surrender
Brilliant, Stu
Keep winging it
It'll be hard to find a lawyer willing to risk his life
But if you hand over the gun
How can  when you won't let me take it out
We'll take it out for you -- as soon as you exit the booth with your hands raised and
(interrupts) Now we're back to that again
It's always "Get out of the booth
' 'You can't stay in the booth
' Well,  like it in the fucking booth
It's my whole world now
It's my booth and 'm never coming out
We're not about to force you because there could be a miscalculation and then we'd never find out why this happened
Why is it so important to know
The guy is dead
Isn't that enough
Knowing isn't going to make him alive again
So who gives a fuck
It's what makes the job interesting
Finding out why
Something drove you to do this
You didn't go out today expecting this to happen
It was a nice day
You were out for a walk
And then suddenly it all changed
All  wanted was to make a phone call
One lousy phone call for thirty-five fucking cents
Careful, Stu
Don't volunteer too much
You got some bad news on that call
The worst
Something that pushed you over the edge
And 've been falling ever since
Time to land
When you hit bottom, you die
'm your safety net
If  tell you what you want to know -- you'll die, too
Something about the implied threat sends a chill through Captain Ramey
The Captain's head as seen through a telescopic sight
Ramey could be dead in an instant
: The only time we deviate from Stu's perspective is when we see the sniper's  through his scope
, the detective fifteen feet away
Ramey decides to back off momentarily
'll go see about that lawyer
Now that's a good idea
The Captain withdraws back across the street
He's lucky
had him centered in my cross hairs
really had to restrain myself
We hear the approach of a helicopter
Stu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above the tall buildings
It's not the police
It's the media
You're news, Stuart
The helicopters circle above
You've never gotten this much press for any of your clients
'm making you a famous person
They're just hoping for coverage of me dying in the gutter
Their presence is putting the police on their continued best behavior
Those cops are just looking for any excuse
Then don't give them one
Then, as if on cue, Stu's cellular phone in his pocket starts ringing
But he can't allows himself to reach for it
To do so might cause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun
It rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth
Drowned out by the traffic horns, the static from the police radios and the newly introduced sound of television helicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage of the event below
Who could it be
Kelly
She was worried about me
Stu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think he's going for a gun
Maybe she's seen this on television
It must be on every channel by now
Breaking news
She doesn't watch daytime
One of the neighbors could've alerted her
The cell phone keeps ringing, almost drowned out by the sound of helicopters circling overhead
Why are you saying this
You want me to reach in my pocket so you can see them open fire
That's an unwarranted accusation and very unbecoming in light of the good advice 've given in the past
Have  ever steered you wrong
God -- how 'd love to hear her voice
It might even be worth it
She's insistent, isn't she
The cellular won't stop ringing
If she knows 'm in trouble, she won't give up
Probably glued to the  by now
'm watching coverage on two stations now
Channel surfing
(pause) Well, there you are on two and four and five
Not any decent angles on you, though, stuck inside there
The cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is maddening
Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide the cops with an excuse to open fire
But if you'd take one or two steps outside and look up,  think they could get a clear picture of you
You said 'm not allowed to leave the booth
Finally the cell phone stops ringing
might be willing to bend the rules and let you enjoy your moment of fame
Set the phone down without hanging up
and take a step or two outside
Just for a minute
Then come straight back in or 'll be forced to provide 'live' coverage that should rival the historic Zapruder footage
(beat) Nothing like an exploding head to excite viewer interest
No, thanks
'll stay where  am
It was only a suggestion
Since you're convinced 'm going to plug you anyway, it can't matter much
If you shoot me, you give yourself away
Even without a muffler, they'd never hear the report with all this noise
Afterwards, it'd take them a good ten minutes to realize you weren't plugged by some overzealous officer
Then they'll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down here and do the  team's job for them
You expected them to come
You had this all worked out
write the scenario and you all play your parts -- as directed
The damned cell phone starts beeping again
Stu fights the temptation to grab for it and hear Kelly's voice for one last time
Poor Kelly
What she must be going through
Why don't you tell her how you feel about her
'd never get the words out
Not with fifteen or twenty rounds in me
You can't be certain they'd fire
They'd see it was only a phone
They wouldn't wait to see
The cellular ringing continues jangling Stu's nerves
Why doesn't she hang up
Then Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across the street behind the police barricades
Countless faces rubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of violence that would end with him face down dead on the pavement
And in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him female, quite pretty
even in tears
It's Kelly
(We see her only in   -- a distant figure in bright green jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd
) It's her
She's not calling me
She's over there
Is she
The blonde girl in the green jacket
Can't miss her
Very attractive, isn't she
She must've heard all the commotion and come downstairs
The cellular is still ringing
It's somebody else who knows my cell number
(beat) It's you
You continue to impress
Why is it so important that they kill me
Because that's how  win
This time you won't
If you want me dead, you'll have to do it yourself
Either way  can't lose
It's all a game to you -- because you're incapable of feelings
You're not even human
pride myself on that
What's so great about being human
It's the lowest form of life on this planet and 've taken it upon myself to thin the herd
quit
'm not answering back any more
won't hang up but 'm not playing
There's silence now between them
Stu
Stu, don't be that way
You're taking the pleasure out of it
Stu doesn't take the bait
He remains absolutely silent
stalemate has been reached
clustered behind an emergency vehicle
The Sergeant brings a civilian to meet Captain Ramey of the  unit
The newcomer wears coveralls stenciled "&
"  (Although they are very far away, we hear their voices close up as they come into sharper focus
) This here's Helfand, of New York Telephone
Glad to help out
Have you got the number of that booth
Sure do
Can you tap into that call
It can be done
But not without a warrant
You could be violating this psycho's civil rights
Especially if he's on the line with his fucking psychiatrist
Shit
don't want to blow this on a technicality
Tracing the call isn't any violation, is it
As long as we don't listen in
We remain in   of the  as they continue in heated conversation
(to Helfand) Okay, we've got to know who he's talking to and their current location
That  can handle
As long as they keep the circuit open
need the number and an address to go with it
Helfand rushes off
At the corner, we can glimpse him entering a phone company utility truck parked on Forty-Fifth Street
Stu remains tight lipped and silent, refusing to give his tormentor the conversation he so craves
Stuart, my friend
Do you want to see how close  can come without actually hitting you
Stu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more powerful
There's no glass in the left side of the booth since the late Leon smashed it all out
Nothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot
May  call attention to the yellow pages
The frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit
There's been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there to behold
Stu reaches for the phonebook
There's a bullet hole straight through it
Pieces of the
30 calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are imbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick volume
Stu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory
He looks at them in the palm of his hand
Hollow points are designed to break up on impact
It would've behaved differently if it had pierced your soft flesh
The pieces would've bounced around looking for a way out
That's where the real damage occurs -- finding an exit -- deflecting off all that bone
Stu wants to shout "," but restrains himself
Not talking gives him some degree of power
Still the silent treatment
My father used to dish that out when he chose to punish me
Not a word spoken -- one time for over a month
'd try and goad him to acknowledge  existed, but he stared right through me
You're bringing back unhappy childhood, Stu
That's not wise
Stu still declines to answer
His silence seems his only weapon
He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto the pavement
Since you're ignoring me, 'll focus on someone else
(a beat) There she is -- nice and sharp can see the two little punctures in each earlobe and my God, what kind of a girl would have her nostril pierced
Stu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights
No
What was that
Louder, Stu
We must have a bad connection
Leave her out of it
didn't expect her to show up here
But since she has -- 'll improvise
Don't
Please don't
'm sorry
'm talking to you again
'll talk all you want
It's a bad dye job
The black roots are growing in and it makes her look cheap
've screwed up her life enough already
Please don't hurt her
don't necessarily have to kill her
could be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation
Which part of her displeases you most
If she turns a bit more in profile, 'm accurate enough to remove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose
It's just cartilage
Any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking better than ever
'  - in the crowd
Distant yet distinct amongst the curious onlookers
--
following her as she forces her way through the crowd toward the police officers
Her face virtually fills the screen
: The only time we deviate from Stu and his is when we see the sniper's own  through his telescopic sight
You can see her talking to the police now
She's identifying herself as your wife
They're very interested in who you are
They're taking her over to see the officer in charge
What was his name
' Through the cross hairs of the sniperscope, we can see Kelly conversing with Captain Ramey
She's in a state of complete agitation
half leaning out of the booth, staring at his wife and the cops in the distance
-- and suddenly we can hear them clearly in spite of the distance
What do you mean psychiatrist
He doesn't see any psychiatrist
Then who'd your husband be talking to
There was some guy that called the house this morning and said weird stuff to me
Stu seems to be checking things out with this person
He hasn't got many friends --  can tell you that
Remain here, please
We may need you later
You won't hurt him
We'll do our best not to
Kelly is left alone as the Captain returns to their command center
Kelly is once again a solitary target
She could be picked off without attracting undue attention
She won't even feel it when it happens
Take me instead
Don't distract me
Now's the time to be absolutely still
have to hold my breath as  squeeze gently -- No
'm hanging up
That's it
Stu hangs up the receiver
He disconnects
-- The police as they react
We see a flurry of activity across the street
Voices become clear as focus shifts
Shit
He hung up
Maybe they already traced it
Anyhow, it doesn't matter
Looks like he's coming out
-- slowly stepping out of the booth
His hands are raised
(shouts) 've giving myself up
Take me
(distant) First the gun
We want to see you toss away your weapon
Shit
can't
(distant) Freeze where you are
Turn around and keep those hands clasped
(signals the others) Take him
The   in protective gear now step out of cover and fan out as they approach the booth
He's just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the sniper's bullet go through him at any moment
Then the pay phone starts ringing
The sniper is calling back
to the police
All the cops react
Particularly the Captain and the Sergeant
Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in focus
What is going on with these fucking phone calls
(shouts) Hold your fire
Let him answer it
The  team backs up but maintain their aim
Are you nuts
Let them talk
He's not going anywhere
(shouts) He's going back inside the booth
Indeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick up the receiver
(into pay phone) Yeah
strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish
Totally unintelligible to Stu
(into pay phone) You got the wrong number
Hang up
The voice, probably a Puerto Rican gentleman, rattles on in Spanish
Wrong number
Wrong number
Then the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic accent
It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor
Aw, relax, Stu
Only yanking your chain
Now can we start over
Those cops won't wait much longer
What else can they do
They can't afford to just shoot you like can
Not with so much media coverage
Not unless you make some stupid aggressive move
(beat) The  Mobile Unit just rolled up
Across the street, Stu can see various  units from local stations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks
Will you look at that
must be going out over the network
Bet they're pre-empting usual programming
And just think -- if you survive this, your trial will be televised
And you can try and make the world believe  ever existed
'd be your only defense
How are they gonna prove that killed anybody when there's no gun
They'll plant one
The police aren't above that -- when they're desperate to convict
No, sir
No gun and  walk
Don't you think  took that into account
Am  a fool
What do you mean
Haven't  considered every eventuality
knew they'd come and cordon off the block
(beat) And that there'd have to be a gun someplace
Where
It's a small booth, Stu
Have you checked every inch of it
(looking up and down) It's not on the floor
Then what's left
Up above
Could be
Why don't you reach up there and lift the plastic sheet -- and feel around
If they see me reach for something, they could open fire
They could
But you have to know if it's there
Don't you
totally don't give a shit
In a narrow space, tucked just to the left of the fluorescent bulb
You can almost see it outlined if you look closely
Stu peers upward at the clouded plastic, now stained and dirty
There are shadows of objects above in the shallows area around the light fixture that automatically goes on when the door to the phone booth is tightly closed
Stu opens and closes the door a few times, watching the light click on -- watching the shadows around the light
Could that be an accumulation of dirt, dust, or dead insects
Or could something be stashed up there
It doesn't matter
know about ballistics
The slug in that dead guy came from your rifle, not any handgun
You saw how hollow points splinter on impact
There's nothing much for ballistics to match to
The same make
30 calibre bullets are in that handgun
The prosecution rests
There's no gun up there
don't see a damn thing
Slide your finger up under the plastic and you'll feel the cold metal surface
There are four rounds left in it
Should you decide to shoot your way out
could never shoot anybody
You could shoot me, Stu
You'd do that in a minute if you could
And 'd fucking love it
Now you're speaking from the heart
Come on, just lift the partition a few inches and feel what's there for you
'm not getting my fingerprints on your fucking weapon
What about powder residue
How are they going to explain that to a jury
Do you think that'll matter with so many eye witnesses
(beat) Do it
or should  re-focus my attention on Kelly
No
You carefully distracted me from her before and  let you get away with it
But if you're not going to play fairly -- (a pause) There she is again
So close feel like  could touch her
Get off her
Then mind me when  speak
Look
'm reaching up with my left hand
'm pushing against the partition
It's giving
'm feeling around with my fingertips
It's filthy up there
- ' feel about inside the shallow space
The shriveled remains of dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a
30 handgun
'm -- touching something
One of the finest handguns Remington makes
Lightweight, efficient and highly accurate
'm not picking it up
Not right now
But eventually
Stu lowers his hand, still empty
wouldn't have a chance
never said you would
'm not insane
But you're getting there
It wouldn't take much
That won't happen
You could pull the gun down, shove it in your own mouth and jerk the trigger
That's another option
Why would  do that
To please me
And ensure that nothing happens to Kelly
don't necessarily have to deal with her today in the midst of a crowd of cops
can take her out any time like
When she goes to pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in the morning
What is it -- a Jack Russell
Okay
know you can do it
But don't talk about that
Please
'd rather see you remembered as the gallant gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police -- than as a coward who sucked the barrel
'm doing your for you
Creating a final image that'll endure
The outraged New Yorker who was pushed too far
When some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory, he retaliated
And when the forces of the law closed in, he was defiant
to the end
Like that nerdy sonofabitch who blew those three wiseass kids away on the subway
Exactly
Nobody minded that he was a sicko
He was living out a New Yorker's pet fantasy
Can you remember that movie where Peter Finch started screaming ''m not taking it anymore
'  And everybody picked up on it
''m mad as hell and 'm not taking it anymore
' That was it
Poor Finch got himself an Oscar for that
But he was dead by then
mean he really died
Maybe playing that part took too much out of him
(softly to himself) ''m not taking it anymore
'  ''m not taking it anymore
' That's the way
Psyche yourself up
Everybody respects a man who fights back, even if he goes a little berserk in the process
Fighting back
That's what it's about
Exactly
We all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses
We all thought of doing that
But only he had the balls
The terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices
Maybe somebody will finally get the message
You can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you
'm still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned
could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second
Shall
Stu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man on the line has done to him
His turn has come to fight back
He has an idea
If the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can't be watching Stu
Turning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his knees
'm on my knees begging you
Stand up, Stu
You're embarrassing yourself
-- Stu now down on his knees in the booth
He's curled up almost into a fetal position
By doing so, he hopes to hide the fact that he's reaching into his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone
He half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the sniper or the cops
But nothing happens
Stu --  want you back on your feet facing me
So you can see what 'm going to do to her
Stu ignores the command
He's quickly dialing
911
He's calling police emergency
' Stu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope, crouched, doubled up at the foot of the booth
But the cell phone is hidden in front of him
Be a man, Stuart
Don't let them see you like this
You're an embarrassment to me
- with Stu still kneeling
to police across the street as their voices become clear -- (listening to transmission) Officer on east side of the street reports subject removed a dark metallic object from his pocket
We better move
Hold all fire until you actually identify a weapon
We're doing this on fucking
-- crouched forward
The pay phone receiver dangles just above his head
The cellular remains cupped in his hand
Stu never lifts the cell phone
He keeps the palm of his hand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from the other end
It rings and finally someone answers
(faint) Police
Is this an emergency
Hello
Is someone on the line
But Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he now grips in his other hand
Hoping that his words will be picked up by the emergency operator listening via the cellular
To help in this regard, he reaches back and slides the door to the booth tightly closed
He pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are meant for the 911 operator to hear
(loud) You've made your point
Who's going to believe 've got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in a fucking phone booth at 45th and 8th
It took you a while to believe it yourself
If you'd put a bullet in that Captain Ramey, it would've been a different story -- but you were too wise to do that
Why don't you do it for me
Wave the old captain back over and get him nice and close and then use the handgun on him
(talking loud) Why me
You could pick off any of those cops from your window up there
Like you did that pimp
And that tourist last week
But this time you want me to do your killing for you
And you will
To save Kelly
- cupped in Stu's hand and held low
Can they hear him on the other end
(muffled, almost inaudible) Can you speak up, sir
What is your name
Stu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the emergency operator
He sets the cell phone down flat on the floor of the booth facing upward
He puts his foot over the receiving end to muffle the incoming voice
Then he stands up
That's better, Stu
Now turn around so  can see you
Stu talks close into the pay phone receiver now
But keeps his voice raised
This booth
It's my whole world -- shrunk down to four feet by three feet
Not much bigger than the size of a coffin
They can put handles on the booth and bury you in it
(loudly into pay phone) When  saw you put that bullet into that black dude,  knew you'd never let me out of this phone booth alive
You're wasting my time
Reach up and take the gun
(peering upward, squinting) Let me see you first
What harm can that do you
You're in one of those windows
've got to know which one
No need for that
Being so far,  could never identify you
don't even want to
What is it then
Don't worry that 'd try to point you out
You'd shut me up with one of your
30 calibre hollow points before  could even raise a finger
Why does it matter so much
want to see that you exist
Like God exists
It's not enough to believe
You want to see him -- just once -- even at a distance
And then you'd take the gun down
And use it
We have a deal on that
Show yourself to me and 'll take the gun down
swear
There's a pause as the sniper mulls it over
don't have to make deals
And you're irritating me by trying to negotiate
God doesn't have to prove anything
He just strikes you down when he gets in the mood
Stop
won't ask to see you anymore
'm glad that's settled
But look who else has showed up
Who
guess she saw the coverage on and just couldn't keep away
What are you talking about
The 'hotel' just arrived
And a very beautiful little hotel she is
Actually, 'd classify her as more of a motel
Mavis
don't see her
She's too far back behind the police line
But 've got a fine shot at her from up here
You don't even know what she looks like
You're in an enviable position now, Stu
You get to choose between them
Tell me which one
can't
Which will it be
Kelly or Mavis
Or should  simply select one
- lying face up on the floor of the booth
Is anybody listening
Stu looks down at the cellular
He has no way of knowing if the police operator can hear any of his words
need time to think
You've got to be more in touch with your feelings
You said you love Kelly
do
Then 'm doing you a favor putting you out of the way of temptation
It wasn't Mavis' fault
It was all my fault
Then take the third option
Reach above you and pick up the gun
You'll leave them both alone
There won't be much point in harming them without you around to impress
'll do it
Let me see you do it
need one minute
One last minute, please
Can you give me that
Don't tell me you're going to say your prayers
Something like that
- assembled on the opposite side of the street
They should've traced the fucking call by now
(listening on transmitter) There's something else coming in
911 operator says your name was mentioned by somebody that's still on the line
Somebody talking about a phone booth
And a sniper
Patch me through
Hello, this is Captain Edward Ramey
What about that call
The line is still open
It's originating from a booth at 45th and 8th
We're there
Can you play me back your recording of the entire call
can't replay the tape while it's still running
Then switch to another machine and play back what you've got
It's awful faint
He's not talking directly into the receiver
Ramey begins to listen
We hear snatches of Stu's call picking up words which are at times incomprehensible
' (faint) 'Who's going to believe 've got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in some fucking phone booth
' The uniformed   now joins Ramey and the Sergeant
Got what you wanted
The call's coming from up the street
The Hotel Broadway
Have you got the room
It's not that easy
Electronic switchboard
(to Sergeant) Move your  units to the hotel
No
wait
Any movement will alert the sniper
If he sees any of us withdraw, he may panic
There's another  unit on the way
Intercept them
Divert them to the hotel
It's done
Send them in from the Forty-third Street side
don't want any activity the sniper might catch sight of
He's probably high up and facing that booth
He's got to continue to believe our full attention is focused on the man inside -- whoever the hell that poor bastard is
(to emergency operator) Hello 911 operator,  missed some of that
Run it halfway back and repeat it
'  () (faint) '
Like you did that pimp
And that tourist last week
But this time you want me to do the killing for you
' (listening) Jesus
he's a dead man
The police seem all excited about something, Stu
Are they
wasn't looking
can't wait any longer
Say amen, then reach up for the gun
When your hand comes down,  want to see it
'm too afraid
For once, be brave
Surprise yourself
'm shaking all over
Guys in combat situations even shit their pants
But they follow orders
As soon as the cops see a gun, they'll open fire
Then 'd advise you to fire first
Stu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower
His fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that cover the roof of the booth
It raises up easily at the middle where two sheets join
The space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of clouded plastic
We see the fluorescent lighting fixture covered with dust
The solitary object -- a cruel-looking weapon
Now Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space
He touches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the roughness of the grip
- ' as below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony -- The sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed tightly shut
He can already imagine the police bullets tearing into him
(into transmitter) Give me the word
- His arm still raised
He hasn't brought it down with the gun in it
Not yet
He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up against his mouth
Hard part's over
Drop your arm and point it like you'd point your finger and squeeze
No
You do it
If you want me dead, then fucking murder me
Why must  keep invoking some poor girl's name every time we come to an impasse
'm focused back on Kelly again
You're obviously not willing to trade your life for hers
am
'm doing it
He pulls the handgun down into full view
Curiously, the police do not open fire
There
You see it
They all see it
He waves the gun so nobody can miss it
Where are you
Damn you
He drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth
Still the cops do not open fire
Then Stu starts shooting
Not at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the street
At the thousands of windows that look down upon him
He gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out in response
He has fired
The remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters
Stu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the pavement
She screams, tries to break through but cops restrain her
as it sways back and forth
From it, we hear the voice
Thanks for such an interesting afternoon
wooden door being battered open
few incomprehensible shouts as a   dashes in
Stu's stalling for time has paid off
The police have broken in on Stu's tormentor and there has been a rapid exchange of shots
reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver
as Ramey places it to his ear
Hello
This is Captain Ramey
Somebody talk to me
' Yeah
We took him out, Captain
Nobody else got hurt
What's his condition
' Critical
The sonofabitch took two
Probably won't survive the ride
Get a statement from him
'll be right over
He drops the receiver so that it dangles again
to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and medics
He's stunned, but very much alive
Don't try to sit up
What was that
(kneeling) Rubber bullet
You'll have one hell of a nasty welt
Busted rib
Maybe a permanent scar there
It couldn't hurt much more if you really shot me
Somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us
Did you get him
Sure as hell did
Thanks to you
Still alive
Barely
We'll be giving him a hypo for the pain
It'll put him out for a while
Kelly is now brought over by a female cop
She drops to her knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him
The medics restrain her
It's okay
'm not really shot
was so afraid
thought
thought so, too
But we're going to be alright
Both of us
Remember how you swore up and down you'd get me on
Well, you did
already got interviewed on Fox and Channel Eleven and they even want me on
America tomorrow morning
Bet you didn't think  could deliver on that
Will you please let go of him, Miss
gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance
The medic is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away
No
No hypo
want to see him first
The medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart him off
But Stu struggles against them
Relax
The guy's dying
That's why 've gotta talk to him
Please
We'll see
(to Kelly) You can ride with him in the ambulance
The woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance
Ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the  team inside the hotel
This is Ramey
Over
This is Ramey
Ten-Four
There's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple garbled voices on the other end of the line
Shit
Get everybody off this wavelength
He crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling receiver
Hello
Hello
Pick up
Yeah, it's Ramey again
Can you hold the phone close enough so the perp can listen
' He's not saying a word, Captain
He's not about to talk to us
Maybe to him
Ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift Stu onto the gurney
Forget that
Stand him up
(to Stu) Can you stand
can try
Help him over here
The medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth
It's painful, but Stu ignores it
Ramey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak
Here
Speak up
(into pay phone) It's me
Do you hear me
Answer me
(wheezing) Had to have the last word, Stu
finally beat your ass
Admit it, you fuck
But you'll never forget me
gave you the most thrilling day of your life
Say thanks
Now you're gonna die, you bastard
lost a lot of blood
Don't you want to donate some for me
Then we'd really be part of each other
Hang on
can't wait to see you at the hospital
So  can yank your fucking air tube out
Wish  could give you that pleasure
You deserve it
(coughing) Only 'm out of time
What's your name
At least tell me who you are
There's more violent coughing, then silence
Then a cop's voice is heard
' He's gone
Stu stares at the receiver
Don't worry
We'll find out who he is
And why he picked you
No
You won't
(a beat) What do you want to bet you won't
Stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver
'll spend my whole life trying to figure that out
Then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto the waiting gurney
The hypo is finally administered
It kicks in immediately, relieving the pain
He's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance
Kelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the hospital
'  - pulling away in
inside the ambulance with Stu
The doors shut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his entire world until moments ago
(groggy) Gotta sleep now
No phone calls
Kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs
Stu passes out -- into a deep sleep he much deserves
