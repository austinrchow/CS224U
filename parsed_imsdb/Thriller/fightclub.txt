) People were always asking me, did know Tyler Durden
: -      -- has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand holds a  with the barrel lodged in '
Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap
They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a dry sort of way
Tyler looks at his watch
One minute
(looking out window) This is the beginning
We're at ground zero
Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion
i
ann
iinn
ff
nnyin
(
) With a gun barrel between your teeth, you only speak in vowels
Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth
(still distorted) can't think of anything
(
) With my tongue,  can feel the rifling in the barrel
For a second, totally forgot about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing and wondered how clean this gun is
Tyler checks his watch
It's getting exciting now
(
) That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way
Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31
(
) We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction
The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin
In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble
know this because Tyler knows this
Look what we've accomplised
(checks watch) Thirty seconds
(
) Somehow,  realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer
from Jack's face
It's pressed against that belong to
, 45, a moose of a man
Jack is engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace
Bob weeps openly
(
) Bob had bitch tits
to wide on
- Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones
Near the door, a  on a stand: "
" (
) This was a support group for men with testicular cancer
The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob
We're still men
Yes
We're men
Men is what we are
(
) Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed
Then hormone therapy
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen
That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid
Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes
Okay
You cry now
Jack looks at Bob
(
) Wait
Back up
Let me start earlier
'  - Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling
(
) For six months
could not sleep
- Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine
His Starbucks cup sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies
(
) With insomnia, nothing is real
Everything is far away
Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy
Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping
Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves
'  - Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the floor, full of newspapers and
(
) When deep space exploration ramps up, it will be corporations that name everything
The  Stellar Sphere
The Philip Morris Galaxy
Planet Starbucks
Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's , enters, Starbucks cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk
'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week
We've got some "red-flags" to cover
(
) It must've been Tuesday
he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie
(listless management speak) You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade
You need to make these your primary "action items
" (
) He was full of pep
Must've had his grande latte enema
Here are your flight coupons
Call me from the road if there are any snags
Your itinerary
Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen
- '  - Jack sits on the toilet,   to his ear, flips through an  catalog
There's a stack of old Playboy magazines and other catalogs nearby
(
) Like everyone else,  had become a slave to the  nesting instinct
(into phone) Yes
'd like to order the Erika Pekkari slip covers
Jack drops the open catalog on the floor
--   of
(
) If  saw something like clever coffee table sin the shape of a yin and yang,  had to have it
of
(
) Like the Johanneshov armchair in the Strinne green stripe pattern
/ / The armchair
next to armchair
(
) Or the Rislampa wire lamps of environmentally-friendly unbleached paper
The lamps
to wall
(
) Even the Vild hall clock of galvanized steel, resting on the Klipsk shelving unit
The clock  as the shelving unit  on the wall
(
) would flip through catalogs and wonder, "What kind of dining set defines me as a person
"  We used to read pornography
Now it was the Horchow Collection
dining room set
Jack, the cordless phone still glued to his ear, walks   and continues
No,  don't want Cobalt
Oh, that sounds nice
Apricot
Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate
(
) had it all
Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections, proof they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of wherever
He rummages through the refrigerator
It's practically empty
Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses a butter knife to eat it
'  - Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an , who studies him with bemusement
No, you can't die of insomnia
Maybe  died already
Look at my face
You need to lighten up
Can't you give me something
(
) Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals
(overlapping w/ above) You need healthy, natural sleep
Chew valerian root and get some more exercise
The Intern ushes Jack to the door
They step into the
The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart
'm in pain
(facetious) You want to see pain
Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights
See the guys with testicular cancer
That's pain
The Intern moves into the other room
Jack stares after him
- Jack heads for the front door
- Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all listening to a group member speak at a lectern
The has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying
wanted three kids
Two boys and a girl
Mindy wanted two girls and one boy
We never could agree on anything
The Speaker cracks a sad smile
Some men chuckle, happy to lighten the mood
Well, she had her first child a month ago, a girl, with her new husband
And, Thank God
'm glad for her, because she deserves
The speaker breaks down,
Jack watches
couple of the men go up to the speaker, comforting him, leading him away
takes the stand
Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us
Jack, uncomfortable, joins  : (in unison) Thank you, Thomas
look around this room and  see a lot of courage
And it gives me strength
We give each other strength
Jack looks around
Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing
Jack squirms in his seat
It's time for the one-on-one
Let's follow Thomas's example and open ourselves
Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off
Jack stands, uncomfortable
Can everyone find a partner
Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack, shuffling his feet
(
) The big moosie, his eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears
Knees together, invisible steps
Bob takes Jack into an embrace
(
) Bob was a champion bodybuilder
You know that chest expansion program you see on
That was his idea
using steroids
was a juicer
Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake
Now 'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls
(
) Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one
Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder and completely covering Jack's face
After a long beat of crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's
Go ahead, Cornelius
You can cry
They look at each other
Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet
(
) Then
something happened
was lost in oblivion -- dark and silent and complete
Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest
Jack tightens his arms around Bob
(
) found freedom
Losing all hope was freedom
Jack pulls away from Bob
On Bob's chest, there's a of Jack's face from how he looks weeping
(
) Babies don't sleep this well
'  - Jack lies sound asleep
(
) became addicted
- Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and women
In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear
" - Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged
He begins to cry along with her
sign by the door: "Onward and Upward
" (
) If  didn't say anything, people assumed the worst
They cried harder
cried harder
- Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, The Leader speaks into a microphone
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra
(
) wasn't really dying,  wasn't host to cancer or parasites;  was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around
And you open the door and you step inside
We're inside our hearts
Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light
That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light
Jack, eyes closed, is silent
It moves over your body, healing you
Keep this going and step forward, through the back door of the room
Where does it lead
To your cave
Step forward into your cave
- ' Jack walks along, moving through an
' That's right
You're going deeper into your cave
And you're going to find your power animal
Jack comes upon a
The penguin looks at him, cocks his head to signal Jack forward
Slide
The penguin jumps onto a patch of  and slides away
- Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people
He walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace
(
) Every evening  died and every evening  was born again
Resurrected
: - Jack's still in an embrace with Bob
(
) Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too
Being there, my face against his tits, ready to cry -- this was my vacation
enters
She has short matte black hair and big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation
(
) And, she ruined everything
Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips
This is cancer, right
Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded
- Everyone paired-off
' as he stares
'
She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette
(
) This
chick
Marla Singer
did not have testicular cancer
She was a liar
- Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while a member speaks
Jack spies on her
(
) She had no diseases at all
had seen her at my melanoma Monday night group
- Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking
All the faces down the row are turned toward her, incredulous
(
) and at "Free and Clear," my blood parasites group Thursdays
Jack leans out further than the others, scornful
(
) -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my tuberculosis Friday night
: - Jack watches
Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the shoulder of the  she's embraced by
She opens her eyes, catching Jack's stare
Jack looks away
(
) Marla -- the big tourist
Her lie reflected my lie
Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder
Tears roll down her cheeks
She wipes at them
- Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing
Jack exits amongst them
He spots Marla walking away
(
) And suddenly,  felt nothing couldn't cry
So, once again, could not sleep
Jack stares after Marla for a long moment
He walks away
- Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling furniture,   shouldered to his ear
(into phone) No,  just can't believe that card is declined -- Okay, okay, let me give you a different card number
Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card and,  over the following, he reads it into the phone
(
) Next group, after guided meditation, after we open our chakras, when it's time to hug, 'm going to grab that little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her arms against her sides and say
-  - ' as he  his arms around Marla
Marla, you liar, you big tourist need this
Get out
- Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his
(
) When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep and you're never really awake
hadn't slept in four days
- Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around
People are chattering with each other
(
) -- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache
Yet they forced themselves to be positive
They never said "parasite;" they said "agent
"  They always talked about getting better
Okay, everyone
Everyone sits in chairs
Jack catches sight of Marla
To open tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words
Taking the lectern is , a pale, sickly girl whose skin stretches yellowish and tight over her bones
She wears a head bondage
She clears her throat
(
) Ahh, Chloe
Chloe looked the way Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around a party being extra nice to everyone
Well, 'm still here -- but  don't know for how long
That's as much certainty as anyone can give me
but 've got some good news --  no longer have any fear of death
from around the room
But
am in a pretty lonely place
No one will have sex with me
'm so close to the end and all  want is to get laid for the last time
have pornographic movies in my apartment, and lubricants and amyl nitrate
The  gingerly takes control of the microphone
Thank you, Chloe
Everyone, let's thank Chloe
Thank you, Chloe
- Now, you're standing at the entrance to your cave
You step inside your cave and you walk
Keep walking
Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless
(
) If  did have a tumor, 'd name it Marla
Marla
the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't
Now, find your power animal
- ' Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette
Marla cocks her head, indicating whe wants him to -- Slide
- Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke rings with her eyes closed
- Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off
Pick someone special to you tonight
Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him
He tries to smile
She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth
Hello, Mr
Tayler
(
) never gave my real name at support groups
Hi, Chloe
We've never actually talked
Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation
Jack, in a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out: You look good
You
look
like a pirate
Chloe laughs, a little too much
Jack squeezes out a laugh
Then he sees Marla, off by herself
Someone heads for her
Excuse me,  have to
Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla
Chloe watches him go
as Jack  his arms around her
He whispers into her ear
We need to talk
Sure
'm on to you
You're a faker
You aren't dying
What
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying
But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying
Tell the other person how you feel
You're a tourist
saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer
And  saw you practicing this
Practicing what
Telling me off
Is it going as well as you hoped
(reads his nametag) "
Mr
Taylor
" 'll expose you
Go ahead
'll expose you
Share yourself completely
Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were crying
Jack pulls her head back up
She deadpans at him
Why are you doing this
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee
These are my groups
was here first
've been coming for a year
year
How'd you manage that
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back
Let yourself cry
Why do you do it
don't know
guess
when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak
Yeah
Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes
Quietly, now
Share with each other
Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot
(warning) It becomes an addiction
Really
Jack sighs, then pulls back
Look,  can't cry with a faker present
Candy-stripe a cancer ward
It's not my problem
Please
Can't we do something
Marla starts out of the room
Jack follows her
Now, the closing prayer
-  - Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along
We'll split up the week
You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and -- You take tuberculosis
My smoking doesn't go over at all
think testicular cancer should be no contest
Well, technically,  have more of a right to be there than you
You still have your balls
You're kidding
don't know -- am
Jack follow Marla into
- Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched
She takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts
'll take the parasites
You can't have both parasites
You can take blood parasites -- want brain parasites
Okay
'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia -- want that
You can't have the whole brain
So far, you have four and  only have two
Then, take blood parasites
It's yours
Now we each have three
Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack
- Jack follows, bewildered
You
left half your clothes
Jack starts
Marla's led him into the street with traffic barreling down
Marla walks on, oblivious as  screech to a halt, Jack dashes, following
- Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter
An old sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad
You're selling those
Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot
He winces in pain
(for the Clerk to hear) Yes, 'm selling some chothes
The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts
So, we each have three -- that's six
What about the seventh day
want ascending bowel cancer
(
) The girl had done her homework
want ascending bowel cancer
The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla
That's your favorite, too
Tried to slip it by me, eh
We'll split it
You get it the first and third Sunday of the month
Deal
They shake
Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it
Looks like this is goodbye
Let's not make a big thing out of it
She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back
How's this for not making a big thing
Jack watches her go
moment, then he follows after
- Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her
Um
Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers
Should we
In case we want to switch nights
suppose
Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the back, hands it to her
She takes the pen, grabs his hand and writes her number on his palm
She walks into the street, causing more  and
She turns, holds up the card
It doesn't have your name
Who are you
Cornelius
Mr
Taylor
Dr
Zaius
Any of the stupid names you give each night
Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud
Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving moves into view, obscuring her
(
) This is how  met Marla Singer
- The plane touches down; the cabin
Jack's eyes open
(
) You wake up at 'Hare
- Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented
(
) You wake up at SeaTac
- The rear of a   sticks up by the side of the road
Jack stands, marking on a clipboard
The   behind
- Jack stands at a gate counter
An  smiles at him
Check-in for that flight doesn't begin for another two hours, Sir
Jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and looks at an overhanging
(
) Pacific, Mountain, Central
Lose an hour, gain an hour
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time
- Jack's eyes snap open as the plane
(
) You wake up at Air Harbor International
Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet
He watches    on the opposite conveyor
(
) If you wake up at a different time and in a different place, could you wake up as a different person
Jack misses seeing  on the opposite conveyor belt
They pass each other

) Everywhere  travel -- tiny life
Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream, single pat of butter

) Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit

) Shampoo/conditioner combo
Single- serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap
Jack picks up an individual, wrapped -, looks at it
He moves out of the bathroom into

He turns on the

Jack turns to look at his food, takes a bite
He turns back and it's

Jack takes another bite, turns back and it's
--a  next to him
Jack takes another bite, turns back, and it's
--a   next to him
(
) The people  meet on each flight -- they're single-serving friends
Between take-off and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get
- Jack's eyes snap open
(
) You wake up at Logan
- giant corrugated   opens
(
) On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero
Two  lead Jack to the -  of a Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it and starts to make notes on a
(
) 'm a recall coordinator
My job is to apply the formula
It's a story problem
#1 Here's where the infant went through the windshield
Three points
(
) new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour
The rear differential locks up
#2 The teenager's braces around the backseat ashtray would make a good "anti-smoking" ad
(
) The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside
Now: do we initiate a recall
#1 The father must've been huge
See how the fat burnt into the driver's seat with his polyester shirt
Very "modern art
" (
) Take the number of vehicles in the field, (), and multiply it by the probable rate of failure, (), then multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, () times  times  equals
: - Jack is speaking to the  next to him
If  is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents
Oh, you wouldn't believe
Which
car company do you work for
major one
Turgid silence
Jack turns to the window
He sees a get  into the
(
) Every time the plane banked too sharply on take-off or landing, prayed for a crash, or a mid-air collision -- anything
Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane -- the cabin wobbles
People panic
Masks drop
(
) No more haircuts
Nothing matters, not even bad breath
The side of the plane
Screaming  are sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering wind
Magazines and other objects fly everywhere
(
) Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip
Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression
-- the seatbelt light goes
Jack
Some passengers get out of their seats
From next to Jack, a  we've heard before
There are three ways to make napalm
One, mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice
Jack turns to see
Without turned to Jack, Tyler continues: Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola
Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick
Pardon me
Tyler turns to Jack
(
) This is how  met -- Tyler Durden
Tyler offers his hand
Jack takes it
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes
No, supply oxygen
Oxygen gets you high
In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths
Tyler grabs a safety instruction  from the seatback, hands it to Jack
Suddenly, we become euphoic and docile
We accept our fate
Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures
Emergency water landing, 600 miles per hour
Blank faces -- calm as Hindu cows
Jack laughs
What do you do, Tyler
What do you want me to do
mean -- for a living
Why
So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do
" -- And be a smug little shit about it
Jack laughs
Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him and lifts a
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
Jack points to his own briefcase
We have the same briefcase
Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack
Open it
Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of
Soap -- the yardstick of civilization

Tyler hands Jack his card
"
" If you were to add nitric acid to the soap-making process, one would get nitroglycerin
With enough soap, one could blow up the world, if one were so inclined
Tyler  the briefcase shut
Jack stares
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting "single-serving" friend 've ever met
Tyler stares back
Jack, enjoying his own chance to be witty, leans closer to Tyler
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained-- The spork
get it
You're very clever
Thank you
How's that working out for you
What
Being clever
(thrown) Well, uh
great
Keep it up, then
Keep it right up
Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle
As  squeeze past, do  give you the ass or the crotch
Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away
We are defined by the choices we make
Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the curtain aside and sits in an empty seat
Jack watches
(
) How  came to live with Tyler is: airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage
- Utterly empty of baggage
No people except for Jack and a The Security , smirking, holds a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall
(to Jack) Throwers don't worry about ticking
Modern bombs don't tick
Excuse me
"Throwers
" Baggage handlers
But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police
My suitcase was vibrating
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor
But, every once in a while
(whispers) it's a dildo
It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo
We use the indefinite aricle: " dildo
"  Never "Your dildo
" Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red
Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and jack turns away, looks at the Security
In the background, a   dashes after Tyler and the convertible,
(to Security ) had everything in that bag
My shirts
my
shoes
(into phone) Yeah, uh huh
yeah
(pause, still on phone) Oh
lone  sits on the concrete keep their distance
The suitcase explodes
- The Security , shakes his head, hangs up
'm terribly sorry
The Security  hands Jack a claim form
Jack snatches it, disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form
You know the industry slang for "Flight Attendant
"  "Air Mattress
" -  - Along a residential street
Jack looks ahead, sees a tall, grey, bland  on the corner
(
) Home was a condo on the fifteenth floor of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals
The walls were solid concrete
foot of concrete is important when your next- door neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume
The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the building
diffuse  of  wafts away from a - of the fifteenth floor
, and a  are all crowded around the lobby area
(
) -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out your floor- to-ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night
Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the Cabbie money
The taxi pulls away
Jack starts toward the building
He pushes through the fray of people, into the
The  sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his head
Jack starts for the elevator
There's nothing up there
Jack presses the button
The Doorman moves next to him
You can't go into the unit
Police orders
The elevator doors open
Jack hesitates
The doors close
Jack heads out the lobby doors
The Doorman follows
- Jack walks past ,   -- a flash of from the Yang table, a   from the hall clock, part of an arm from the
His feet  glass
(
) How embarrassing
Do you have somebody you can call
Jack comes to his  lying on its side
He reaches down and takes a note: " --" and a phone number, from under a
- ' Hissing
(
) The police would later tell me that the pilot light might have gone out
letting out just a little bit of gas
- Jack gets to a
The Doorman follows, watching him
Lots of young people try to impress the world and buy too many things
Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter
He looks at Marla's number a long moment
- '   - The  of the
(
) The gas could have slowly filled the condo
Seventeen-hundred square feet with high ceilings, for days and days
- Jack replaces the receiver
He pockets Marla's number, digs out a small
He flips through the pages for phone numbers and addresses
Most of the pages are blank
Many young people feel trapped and desperate
-      ' (
) Then, the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on
Click
- Jack looks at the Doorman
Tyler's   falls from the Filofax
Jack catches it
If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't
The Doorman walks away
Jack stares at Tyler's card
(
) If you asked me now,  couldn't tell you why  called him
Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number
It and  and
Jack sighs and hangs up the phone
moment, then the phone
Hello
' Who's this
Tyler
' Who's this
Uh
'm sorry
We met on the plane
We had the same briefcase
'm
you know, the clever guy
' Oh, yeah
just called a second ago
There was no answer
'm at a payphone
' star-sixty-nined you
never pick up my phone
What's up
Well
let me see
here's the thing
'  - small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot
'  - Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of
You buy furniture
You tell yourself: this is the last sofa 'll ever need
No matter what else happens, 've got the sofa issue handled
Then, the right set of dishes
The right dinette
This is how we fill up our lives
Tyler lights a cigarette
guess so
And, now it's gone
All gone
Tyler offers cigarettes
Jack declines
Could be worse
woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car
There's always that
don't know, maybe 'm wrong
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy
no
no
mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit
The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am  right
Jack laughs, nods
He shakes his head, drinks
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered
(toasts) Delivered from Swedish furniture
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns
Delivered from Martha Stewart
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia
" They laugh together
Then, silence
They drink
Insurance'll cover it
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list
What list
The "now  get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list
That list
don't
think so
This time maybe get a widescreen
You'll be occupied for weeks
Well,  have to file a claim
The things you own, they end up owning you
Don't
Do what you like
(looks at watch) God, it's late
should find a hotel
hotel
Yeah
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you
go find a hotel
don't follow
We're on our third pitcher of beer
Just ask me
Huh
You called me so you could have a place to stay
No,
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place
Would that be a problem
Is it a problem for you to ask
Can  stay at your place
Yes, you can
Thank you
You're welcome
But,  want you to do me one favor
What's that
want you to hit me as hard as you can
What
want you to hit me as hard as you can
Freeze picture
(
) Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden
- - -- And we see it's
-  - Jack, in the foreground,
In the , Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual  cut from movies
Near him, a  rolls film
Tyler was a night person
He sometimes worked as a projectionist
movie doesn't come in one big reel, it's on a few
In old theaters, two projectors are used, so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins
Sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner
Tyler points to the side of   and the briefly
They're called "cigarette burns
" It's called a "changeover
"  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea
Why would anyone want this shitty job
It affords him other interesting opportunities
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution
In the ,  suddenly start squirming, confused, looking at each other
abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling vaguely terrible
Her uncomfortable  slowly leans back in his seat
Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window
One-forty-eighth of a second
That's how long it's up there
No one really knows that they've seen it
But they did
nice, big cock
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work
- Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down Jack stands in the same position,
Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel
The  command the  with snaps of fingers
- Jack turns and   to Tyler, standing by a  with a giant
His hands are at his open fly and he's in position to piss into the soup
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry
Don't watch
can't if you watch
Jack waits
The  of a  of  is
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well
(
) Go ahead
Say it
You get the idea
- Tyler and Jack come out the back door
don't know about this
don't know, either
want to find out
've never been hit, have you
No
That's a good thing, isn't it
don't want to die without any scars
How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight
Come on
you're the only person 've ever asked
Me
Jack stares at him
Why not you
'm letting you go first
Do it
This is crazy
Alright, go crazy
Let 'er rip
Where do you want it
In the face
Surprise me
Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's neck -- makes a dull, flat sound
Shit
Sorry
That didn't count
Like hell
That counted
Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest
Jack falls back against a car
His eyes tear up
How do you feel
Strange
But a good strange
Is it
We've crossed the threshold
You want to call it off
Call what off
The fight
What fight
This fight, pussy
Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under Tyler's ear
Tyler punches Jack in the stomach
Tyler and Jack move clumsily, throwing punches
They breathe heavier, drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact
- Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights on the nearby freeway
Their eyes are glazed with endorphin- induced serenity
They look at each other, laugh
Look away
If you could fight anyone
one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight
Anyone
Anyone
Jack thinks
My boss, probably
(pause) Who would you fight
My dad
No question
long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face
Oh, yeah
(nodding) didn't know my dad
Well,  knew him, till  was six
He went and married another woman, had more kids
Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family
He was setting up franchises
My father never went to college, so it was really important that  go
know that
After  graduated,  called him long distance and asked, "Now what
"  He said, "Get a job
"  When  turned twenty-five,  called him and asked, "Now what
"  He said, " don't know
Get married
" Same here
generation of men raised by women
'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need
Another pause
Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles
We should do this again sometime
Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack
- street sign: "
"     stis on one side, facing a lone  on the other
The rest of the land is grass and weeds
It's a grand, old three-story, long abandoned
Tyler leads Jack toward it
Where's your car
What car

) don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year

) It looked like it was waiting to be torn down
Most of the windows were boarded up

) None of the doors locked
The stairs were ready to collapse

Tyler opens the door to a
- Jack enters, stis on the creaky
Dust drifts upwards
(
) Neither would have surprised me
- Jack turns on the water
from the walls
Water spits in starts
(
) Nothing worked
The rusty plumbing leaked
Turning on a light meant another light in the house went out
'    - All the tavern's lights are off
Tyler and Jack
stand around watching
-  - Jack, his face showing    , makes coffee with a wire-mesh strainer
Tyler shuffles in, wearing a flannel bathrobe
He spears pieces of bread on a fork, starts roasting them over a burner
(
) There were no neighbors
Just warehouses and the paper mill
The fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips
- Jack sits watching as Tyler  an old   -- -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street
(
) At night, Tyler and  were alone for half a mile in every direction
'    - All the lights are off
, standing around Jack and Tyler, who
are parked in the lot
- Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep in water, works at an open , flipping breakers in a certain order, showing Jack how it's done
(
) When it rained, we had to kill the power
By the end of the first month,  didn't care about didn't mind the warm, stale refrigerator
- Tyler and Jack are seated across from each other on the buckled floor, reading
Rain from the ceiling
No furniture

) The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in

The crowd than before

He stops, looking at a  with -- milling around the entrance, drinking coffee and sodas
Marla's there, amongst them, smoking

) should have been upset about my nice, neat, flaming little shit
Jack's face shows no reaction
He continues to walk

) But  wasn't
- Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and  his knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips
Tyler, in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie
(
) Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet
Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door
(
) But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday night

No one around, but there are at least -  parked in the full lot

) we were finding something out: we were finding out, more and more, that we were not alone

Jack sits, deadpan, with a   and a  cheek
(
) Thursday mornings, all  could do was think about next week
Boss gives Jack a dubious look
Walter's next : a The basic premise of cyber-netting your office is -- make things more efficient
Can  get the icon in cornflower blue
Absolutely
Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's
: (
) Walter, the Microsoft account exec
Walter, with his smooth, soft hands
Maybe he was thinking about the free- range potluck he'd been to last weekend, or his church-group car-wash fund-raiser
Or, probably not
Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder
showed this already to my man here
You liked it, didn't you
Jack smiles
His teeth are  with
They eerily in the dim light
(
) You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick
Jesus, 'd hate to see what happened to the other guy
Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face
(
) Screw Walter
His candy-ass wouldn't last a second Wednesday night
'  - Out of silent darkness,  appear from all directions
and park in the already-packed lot
get out and march into the tavern
'  - The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against the back wall, waiting
The bartender, , calls out: Drink up people
We're closing
Irvine flicks on the
Drunken customers squint and get the message
They plop down money, leaving

) It was right in everyone's face
Tyler and  just made it visible
Irvine hits a button and the  loses power
Members of the waiting army begins to share secret looks
Finally, one buy locks the door
Two other guys close the blinds
(
) It was on the tip of everyone's tongue
Tyler and  just gave it a name
- -
Concrete walls
One   above, Tyler standing directly beneath it
Welcome to fight club
The guys mill around, finding partners
Everyone brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool
gets
Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center
(
) Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and  decided
, till Tyler raises his arms and the couple of ,  , then,
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club
The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club
The third rule of fight club is -- when someone says "stop" or goes limp, the fight is over
Fourth rule is -- only two guys to a fight
Fifth rule -- one fight at a time
Sixth rule -- no shirts, no shoes
Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to
And the eighth and final rule -- if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight
Tyler steps back
short guy, , and a take off shirts and shoes and step to the center
(
) This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk -- couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink
The two fighters circle, then begin throwing
(
) But Ricky was a god for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size
Harder, faster  between the two

Ricky's getting the best of Goateed Man,  him
(
) Sometimes all you could hear were flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling, or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed
(spittle-lipped) Ssssstop
- Jack, eating lunch, watches the -  with a -- from the above fight -- converse with a  '
(
) Even if  could tell someone they had a good fight,  wouldn't be talking to the same man
The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda down on the table
The two of them briefly make eye contact
(
) Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world
- Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light
He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an apron, push a supply cart
Ricks nods at Jack
(
) You weren't alive anywhere like you were there
But fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends
'  - Jack, playing  on his computer, daubs blood from his mouth with a handkerchief
Boss, passing by the doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated
What are you getting yourself into every week
Jack keeps playing Solitaire
Boss enters, folds his arms
(
) After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down
You can deal with anything
Have you finished those reports
(handing him reports) Yes
(
) The people who had power over you have less and less
Jack looks at Boss
Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with his teeth
(
) By this point,  could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw
- Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes

) guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood
If you could fight any celebrity
Alive or dead
Doesn't matter

They reach a   as a  arrives, tossing their cigarettes, getting on board
- The bus is crowded
As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back, Jack studies the faces of
(
) We all started seeing things differently
Wherever we went
They hold hand grips
Jack looks up at an ; a ad featuring a tan, bare-chested

) felt sorry for all the guys packing into gyms, trying to look like what Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said they should
Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the
advertisement
Self-improvement is masturbation
Self-destruction is the answer
in a suit  Tyler's shoulder as he passes
The Man takes a handle, close by
Jack's pissed, staring at the man, who stares back
(to Tyler, so the Man can hear) You could take him
Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man
Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril
The trick is not to care
Tyler stares forward
- Tyler  the floor, stomach first
lands on top of him, grappling, trying for a
The surrounding , Jack included,  at them
Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him
Tyler turns -- starts reining  into the Opponent's
: Jack lands a couple of  to  ' stomach -- brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw
Tiny spatters of  adorn the walls, along with sweat
Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face
(
) Fight club wasn't about winning or losing
It wasn't about words
The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack
Jack snakes his arm into a counter headlock
They wrestle like wild animals
The crowd  maniacally
(
) They hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal church
Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering
The Opponent  Jack's head to the floor, over and over
stop
(
) When the fight was over, nothing was solved, but nothing mattered
Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away
Tyler pushes through the crowd
Others lift Jack up
They turn their attention to the floor, to a   of Jack's face -- similar to the   on '
Cool
Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand
How about next week
Look at me
How about next month
Everyone helps Jack walk
He's sweating, bleeding, smiling

) Afterwards, we all felt saved

He fell down some stairs
The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack

(
) Sometimes Tyler spoke for me
-  - Tyler and Jack share the cracked
Tyler's clipping at his hair with blunt, ill-suited
Jack's brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam

) Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails

Skinny guys fight till they're burger

Where have you been the last few weeks
Marla
Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups
Jack leans, cups the phone
(quietly) How did you find me
The forwarding number
haven't seen you at any support groups
That's the idea -- we split them
You haven't been going to yours

Really
It's for men
Like testicular cancer
Look, this is a bad time

You want to see some truly fucked up people
'm just on my way out
Me too
got a stomach full of Xanax
took what was left of a bottle
Might've been too much
Jack looks exasperated, turns
(
) Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment
This isn't a for-real suicide thing
This is probably one of those cry-for- help things
(
) This could go on for hours
So you're staying in tonight
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death
Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, walks out the back door
' Do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone

- Jack stares into the , looking at
- Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest
He hears  approaching
You're not going to believe what dreamt last night
Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's been raped by a hurricane
Jack's jaw drops
can hardly believe anything about last night
Marla goes to pour coffee
She takes a swig,  and it in the sink
She gives Jack a lascivious smile
What are you doing here
What
What the hell are you doing here
Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink
Fuck you
Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out
Jack gets up, watches her stomp away
Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla
He's in his usual sweatpants
He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours himself coffee
Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest
Tyler puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises
She's a piece of work
Get this -- come in here last night, the phone's off the hook
Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler
' (
) already knew the story before he told it to me
-   () Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens
' (from handset) 'll tell you when 'm floating out of my body
Tyler smiles
(
) How could Tyler, off all people, think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die
' - 8TH   -   () Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars, looking at the rotting walls
He reaches the top of the stairs and heads for Marla's room
Before he can knock, Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him
'  -  () Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door
Her drugged eyes look him over
You got here fast
She staggers and sits on the bed
She slides off, along with the blanket and sheets, to the floor
The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic
She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler
Did  call you
Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a lying atop a dresser
Marla follows his gaze
Don't worry
It's not a threat to you
and vehicles  outside can be ; doors opening and ; running
Oh, no
Somebody called the cops
She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door

Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass

The rescuers keep running
(calling after) The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself
Miss Singer, let us help you
You have every reason to live
Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs
She's a monster
Infectious human waste
Good luck trying to save her
-  () Tyler makes coffee
Marla slouches against the refrigerator
If  fall asleep, 'm done for
You're gonna have to keep me up all night
-  () Tyler chuckles, shakes his head
Unbelievable, huh
(
) He was obviously able to handle it
Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack
mean, this girl
uh, you're not into her or anything
No
Not at all
(
) am Jack's Raging Bile Duct
Tyler lights his cigarette
You're sure
Yeah, 'm sure
Good
This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room
The things that she said
've never heard a woman talk like that
'  -  () Tyler smokes, post-coital
Marla puts her lips to his ear
(whispering) want to have your abortion
-  () Tyler laughs, shakes his head
Jack's gripping his Reader's Digest just a little too tight
(
) How could Tyler not go for that
Night before last, he was splicing sex organs into "Little Mermaid
" Tyler sits, studies Jack's face
You're okay with this
'm fine
(
) Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains
Tyler smokes
She is a wild, twisted bitch
Stay away from that one
Oh, and my pace is more librarians
Hey
don't knock librarians
Marla doesn't need a lover
She needs a case worker
She needs an exorcist
This isn't love
This is sport-fucking
(
) She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home
Listen
do me a favor
sit here a minute
Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it
Jack puts down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair
What
You've gotta understand something about me
have a little rule, okay
Don't ever talk to her about me
Ever
can't stand that kind of shit
Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone --  will find out
And you'll never see me again
Promise me
Okay
Promise you won't
Yes,  promise
Promise
said  promise
That was three times you promised
Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves
Jack sits smoldering

) If only  had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla die, none of this would have happened

But  didn't

Jack flips  off, then walks upstairs

He reaches the landing
Tyler's door is ajar
Jack peeks in
Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed
The door -- Tyler, naked, stands
What are you doing
Jack steps back
uh
just going to bed
Tyler scratches his head, wears a
You want to finish her off
Uh
nah
Jack continues toward his room
- Jack brushes his teeth

) became the calm, little center of the world

- Haiku is   in a trendy, italicized font
"Worker bees can leave Even drones can fly away The queen is their slave" (

) faxed them around to everyone

He presses this key over and over
Boss enters
Is that your blood
Some of it, yes
Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars
Take the rest of the day off
Come back tomorrow with clean clothes
Get yourself together
- Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing who coldly stare at him
His face is totally passive

) got right in everyone's hostile little face
Yes, these are bruises from fighting

Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants
He runs water in the sink, finds a tiny bit of  and scrubs at the blood stains
The
He answers it
Yeah
Speaking
- cop,  , refers to a file
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit
We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo
Yes
don't know if you're aware
your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder
No,  wasn't aware
(
) am Jack's Cold Sweat
Does this sound strange to you
Yes, sire, strange
Very strange
Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively
The dynamite
Dynamite
Yes
It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride
Do you know what that means
What does that mean
It means it was homemade
This is
really a shock
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion
The gas, it seems, was just a detonator
Who do you think could've done this
'll ask the questions, son
(whispering in Jack's ear) Tell him
Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler standing right next to him
Huh
(overlap w/below) "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception
" Shhhhhh
(into phone, overlap w/above) don't know what to make of this, sir,  really don't

) 'd like to thank the academy
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call
In the meantime, don't leave town

Jack hangs up
Tyler shrugs
Could be worse
You could be cursed with the three terrible Karmas
You could be beautiful, rich and famous
Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants
Marla's can be  coming downstairs
Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing water
He turns, sees Marla enter
Tyler is
Marla lights a cigarette
(
) Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room
got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar
(keeps scrubbing) Worth every penny
(
) My parents pulled this exact act for years -- one came in, the other disappeared
Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to Jack
She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close to Jack's body, almost touhcing
(seductive) It's a bridesmaid's dress
Someone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it
Like a Christmas tree -- so special, then, bam -- it's abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel still clinging to it
Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses against the counter
Marla pulls her hemline further up
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape
(coldly) It suits you
She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely: You can borrow it sometime
Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing
Marla blows smoke in his face
Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the sink
Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going
(
) Get rid of her
Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway
You get rid of her
(pointing at Jack) Don't mention me
Marla's  are coming
Jack looks to the archway, then back at -- Tyler's
Marla enters, shoes and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something on the junk strewn table
(
) 'm six years old again, passing messages between my parents
, uh
think you should go now
Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things, pushing other things off to the floor
It's time for you to leave
Don't worry, 'm leaving
Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes
She moves up into Jack's face
You're such a nutcase,  can't even begin to keep up
Goodbye
She laughs, spins on her heels
As she exits the back door, she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls
" Jack watches her through the kitchen window
(
) Nice work
Jack turns
Tyler's right behind him
Through the window, Marla can be seen walking away
Tyler picks up the remnant of  Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack
To make soap, first we have to render fat
Jack looks at Tyler
- : " -
" -     - Tyler stands inside the fence
Jack's atop the fence, struggling to cross
He wobbles, gets over, snags his shirt
Jack falls,
Tyler helps
Tyler pulls Jack behind a , one of
silhouette of a moves along the perimeter, flashlight first
He walks away
to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding
Tyler eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster
The best fat for making soap -- because the salt balance is just right -- comes form human bodies
Tyler lifts the lid -- it
What is this place
liposuction clinic
From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized, thick plastic bag full of
Paydirt
From society's richest asses and thighs
: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying of fat
One of Jack's bags , spilling the goo down the chain-link fench
Jack slips and slides
Tyler laughs
Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag
- Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface
Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts
This clear layer in glycerin
We'll mix it back in when we make the soap
Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the glycerin layer
Then, he crabs a can, opens it
Lye -- the crucial ingredient
(adding lye to mix) Ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river
Why
Because, human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river
Year after year, bodies burnt
Rain feel
Water seeped through the wood ashes to become lye
The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river
Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet
He takes Jack's hands and  the back of it
The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes
Like the first monkeys shot into space
The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss
Tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand
Without sacrifice, without death, we would have nothing
Jack's whole body
Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand and arm
Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens
This is a chemical burn
It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar
Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of Tyler's kiss
Jack's face spasms
(
) Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand
Look at your hand
(
) Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this
,
: Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes
Come back to the pain
Don't shut this out
Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away
Tyler keeps hold of it and their arms   off the table
(
) tried not to think of the words "searing" or "flesh
"   imagined my pain as a ball of healing white light
,
: Tyler  Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention
Stop it
This is your pain -- your burning hand
It's right here
Look at it
(
) was going to my cave to find my power animal
'
: Tyler  Jack's hand again
Jack re-focuses on Tyler
Don't deal with this the way those dead people do
Deal with it the way a living person does
-  , ,
: Jack tries to pull his hand free
Tyler won't let go
Jack's eyes glaze over again
Jack speaks, whiny from pain: think  understand
think get it
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment
: Tyler  Jack's face, regaining his attention
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it
No, 'm not
: Shut up
Our fathers were our models for God
And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God
don't know
: Tyler  Jack's face again
Listen to me
You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you
In all probability, He hates you
This is not the worst thing that can happen
It isn't
We don't need him
We don't
- -    - -
: Jack is a wide-eyed zombie
Marla
Fuck damnation
Fuck redemption
We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it
Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes
Jack does his best to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled knot
He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on
You can go to the sink and run water over your hand
Look at me
Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn, but first you have to give up
First, you have to know that someday, you are going to die
Until you know that, you will be useless
Jack spasms with a shiver of pain
You
you don't know what this feels like, Tyler
Tyler shows Jack a -   on his own hand
Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes
Tyler grabs a bottle of  -- pours it over Jack's wound
Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand
slumps to the floor
Congratulations
You're a step closer to hitting bottom
' - Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed- over, wait as a  fills out forms
There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on the counter
Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get arrested
His hand is
(
) Tyler sold the soap to department stores at twenty bucks a Ear
God knows what they charged
How ironic
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them
'  - Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer, smoking a cigarette
Boss enters
(
) He was wearing a yellow tie
It must be Thursday
didn't even wear a tie to work anymore
Boss slaps a piece of  down on Jack's desk
"The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club
" Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically
(
) must've left the original in the copy machine
"The second rule of fight club
Is this yours
Hmm
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine
"Abuse" the copy machine
There's an image
Pretend you're me
You find this
What would you do
Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it
Me
'd be very careful who  talked to about this
It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it
someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite -10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co- workers
Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the  and starts tearing it into pieces
Might be someone you've known for years
somebody very close to you
Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up
Jack puts the  in his trash
Bass stares with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear
Jack answers it
Compliance and Liability
' My tit's going to rot off
Just a second
(to Boss; smiles) Could you excuse me
need to take this call
Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves
(into phone) What are you talking about
-
Would you do something for me need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast
can't afford to throw money away on a doctor
don't know
Please

) She didn't call Tyler
'm neutral in her book

This is a sweet side of you

"Mrs

Tragically, they're dead

You want any
No, thanks
Good
He stares at her while she eats
What happened to your hand
Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back
Nothing

Jack stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her breast
Marla's hand guides his

No
Jack's head is behind Marla's
They speak softer, slower
Make sure
Okay
Okay, 'm sure
You feel nothing
Nothing
Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt
Well, that's a relief
Thank you
No
no problem
wish  could return the favor
Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head
think everything's okay here
could check your prostate
Uh
nah
(pause) Well
thanks, anyway
Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than just friendly
Jack pulls away
So
are we done
Marla sighs
Yeah, we're done
See you around
- Jack emerges from the lobby
He looks up at Marla's window, watches her silhouette
He walks away, right into -- Big , the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice
Cornelius
How are you
Bob
'm okay
How are you
Better than 've ever been in my life

Great
Still "Remaining Men Together

Oh
And the second rule about it is
you're not supposed to talk about it
And the third rule

You are
Look at my face
Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder
That's a fucking great, man
Fucking great
Congratulations
Yeah, both of us
You know about the guy who invented it
hear all kinds of things
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution
They say he only sleeps one hour a night
You know about this guy
Tyler Durden
-   - The   insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the circle of light
Bob's eyes are wild with glee
-   - Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none of these guys before - it's a new chapter
Jack and Bob Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape
They both grin with religious serenity
Bob hugs Jack
Thank you
Thank you
Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a sack, completely enervated from the beating he took
You're welcome
(
) Fight club -- this was mine and Tyler's gift
our gift to the world
-- Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at
Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink
Jack takes out a cigarette, lights up
He offers the pack
No thanks,  quit
You quit
Yeah
Where you headed
Work
Going to work
Tyler scratches his chin absently
What
Nothing
Do what you like
Tyler walks out the way he came
'  - Jack sits staring at his
'  - Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe
Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk
We need to talk
Okay
Where to begin
With your constant absenteeism
With your unpresentable appearance
You're up for review
Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise
Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged
Let's pretend
You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects
Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles
Fuel injectors that burn people alive
Just who the fuck do you think you are
Get out
You're fired
What about this
Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant
In exchange for my salary, 'll keep my mouth shut
won't need to come to the office
can do this job from home
Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage
You little fucker
oughta
Jack   in the nose
Blood starts to trickle
He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by the force of the punch,  against a framed picture and the glass
He falls to the floor
(
) Am Jack's Smirking Revenge
Jack gets back to his feet
Please
don't hit me again, please
'm your responsibility
He  himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again
He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents flying
He hits the floor
(
) For some reason,  thought of my first fight -- with Tyler
Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg
Please
give me the paychecks like asked for
won't be any trouble
You won't see me again
Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off
Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings
(
) Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted, something horrible had been growing
Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting himself up
He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand
Please
please
(
) And right then, at our most excellent moment together
Two   enter and gape at the sight
Behind them stand  , looking in
(gurgling blood) Please don't hit me again

Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of
Forty-eight airline flight coupons

Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door
He drags an unwieldy   in behind him; filled with his , ,  and other office equipment

Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud
Good for you
'  -  - An enormous  of guys, including Jack and Bob, stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle, holding up his hands to quiet them
look around
look around and see a lot of new faces
An enthusiastic  from the crowd
Shut up
Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of fight club
glum silence falls
Guys look at each other
see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived -- an entire generation pumping gas and waiting tables; or they're slaves with white collars

We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place
We have no great war, or great depression
The great war is a spiritual war
The great depression is our lives
We were raised by television to believe that we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars -- but we won't
And we're learning that fact
And we're very, very pissed-off
The crowd erupts into a   of agreement
Jack looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd

Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou  it away
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place
We have a deal worked out with Irvine
Irvine
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone
Everyone glances guiltily at each other
He don't own this place,  do
How much money's he getting for this
There is no money
Really
It's free to all
Ain't that something
Yes, it is
Look, stupid fuck,  want everyone outta here now
You're welcome to join our club
Did you hear what  just said
You and your friend
Lou  Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over
You hear me now
Tyler gains his breath, determined
He looks up, turns his head, looking to Jack
Jack watches, wide-eyed
Tyler straightens, facing Lou
No, 'm sorry,  didn't hear you
Lou  Tyler in the face
Some of the guys move forward, but the Thug points his gun
Jack-runs forward anyway -- Lou  him in the face
More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou
We really need to use this place
Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler,  his face, his stomach
Tyler collapses to the floor
Lou starts  his
Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face
That's it
that's good
Get it all out
You'll feel better
Lou flushes red with exasperation,  more
Finally, sweating, bewildered, Lou stops
He looks to the Thug, who is just as bewildered
Suddenly, Tyler  , grabs onto Lou
Yes,  am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world
Tyler's blood spatters on Lou
Lou tries to shake Tyler off, but Tyler  Lou's
The Thug grabs Tyler and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou
Lou slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood
Tyler spits and shouts through clenched teeth
You don't know where 've been
Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor
Tyler rubs his bloody face into Lou's face
The Thug lifts Tyler
Tyler clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged
We need this place
We need it
Please let us keep it, please
Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou
What are you doing
Pleeeeeease
Okay
Okay, fuck it
Use the basement
Get off me
We need some towels, Lou
We need replacement light bulbs
Alright, Christ
Fucking let me go
Thank you
Thank you, sir
Let go of me
Tyler lets go of Lou's belt
Lou scrambles away
The Thug drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood
Lou gets to his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys
He and the Thug back away
slamming the door behind
Fight club surrounds Tyler
They help him up, move him to a crate
Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his breathing labored
then, he sits back, crossing his legs and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike

Ricky and the mechanic are in back
Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb
It has two bumperstickers: "  " and "
" -  - down
Jack stews, silent
The car moves down a , intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights
Something on your mind
No
Tyler shrugs; turns on the , ignores Jack
Why wasn't  told about "Project Mayhem
" What should  have told you
Why wasn't  involved from the beginning
You and  started fight club together
Fight club was the beginning
Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem
(together) The first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions
This is as much mine as yours
Is this a needlepoint club
Is it about you and me
You know what  mean
What do you want
statement of purpose
Look
Should  -mail you
Should  put this on your "action item list
" want to know -- What do you want to know about Project Mayhem
(together) The first rule of Project Mayhem -- (to Ricky and Mechanic) Shut up
(to Tyler) want to know what's going on
Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates
Opposing  get closer fast
This does not belong to us
We are not the leaders
We are not special
What are you doing
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world
We are all part of the same compost heap
Tyler
Tyler steers back into the proper lane
The other  flies past,
What the hell
You choose your level of involvement
won't make decisions for you
'm not asking you to
You're asking questions that don't have answers
You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else
don't think that's true
Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up
Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a
Tyler
what is this
Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands
What will you wish you'd done before you died
Paint a self-portrait
Build a house
(to Jack) And you
don't know
Nothing
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life
would feel nothing about my life
Is that what you want to hear
The oncoming truck  and  its
It moves to the other side of the road
Tyler steers there, too
want to hear the truth
Fuck my life
Fuck fight club
Fuck you and fuck Marla
'm sick of this
How's that
Why do you think  blew up your condo
What
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat
It's not a seminar
You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me
Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the wheel
the car swerves
The truck  past, spraying water,
Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air
Jack looks at Tyler with dead eyes
Okay, okay
fine
Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air
Tyler studies Jack face, impressed
Tyler makes no move to take the wheel
: a   ahead on the side of the road, surrounded by flares
Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the shoulder
heading for the stalled car
Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares
Tyler smiles
They  into the stalled car --
The back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass- over-tea-kettle  down a hill
(
) 'd never been in a car accident
This must've been what all those statistics felt like before  filed them into my reports
The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof
Tyler crawls from the passenger side
He walks around
opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the mud
Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear window
Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack
We just had a near-life experience
'  - Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the ceiling
Tyler sits in a nearby chair
In the world  see -- you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center
You will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life
You will climb the wrist- thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower
You will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway
Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat
(leaving) Feel better, champ
- Jack sits at the table, sips coffee
He's pale, dazed, seems broken
He hears the faint  of  and , unsure of where it's coming from
Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the counter
Her back is to Jack as he looks at her
She pours ccffee and lights a cigarette
beat of silence, then: 'll be out of your way in a sec
She seems to be as weak as Jack
You
don't have to
leave
Whatever
Really
mean it
(pause) Have you been going to your groups
Chloe's dead
When
Do you care
don't know
It was the smart move on her part
Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face
There's a  on her
Jack gets up, moves closer
Why are we both
caught up like this
with
(
) came so close to saying Tyler's name,  could feel it vibrate inside my mouth
Marla looks a him, waiting
don't understand
Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person
to hang onto
What do you get out of it
Faint  of  and
Jack can't quite figure where it's coming from
You hear that
Hear what
That
sawing and hammering
Have we been talking too long
Must we change the subject
Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door, Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs
(harsh whisper) You're not talking about me, are you
Jack reacts, turns back to Marla
(to Marla and Tyler) No
That day you came over to my place to play doctor
what was going on there
(still a whisper) What are you talking about
(to Marla and Tyler) Nothing
Nothing
don't think so
(whisper) This conversation
This conversation
is over
is over
Marla comes to touch Jack's hair
Jack closes the basement door
Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his hand
Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip
What is this
Who did this
person
Guy or girl
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl
Why would you get bent if  asked
Let go of me
(pulls his hand free) Leave me alone
You're afraid to say
Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with frustration
She leaves out the back door, not looking back
Jack leans against the wall
After a moment, he opens the basement door, heads downstairs
Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down
- Jack looks around
-  clutter the basement, as many as can fit into the space
(calling upstairs) Tyler
What's this for
From upstairs, the  of the
- Jack opens the door
Ricky stands on the porch, staring ahead in subordinate military style
He's in black pants, black shirt, black shoes, holds a  , with an army surplus  rolled-up at his feet
Um
what can  do for you, Ricky
Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over
You're too young
Sorry
Wait a minute
Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door
"Too young
" If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young
Old, too old
Fat, too fat
"Applicant
" If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training
"Training
"  Tyler
- Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets, unsure
Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead
Uh, look
You're too
young to
train here
You should probably be on you way
No response from Ricky, who remains at attention
Jack goes back inside
Tyler closes the door
- Ricky remains at attention
Jack bursts out with a , knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away
Are you deaf
told you to leave
You will never get inside this house
- Ricky's still there
Tyler comes out, friendly
Look, friend, 'm sorry for the misunderstanding
It's not the end of the world
Just go away
You're trespassing and  will call the police
Nothing personal
- Ricky, same spot
Jack bursts outside with the broom again
You're never getting through this door, you stupid little weasel
Look at me when  talk to you
He  Ricky in the shoulder with the broom
What is your major malfunction
'  - At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the below
(
) Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be
- Ricky's there
Bob is now next to him, in black, with a paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet
Tyler steps out
Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob
To all the following questions, Ricky answers "Sir
" -- You have two black shirts
Two pair black trousers
One pair black boots
Two pair black socks
One black coat
Three hundred dollars personal burial money
Go inside
Ricky goes in
Tyler turns to Bob
You're too old
Sorry
And, you're too fat
Nice seeing you
Bob looks genuinely hurt
He picks up his mattress and starts away
Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes
Jack follows Bob
Bob
Bob, wait
(leading Bob back) Let me explain this to you
-- Bob stands at at rigid attention
2ND   - Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky finish  off all of his
Tyler comes to give the top of Ricky's head a sharp
monkey, ready to be shot into space
Space Monkey, ready to sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem
From here on, all those with shaved heads: "

Bob stands motionless
There's another "applicant," a  , beside Bob
Ricky comes out the front door with the

) To what purpose, might one ask
Well, one might ask, if not for the first rule of Project Mayhem
Jack turns to look around the kitchen work -- one  the , one  , one the walls
Jack walks out

) In Tyler We Trust

Angel Face comes to take the file from him
That wouldn't interest you
Where's Tyler
The first rule of Project -- Right, right
As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a - - on the back of Angel Face's hand

Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag
The Paper Street Soap Company

He's not here

He's not here
Tyler's not here anymore
He's gone away
Marla stares at Jack, miserable
tear runs down her cheek
She turns and walks away
Jack watches her go
There's a   from the house,

We gotta do something
We got to get rid of the evidence
We have to get rid of this body
Bury him
Jack looks around in disbelief
What
The garden
Take him there
Move, people
Let's do this
Several Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body
No
Space Monkeys stop
Jack gets between them and Bob, a few Space Monkeys back
Get your hands off him

You are a moron

The bus stops

) Under and behind and inside everything  took for granted, something horrible had been growing

He stops, wipes his brow

The place is damp and empty

At his feet --   on the concrete floor

The place is empty
He walks to a , opens it and peers in at

How have you been
You know me
Is this a test, sir
Yes
it's a test
You were in here last Thursday night
What
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is
It's tight as a drum
Who do you think  am
Is this part of the test
Jack nods slowly
The Bartender holds up his hand, shows the   on the back of his hand
You're the one who did this to me
You're Mr
Durden, sir
Tyler Durden
(
) Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position
- Jack bursts inside, out of breath, runs to grab the phone, punches a number, doesn't bother to turn on the lamp
'  - Marla answers
Yeah
Marla, it's me
Have we
have we ever had sex
What kind of stupid question is that
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no
" Is this a trick
Will you just answer me, for Christsake
You mean, you want to know if  think we were just having sex or making love
We did make love
Is that what you're calling it
Answer the question
You fuck me, then snub me
You love me, you hate me
You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole
Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler
(
) We've just lost cabin pressure
What did you say
What is wrong with you
Say my name
What
Say my name
What's my name
Tyler Durden
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak
What's going on
'm coming over there
Marla, no, wait
As Marla
Jack stares at the receiver, dazed
' We've got six fight clubs in Chicago now
Jack spins, dropping the phone --  sits beside him
Four in Milwaukee
What's this all about, Tyler
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South
Why do people think 'm you
You broke your promise
You talked to her about me
Why do people think 'm Tyler Durden
Why did you do that
Answer me, Tyler
Why do people think anything
don't know
Tell me
Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated
People think that you're me, because you and  happen to share the same body
What
Is this really news to you
What are you talking about
Sometimes  control it, and you imagine yourself watching me

The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club

He's not here
Tyler's not here anymore
He's gone away
- You can see me and hear me, but no one else can
-  - sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway
He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there
Anyone
(thinks) My boss, probably

Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him
Oh, yeah

#2 am not how much money  have in the bank
- Jack's having trouble catching his breath
Tyler stands
There
Happy
asked for one thing from you
one simple promise
Now look what you've done
This isn't possible
We're going to have to do something about Marla
What
what are you saying
It's okay
We okay
a little codependent, sure, but
Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial
No
This isn't true
We
we were around other people, together, both of us
You never talked to me in front of anyone else
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash
the two guys in the backseat
What about them
They're lunatics
You took me to the house
The house is rented in your name
You have jobs
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping
What about Marla
What about Marla
She's

you're fucking her
Um, well

) It's called a "changeover

The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a

Jack goes out the door, freezes
He rushes back in, going to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many
Wait

Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk

Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible
Very good, Sir
Excuse me
Don't worry about us, sir
We're solid
Now wait, there's been a mix-up
Everything's changed
You told me you'd say that
Abort the plan

Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files
Marla
Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away
Jack follows, hugging the files to his chest, catching up
Marla
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom
thought they were going to break my arm
'm sorry,
The were burning their fingertips with lye
The stink was unbelievable
Marla

It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit
Marla heads into a
Jack follows
--  little more faith than that
- Marla sits in a
Jack sits across from her
don't want to hear anything you've got to say
Give me a minute, Marla, alright

Sixty seconds, then 'm out of here
Absolutely, you have every right need you to do me a favor

Sir
Anything you order is free of charge, sir
Why is it free of charge
Because

Jack look to the pass-through  into the kitchen where look out with  in their faces
Clean food, please
In that case, sir, may  advise against the lady eating the clam chowder
Thanks, no clam chowder
That's it
The waiter snaps to attention and leaves
You got about thirty seconds

unwell know it's been like there's two sides to me
Two sides
You're Dr
Jeckle and Mr
Jackass
deserve that
Anyway, 've
've only just realized What
mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me
know this
know us hasn't been such a great thing for you
Whatever
(to waiter) 'll take my food to go
Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her by the arm, putting her back in her seat
Sit down
Sit down and give me my last fifteen seconds without opening your mouth
Marla crosses her arms
Jack collects himself
'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, think your life might be in real danger
What
You have to get out of here
Leave as soon as possible
Go to any rural town, away from any major city
You are an insane person
Marla
No, no, shut up
've had enough
tried, Tyler
have tried
Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes
There's a part of you  really like, but  can't do this anymore
just can't
This is killing me
'm sorry, but
What
You're sorry
don't believe that for a minute
Marla gets up
Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading for the door
Jack gathers his files, runs to follow
- Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up
can't explain
You wouldn't believe me anyway
'm trying to protect you
Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a , but the taxi races past
Marla pulls free, screaming at him
, Let go of me
Do this for me, Marla
Do this for me, if you never do anything else
Jack spots a  idling further up the street
Leave me alone
don't ever want to see you again
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again
(digs in his pocket) Here
here
He pulls  from his pocket, holding it out
Take this money, get on this bus
(pointing to bus) Get on, and  promise you, 'll never bother you again, if that's what you want
Please
Marla looks at Jack, numb
Tyler
'm begging you
Get on the bus
Get on the bus
Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus
As they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look
Why are you doing this
can't let myself see where you're going
Go wherever it takes you, remember
keep away from major cities
Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one last look at Jack
(holds up the money) 'm not paying this back
consider it "asshole tax
" Yes, fine
Just, get on
Stay away a couple of weeks, at least
Jack's still covering his eyes
Marla gets on the bus
Tyler
Jack finally looks to her
You are the worst thing that ever happened to me
The  , heading away
Jack seems relieved
Then, a  is  from
Jack turns, looks
: the bus is filled with    : Space Monkeys
Jack  after the bus
The bus speeds away
Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla
Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying
Son of a bitch
- Jack  to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of files on the desk in front of the
(loudly) want you to arrest me
'm the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for acts of vandalism all over the city
Detective Stern in arson knows who  am
- Detective Stern and   stand, staring at Jack, who's seated
On the table are the phone bill and files
There are probably several hundred members in the metropolitan area
Chapters are sprouting in at least five other major cities
They're tightly-regimented, with many cells capable of operating without a central leader
Check this address: 1537 Paper Street
You'll find the body of Robert Paulson buried in the garden
You'll also find numerous tubs used to make gallons of nitroglycerin
The plan,  believe, is to blow up these credit card headquarters and the  building
Why these buildings
You are not your job
You are not how much money you have in the bank
(to other detectives) Keep him talking
Stern leaves
beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile at Jack with
- really admire what you're doing
You're a brave man to order this
What
You're a genius, sir
They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table
Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife
You know the drill
You said if anyone ever tries to interfere with Project Mayhem, even you, we got to get his balls
Flat-Top  Jack's pants completely off, tosses them aside
Jack
Flat-Top holds his legs
- It's useless to fight
This is really a powerful gesture, Mr
Durden
It'll set quite an example
No
you're making a mistake
- You told us you'd say that
'm not Tyler Durden
You told us you'd say that, too
Okay,  am Tyler Durden and 'm ordering you to abort the mission
- You said you would definitely say that
What's our best time for a "cut and run
" - Four minutes
Is somebody timing this
(looks at his watch) Wait till the second hand gets to the twelve
at the door
Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's mouth
He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy opens the door a crack
Stern mutters: Some of this info checks out
Let's go to the place on Paper Street
Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing the door
The two remaining Detectives continue
Jack kicks and screams and writhes
The Detectives wrangle him, but with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone
(checking his watch) Mr
Durden, you're going to fuck up the time
Jack gets one leg free, , knocks Flat-top backwards -- Flat-Top  the wall, falls
Redhead lets go of one of Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat
cutting off the airway
Jack's face reddens
he's choking
Jack's free hand reaches, searching
pulls Redhead's and points it at him
Redhead backs off
Jack gets up, gasping for air, - Flat-top as he rises
Jack grabs one of the files off the table
- Jack, without pants, in  , escapes out the He looks at the  on the file folder
Jack  down the middle of the street, gun in hand, looking like a complete madman
Cars almost hit him
- Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks
then heads toward the  with the address "1888
" 1888 Jack tries the door
Locked
He lifts a cast iron bench, runs forward --  it into the glass
The bench immediately recoils from the glass,  Jack's groin
Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package
Then, he rises,  the glass
1888 Jack pushes through the broken glass
He sprints for the "" door
- Jack enters, looks --
He bolts to the
-   - Jack enters, heaving
Again,
He moves from one to another, searching
He finally spies, across the garage,   , heavily-
Jack runs to the , frantic
He walks around it
There's a  , ticking down from "10:05"
Jack moves to pull the lid off one , looks inside
Could be worse
Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support
oh, maybe it couldn't be
(points at bomb) You
you can't be serious about this
What a ridiculous thing to say
can't let you
go through with this
What are you going to do
'm going to
stop me
'm not going
to let this happen
Stop finishing
your sentences
They're our sentences
Get your mind around that
Tyler gets up walks to Jack
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants
We both use that body
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago
Everything's proceeding exactly as planned
You don't know that
There could still be people inside
Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms
Maybe
Maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldn't synchronize their watches
Good riddance
Jack looks back to the , goes to it, wipes sweat off his face
He starts finger the  , sorting them
wouldn't be doing that
Unless you know which wires, in what order
If you know,  know
Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go through the tangle of colored wires
Or
maybe  knew you'd know, so spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones
Jack chooses one wire, , holds it in his fingers
If 'm wrong, we're both dead
This is not about martyrdom
Jack twists the   around his finger
'm pulling the green wire
Green
Did you say green
Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look, seems genuinely concerned
Yes
Don't pull the green wire
Pull anything but the green wire
Fuck you
'm serious
That's the wrong one
Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers trembling
The  of a  is  from below
Hear that
Marla's here
Just in the nick of time, eh
Jack looks to Tyler
Tyler points towards the
See for yourself
Jack releases the wire, walks to a , gun in hand, keeps an eye on Tyler
Jack looks over the railing
, a  idles
The doors open and ' dragged out, kicking and screaming, carried by
You motherfuckers
They carry Marla into the '
Jack leans against the railing, exhausted
've got everything
The bombs
The army
've got Marla
Bob is dead, Tyler
The police blew a hole in his head
Was that part of your plan
Tyler thinks, shrugs
Bob was a grown man
In any great struggle, there will be casualties
Wouldn't that be implicit in the name
Project "Mayhem
" Fuck your struggle
want out
You want out
quit
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons
You need to get with the program
(looks at his watch) Seven minutes
Let's get out of here
Tyler's walks away
Jack looks at the gun in his hand
He points the gun at Tyler
Tyler
(still walking away) What
( the gun) Defuse the bomb
Tyler stops walking
Ask me nicely
Defuse the bomb, please
Defuse the bomb
Yes
Tyler strides towards the
Jack trains the gun
Please
Tyler looks at the , reaches over to it
He grips the , yanks it out -- the
Jack lowers his gun
did that for you
As a gesture
Now, how fast can you run
There are ten other bombs, in ten other buildings in the immediate area
If you're going to get them all, you better get cracking
(looks at watch) Six minutes
Green wires, remember
'll be upstairs
Jack's stunned
Tyler walks across the parking garage, past Jack, heading for the
Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back,
Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding
Tyler spins to face Jack
Whoa
What was that all about
Jack aims
Tyler  behind a post as the
Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the post
Tyler is
Jack turns, takes slow steps, moving the gun from side to side
Suddenly, a    --  Jack's face
Jack falls
The gun goes  across the floor
Jack turns, looking
Tyler's
Jack looks to the gun, scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun
Tyler  Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling
Jack rolls, holding his chest
He looks up, sees Tyler run into the
Jack grabs the gun and follows
Jack smashes the door open
The stairwell's empty
Jack up a flight of stairs, kicks open
Jack steps forward, gun up down onto his head
Jack drops to the floor
Tyler backs away, laughing
Jack gets to his feet, aims his gun
Fire at will
Jack clenches his teeth,  -- nothing happens to Tyler
Jack   -- no effect
Tyler raises his arms
What did you expect
Jack charges
Tyler dodges, , knocks the gun out of Jack's hand
They , trading , grappling, taking each other to the floor
: - Banks of   sit unmanned
: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor, alone, wrestling himself
He swings his left hand up, punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- himself in the side of the head
Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied
Tyler manages to get his hands around Jack's throat, starts  Jack's head against the floor
Jack's got his hands around his own throat,  his own head against the floor, over and over
Jack manages to break Tyler's grip,  Tyler away
Tyler springs to his feet, , heading for a
Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows
, Tyler reaches the  , above the lobby, disappears around a corner
Jack's right behind, turning the corner -- Tyler's
Jack receives a   on the back of the head
He wheels
Tyler isn't there
on his shoulder
Jack turns around --
-- Tyler  his face
Jack falls against the loft railing
Tyler comes forward,
Jack  himself square in the nose
Jack's dazed
Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward, --  him
Jack  horribly down
, striking his head on the floor
Jack
: - : Jack's head jerks back as he
He looks around, trying to focus his eyes
'
--  in the sawdust of the floor, from where his body was dragged across to where he is how
: Jack tries to comprehend
He turns his head -- '  brings the  up,     ' Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes
: Tyler is seated in Jack's lap
Tyler holds the gun in Jack's mouth, his arm around him
This huge room is being remodeled
Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling windows affording a spectacular view of the
Tyler looks at his watch
One minute
(
) think this is about where we came in
(looking out window) This is the beginning
We're at ground zero
Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion
i
ann
iinn
ff
nnyin
Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth
(still distorted) still can't think of anything
Tyler checks his watch
It's getting exciting now
Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31
Look what we've accomplished
(checks watch) Thirty seconds
(looks out windows) Out these windows, we will view the economic collapse
One step closer to global equilibrium
'm glad you're here with me
Tyler watches the skyline,  at tune, waiting
(distorted) Can't you call it off
It's out of our hands
(looks at watch) This is it
Please
Fifteen seconds now
Can you see alright

Tyler looks out the windows, at  , excited
Jack closes his eyes, despairing

Out the window, the  remains unchanged
Nothing long beat
very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face
Jack opens his eyes
More waiting
Tyler looks genuinely surprised, pissed-off
What the fuck --
Paraffin
What
(relieved) Paraffin
Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin
saw it floating in the bomb
(more) (cont) They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt
Paraffin is iffy at best
Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts pacing
Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile
Damn it
God-damn it
Not exactly according to plan
Do we have to do everything ourselves
Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust
He reaches into his pocket, taking out a
(into  ) Codename Rooster
Passcode First Strike
Jack's eyes go wide
(into  ) Proceed with remote detonation
Jack leaps --  Tyler
The  is knocked away
Jack Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles off
Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it
Tyler's getting to his feet, sees the gun, annoyed
Jack stands
Haven't we already done this
Jack
Bullets pass right thorough Tyler
Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the floor and  on it,  it
(pointing) How'd you do that
You're a fucking figment of my imagination
you're psychogenic fugue state
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination
Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet
There's no walkie- talkie there
Jack looks down, sees the - under his own foot
Oh
Christ
Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end
Why
why
why
Why what
Why can't  get rid of you
Why can't  just wish you away
You need me
No, no,  don't
(pause) thank you,  really do
Thank you, but  don't need you anymore
Look,  can be selfish,  know that
(pause) 'm not blind to my own failings
Noooo, please
Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary
From now on, we'll share Marla
We've been spending too much time apart
no, no, no
No more running off without you
From here on out, we do it together
Why are you doing this
'm doing this for us
Please understand
've gotten all can from this, Tyler
(sullen) If  leave, you will be right back where  found you
swear on my life,  won't
You will
You know you will
Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head
He looks at the gun in his hand
Can you live with that
Jack stares at the gun a long time
then
Jack brings the gun up,
Tyler cocks his head
What are you doing
What have you left for me
Why do you want to do that
Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth
Not my mouth
Our mouth
Tyler is calm
This is interesting
Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands very close to Jack
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy
It's the only way to get rid of you
Jack  the hammer on the gun
can see you feel very strongly feel strongly too
(pause) Hey, you and me
(pause) Friends again
Their eyes are locked, unblinking
Long silence
Do something for me
What
Appreciate something
What
Look at me
What
My eyes are open
: Jack's finger squeezes the trigger
-- Jack's cheeks  with gas
His eyes bulge
flies out from his head
The  behind him wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts
as the   behind Jack
Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air
What's that smell
Jack slumps to the floor
Tyler falls
Tyler hits the ground
The back of '  is , revealing blood, skull and brain
Suddenly, a  of   burst into the room, moving forward to Jack
'
Are you all right, sir
Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole blown in his
He's bleeding hard, but he's alive
'm okay
Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to see
enter with Marla
One holds a gun to Marla as she struggles
Are you sure
You look terrible, sir
What's happened
Everything's fine
Sir, you look really awful
Do you need medical assistance
Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls
Bring the girl to me
The rest of you get out
Now
The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting
What happened
Don't ask
Marla crouches, takes out wadded  and tries to apply
them to Jack's wound
Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly
Get to the rendezvous point
Move it
Jack and Marla are left alone
My God, you're shot
Yes
Jack tries to got up
Marla helps him
Who did this to you
did,  think
But, 'm okay
'm fine
the glass walls rattle
Jack and Marla look --   : a  ; collapsing upon itself
Then, into a massive cloud of dust
Jack and Marla are silhouetted against the
Jack looks to Marla, reaches to take her hand
'm sorry
you met me at a very strange time in my life
Marla looks at him
and inward
