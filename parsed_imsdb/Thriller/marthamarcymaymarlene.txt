Written by Sean Durkin - It is a hot summer day
large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley
tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock
work in a vegetable garden
hang wet clothes on a clothes line
work in a cluttered garage on an old car
sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch
One woman breast feeds a new born
The others knit a large blanket
and   swim naked in a swimming hole
in his forties sits alone in a room reading
chops wood
bare foot  plays alone in the driveway
- large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor
are in the kitchen preparing food
, sets a table for eight
Martha is beautiful but appears run down
She is 24 years old but her weathered face makes her look older
bell rings off screen
- The men sit around a table eating dinner
One man sits at the head of the table, this is
Patrick is older than the other men
To his right is , a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy beard
2
- The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting
The men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk outside
The women file into the dining room, clear the men's dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a new serving of food
- The women sit around the table eating very small portions of low protein food
Katie sits at the head of the table
: - The kitchen is filled with dishes
sleep next to each other in an old broken crib
teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the crib
People are strewn all over the house sleeping
Suddenly, a figure passes quickly through frame
- Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up the driveway
She carries a small bag
Her pace becomes increasingly faster
She looks back to see a teenage girl, , standing in the window watching
Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the woods
As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run
:
Off screen, the house
urgently yells out: " " The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind
For a moment everything is quiet
3
Suddenly,   and   enter frame and run into the woods, chasing after Martha
- The woods are dark
Martha runs as fast as she can
She hears the 's voice calling her from a distance
man and two women are chasing her
Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill
She keeps running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls
Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and begin their descent
Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her pass by
- Martha uses a pay phone at a diner
She dials and waits
She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion
Hello
Hello
Hi
Martha
Yeah
Oh my god
Where are you
'm not sure
Upstate  think
You're in New York
think
Yeah
When did you get back
4
Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears
(') Martha
What's wrong
What's happened
don't know
should go back
Go back where
have to go,  can't stay gone
No, no, no
Don't go
What are you talking about
Sorry for calling
Martha
Don't hang up
Please
Do not hang up
() Do you want me to come get you
can't wait that long
What do you mean
Tell me where you are and 'll come right now
It's okay, you don't have to- want to see you Martha
Please
Martha thinks for a moment
(') Martha
- Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries
She devours the food like she hasn't eaten in days
5
The entrance bell rings
Martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth
walks in
They are seated
Martha returns to eating
'  (
) Marcy May
It is Watts
His voice paralyzes her
What are you doin'
Martha stops eating
He slides into the booth and sits across from her
Watts reaches over and takes some french fries
He eats them slowly, enjoying every bite
She can't look at him
(') We were worried about you
'm fine
Patrick's worried about you
just wanted to come into town
could've brought you
wanted to walk
Through the woods
( ) Can  get you something
No
( ) You done
Yeah
6
The waitress goes to take Martha's plate
Watts puts his hand out to stop her
( ) You not gonna eat that
Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth
The waitress clears the plate
Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews
(') You ready to go
Martha doesn't respond
(') Come on
Not right now
No
The waitress drops the check on the table
Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers
He sorts through them and separates a $20 bill
He stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket
He grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed
(') 'll get this
He lets go
Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table
She does not look at him
He leans in and forces eye contact with her
Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner
It is very busy
He does not want to make a scene in front of all these people
He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek
She doesn't kiss back
He holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts
She reluctantly kisses him on the lips
Martha watches him walk outside
As soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly cuts through the kitchen
7
- Martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at an empty bus stop
She does not look well
She turns and vomits behind the bench
- Martha hides between two parked buses
She watches a pull into the parking lot
, a well dressed woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car
Martha walks towards Lucy
Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha
'  - Martha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against the window watching the road behind her in the side view mirror
It's nice to see you
You too
Lucy notices that Martha's left ear is bruised
What's going on
Not much
You alright
Yeah
You sure
Yeah
You were pretty upset on the phone
Sorry
over reacted

To what
Martha thinks
(') What happened
We had a fight
Who
Me and this guy
Who
Martha doesn't answer
(') Your boyfriend
Martha nods
(') Did he hurt you
No
Are you sure
No
'm fine
Lucy is skeptical
Did you guys break up
Martha nods
(') How long were you together
while
9
How long
don't know
Maybe a year, maybe more or less
And you were here the whole time
Martha nods
(') You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me
'm sorry
Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm
Well, 'm glad you're here now
/'  - Lucy makes the bed
Martha enters the room wrapped in a towel
Her hair drips on the floor
made you some tea
Thanks
Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair
Ted should be up from the city soon
He'll cook us some dinner
'm pretty tired, is it okay if  just go to bed
Of course
() Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow
10
Lucy leaves
Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her wet towel
- Lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of
The front door opens
She puts on a smile as  enters
He speaks with a
He sets down his bag and gives her a hug and a kiss
Well
She seems okay
What did she say
Not much, she's pretty tired
Where's she been
She had some boyfriend, they were living in the Catskills
What
It's okay
Not really Lucy
It's fine
She's here now
Ted keeps his comments to himself
( ) Well, how long's she staying
() don't know
11
told you she was fine
You spend all that time worrying
Ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor cabinet and pours a scotch
: - The house is completely dark
Martha finds her way through the hallway and into the kitchen
She drinks water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst
The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is beyond that
Martha is scared to look outside
She forces herself to slowly turn and look
She puts her head down and quickly returns to her room
/'  - Martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor
Martha
Why are you on the floor
Martha does not know where she is
moment passes before she starts to come to
'm sorry
It's okay, you were in a deep sleep
Come have some breakfast
- Lucy and Ted eat at the kitchen table
Martha enters
Martha
Welcome
Hi
12
Great to finally meet you
You sleep alright
Yeah
How do you like the house
It's just a rental
Well  love it
Lucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha
It's nice
didn't know there was a lake
Yeah
Do you still like to swim
You don't live in the city anymore
We do
This is for weekends and holidays
Ted and Lucy eat, Martha takes miniscule bites
(') Ted's finishing a new building down town and when it's done we're taking one of the new apartments
You want to see pictures
Lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room
Martha sniffs her food
Ted doesn't notice
( ) Do you think she's excited to have you back
Lucy re-enters with her digital camera
This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished
It's nice right
() 13
(') We were supposed to move in the spring but construction halted, so, it'll just be a little while longer
() Yep, just a little while longer
Okay, sorry, no more work talk
Lucy notices that Martha isn't eating
(') Aren't you hungry
Not really, sorry
Well, you've got to eat
It's okay,  can fix you something later
Martha, feeling on the spot, forces down a big bite
- Martha sits cross legged on a sun bed looking out to the lake
Ted naps while Lucy sun bathes reading Where are we
Connecticut
How far are we
From what
Yesterday
Lucy is confused
She tries to make sense of the question
You mean where  picked you up
14
Martha nods
(') About 3 hours
() Why
Just wondered
Lucy goes back to reading
Martha lies down and stares at the sky
light banging sound starts to echo over the lake
- :  light breeze in the trees and the water gently hitting the dock
Patrick and two men build a fence
: Martha lies in the open field smoking cigarettes with , a girl in her early twenties
Martha is younger, more energetic and confident
They are laughing and talking when Zoe notices Patrick walking towards them
Put out your cigarette
() Why
Just do it
They put out their cigarettes
Zoe buries them in the grass
Patrick approaches them
Is that him
Yeah
( ) Hey
15
Is this Martha
Hi
How're you doing
Patrick crouches down over Zoe but smiles at Martha
Great
You've got a really nice place here
It's as much yours as it is mine
He glances at her legs, then back up to her face
He turns his attention to Zoe
(') thought you quit
did
It's disgusting
know
'm sorry
Don't apologize to me, it's your body
Patrick gestures towards Martha
(') Look after this girl properly Zoe, she deserves some real care for once in her life
will
She's been great, everyone's been great
Good
() You look like a Marcy May
16
Marcy was my grandmothers name
Well, there you go
He continues to walk through the field
Zoe and Martha recline into the grass and continue talking
(
) 'm going for a dip
Anyone want to join
Sure
Martha stands up and brushes herself off
(') You coming
- Martha turns to Zoe but Lucy is there instead, lying on the sun bed, lost in her book
Lucy does not answer
Ted runs down the dock and dives into the water
Martha follows
Ted looks back to see Martha stand at the end of the dock, take off her clothes and dive in naked
Martha swims, lost in her own world
Lucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the end of the dock
Ted swims back and gets out
() Brilliant choice of swim wear
Lucy is not amused
Ted walks away laughing
He turns to sneak one more glimpse of Martha
Martha
What are you doing
What
Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked
17
Why
You just can't
There are kids around and people come by
So
So you can't
We don't, just don't have a bathing suit you can borrow
Martha gets out of the water
Lucy wraps the towel around her and walks away
Martha dries off
She feels embarrassed
/'  - Martha sleeps
Lucy notices the bruising on Martha's ear
Martha
() 've been trying to wake you
You should get up or you won't sleep through the night
Martha wakes up
(') You should eat
will
'm just going to sleep a little more first okay
Okay
'm sorry  got frustrated with you before
It's okay
Lucy leaves
Martha opens the window and dumps the pasta outside then goes back to sleep
18
- She's not coming
She's in a really deep sleep
can't wake her
She seems a bit off, no
She's just really tired
() She's had a bad breakup
want to give her a couple days to get situated, you know
Has she always been like this
pain in my ass, yes
They laugh
'  /   - Martha sits up in bed wide awake
She turns and stares out her window into the dark trees that surround the lake house
: - An    pulls out of the driveway
Martha sweeps the front porch
She notices the car pull away
,  young man in his early twenties, comes outside and sits down next to her
Max is warm, nice, and care free
He's not very bright but he is a good time to be around
Hey Marcy
19
Hey Max
() Where do they go at night
don't know,  never get invited
He jumps over the banister and reaches under the porch
(') You want to have a drink with me
He pulls out a little flask and shakes it
mischievous smile grows on his face
(') They won't be back for a few hours
shouldn't
'm not going to drink for awhile,  think it's a good idea for me
Alright
Patrick'll know
It's cool, 'm good at hiding it
- People are scattered around a large room sleeping
Watts enters and bangs two pots together to wake everyone
/  - Martha other girls get dressed in the communal closet
- Martha does dishes, Katie clears the table
We switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things
() Do you knit
20
No
can learn though
It's okay, you'll find your role
It takes time for people to find their role in a new family
Katie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around
(') We sell blankets in town
We still need some money, but when the farm's up and running we'll be self sufficient and we'll never have to worry about it again
When do you think that'll happen
Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see
It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash
That'll be nice
Katie accidentally drops a plate
Shoot
Martha gets down and starts to clean it up
- Martha, Watts, Max, Zoe and a few others sit around and listen to two men play guitar
Everyone is talking and laughing and having a nice time
Patrick approaches
He observes everyone for a moment, he seems agitated
He speaks above everyone and above the music
How's everything going so far Marcy May
Good
The guys stop playing music
21
You like it here
Yeah, it's really nice
want you to feel at home
do
Thanks
People have abandoned you your whole life
don't blame you for not trusting anyone
What
If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down
Martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot
(') It's not your fault, but it's there
If you feel safe here, and  think you do, let us in
We just want to help you
Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome
If you're going to live here then really be apart of things
- Lucy is putting away groceries
Martha enters
Good morning
How are you feeling today
Good
There's this great juice shop in town, got us a couple of juices
() 22
(') This one is Kale with ginseng
It gives me energy, so  thought it might help you
Martha takes a sip
It tastes terrible but she drinks it
(') got pineapple orange too if that's better
Maybe that's better
Sorry, thanks
also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack
Martha watches Lucy put the groceries away
Why is the house so big
It's not that big
For two people, it's huge
We like to entertain
Our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties
It's just good to have space
So no one else lives here
Of course no one else lives here
/  - It is hot, sunny, and peaceful
Martha sits cross legged
Ted reads the newspaper
Lucy sunbathes
Martha notices they wear wedding rings
() You're married
Yeah
23
When
Earlier this year, in the spring
There is an awkward silence
(') tried to get in touch with you, apparently you got rid of your cell phone
lost it
You never got a new one
got used to not having it
Cocktail anyone
No thanks
Martha
Martha shakes her head
Ted walks to the back of the boat
Martha has to stand up to let him pass through the narrow walk way
He brushes up against her as he squeezes by
Was it a big wedding
No, about forty people
Mostly his family
() Did Aunt Dora come
Yeah
Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything
24
Ted laughs
She's not that bad
You never had to live with her
You lived with Dora
She lived with me after mom died
( ) Where were you
College
Lucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha
(') Well 'm sure she'd love to know you're okay
() She hates me
She doesn't hate you
() Look at me
hate her
Martha notices the camera and quickly turns away
Relax,  don't have any pictures of you
( ) Jesus you're gorgeous
It's annoying
Martha cracks a smile
Lucy snaps the shot
(') There you go
Lucy hands Martha the Polaroid, she shakes it
25
(') Don't shake it, that's a myth
Martha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the Polaroid
Is it true married people don't fuck
What
No
Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at Martha's ass as he passes
Martha is embarrassed
She stares at the Polaroid
/  '  - Martha sits on the bed watching Lucy go through her closet looking at old clothes
Lucy holds up a summer dress
Put this on
You're kidding
Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it
Why does it matter
It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable
Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose
(') It looks good you little shit
Whatever makes you happy mama bear
You're making fun of me and  think it looks really good
They both laugh
26
- Martha wears Lucy's dress
Ted, Lucy and Martha sit around the table eating dinner
Ted picks at the food
It's no good
It's good, it's just, a bit dry
It's not dry
Martha laughs
Ted starts laughing
Lucy tries it again
(') It just needs a little salt
What are you laughing about  cooked for you your whole life
You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks
Ted and Martha continue to laugh
Lucy gets up from the table
She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food
/   '  - Ted and Lucy get ready for bed
She seems better today
Yeah
wish  didn't have to go tomorrow
Let me take you
No,  don't want to leave her alone
() You'll be nice to her right
'm always nice
27
Right
They laugh and kiss
'  - Martha lies awake in bed staring at the ceiling
She is lost deep in thought
: /  - ' ,
/   - Martha seems like she has been drugged, she has a white robe draped around her
Katie consoles her and makes her drink water
know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good
We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad
We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us
() Do you believe me
Martha nods
/  - Zoe and Martha share a single mattress on the floor in a small dark room
Martha is still wrapped in the robe, she is still dazed
28
You're so lucky, 'd give anything to have my first time again
Really
Yeah, it's so special
can't remember anything,  just woke up on the floor and felt this pain - That's the cleansing
It's good
It means it's working if you can't remember things
You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins
Martha is distant
(') You need to share yourself, don't be so selfish
'm not
So smile then, enjoy this amazing night
It only happens once
Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead
They curl up together in a very intimate way
Martha smiles
Zoe kisses her on the lips
Martha is caught off guard
She laughs
They have a second peck on the lips before closing their eyes to sleep
- The group sits around listening to Max finish playing a song
Everyone claps for him
Patrick, who sits in the back, stands up and walks up to the stage
Everyone gets excited
He tunes his guitar
This one's called Marcy's song
29
Martha sits in the back listening
Everyone turns around to look at her
She watches on as Patrick begins to play
The song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song
The whole group is entranced
Martha is mesmerized by him
(') Well she, she's just a picture
Who lives on my wall Well she, she's just a picture And the reason, reason, reason it is so small
With a smile so inviting and a body so tall, She, she's just a picture Just a picture ' Well you stand there, stand there with the nightshade, Her dripping ripping down your hands And you ask me, ask me about the And the lady, lady, lady she understands It's a dream for the future and the water for the sands And the strangeness is wandering Through many callin' lands - Ted walks into the kitchen
Martha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen floor
Ted gets a six pack out of the fridge
He cracks a beer and drinks it
What are you doing
Cleaning
() thought 'd help out more
Alright
'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come
30
Is Lucy coming
She had to run to the city
Oh
'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on
It's okay
Come on
- Ted drives the boat with a beer in his hand
He moves over and motions for Martha to take the wheel
Ted slowly lets go and moves over so she can take the helm
They brush up against each other
Martha is driving the boat
She bounces up and down like an excited little girl
- Martha and Ted sit on the back of the boat
Ted gets a beer out of the cooler
You want one
Ted hands her a beer
She stares at the beer and hesitates before taking a giant chug
(') Beautiful day
Yeah
How have things been with you and Lucy
Fine
31
Is it strange to spend time together
No
Why
It's been a long time
don't know, it's normal  guess
She hasn't changed much
Martha takes a swig of her beer
(') Where is she
At the doctor
Why
She's getting a check up
() We're trying to have a baby
Martha laughs to herself
The beer is affecting her
(') What
can't imagine it Lucy holding a child
Why
She wouldn't know what to do with it
() Do you want a baby
He gets up and opens two more beers
want what Lucy wants
() If she's happy, 'm happy
He hands one to Martha and sits down again
32
() So you're unhappy
Ted laughs
No
She's good
She's relieved to have you back
You had her worried
Why
You disappeared
You haven't called in two years
lost track  guess
It's good to let people know where you are Martha
People worry
didn't think Lucy would worry about me
Well, she did
There is another awkward silence
They both drink their beer
Can  go swimming
You don't need to ask
Martha takes off her clothes
She is wearing a bikini that Lucy gave her
It does not quite fit
The bathing suit sags and top of her ass shows
Ted tries not to look
- Martha brings her head above water and she is with a group of people from the farm swimming in a swimming hole
33
Martha watches as Watts jumps off the cliff into the water
Everyone cheers him on
Patrick swims up behind Martha
You jump yet
No
Go on
Watts swims by and guides her out of the water
Watts and Martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a rock face
You ready
can't
Sure you can
Watts jumps
Martha stands alone at the top of the cliff naked
Everyone is looking up at her cheering her on
She builds up the courage and jumps
She hits the water, everything goes dark
The frame fills with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated
She continues to swim, the camera follows her under water
The darkness of the water makes the screen go black
- The hallway is dark, the space is unclear
Martha walks down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house
She walks into Patrick's room
She get's into bed with him and curls up in his arms and falls asleep
She looks safe and happy
He welcomes her, the room looks warm and comforting
: 34
/'  - Martha sleeps
Something hits the roof
Martha wakes up
,
Martha sits up and listens
She waits in anticipation
'  - Martha walks down the dark hallway and slowly opens the door to Ted and Lucy's room
Ted and Lucy are having sex
Martha watches for a moment, then creeps into the room and quietly curls up on the edge of the bed
Lucy does not see Martha
Ted does not say anything, he continues to have sex with Lucy
His motion becomes harder, Lucy opens her eyes and Ted jumps up
() What
What
Ted gestures to Martha
(') Martha, what are you doing
Nothing
Ted turns on the light
He sits on the edge of the bed
Jesus, you can't just come in like that
Sorry
Martha gets up to leave
God damn it, what's wrong
Martha stops and stands facing the door
It's been hard to sleep alone
All you do is sleep
35
Martha goes to leave again
( ) Stay, just stay
Martha comes back and sits on the bed
(') () Why would you think it was okay to come in like that
don't know
It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side
You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal
It's private
Sorry
Don't apologize,  just want you to understand why it's not okay
Okay
Do you
Yeah
Well
Because it's privte and it's not normal
Lucy can see something is really wrong
Just lie down Martha
Martha lies in Lucy's lap
Lucy is uncomfortable with the contact, she pushes Martha's head onto a pillow
36
This is just brilliant
Ted stands up and puts on his sweatpants and walks out
Martha closes her eyes
: /'  - Martha wakes up in Patrick's room, he is gently having sex with her
She doesn't enjoy it but she doesn't stop him
- Ted is half asleep on the couch
Lucy sits to wake him
Martha is lying in their bed listening to them through the cracked doorway
'm sorry you slept out here
Thanks for being patient
don't have much choice do
just want to make sure she's okay
get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before  have to go back to work
know
am under so much pressure right now- know you are
have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it
That has nothing to do with Martha
37
My point is,  don't need the extra stress
'm her only family
She needs to be able to depend on me right now
() It's complicated Ted
As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane
Martha pretends to go back to sleep
- Lucy works in the garden
Martha walks over to help
Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night
No
Maybe it's the pine cones
() Where did you pick up gardening
We had a garden where  lived
You're good
'm good at some things
know you are
They continue to work
Lucy builds up the courage
(') Was he ever physical with you
Who
Your boyfriend
38
What do you mean
Did he ever, hit you
No
You had a bruised ear, and when you called me you were hysterical
Martha feels her ear
(') Are you sure
Yes
You can tell me
He never hit me
Beat
wish you felt more comfortable talking to me
do
So talk
There's nothing to talk about
had a boyfriend, he lied to me,  left
That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big - Martha, Zoe and Katie work in the garden
Several men, are lifting heavy rocks to make a stone wall
Max is in the hay loft
Zoe is tucked around the corner smoking a cigarette
Patrick catches her
39
He swats it out of her hand and scolds her
After a moment he puts his forehead to her forehead and caresses her head
( ) Don't stare
Zoe walks back to the garden
You okay
Yeah
He's right
don't know why 'm so weak
You're not
You'll quit
An    pulls into the driveway
, no more than fifteen years old gets out
(') Who's that
Her name's Sarah  think
welcome  and walk her into the house
(') ( ) You should handle her
You think
You're ready
Zoe can help but you'll be great
'  - Martha sits in the passenger seat, Lucy drives
Martha notices a   is parked at the top of the driveway on the side of the road
Martha is troubled by the parked car's presence
Whose car was that
40
don't know
Why
Just curious
There's a hiking trail, people leave their cars there all the time
- Lucy looks through produce
Martha takes the cart and runs down the isle with it
She picks her feet off the ground so she is riding on the cart
Lucy is amused
Martha turns around and goes faster, flying all the way down the isle
good looking   walks into the isle
Martha almost hits him with the cart but she slams her feet on the floor and just misses him
Lucy runs up and takes the shopping cart back
Martha doesn't say anything, she just stares at him
Sorry
It's okay
The young man walks down the isle
Martha watches him go
You're going to hurt someone
Martha is distracted
(') Can you go get me a large jug of water
What's wrong with the tap
like bottled
It's a waste
Will you get it or not
41
/  - Martha walks through the refrigerated section looking for water
She notices the Young Man walking behind her
She stops to get water
He stops to buy beer
He looks at her
She grabs the water and walks away
'  - Martha and Lucy get into the car in the grocery store parking lot
Martha watches the rear view mirror
Did you know that guy
What guy
The guy in the store
The one you almost ran into
No
He was looking at me like he knew me
() Did you say something to him
Like what
don't know, you tell me
What are you talking about
() He was staring at me like he knew me, did you talk to him about me
() No
Jesus
The guy was checking you out Martha
Relax
(Lucy starts the car
) () 42
(') If you don't want guys to drool all over you, then wear more clothes- Just drive the car Lucy
What
Drive the car
- Lucy is unpacking groceries
Ted enters
Lucy puts something in a cupboard
Ted takes it out and puts it in a different cupboard
don't think we should have the party
It's labor day, we always have it
Things are just too stressful right now
've already invited clients
'm sure people would understand- They wouldn't
just think it would be best
For who, Martha
For all of us
It's not an option
We're having the party
And that's the end of it, because you say so
43
Yes
/ - Martha shows Sarah a large walk in closet
Martha puts Sarah's clothes on a shelf with all the other clothes
We share all of this, if it fits, you can wear it
Cool
They walk into a small bedroom
This is where we sleep
You can take any bed that's open or you can sleep downstairs
They walk downstairs
And see another large bedroom
'm hungry, can we eat
We don't eat until the evening
Really
At the bottom of the stairs, several make shift beds are laid out on the floor
You'll get used to it
Your body doesn't need that much food
You're taught to overconsume
There is a baby asleep in the crib
He's beautiful
Whose the mother
Katie's, but we all help out
Is Patrick the father
44
Uh huh
They look just like him
() All the kids here are boys
Martha picks one up, she is very natural with him
He only has boys
You're good with them
You want to hold him
No Thanks
() don't have to take care of them do
Not if you don't want to
There are plenty of jobs to be done
() You'll find your role
It takes time for people to find their role in a new family
- Martha walks with Sarah and Zoe across the courtyard and out into the field towards the woods
( ) called my dad today to ask for money
Does Patrick know
He asked me to
Sometimes, if there's something we really need 'll call
How was it
45
Fine, they're not bad people
Did he give you the money
Yeah
He thinks 'm on drugs
Do you tell him you're not
No, that's why he gives it to me
guess he'd rather pay for it than think 'm sucking dick for it
've done drugs
Not a lot but 've tried everything pretty much, except heroin
It's good to try everything at least once
You find out who you are that way
What about drinking, do you drink
have, but  don't
Good, we don't drink
It just makes you angry and less focused
Don't get the wrong idea Sarah
We don't talk to our old families
wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter how much he paid me
Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods
Hey
Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet
Sally, yeah
: 46
- Katie teaches Martha how to make a vegetable drink
Martha adds some herbs
That's enough

She crushes it with a spoon
- Martha is back at the Lake house
Lucy enters and begins to load the dishwasher
Martha holds the glass with the green drink which we now see is just water
'll do these if you want to go to bed
don't mind
Get some sleep
Okay
Martha leaves
Holding the glass tightly, Martha walks to her bedroom
, , /   - Martha enters her bedroom holding the green drink
Sarah sits in a chair wearing a
The room is no longer Martha's bedroom at the lake, it is a small dark room at the farm
47
Oh, hi
Hi
Sarah is nervous
Martha brushes Sarah's hair
(') What do  have to do
Nothing you don't want to
Drink this, it will help you relax
Sarah takes a sip of a thick green drink
She gags
(') It's herbal
It's the start of your cleansing
Martha lifts the bottom of the glass to force it down
(') We've all done it so you know there's nothing to worry about
Do  have to wear this robe
() know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it
Sarah looks very uncomfortable
She is getting light headed from the drink
(') You look amazing
It's your special night with him, enjoy it, you'll be great
Thanks
Martha helps Sarah up and passes her through a door to the next room
She removes Sarah's robe and lays her on the ground
Martha shuts the door locking her in
Martha lies down on the floor and curls up into a ball
48
'  - Martha wakes up wearing Lucy's dress
She has wet herself
Martha takes off the dress and stuffs it between the mattress and the box spring
- Martha sits alone on the steps looking out onto the water
She is deep in thought
Lucy walks down the stairs and sits next to her
Shouldn't we start cooking
just made some potato salad
Ted's cooking the fish
thought we were going to cook
We cooked last night
Oh, yeah
Martha is lost deep in thought
(') Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed
Not really
Beat
(') Do you blame me for anything
No
() Like what
49
don't know
() 'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking
didn't think about it
Really
We were far apart
Sometimes  wonder if, maybe  could have taken better care of you
() The past doesn't matter
It does matter
took care of myself
know you did
think  could have done more though
Stop it
Be honest with me, you never think about it
No
You're not angry at me
know you don't think much of me but knew what  was doing then and  still do
50
No, Martha,  think the world of you, 'm just wondering if  should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential
don't need your guidance,  never did
'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now  know  am, know who  am
Teacher and a leader
What are you talking about
always encouraged you to do more, but you shut me out
Martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought
(') - Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head
(
) () Dinner's ready
- Ted, Lucy and Martha eat at the dinner table
So what are your plans Martha
For what
Life
don't know
Are you thinking about what you can do for work
51
No
You're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career
Why
It's a part of adult life
There are other ways to live
Really
Sure
Like what
don't know
People don't need careers, people should just exist
Ted laughs
He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in
Maybe we can help you get some ideas together
have moments when  would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way
You can do that if you want to
It's not that simple
() It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions
It's just not the right way to live
52
Lucy is floored by Martha's response
And what do you think the right way to live is
Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain
You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth
You're rude
Martha, with a frightening streak of viciousness stands up to Ted
You don't know anything about it
Ted and Lucy are speechless
Martha leaves
- Martha sneaks downstairs in the middle of the night
Ted and Lucy are asleep in their room
Martha picks up the phone and dials a number
picks up
Hello
Hello
Who's this
Who's this
() Zoe
She not there
She's not
Where is she
Who is this
Who is this
It's Marlene Lewis
Who's this
53
Martha hangs up
The phone rings
She unplugs the phone and collapses on the floor
: - Martha and the others are practicing pick pocketing
Martha looks out into the feild to see Patrick talking with Sarah
She is enamoured by him
- Zoe, Martha, Sarah and  are shooting bottles in the woods
Watts said 'm supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but  think you're hopeless
'm surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it
Please, 'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday
Zoe shoots and hits a bottle
He comes up behind Zoe, wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her breasts
She moves his hands away
Sarah watches on
(') God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes my willy hard
Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several shots
He misses the bottles
What happened Doc
should be teaching you
He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle
Alright, my turn
Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping the gun
54
() Alright Max, was this just an excuse to grope Marcy
'm teaching her how to shoot
Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze
Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac
Martha fires a few shots and misses
Focus
Take a deep breath
Think about someone who wronged you
Feel it, feel how they made you feel in your stomach
Take a deep breath, feel it all moving out into your hands
Let it build
It's transferring to the gun, building in the gun
Now release
She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters smile grows on martha's face
(') () Feels good right
Martha nods
Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out
(') Now try that
What do you mean
Shoot it
They're living animals
So, shoot Max then
Patrick lifts Martha's hand so the gun is pointing at Max
Max is frozen, he smiles awkwardly
(') Go on
Max is confused, he gets embarrassed
55
Fuck this
Don't walk away from me Max
Max stops
Martha drops the gun down to her waist
(') The cat has terminal cancer, it's in excruciating pain
can't
Max has no substance, he's just here to free load and be around the girls but you're a teacher and leader, you just don't see it because no one let you believe it before me
You're a leader a Marcy, now prove it
Martha is shook up
She does not fire the gun
(') The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing you think you used to love
You're holding on to some false emotion that stops you from doing what's right
Zoe takes the gun out of Martha's hand
The gun goes off
Martha and Max jump
Zoe shot the cat without blinking
She hands the gun back to Martha
(') could spend my life being selfish, living alone, using this gift for me but 've sacrificed myself to be what you all need me to be
You need to trust me
trust you
Then you shouldn't need me to explain everything
gun shot goes off
They all look up
Max looks mortified, he has shot the other cat
(') What did you do
56
You said it was sick
One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one it was
Max tosses the gun and walks away
- Martha looks for Max
She finds him in the hay loft
You okay
'm fine
() 'll probably leave this place soon anyways
Where are you going to go
got places
My cousin lives in Bennington, he said  could go up there and make like, $500 a week selling weed
You don't want to do that
don't care what  do
'm sick of all these rules
Max, they're not rules
It's just common sense
It feels like rules
They won't let me do anything
can't even go on the house runs
'd be great at taking shit
It's not about taking shit
Sounds like it's about taking shit to me
57
And that's why you don't get to come
You just don't get it
() You need to quit drinking
'm not drinking
Martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale
You're still living with all the shit you carried out there
You're the only one, let it go
'll try
No
You can't try
You have to stop
They love you, they just want you to be stronger
'm strong, they'll see
Max leans up and tries to kiss her
Martha stops him
She hugs him instead
You'll be okay

Martha screams
It's Ted
Jesus Christ you scared me
Sorry
They take a moment to calm down
Did  wake you
No

Me neither

() You want to watch
Martha thinks about it

It always helps me
It's better than lying in bed awake
He takes a couple of beers out of the fridge

They are drinking cocktails and talking in the house and on the back porch
Jazz plays over speakers

(') Can  get you something
used to like this
She points at the tequila
Straight
She stands there looking dazed
She doesn't respond
He just pours it
He is confused by her
thought you weren't supposed to drink Mike

Breath
Don't touch me, you're not listening to me
66
Martha please try to breath

Patrick enters the bedroom and sits on her bed with Martha
Martha closes her eyes pretending to sleep
Look at me
Patrick runs his hands through her hair
(') You okay
Uh huh
There is a long silence
Martha is clearly not okay
You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right
Death is beautiful because everyone fears death
And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness
When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in
It brings you to and that makes you truly present
And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love
So, death is pure love

Zoe
Yeah

It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time

Patrick calms down
He sits
(') Maybe  asked too much from you too soon

You need help Martha
know
What happened to you
Martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her eyes
(') What happened to you
() don't know
Lucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is too far gone
We're going to get you proper help
There is a long moment of silence
Are you going to send me away

() Please don't
Please don't
can't help you
78
Please,  can't be alone, please
We're trying to start a family and don't trust you to be here
Lucy walks away
Lucy
What
Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs
(') What
You're going to be a terrible mother
Lucy freezes, she tries to stay calm but bursts into tears
There is a long, tense silence
Lucy dries her eyes
Do you have any money left
Martha shakes her head
(') Of course you don't
() We'll make sure everything is taken care of
Lucy walks away, Martha is frozen on the stairs
- Martha walks through the house
All of the luggage is packed and sitting by the front door
Ted sits on the couch eating a sandwich and drinking a beer
79
- It is an overcast, unusually cold Labor Day
Lucy works in the garden
Going swimming
Yeah
It's a bit chilly
don't mind
think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean
Yeah
We scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning
Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices footprints
What's it like there
It looks nice
Martha turns and walks down to the water
(') We're heading back to the city in about an hour
You'll be ready to go
Yep
- Martha stands on the dock
She strips down to her underwear and dives in
80
Martha swims out into the lake
She drops under the water and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the surface
few seconds pass by and she is not coming up
Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for air
She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice homes that appear to be empty now
No one else is swimming
Martha sees a scruffy  sitting on a neighboring dock, he seems familiar
He is in his mid twenties, his jeans are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water
His shirt is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette
He looks directly at Martha
They make eye contact
He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water, puts on his shirt and just sits there
Martha swims back to the house
'  - Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car
Ted drives and Lucy sits up front
They drive up the driveway and turn out onto the road
Ted and Lucy talk
Martha gets a concerned look on her face
Ted slams on the breaks
Jesus Christ
Are you okay
Yeah
Fucking idiot
What was he doing
The  from the dock walks past the car
They almost hit him
As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into the a brown car, start the engine and drive
The car drives behind Ted's car
Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back again to see that he is still there
81
She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying something but then stops herself
Instead she sits in silence
