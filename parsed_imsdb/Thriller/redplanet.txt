voice begins to speak
An older, wise voice
Bud Chantilas
We'll meet him later
(
) The Earth
From space
In all its glory, the most perfect, self-regulating organism you could imagine
We went out there; we turned around; we looked back; we saw it
You'd think we'd behold and learn something
(beat) We didn't
The   in one corner of the screen
1961
(
) It was 1961 when we first went into space
There were four billion people in the world
The   in the other
(
) And at a rate that was scarcely comprehensible, we began to poison and populate our planet
, the  as well
The big, sparkling blue marble that is Earth begins to lose its luster and slowly turns gray
By the year 2000, the population is six billion
(
) We increased by 80 million people a year
Pumped out our toxins beyond measure
Destroyed our resources killed forests, trees, plants, animals
Anything that couldn't be trademarked and sold at a profit we annihilated without a thought
We killed half of what was on the planet
We didn't care
Right about the millennium, we got another warning
: in the midst of a pond
Surrounded by hundreds of dead, dying and deformed frogs
(
) We killed all the frogs
Every frog on the face of the planet
We'd killed species before, sure, even a genus or two
But this time we wiped out an entire phylum
As the frogs breathe through their skin and react to toxins in the environment faster, this should have been a warning, canary in the coal mine kind of thing
The last frog dies
(
) Nah, we didn't pay any attention to that either
The only people who were really upset were the French
And no one really likes the French
We - : - and   begin to  again
The planet grows dimmer and dimmer
The oceans grayer and grayer
(
) By 2050 there were 12 billion people
It took us 100 years to go from the Industrial Revolution to putting a man in space
It took us only another 100 to poison and overpopulate the planet so seriously that if we didn't go out and find somewhere else to live, we realized we were gonna die out as a species ourselves in the next two generations
: billion stars
We    - - spaceship unlike anything you've seen
Thirteen spheres up front, cuboctoahedral packing
The  (Mars Entry Vehicle), a large cylinder behind
The whole thing is slowly turning
:      ( 190) The ship floats by to reveal - Red, huge, and very close
which we hear - (
) Houston, we are go for Mars orbit acquisition
(
) You are go
Nice flight
Godspeed
Engines light up in the back of the craft
The ship heads down towards Mars
Enters orbit
Disappears around the back side
:  - The        ,  the  until we are   - writhing ball of plasma
The surface roils, waves of energy pass by and a flare starts to grow and expand out from one quadrant like a giant volcanic eruption

Monitors around record the event as well

Science Officer,  , turns to the Flight Director,
The bad news is it's directional, and most of it's going toward Mars

He looks to the Capcom,
News gets worse
No comm
They're on backside
They'll be clear in

( All the crew in mission control wear small Projected Image Monocles (PIMs) over their dominant eye
There are no giant viewscreens dominating the room as in missions past
When so moved, the flight director can throw an image on a large general viewscreen
But unless noted, there are no projected images in the room
) - Dark side of Mars
The Ares is a slightly shining speck, moving towards the horizon and light
At 17,000 mph
-   - Commander   is at the helm
She's got a kind of quiet assurance
You'd like her
Mission co-pilot   is beside and behind her
She speaks into a mike to rest of the ship - We have stable orbit
We've got three laps around, ninety minutes each
In four and a half hours, we will launch the Mars Entry Vehicle
floats in through the hatch in the back
He's been waiting 309 million miles for this - Are we there yet
Kate shakes her head
She's about to respond when - They just clear the edge of the planet, lights hit them and
- Wham
One light starts to flicker to red
And then another
Some just go off
What the hell
Santen reaches for the  as it begins to blare
Comm's out
Bowman begins to rapidly reset states
Some hold, some flip back to red
Things are bad, but she's calm
Decides
Single event upsets
All over the board
Latch up
Free flow
We're gonna lose chips
Shut it down
Shut it down
Safety  start to go off
Everything
, some kind of massive flare
(then; into the intercom) Gentlemen, correction, we will launch on this pass
In fact
in five
Santen is shutting off every system he can get his hands on
She reaches to finish it off herself
Proton flux
Event Upsets
Ed, bye
Santen is out of his seat and heading back as fast as he can
Gallagher behind him
ring now as he rushes out, the artificial gravity begins to fail
- The crew madly scrambling everywhere
On the  ,  , Chief Science Officer (60s, graying) is pulling himself into a spacesuit
Popping out of his bunk and into the wall,   (30s, a little dour), grabs a satchel of personal possessions and swims off down an access tube
Gallagher and Santen rush along, careening off the walls
Emerging onto the  deck, looking absolutely calm,   (40s, weathered, unconcerned) stops at an intercom station, presses a toggle - Katherine, you could probably cut off that caterwauling now
'm up from my nap
moment later, the
6 High  couches are faceted about the interior walls, crew names stenciled on them
(Bowman's remains conspicuously empty
)  Santen straps himself in
Chantilas, Burchenal, Pettengill, and Gallagher stream aboard
Start cinching themselves in as - -   - Kate continues to try to shut the ship down
Some circuits do, others flicker/free flow and refuse to stop
One particular circuit will clear, but only as long as she holds it shut manually -  Launch Release
Only takes her a moment to decide
She's not happy, but tries not to let her concern show as - Gentlemen, it seems  will not be able to join you and will maintain the manual release for the  from the Flight Deck
(
) Commander
She has no time or inclination to engage in discussion about her decision
You are go for Mars descent, Lieutenant
On my signal
Santen powers up the smaller craft
Seals the door
He can't believe he's doing this, but he has no choice
We are green across the board
The last of them finish torquing themselves down
Gallagher toggles his intercom to Bowman - Promise you won't leave if we don't like it there
- She responds in kind
Keeps her tone as light as she can
promise
(then) Lieutenant Santen, you have control authority of the
Now
She holds the circuit closed
Lights are starting to flicker off on the board
Waiting is not a good plan
Santen calls out quickly - Crew secure
Secure
Secure
Secure
Secure
Santen slams two large buttons on either side of him
-   - Explosive bolts blow the two halves of the cylinder away
The  is an icosahedron revealed inside
As this is space, and a vacuum, there is no sound
- However, in here, it's
Half a moment later,   and - - The  is blown free of the Ares
Again, oddly silent
Small maneuvering   for a moment, starting the  out of orbit and in free fall towards Mars
It drops, drops, drops and disappears, friction blazing as
-   - There are still free-flows all over the board
Bowman can't get them to shut down
They flicker, pop on and off
Systems start and shut down and start up again all over the ship
Checks the  again
Still
Control panel on the wall
We hear a
Inside the panel, we see the switch sputtering on/off
It fails, arcs
Smoke begins to wisp out
-   - red light comes on
Soft
Kate turns
It's a smoke warning in sphere six
-   - Bowman rushes through sphere that's a garden
Another with orchids growing on walls
Artwork on huge  screens
Pulls open panels and slaps down banks of breakers as she goes
Rooms turn dark, the artwork disappears
Only phosphorescent safety lights remain
More
- Bowman yanks out a fire extinguisher
Sprays down the offending area
She is, of course, hurled across the room by the force
For a moment, though, it looks like she's succeeded
Smoke begins to wisp out again
She pushes over, anchors her feet and jams the nozzle into a fire port
Empties it
This time it seems as if she's prevailed
And then a gentle voice on the intercom
(
) Fire
Sphere 5
Fire
Sphere 5
Smoke
Sphere 8
Smoke
Sphere 8
She still doesn't panic
Hurls herself down another access tube and
- Way up in the sky, we can see the tiny flare of the  entering the atmosphere
moment later, a   reaches us
Bowman fights a fire in another sphere
Dark now except for the flickering flames
This time we see them otherworldly round and glowing in the zero
Smoke's in the air it's getting hard to breathe
She puts out the fire, but from the , it's clear she's now fighting a losing battle
-  /  - Kate rushes in
Starts pulling master breakers
are  as the power surges
She's surrounded by a cloud of glittering glass fragments
We can see the fire/smoke panel lit up nearby
The news is bad
Half of the lights are red
She yanks on a spacesuit
Slaps on a small oxygen container
Locks on the waist, wrists
Reaches back to what seems to be a gelatinous hood
Pulls it over her head, locks the front down and the helmet turns rigid and transparent
She throws the last breaker
Life Support
The ship is now dead, but still burning
She clips herself in with a set of safety tethers and
throws open the main hatch
- The venting air crystallizes in a huge white plume
Papers, books, cups, clothing flies forth as well
-  / Bowman is sucked towards the open hatch
Tethers hold
Watching all her air escape is not a calming moment
Without oxygen, the fires subside and die
All of them
The ship is still and dead
/ Total silence
Fire lights are out
Kate shuts the hatch
Finally she lets herself begin to react
Starts to hyperventilate and shake inside her spacesuit
The  has crash-landed
It's a wreck
Air bags deflate
Half  have been destroyed
The icosahedron attempts to unfold
figure struggles out of the shattered craft, collapses on the ground
It wasn't supposed to be like this

- :   9 The air is gray, thick
Stragglers in heavy protective gear struggle through the fetid wind to an airlock on the side of
- and join hundreds of journalists in the audience
Lights dim
In front, face lit from below at a podium, Senior Scientist  , 60s, head of the Space Exploration Office
As many of you may know, in 2032 the Space Exploration Office began a series of unmanned flights to Mars
The entire wall behind him, 40 feet by 100 feet, is a vid screen
As he speaks the images appear
Not as if he's narrating to the footage, but as if it's voice activated
It had been determined by 2020 that Mars harbored no life
Although beginning with the same resources as Earth four billion years ago, Mars didn't support any life beyond the microbial stage in the last 300 million years
Nor did it have an atmosphere or climate supportive of human life
Exactly as he describes it, it occurs
(Icecaps melt, temperature gradients rise, etc
)
In the audience are hundreds of journalists watching
It was, however, concluded that Mars was receptive to terraforming
If we could raise the temperature of the planet by only four degrees, the resultant melting of the ice caps would increase the density of the atmosphere, thus holding greater heat, melting the icecaps further
We could use the greenhouse effect to our benefit
To do this, we needed to increase the oxygen content of the atmosphere
Resultingly, a series of probes were sent, each releasing further and further genetically manipulated lichen and algaes designed to stand the rigors of the Martian environment while augmenting the oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere
In the last 28 years, we have sent 2200 probes
The terraforming was initially successful
We see the probes launching and bursting in aerosol deployments over the Martian surface
Algae blooms
Red, orange, green, black, burnt sienna
Every color you can imagine
Valleys covered with color
The average temperature on Mars has increased two and a half degrees over the last three decades
The oxygen content began to increase as well
And then eleven months ago, the O2 on Mars suddenly began to decline
Soon after, all the remote sensors on the planet ceased functioning
We have no idea what's gone wrong
We need to know why
Man's very destiny may lie in the answer
The color on Mars ebbs away
We are about to embark on the greatest mission of human exploration
By using a number of Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles and a modified close lunar cargo ship, we have created a vessel capable of journeying to Mars
We see construction being rushed along and Hab-1 (a kind of big space ) landing and deploying on Mars as - Three months ago, Hab-1, an unmanned living environment, was launched
In nine days Ares-1, our first manned mission, will be sent to Mars
Ladies and gentlemen,  give you the first men and women to travel beyond the reach of  Earth to the next planet in the solar system
Light comes up on the crew
Lt
Commander Katherine Bowman will supervise the flight component of our mission
Commander Bowman has 2200 hours in space
She will be assisted by Pilot and Mission Specialist Ed Santen
(next) And we're pleased to have Dr
Bud Chantilas come out of retirement as our Chief Science Officer
Bud brings a view as a generalist few can offer, with a Nobel in chemistry and a MacGregor in molecular biology
He was off getting another Ph
, this time in
(checks) theology when we asked him to join us
(next) Dr
Chip Pettengill, who until recently has held the number two position in the Terraforming Office, is an expert in extremophile and cryptoendolithic biology
(then) Dr
Cooper Burchenal, late of Western BioTech has left the private sector to help us
(last) And we are also joined by Robert Gallagher
Santen turns to Kate and quietly mutters
The janitor
His  was on
It  across the room
But Gallagher's too quick to let him try to apologize anyhow
That's technically space janitor
Crowd likes this
Gallagher continues - When the toilet breaks 80 million miles from the nearest hardware store, they call me
Actually, they called me now 'cause then would be too late
To be more precise, Mr
Gallagher is the Mechanical Systems Engineer
We're glad to have him along
Ernest moves on quickly
We stand on the threshold of the most triumphant moment of the millennium
Science has brought us here, and science will take us further
: - The  is horrendously battered
It's a wonder they're alive
Chantilas is propped against a rock, moving a device the size of a hardback book across his abdomen
It's a kind of combination x-ray/sonogram
Doesn't like what he sees
Puts it aside for the moment without discussing it with the others
Gallagher emerges from the  dragging some tools and other salvaged gear
( All communication is via the  radios in their spacesuits
) What've we got
The radio's dead
Rover's dead
's dead
You gave me a shop and three months and  could get this thing set for orbital re-entry
Otherwise
it's staying here
Santen's climbed to the top of a nearby outcropping of rock
Surveys the area red sky, blue clouds, rocks
Anything
No
Great
We put up with your shit for three hundred million miles, so you could crash-land us on Mars
Just fucking great
By all rights, son, we should be dead
That was a decent piece of flying
We have a mission to accomplish, people
We'll be dead in eight hours anyhow when the air runs out
'Cause megapilot missed the landing site
There is no more fucking mission
That puts it all into perspective
So, where the hell are we
The
was tied to the radios
which are dead
Transponder on the Hab was tied to the nav computer
which is dead
Didn't the boys at  pack us a compass
There's no magnetic core on Mars
Wouldn't do any good
Gallagher considers all this for a moment
don't think  like this planet
Best guess
Where do you think we are
Santen shrugs
As much as you can shrug in a spacesuit
Somewhere downrange
Santen pulls his  out of a pocket on his thigh
2050 descendant of a laptop
Mutters at it
It whizzes past all Hab info schematics, the standard 360 degree pan from the landing site, topo map of Mars
Zooms in to show where the Hab was deployed
Based on the last uncorrupted nav state, and given that we were in a full manual descent with no computer correction, 'd say
in this 60x120 mile ellipse
Okay
That's big
There's a long moment of resignation
It's a little irrational, but then, re the  - We've got every other mission variable in here, we ought to be able to figure aerobrake friction and the speed and orbit of the Ares when we exited
We should be able to close in on the downrange variables
Tighten up the ellipse
It's about the math
Gallagher can't believe it
This is it
This is that moment they told us about in high school
Where one day again we'd use algebra
And it would save our lives
And  thought they were fucking kidding
Gallagher turns in frustration and walks away
Chantilas calls to him - Stay in range
thousand yards
And your radio's line of sight
Right,  wouldn't want to get lost
He continues to wander off
We can hear them discussing drag coefficients and whatnot
It just makes him ill
Gallagher stares out at the Martian plain
It would be kinda cool
Except for the fact he's gonna die here
He's pissed and frightened
Yanks his  out
Mutters, images appear
All the Hab details
Stares at the map and then the 360 degree panorama
Back at the map
Back at the panorama
Something about it strikes him
Looks at it some more
He gets up, looks around
Looks around some more
Heads back to the guys
don't think it's about math
don't like math, so 'm biased
think it's about the picture
He holds out the picture of the panorama
Santen dismisses him - he's not a scientist, he's not a pilot, he should leave them alone
We're not in that picture
If we were, we'd know where the Hab was
We're trying to figure this out
Robby ignores him, tosses a rock in the sand, wraps the the 360 degree panorama around it
Screen bends and turns translucent as he does
Look, say that's the lander
At about 30 degrees in the distance, it sees this mountain with the funny top
And at about 180 degrees it sees this funny set of twin peaks
(points) Now  see this mountain over there
And these peaks over there behind me almost on a straight line
And then there's this other peak maybe, which would put us on the line, say here
Which leaves the angle to the Hab at about there
Santen and Chantilas start to manipulate their HHCs faster than you can follow
Muttering to them, hand-gesturing, cross-referencing back and forth to the map, as the ellipse shrinks and their landing location is
determined
Space Janitor First Class Gallagher, nicely done
The good news is it's an eight-hour walk
There's bad news
Chantilas checks Gallagher's wrist monitor
You've got seven and a half hours of air
Try not to breathe too deep
Let's get the hell outta here
Chantilas struggles to his feet
As the five of them tromp away in the giant landscape
-
- The Earth  the
And then  , , ,
It recedes in the distance and disappears
We    the Ares as the final launch stage fizzles out and is discarded
:  :  1 -   - large open common space
Empty for the moment
Until Chantilas and Pettengill enter through an access tube
Gravity follows them around as they walk
Floor, ceiling wall
meter on the wall with a glowing "" points an arrow the direction of the current gravity
Chief Science Officer Chantilas
(off his nod) This is trippy
Chantilas grins
He's been up so many times he's forgotten what it's like the first time
You'll get used to it
When you get home, it feels weird you can't walk on the ceiling
-   - Gallagher comes in too fast
Stumbles up
It's just confusing
He resets
Opens up a locker, about three feet by three feet
He calls in to what seems to be a large tangle of silver pipes
Good morning,
Step out carefully, we're in multi-directional gravity
, the Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion unit, unfolds and steps gingerly from the cabinet
About waist high, eight legs, stereo camera eyes
Like a big silver spider
Old attachments have been sawed off and buffed down
She's a piece of off-the-shelf gear that's been modified
When the light hits her at the right angle, we can see a Marine Corps insignia still etched under the refinishing
How are we after launch
'd like to run a systems check
(as she nods) Shall we do the hokey-pokey
Just to satisfy me
She rapidly shakes each of her legs in turn
Gallagher flips on a wrist panel display
Built into the fabric of his suit
He sees what  sees
Take a look around
He flips off the lights
She flicks over to , sees just fine in the dark
Turns the lights back on
And how is your
today
1000 quick calculations flash by and then - "Good
" Okay, run the occasional self test
Let me know if anything's wrong
And back to storage
contracts and climbs back into her locker
Gallagher shuts the door
Display reads "Good-bye" and winks out
- /  - All six of them are gathered
First dinner in space
Any Space Adaptation Sickness
Vertigo
No
Liars
You'll wake up all night long thinking you're falling
Promise
'll hear you scream
Status
Garden's good
Didn't lose a plant
Anything else
Gallagher holds back here a little
Not a scientist, not an astronaut
Suddenly feels like the most junior member of the crew
Ahh, Commander
Bunch of the HVACs jammed from the lift-off
Reset 'em
They're fine now
'll tell you what, unless we pass a recruiting station on an asteroid and you sign up for the military, you can call me Kate for the next six months, okay
Okay
(as she waits; he relents) Kate
Why'd you come, Gallagher
Not expecting this one
Takes a sec - did two years as a mechanic at
year and a half at McMurdo in the South Pole
Three years on subs
had the highest military tech ratings you can get
And  went cross-country once with my cousins in a  motor home
This didn't seem so bad
That's why they called
Why'd you come
beat, then - You ever been to Europe
Europe's horrible
It's full of stodgy people whose ancestors didn't have the balls to go to America and try something new
Earth is gonna be like Europe
You might visit there and admire some old buildings and crap, but you wouldn't want to live there
This was like getting a call to go with Columbus to America the first time
But harder
How could you not go
Damn
Burchenal grins
don't like Europe much either, son
Didn't quite figure it the same way, but damnation, you don't turn down a phone call like that, do ya
(to Kate) You
spent my entire life training to fly the biggest, fastest thing you can fly
This is it
It's the best job in the world
(points to Santen) He's going 'cause he got the second best job in space
He's a little pissed about it, but he still came
She's nailed him so precisely, Santen can only wince and look away
Pettengill just pipes up
Maybe no one's gonna ask and he wants to get it out in the open - was never supposed to come
came 'cause my boss couldn't
He failed the medical
Heart arrhythmia
So here  am
They tapped me on the shoulder, told me  was going to Mars
was supposed to be second in charge of the Terraforming office till  died
Chantilas's the last
They turn to him
His reason's a little different
Psalm 107, verse 23 They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep
'  So  figured how much wonder for those in space
Beat
You're going to Mars because of a poem
Chantilas thinks about it
He could go on about it, but
Basically
-   - :  :  13 There's no up here, equipment is attached to the floor, ceiling and walls
Santen and Bowman are on a large spinning bicycle-driven centrifuge
Santen's pedaling
By keeping up the speed, he's able to provide enough extra gravity for Bowman, on the other side, to lift free-weights
They're both dripping sweat so it must work
goes off, they slow to a stop
Pettengill comes in
He looks a bit uncomfortable
Certainly out of his element
little, well, puny
So
required exercise
Haven't had this since grade school
Yeah, you musta been doing some kind of reverse thing where you get small
Santen's got years in the gym
Muscles on muscles
Bowman takes a two-second evaluation of the situation
You're done
You can shower
'm not done
was gonna
No
You're done
Santen can't believe he's being thrown out
But he's also a product of the military and couldn't argue if he tried
Yes, ma'am
He leaves
Pettengill feels stupid
You didn't have to do that
No
did
If  didn't nip that in the bud,  wouldn't be doing my job
(then) Flying this beast is only half the job
The whole job's to get the crew in place in shape to do what they have to do
And the funny thing is, flying's the easy part
Pettengill stands abashed for a moment and then his resentment just bubbles out
just hate all those fucking guys
feel like 've spent my entire life being the guy who was hassled in phys ed
lost the first girl  ever cared about to some thug who could throw a football farther than  could
It's like women are hardwired to think that guys who are proficient at sports are going to be better providers
It's not like we hunt and kill our own food anymore
(then) He sells cars for a living now
Cars
end up working on a project that may save the existence of mankind and he sells cars
This is impressively obsessive
You kept track of him
What happened to her
(off his look of "who
") The girl
He has no idea
She grins at him - Little competitive
Who's hardwired for what, Cro-Magnon guy
He can't help it, he grins, a little abashed
We're gonna start with the bungees
Try to quit being pissed off you weren't chosen for dodgeball, willya
'll try
Twenty years of hating the bullying motherfuckers is a hard habit to break
() - It's quiet
And then, a slight
We   the  and
lies on the deck beside her storage container
leg twitches
Then another
Servo
Gets gingerly to her feet
Eyes turn
Wriggles once as if she was stiff and cautiously makes her way outside
() - Looks around
Analyzes
Turns and heads off into the landscape
- landscape so huge, it's hard to comprehend
Five tiny figures progress across the bottom of the frame
They've already come a long ways
Beginning to string out
Pause and regather
Pettengill stops to catch his breath
How you doing
Little tired
'm okay
You should have put more treadmill time in
(sotto) Go fuck yourself
What'd you say
Ahhh
Musclehead, go fuck yourself
They're both getting louder and louder
Guys
Burchenal reaches out, checks their wrist monitors
We're doing fine
In point of fact, he's using less O2 than you are
We can stop a minute
Unless you two want to shout at each other and use up your air
Sorry
Fine
'm sorry, too
No one's sorry
They rest
Use the moment to look around
It's pretty astounding
Chantilas uses the respite to re-scan his abdomen
Puts the device away again
He's in pain but refuses to acknowledge it
How you doing
Things are as they are
(then) Lord
Look at it, we're on Mars
Pretty damn amazing
It' weird
There's nothing here
It's Mars
No,  mean there's not even a trace of the algae
He kneels down, examines a rock
Nada
Even if it all died, there'd be something - a dried algal mat, traces on the lee sides, something
Nothing
Nada
He's right
We sent up fifty-two varietals
Blue-green, black, orange
Anhydriobiosics, chemotrauphs, even a thibacillus that could grow autotrophically on elemental sulfur
Not only are they dead, they're all just gone
don't get it
It's like they were scoured off the rock
Maybe there was never anything in this valley
As they walk, Burchenal checks his
If we are where we think we are - Map appears on a small screen, he mutters to it, overlays of all the algae and lichen that were on Mars appear
This valley was covered with blue algae a month ago
Valley back one should have been covered in an orange-red chloroflectic
He's right
It's weird
There should be something
They crest a small rise
Below lies a valley that closes down quickly into an extremely narrow canyon
Burchenal and Santen check their  maps
This, however, makes sense
Debris apron
Delineated valley fill
Depositional fan
He double-checks with Chantilas
Seems they're going the right way
Chantilas leans back heavily against a rock
Good
You gotta keep moving
Chantilas doesn't get up
And what're you gonna do, sit here and watch
You getting old and lazy
My spleen's ruptured
There's significant internal bleeding
'm not going any further
And trying to carry me will slow you down just enough that we can all die
Robby's stunned, frantic
We'll get you to the Hab
Lock out the spine impulse and you can walk one of us through it
No
You won't
Santen takes charge
It's his mission now
We build a litter
We take him
(stern) Chain of command once we hit the surface starts with me
And 'm ordering you to go, Lieutenant
Now
(turns to Robby) 've only got about forty minutes
There's really not much pain
Put me around the corner where 've got a view
They lift him to the other side of the rock
Gallagher stays with Chantilas a moment
Stricken, speechless
Inside Gallagher's helmet, we can see as the tears roll down
Then - It's okay
'm not sorry  came
Gallagher takes one last look over his shoulder
We are already  , ,
Tiny figures in the landscape once again
One left behind
- Tense
Flight Director Russert watches as Skavlem mutters into the mike
Ares, this Houston, do you read
Ares, this Houston, do you read
Skavlem continues in the b
g
as - What do you want to do
Get every dish in the Deep Space Network pointed at Mars
(doesn't like it, but) Declare a spacecraft emergency
- Chantilas has toppled over
Unmoving
We  , ,  and
() - The four of them trudge up a long hill
The summit is a dozen steps away
Santen is the first to reach it
He looks out over the horizon
Turns back to the others - You're gonna like this
We see what he sees, as do the others as they arrive - not that far in the distance, in the valley below, they can see the lab shining in the sun
Twenty-six months of food, water and air, gentlemen
We're saved
They run down the hillside
For the first time we get a feeling for the
38 gravity
Bouncing sixteen foot steps
Like little kids as they come bounding down
() - They keep running and leaping and coming
Until the first one begins to slow
It's not from exhaustion
And then the second and the third
It's from horror
The Hab is in tatters
Roof is gone, walls are gone
Nothing but the titanium ribs remain
They approach
The insides are not much better
It's destroyed
There's no food
There's no water
There's no air
-  - They search
The news doesn't improve
What the fuck happened here
Jesus
Burchenal continues to look around for a moment
It doesn't matter what happened
It's over
Shakes his head at Gallagher
How's your air
(checks) Twenty-two minutes
'm not much better
What the fuck
He kicks angrily at what's left of the structure
Storms off
It takes Pettengill a moment to process it, but
We're all gonna die, aren't we
-   - Pitch black except for the electroluminescent panels she's stuck around the room
She cracks another one on
They work like glowsticks, but the size of menus
She's jumpered the circuits
Multimeters Velcroed all over the place
Trying to reboot the entire ship
Checks her loads, balances one more jumper, throws a breaker
The  ,   ,
She checks a meter, changes a jumper, tries again
This time the  ,    and  -line
The systems begin to come alive around her
Panels light up, turn from red to green
Lights start to come on
Gravity returns
-   - Bowman moves through
The place is a mess
Soot and fire stains in some spheres
Smoke damage in all
Flowers destroyed
The garden is half-wrecked
She manually opens a set of valves in one room
in from an emergency supply
She checks a meter in her hand, checks again to be sure
Folds back the helmet of her suit
Breathes
-   - Bowman tries to bring the rest of the ship back to life
Half a dozen systems are just plain dead and have to be locked out
Things are not good
Light's beginning to come up
Moments away from entering front-side orbit
Kate opens a panel marked  and throws a series of switches
- Door slides open
small optical receiver is seen
They clear the dark side and burst into the light
-   - On a large viewscreen, Bowman can now scan the surface to about a one meter resolution
Searches
Starts wide, scanning the edge of the horizon as it comes into view
Picks up the glint of the
Zooms in
At first there's nothing but the crashed  in profile
(Like a spy satellite, we are an an  ,   more as the Ares grows less oblique and tracks overhead
) Then the severity of the damage comes clear
Bowman tries not to react
Nothing else is there
No sign of activity or escape
The footprints are beyond the resolution of the camera
There's no reason to believe anything but they're all dead
&  () - Gallagher and Burchenal sit on rocks nearby
Not exerting themselves
Checking their monitors
Maybe we got what we deserved
We ignored science and truth on one planet and poisoned it beyond repair
Then tried to get science to save us on another
Maybe it's the inconsistency that did us in
Burchenal points at a depression a few hundred yards away
(then; points) That's what they call the datum
Sea level
If there was a sea
Or when there was a sea, that's where it was
You can tell 'cause the sand was created by what's called the fluvial process where water breaks rocks into smaller and smaller pieces
We're the first men on Mars
Even if it isn't gonna last long
(then) Would you rather  shut up so you can die quietly
Nah, you can keep talking
It's kinda peaceful
In the b
g
, headed towards a ridge of rocks, we can see a lone figure making its way along
It's Pettengill
He steps around the ridge
We can hear his     as he loses line of sight communication with the others
Up ahead of him, standing on the edge of an enormous drop-off, just staring out into space, is Santen
His back is to us
Pettengill walks towards him
Santen still doesn't hear
Santen's radio is off
in his helmet
3000 foot drop at his feet
It is magnificent
As Pettengill approaches and Santen remains unaware, the scene seems less and less innocuous
We fear for him
Until
Pettengill just walks right up beside him and stares out at the chasm as well
Santen  his
They stand there silently for a moment
Santen has some kind of weak-ass epiphany
Look, 'm sorry
owe you an apology
've been a dick
pick on people who are weaker than  am
It's way too little, way too late
But Pettengill doesn't let on
Just nods
As if he's forgiven him
Steps away and
We    Santen a moment and
Pettengill has picked up what would be a 250-pound rock back on Earth and is heaving it with all his might into Santen from behind
It slams into him, bending him in half, knocking his feet out from under him
For half-a-moment we think Santen might regain his footing
But he doesn't
He starts to fall past the edge of the cliff
Slowly
In
38 grav
Flailing
Twisting in the air
As he falls, looking up, he slaps  the , the
Pettengill leans over the edge
Fuck you
Fuck you
'm gonna die
But 'm gonna spend the next five minutes of my life completely satisfied knowing  killed you
No, you won't, because
Pettengill shakes his head and steps back out of the line of sight
Santen's last taunt turns to
Yes,  will
He turns and walks away
-  - Pettengill returns to the others
He can hear over the  as he approaches - Johannes Kepler was the first to accurately map the orbit of the planet
In 1609
Santen's dead
They turn
But not surprised
They just figure he - Chewed through his air
He threw himself off the cliff
Ouch
Burchenal bows his head down for a moment, overcome
But it's not Santen
It's the bigger picture
It's not often you get to fail when 12 billion people are counting on you
Gallagher's got more pressing problems
Checks his wrist
unnerved
'm at under a minute here
You guys know what this is gonna be like
Hypoxia
Dizzy
Skin'll tingle
Vision narrows
Then anoxia
Shock, convulsions, acidosis
Gonna hurt
Yeah
on Gallagher's
He starts to gasp
Opens his mouth wide
Sucking in and out air that's worth less and less to his body
He begins to claw at the air
It's not pretty to watch
Spins about seeking some release
None forthcoming
Claws some more
Falls to his knees
The others can barely watch
They know they're next
Gallagher's growing more claustrophobic and crazed
Falls the rest of the way to the ground
Still clawing at the air
It's horrible to see
And in one last desperate, angry, trapped-feeling move, reaches up and unhooks the front of his helmet and throws it back
Croaks out a faint epitaph as he collapses
Fuck this planet
And he's still
Still
And then in a last reflexive shudder
Gasps
Gasps again
Takes in the worthless Mars atmosphere
And right when we think it's entirely over
Takes in some more
Breathes again
And again
Opens his eyes
'm not dead
The other two are watching in amazement
'm not dead
It's like being at high altitude
There's not much air here
But
Takes him a minute to catch his breath, but
We're not gonna die
Burchenal's suit
He doesn't screw with gasping in the suit
Just opens the damn thing up and prays
Breathes
Raggedly
It ain't much
But it'll do
He looks around, puzzled
What the hell's going on here
Pettengill's    as well
Much more tentatively he removes his helmet
Breathes
He's not really rejoicing like the others
thought we'd be dead
The enormity of what he's done strikes him
thought we'd be dead
They all breathe the thin Martian air for a moment
God, if Santen had only waited five more minutes
What a waste
Pettengill's completely unsettled face
- on the comm clears
brief caesura then - Copy
(
) Roger, Ares
Good to hear from you
We believe you may have suffered a proton field upset
What is your status
Silence
Silence
Bowman struggles to maintain control
Tear runs down
Takes a deep breath
launched
Radio contact zero
Visual shows crash site, one body, no motion
Believe entire crew to be End of Mission
Ares systems check at below 70 percent
Telemetry to follow
She punches a button
Starts to upload it to them
Air purge in fire control degraded orbital path
Current orbit unstable
Thirty-two hour projected failure
Do you copy, Houston
- The telemetry has come in
Russert puts it up on the common viewscreen
Ship status and all the failures are displayed
It's a disaster
Roger
We copy that
He lets go of the mike
Can't help himself
Jesus fucking God
-
-   - :    15 Dark
Someone moves along
And emerges into - -   - An icosahedronal slice has been removed from one side and replaced with optical glass
billion stars are brighter and more numerous than you've ever imagined
Gallagher comes in, bumps smack into Chantilas
Thought he was alone
Sorry Lotsa room
They lean back against the "floor" for a moment and stare out at a billion and a half stars
Know the stars at all
(pointing) Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cetus, Lepus, Canis Minor
We're looking at what you'd see south around midnight, mid-May if we were on Earth
At about 42 degrees
He's not showing off
He just really does know
Chantilas looks at him, surprised
My grandfather taught me to sail when  was a kid
(fondly) He made me learn the stars in case all the
satellites fell out of the sky at once
He said anyone who put his life in the hands of anything run by batteries was a jackass
He sounds like quite a guy
He didn't like what he called the easy answer or the quick fix
He didn't want to own anything he couldn't repair himself
(thinking back) And, oh yeah, everything automatic sooner or later fails automatically, usually during or immediately before a crisis
He had a lotta damn sayings
(then) He wouldn't've approved of this
Going to Mars
No
That we killed off half the living things on Earth
That after we all but destroyed one planet with global warming, we're trying to bring another to life the same way
Kinda tricky, don't you think
He woulda said we were asking for trouble
It looks like we got trouble
That's why they sent us
beat
They go back to staring at the heavens
Then - don't really get it
You quit being a scientist
You went back to school to study God
just realized science couldn't answer any of the really interesting questions
(off Robby's look) There are values that are fundamental to an adequate apprehension of the world in which we live that can't be expressed by equations or experiments
In that, you see the hand of God
(explaining) Acknowledgment of basic values
Love, kindness, joy
Science doesn't have much use for these
Look, ugly theories are wrong
We know it by insight
Science doesn't want to accept that
We live in a moral world and have moral knowledge that tells us that love and truth are better than hatred and lies
But it's modern to think this is little more than genetic imprinting or a tacit communal cultural agreement
That's not a world  cared to live in anymore
Robby stares back into the void
This is not the kind of conversation he's used to, but - asked my grandfather once if God existed
He played me Brahms' Third
Then he asked me what good it was
Or was it just vibration
(following) What good is beauty
He said if a man could listen to Brahms and not believe in God, he was a fool
think  woulda liked your grandfather
Robby turns to him
You didn't come on this trip because of science at all, did you
That's why they let you come, but you're going to Mars to prove to yourself God exists
Yup
Maybe 'll pick up a rock and it'll say so on the bottom  'Made by God
' Maybe God's more subtle than you are
(then) You think we're doing something we shouldn't, Bud, messing with another planet
(unconcerned) If so, it's because we're supposed to find something out
(then) Let's say we didn't
And we finished poisoning off the Earth and everyone was dead in a hundred years
Then what was the point of any of it
Music, art, beauty, love
All gone
The Greeks, the Romans, the Enlightenment, the Constitution, people dying for freedom, ideas
None of that meant anything
'd rather go out and make a mistake than live in a world that bleak
No one said jack to me about the Greeks and Romans
Shit,  just came along to fix stuff
Fooled ya, didn't we
It's okay
No one told the others either
There's a quiet moment
Robby just came up to stare at the stars
Wasn't expecting all this
Then - There's a reason the planets go around the stars in exactly the same way electrons go around the nucleus of the atom
It's not an accident
There's a design at the bottom of all this
God's watching over you
just wish  didn't think he was chuckling
() - Gallagher, Burchenal, and Pettengill are still stunned over the fact they're alive
There shouldn't be enough oxygen on Mars to do this
We never even got close to a breathable atmosphere
Then the levels started to drop and the sensors all died
don't understand what's going on here
Gallagher is rummaging through the wreckage of the Hab
It's been devastated
Wattya lookin' for
Gallagher unearths a tangle of wire and chewed-up circuits
This
He tosses it aside
It's worthless
It used to be the radio
don't mean to piss on the parade, guys, but no one knows we're here
Don't you see
The good news is we can breathe
The bad news is, unless we can tell somebody, now we get to starve to death
The only mission left is rescue
- The schematic she sent back to Earth is on the screen here as well
The ship is fucked-up bad
(
) The ground crew's dead, your orbit's unstable, and you're gonna burn  in less then a day and a half
(beat: then) Let's get you home
- The three of them rummage through the ravaged structure
News isn't good
We could head back to the lander, try to make something work there
(won't make it) It's six hours back
And it all ran through the main computer which was half-fried and dropped from a great height
Shakes his head no
That ain't gonna help
Then Burchenal, of all things, grins
Gotta think about this scientifically
There's another radio
Two kilometers from here
didn't see any stores on the way over
miss a Radio Hut
We sent it here
Twenty years before you were born
In 1997
Think where we are
(gets it) We're right over the edge from the Ares Vallis
The Sojourner site
The HHCs are yanked out
There was a high-density ridge ringing the valley
The algae never took there
Gallagher checks his watch
We still might have a chance this pass
We wait long
They start to run towards a ridge to west
Sun hangs low in the sky
Only an hour or so of day left
: , with a goofy look on their faces
Like kids at Disneyland the first time
They're standing there looking at - / The little rover
All those damned named rocks
Our first big visit to Mars
The reverie is over quickly
Gallagher tosses down his bag of tools
Walks over, kneels beside Sojourner (the rover)
Sorry about this
He pats it once and starts - off the cover
Tosses another tool to Burchenal
Re the Sagan lander - Rip the panels off everything around the aerial
(then) It's a fifty-year-old off-the-shelf computer radio modem on a frequency that we're not using for this mission
Then why are we bothering
Cause 'd rather die doing something than just sitting there
: - Gallagher has cobbled together a radio from 50-year-old parts
Pettengill holds the solar panels at the sun while Robby carefully removes one of his two suit-radio microphones
Checks with a meter, then solders it onto his jerry-rigged radio
Testing, testing
He adjusts a tiny pot as he continues to call out
green  comes on, flickering with his voice
Does it work
Well, the little green thing lights up
don't know if it works
(into mike) This is Ares ground crew, come back
This is Ares ground crew, do you copy
We
They are so damn alone
-   - Various return scenarios are flickering on different vid screens
(
) Okay, scenario three calls for you to lock out systems 17, 22 and 40
Kate tries
40 freeflows, doesn't lock out
No joy
She resets everything
Maybe we're trying to be way too subtle
Why don't we just jettison the damn tank
(
) Because the margins for error are so small
There's enough fuel to get you home, then if you don't sneeze
It makes us nervous
You want nervous
Over in the corner, Schlissel is listening to something on his headset that's blowing his mind
He starts waving three fingers frantically at Skavlem and Russert
They don't respond fast enough for him
He reaches over and patches someone into the comm link
new voice breaks into the conversations
The accent's Australian
(
) Right, right
Commander Katherine Bowman
(peeved) This is a restricted, encrypted frequency
Who is this
(
) (unperturbed) This is Hank Osterbee in Canberra
Deep Space Network, mate
've got a call for you
- call for me
(
) Right
From the surface of Mars
'm routing it through
Direct frequencies follow
There's   , then - (
) Commander Bowman
You're alive
You're alive
() - We're at sixty percent
Lieutenant Santen and Bud are gone
(beat: then) Oh, and by the way, we can breathe
- You can breathe
(
) Not real well, but yeah
(then) Hey, Kate
We've changed our mind
Get us outta here
We'd like to come home
If the room was at a standstill before, now it's frozen
Is there hope
If they can breathe, can we live there
No
Ninety percent of the algae's gone
It's some kind of freak anomaly
Mars is a dying planet
Just like Earth
They're breathing
It coulda worked
Dammit, it coulda worked
Then through the cacophony comes one voice
It doesn't matter
They're going to die tonight anyhow
In an hour, the sun sets on Mars
It's going to be minus 140
They cannot survive in the open
They're going to die
Yow
Everyone shuts up
It's ugly but true
He's right
You can walk across the South Pole, long as you stay moving and you're wearing insulating clothing - the suits'll work - you can stay warm
But once they stop moving, without shelter, they're gonna die
Her orbit could degrade at any time
She could auger in and burn while they chat about old times and freeze to death
It's a waste
We should just bring her home
Skavlem doesn't love it, but - We can get a free return trajectory now
She's got enough food and water to bring one person back
Russert not happy at all, but - You're not wrong
Nods to Skavlem
Commander, this is Mission Control
-   - No
(
) Ma'am
'm not stupid, John,  know what the question is
'd ask  it if  was there
And the answer is no
So let's move on
(then) By my calculations, if  ditch my reserve tank now and commit to a three-second apogee burn,  stabilize my orbit for another eighteen hours
'd like someone to check the numbers as my apogee's in seven minutes
- Russert has to grin
It's gonna drive him crazy and it's exactly what he'd do
Before any of them can bitch and whine - Come on, people, you heard the woman, let's get on it
The techs begin calculating madly
- The crew is coming down a rise toward the Hab
Carrying the radio
Walking back quickly
Sun is flat over the horizon
Shadows are long, already getting cold
You can see their breath
(
) There's some concern at Mission Control
About the weather
(deadpan) It's gonna rain
(
) It's gonna get a little chilly
could see that
It's dropped about fifty degrees in the last half hour
We figure a hundred below fairly soon
-   - Bowman is doing her best to keep the tone light
But she's gotta know whether or not he thinks he's gonna live or die
(
) It would have been nice to be in the Hab
And there ain't no other motel to check into
You have a plan
Any thoughts on how you might
stay alive
() - They're back at the Hab now
We can't quite tell what's going on, but Burchenal and Pettengill are busy doing something noisy and furious in the b
g
Crashing, bashing, breaking
Burchenal flicks open an entrenching tool
Thumbs a button, edge whizzes by like a tiny chain saw
Chews through something and
Yeah
Behind Gallagher is a whoooosh of flame as Pettengill gets the debris he's piled in the middle of the Hab to light
He's got stacks of additional fuel nearby
We're gonna have a 75 million dollar campfire
() - 20 The sun sets
First sunset on Mars man has seen
Red upon red upon red
Fire burns behind them
Sky turns black
Fast
billion stars
And then a  begins to fall
It's huge
It's red
It
What the hell was that
She ditched the '' tank
She must be figuring there's an even chance we'll live through the night
- The Ares lights up and burns for three long seconds
And off
-   - Bowman checks the gauges
Eight liters was burned
Hell, what's eight liters
(answers herself) It'll either save their lives or 've screwed up getting home and 'll spend the next three hundred years circling this planet
- Burchenal pokes at the flames
They're spread out and low
Flickering yellow and blue
think we'll make it through
There's so little O2, this is gonna burn real slow
Gallagher picks up a piece of scrap, about to feed it into the flames, then stops, examines it by the light of the fire
It looks like someone took a rasp to it
He gets up, turns on a suit light and looks over the remaining ribs of the structure
What happened to this place
Everything but the titanium supports were just chewed up
Could a dust storm've done this
No prevailing pattern to the damage
don't know what could've done it
Nor does it matter right now
They sit back around the fire and relish the warmth
Out in the darkness, past a rise, something catches Robby's eye
flash, a reflection
Of the fire
On what
And then it's gone
He doesn't bother to mention it
Writes it off
Behind a hill,  crouches in the dark
Pops up again, looks over, sees the three men and the fire
Lowers back down - you'd swear she was thinking - then silently ambles away
The weird tableau of three men in spacesuits around a campfire on Mars
moment then - You still think we had any business coming to Mars
Screwing with stuff
Trying to spread life
You think maybe God's teaching us some hardass lesson
Pettengill just makes some kind of weird gulping noise and turns away
They let him be
God
You talked to Chantilas too much on the trip over
don't mean to burst your bubble, but God's the retreat of the ignorant, the weak and the hopeless
bet you don't believe in Santa
And you're no fun at all at Christmas
(then) Not everything gets an explanation you can write down as a formula
Son, 'm a scientist
geneticist, as good as they come
write code, just like a hacker
Four elements,
, in different orders, back the genome
And your kidneys work or you grow a sixth finger
line up unconscious atoms and they give rise to conscious beings
It's like if  stacked up a bunch of rocks in the right order and they become a dog
do that
chose when,  chose where,  chose how many fingers
just don't hold with mystical explanations for science, with organized religion, buildings with different symbols on 'em
You spot God, you lemme know
Till then,  put my trust in my three Ph
's
(then) But  think life's an amazing thing
And  believe that when you get it you should grab it with both hands and live as much of it as you can
Which is why  am not happy about losing it on this damn ugly planet
Burchenal shuts his eyes
We    Gallagher looking rueful and
-
-   - :  :  32 Gallagher comes in
His timing, depending how you look at it, is very good or very bad
Bowman steps out of the shower
To dry off
It's too late for Robby to stop or recoup
He has to tough it out and try to act like an adult
Bowman sees his discomfort
She's amused
It's okay
had brothers
have two sisters
(gives up) Neither of them were this fine
Now she colors
The only way this works, is if we both make believe it doesn't matter
tried
really tried
(then) Maybe  should go fix something
(laughing now) Maybe you should
He hesitates, leaves
She starts to vacuum dry her hair
() - Gallagher's half filled with regret, half annoyed with himself
Sighs, shuts his eyes, tries to get some sleep
- Place is ragged coffee on the workstations, techs as unshaven and beat as the crew on Mars
All right, people, we bought ourselves another eighteen hours in orbit
The crew's burning pretty much what we've got on the surface so they don't freeze solid
So whatever we can come up with
has got to work before the sun sets again tomorrow and they freeze to death anyhow
What else is on Mars
Rocks
Sand
The janitor just built a radio out of a fifty-year-old Rover mission
Now, what else is on Mars
Mars maps come up on all their PIMs
There are things on the surface
Marked with various symbols
Leftovers from other missions
We sent a dozen probes even before the biologics started up
Eight were return missions
And they're back
There's a Viking lander
2,200 kilometers away
Silence
They all stare at the PIMs
And then Schlissel turns to a nearby  - Slap your forehead
We're not the only people who sent stuff to Mars
Other overlays come up on the maps
New colors
New symbols
The Twenties were nothing but unmanned sample return missions
Everyone wanted to bring back a bucket of Mars rocks
They find something near the Hab
There was Euro-Malaysian sample return mission 2018
Checking
(knows) It blew up on attempted return
Looking further afield, they find something else
It ain't close, but there's an Uzbecki
that failed to launch
(argh) An Uzbecki probe from 2032
Is it viable
Can we get plans
It was built at the Cosmos factory in Garagin in 2031
(there's more) The factory closed eight years later
And then it burnt down
All right, that's the end of that
And then Schlissel spots a detail that means something to him
It was designed by Aleksandr Ivanovich Borokovski
He was the last of the greats in the Russian space program
Is he still alive
Schlissel's  flickers madly as he mutters at it
There's no closing date on his bio
He'd be in his seventies
Find him
Somebody get on the line to Kazakhstan
This is insanity
thirty-year-old lander built in a factory that doesn't exist anymore
Found him
He emigrated
He runs a deli in Brooklyn
- Low hum of conversation, a bunch of the workstations are vacant, techs sleeping in cots nearby
, in his best suit, 20 years old, comes in led by two  flunkies
Unhooks his filtration mask
Vindicated
All right,  am Borokovski
am here
() - - Sky's beginning to grow light
Last of the fire flickering out
Nothing left of the Hab but a few metal ribs
Gallagher stirs
Stiff from sleeping on the ground
Burchenal and Pettengill follow
They've lived through the night
Gallagher walks off twenty paces
When we see him again, he's unlocked the top and bottom of his suit and dropped the trousers to his knees
'm the first man to piss on Mars
Burchenal and Pettengill follow suit on the other side of the Hab
beat, then - Damn
Whoa
You sure get some arc in this low gravity
The sun's gonna break any minute
Something suddenly hits Burchenal
He yanks up his pants, runs to remains of the Hab
Looks around desperately
Pulls free a metal rib
Turns to Gallagher
Run
Towards the sun
Robby understands or doesn't bother to ask why
Takes off
Burchenal yanks free a shard of metal
Pounds it into the sand a dozen feet from the Hab
The sun is just breaking the horizon
Robby is fifty yards away
Stop
Left
Left
little more
Right
Mark it
He adjusts his own peg a tad
Robby comes loping back
What'd we do
(approvingly) Built a directional
Now at least we know where something is
The
(
) Good morning, boys
Martian weather today's clear and cold
Warming to a high today of around sixty
-   - She hasn't slept
There's notes and charts and additional 's all over the place
So
Houston has an idea
: () - Gallagher, Burchenal and Pettengill have heard the plan
It doesn't impress them
That's it
We walk a hundred kilometers in one day to find a twelve-by-twelve object that's been sitting there for 30 years
(are you kidding) That's the best plan they could come up with
(
) It's the only plan they could come up with
(reconsiders) guess that makes it best
(
) There's an
maintenance port on the Cosmos
Your
should talk to it
You'll have to reprogram the launch sequence
The bad news is
-   - (
) There's bad news
(ignoring him) is it's programmed in a forty-year-old dead operating system no one uses anymore
It was something called
Windows
- None of them have ever heard of it
(
) We're getting a copy of it from the Smithsonian
We're gonna have to download it to you
Let's worry about it when we get there
Where're we going
(
) 've got coordinates for you
How 'bout something simpler
Like how many degrees it is off from the direction the sun rose
We marked it
'm figurin' we're within half a degree
Heck, we just gotta pack
He picks up a satchel of tools
Everything else's burnt to a cinder
- Basic trig has been calculated
triangle of scavenged wire stretches with one side along the directional, the other side points their way across the Martian landscape
They take a last sighting, and stride off into the distance getting smaller and smaller and then - the three of them
Pettengill looks doubtful
hundred kilometers
Sixty-odd miles
Say two and a half marathons
In twelve hours
Do we really have a chance in hell
It took us six hours to go 26 kilometers last time
We don't have the rebreathers, we don't have the tanks
Figure you weigh about fifty pounds in this gravity
We have a chance in hell
But not much more'n that
- messenger is escorted in and taken to Borokovski
He's got a copy of Windows, fifty years old, and still in the shrink wrap
Borokovski rips it open, then peers at tech requirements on the box
will need a computer with a - drive
And a pentium processor
Nobody moves
It's like asking for a steam engine
What's a pentium processor
What's a -
(a little defensive) It was all state-of-the-art in Kazakhstan
We were cut off
Still nobody moves
We gotta wake up the Director of Dead Technology at the Smithsonian
And quick
Assistants scramble
Schlissel comes over to peer curiously at the shiny silver disk and - -
-  - :  :  132 The ship floats
We hear the familiar  of
(
) Call
(
) Call
(
) Call
/  - Burchenal, Santen, Chantilas and Gallagher are playing poker
Burchenal fans his cards down
Full house
Kings over queens
That's it
You're the best poker player in a hundred million miles
Yep
He rakes in all the chips
And no one'll play for money
What a waste
'm done
See you all in the morning
Game's over
Santen leaves, Chantilas starts to follow, then turns and asks, three-quarters kidding - Do you cheat
Compared to what
Chantilas gives up and leaves
Do you cheat
Only Santen
That seems fair
Gallagher's putting away the chips when - You know what  miss
drink sometimes at the end of the day
Damned hard-asses at
Gallagher gets a look in his eye
You got enough gear on board to splice genes, right
Glassware, tubing, Bunsen burners
all that kind of stuff
Yep, sure do
Why
-   - Bowman comes in
Robby moves quickly to intercept her
Blocks her view
came to apologize
You were uncomfortable with a situation the other day, and  made you more uncomfortable for my own amusement
'm sorry
It's too small a ship for playground games
Okay
He's done
She can leave now
Okay
No witty comeback
No gloating
(beat) No explanation for why the temperature in this sphere is up three degrees
She slithers by him before he can stop her to find Burchenal tending a huge contraption of glass tubing, Bunsen burners and filtration tanks
He's teaching me
About biology
've developed an interest in
fermentation
Even when you make it out of high-tech glassware, a still looks just like a still
(stern) You built a still
It's a science experiment
Did you know that an ounce of red wine per day actually benefits your heart
(adamant) So does three ounces of grape juice
Grapes don't grow well hydroponically
So we, ah, used potatoes
You're making moonshine vodka on my ship
Well, yes, ma'am
But we ran it through the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer and the impurity levels are very low
How's it taste
Burchenal is the first to realize they're off the hook
It's a little rough
Are you going to offer me a drink
Of course
That would be the polite thing to do
He does
She tosses it back
Woooof
That's a little rough
How much have you made
'bout three liters
She considers
Then - You're done
Dismantle the science project
Offer equal rations to the crew
Mr
Santen doesn't drink or approve of those who do
(stern again) Now tell me the truth
How much were you cutting this
(they're busted again) About three to one
can't believe you drank that
learned to fly in the Navy
Wimps
- Gallagher, Bowman, and Burchenal are there
They've got half a beaker of vodka left
They're all looped and laughing
spent half of my life trying to make a better potato
And the second half trying to stop it
The things were so damn good they killed everything in their path
Corn, wheat, barley
(suddenly melancholy) We fucked up our own back yard, hit the Malthusian wall, and tried to breed our way out of it
Maybe we don't deserve another chance
Then he shakes it off
Laughs
Don't worry, if we need any help on the surface, 'm allowed to grow us some six-fingered lab assistants
He cracks up again
He's wasted
Knows it
gotta go to bed
He heads off drunkenly
Gallagher gets an idea
'm in space
wanna see the stars
He flails off in another direction
She laughs and follows him
Don't go outside
- billion stars, two very drunk people, half a beaker of moonshine vodka
She's talking about Burchenal - He's okay
bet there's a hell of a girl waiting for him back home
Three
And a horse
He really likes the horse
You're serious
He pines for the horse
You
don't have a horse
That's too bad
He takes another swig
Offers it to her
She matches him
Can  ask you something very personal
Okay
It's about bras and space
She looks at him
don't wear a bra in space
know
Bras are designed to hold your boobs in place on Earth where there's real gravity
Why would  need one in space
Cause it's really fucking distracting
You want me to wear a bra
No
Not at all
'm sorry  ever brought this up
The good news is neither of them will remember in the morning
Much
Another round
Then - Do you have someone waiting for you back home
Or a horse
With the kind of jobs 've had, it's very hard to maintain any kind of relationship
So
no horses
Or maybe you took those jobs 'cause you didn't want anyone waiting for you
Or maybe
No,  like horses just fine
They've floated very close
You know, you're not who  thought you were at first
Is that an insult or a compliment
An observation
They're very, very close
And very drunk
It's when he should kiss her
But he doesn't
The moment passes
They both know it was there and now it's gone
Drift apart
Feel stupid
Damn
- the landscape
Miles and miles from where they started, we   the three men as they move rapidly across a dry wash, across the bank and up and over a hill
And stop dead at the top
Over the next ridge, the landscape is covered with algae
Colors like brush strokes on the terrain
Oxblood brown, burnt orange, cadmium yellow
Wattya know
Pettengill gets down on one knee to examine it
Half inch to an inch high, vibrantly colored
Healthy
Maybe it's the longitude
Maybe it's the equatorial belt
Maybe it doesn't matter 'cause we gotta keep moving or we're gonna die
Pettengill doesn't argue
Just trying to stay alive is the great scientific mystery right now
They bound down far side and
- Borokovski is laboring to install Windows on a 50-year-old computer from the museum
Schlissel and the Tech watch, kibbutz
It crashes
Again
Yob tyvou mot
(Which, by the way, means "fuck your mother
") It keeps crashing
That was part of its charm
You had to buy programs to check why the program you had already bought was not working
People installed this on their computers on purpose
It wasn't a virus
The company planned it this way
It was later discovered they owned all the companies that sold you the products to fix the product they had already sold you
remember this
The government had to bomb the factory in the end
Borokovski nods
Windows comes up
Look, there we go
- The  seems odd
In fact it is
It's from orbit
It's Bowman searching on the telescope
-   -  - As the picture skitters along the surface and finds them, tiny figures on a landscape
In extreme profile
-  - few minutes away from plunging onto the night side
-   - She marks their location on the viewscreen, zooms out wide
The Hab and the Cosmos are marked with symbols
The computer pauses, analyzes, then spits them out as a little more than 56 kilometers along their way
More calculation is done on the screen
They're more than halfway; they've used up less than half the available daylight; their average speed is looking good
They're on time, on schedule and on the right course
So far, so good
Ground crew, this is Ares
You're a little more than half
You're doing great
(
) (over radio) Oh yeah, we're doing fabulous
As she plunges into darkness, we hear - (
) (singing) Rollin', rollin', rollin', keep them doggies rollin'
' - They're all exhausted and a little punchy
How long can a man go without food or water
How long can you go without singing that dumb song
Burchenal looks hurt
Walks another few paces
Begins to sing again
Gallagher turns to Pettengill
There's two of us
And we can stop him from singing
Pettengill considers
Then sings along instead
They only know the one line
It's really annoying
What is that
have no idea
It's old, though
It's classic music
don't know the classics
This sets Burchenal off
He sings some more - Mars ain't a place to raise your kids In fact it's cold as hell And there's no one there to raise them If you dig
' What the hell is that
You don't know any of the classics, do you
He was a rocket man
An astronaut wrote that
Never mind
Sing the one about the dogs again
It's about cows
Then why does it say doggies
All this time, they've been walking across a landscape pigmented with color - steel blue, alizarin crimson, malachite green - the algae varietals everywhere
And then off to the left, the algae stops
Erased, like it was never there, extirpated in a long crooked line
What the fuck
Yeah, what the fuck
You said doggies
Then he sees as well
They all see
Can't help themselves
They're drawn towards it
Gallagher and Burchenal check their course in  the distance before veering off
Pettengill is already heading towards it
It's maybe 100 yards away
At 50, something indistinct can be seen
Sort of
It's like the line, and the surrounding terrain is out of focus, blurry
At 30, the blurriness comes into focus
It's alive
It moves slightly
You can see through it
At ten, you can see it undulating
Slowly,  us
Erasing the algae, the color slowly spreading outwards behind and diffusing
And then we can see
billion, a hundred billion
nematodes
Little tiny translucent worms
Eating the algae
Slowly, irrevocably
Advancing
Pettengill pulls out his entrenching tool
Carefully separates one out
Lifts it up to the light to see
Maybe three inches long, skinnier than an earthworm
One end lifts in the air, a tri-part mouth with little crystalline teeth opening and closing, searching for something to eat
It's fucking scary
It gets worse when you realize how many of them there are
The line's moved three or four inches closer as they stand there
They take a step back
No one can really speak yet
What
It's a nematode
Or something like one
It's probably this skinny so it defrosts each morning when the sun hits them
Or they'r enot water-based at all
Is it something we sent up by accident with the probes
No
thought we said there wasn't any life on this planet
We did
We were wrong
Maybe there wasn't when we checked
don't know
It's not from Earth
(beat; yow) And it's not from here
This can't be
This can't be
Burchenal actually seems kind of upset about it
Gallagher looks at him
Say what
Burch is upset
It can't be here
You don't understand
The odds of there being any other life in the universe are infinitesimally small
The odds that it could survive on something other than its home planet are equally astronomical
The odds that it could travel to another solar system, let alone one where life already existed are
impossible
But it's here
Yeah
Burchenal seems almost unhappy about this
It rocks his world
In a bad way
Gallagher turns to Pettengill happily and untroubled
Well, it looks like we're not alone in the universe
You just discovered life on another planet, pal
It takes a moment for this to sink in
Then something hits Robby
Made by God
That's what's stamped on the bottom
That's what Bud would have said
He woulda loved this
Gallagher gets down on one knee and looks at them
They're kinda horrible, but as he turns to Pettengill - You know what this means
You're gonna be more famous than Darwin
They're gonna name buildings after you
Spacecrafts, cities on Mars
The enormity of how badly Pettengill has screwed up - that in the space of one day, he's committed murder and discovered life on another planet - begins to dawn on him
He doesn't handle it well
He's fucked up like few people can imagine
He tries to reset, it doesn't work
The worm twists about, starts to eat the metal right off the entrenching tool
He flicks it back to its relatives
Right
Right
Motherfuck
Motherfuck
And then he says something really odd - Name them after Santen
You hated Santen
Yeah
He storms away
They're both confused by this
Pettengill finds a rock, sits down behind it
He's obscured except for his head and shoulders
need a minute or two
You wanna tell Houston
Go ahead
You do it
Just give me a few minutes
-   - (
) We seem to have come across the, uh, cause of the annihilation of the algae
There's cryptoendolithic life here
Eating it
as needed with Mission Control and Mars surface
(concerned) They're hallucinating
Pettengill's a bit overcome
Or he'd be telling you about it himself
But the discovery goes to him
(baffled; but) Though he wants to name them after Santen
You're saying there's Martian life
(calling out from behind the rock) No, that there's life on Mars
We're not saying where it came from
But not Earth
Fuck
They all disregard that last bit
They're like some kind of translucent worms
You're all seeing these
Oh yeah
They're here
What did you think this was, hypoxia
They did
- Conversation's over
Gallagher walks towards the rock - We should get outta here
Pettengill doesn't respond
Really
We should get going
Gallagher walks over
We hear a familiar
Don't recognize what it is at first
Until Gallagher around the rock and sees
Pettengill's flicked on the    of the entrenching
Shreds his left wrist
Lifts it and rips through his carotid arteries
All but cuts off his head as he falls to the ground
Suit's awash with
Overflowing onto the ground and him
in spurts
Some hits the worms
Jesus
Jesus God
Burchenal's joined him
There's nothing they could do
Only watch in shock
It gets worse
The worms come
Pulsating and undulating towards Pettengill
As if some secret message the food is here has spread through the billions of them in burst of knowledge
diaphanous, hungry wave crests onto Pettengill and engulfs him
He's covered in translucence as they devour him
Gallagher and Burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red aureole grows around him as he's eaten
Color spreads out around him in a perfect ever-growing circle
It's a feast
The two of them walk along
Can't tell if they're hurrying towards something or away
They've both figured out what's up
beat, then - He killed Santen
Yep
Probably figured we were gonna die anyhow
Yep
Figured wrong
For now
(beat; then) Nobody deserves to die like that
No
- There's a general buzz of animated scientific debate
One voice cuts through - We've thawed out three and four-million-year-old organisms from the permafrost in Siberia and they've come back to life
It's possible
So even if there wasn't life there, there is now
And we warmed the place up and sent it something to eat
It could have sat there for millions of years since Mars cooled
Waiting
Rode in on a frozen meterorite from anywhere
And waited
voice chimes in from the corner - Like sea monkeys
But not as friendly
They all consider that
Kinda bizarre but accurate
- Burchenal and Gallagher trudge onward
Burchenal checks his watch
It's time
Gallagher hands him the radio
Walks ahead
Doesn't want to hear
-   - Bowman just heard the news
It's like she's been punched
It takes her a moment to recover
Copy that, Ground Crew
Mission Control has heard as well
beat, then - (
) Requiescat in Pace
- The sun is way past its zenith
It hangs noticeably lower in the sky
Maybe four or five o'clock
Burchenal and Gallagher plod along
They're beat
There's no singing, there's no banter
They're just trying to keep moving
-   - Bowman finds them again with 10m scope
Marks it
Computer analyzes their position
The results aren't encouraging
Their average speed has been steadily dropping
There's only two hours left till dark
They've gone 79 kilometers
And they're projected to get 88
5 kilometers before nightfall
They're gonna miss getting to the Cosmos by about an hour
- It's worse
They're stumbling
Not keeping in all that straight a line
Having to constantly re-check their position
(
) Ground Crew, this is Ares
(studiously casual) How's it goin'
They look at each other
Is she kidding
We've just done a little over two marathons back to back
We haven't had anything to eat or drink in two days
There are these worms that want to eat us and a mad robot who wants to kill us
Why do you ask
He starts to laugh
For some weird reason Burchenal joins him
(
) You're not going to like what  have to say
You're going home
Bring us some chicken
They crack up anew
(
) You have to pick up the pace
They laugh
It's not funny, but they really laugh
We're not gonna make it
(
) At this pace, you'll make about ninety kilometers
Burchenal shakes himself
Digs into some deep reserve
Picks up his speed and shouts - We Sleep Till Brooklyn
He totters off towards the horizon
(
) What was that
Cooper's been singing classic music
don't know most of it
No Sleep Till Brooklyn
Neither does he
think he knows one line from each song
We'll try to go faster
We really will
He's trying to convince himself as well as her
But he does pick up the pace and push after Burch and
- Borokovski has listened in curiously to this exchange
Why is he speaking of Brooklyn
He's singing classic music to keep his spirits up
The tech looks at him curiously
studied it in college
It's the Beastie Guys
Most of the music we listen to today is based on the ground-breaking work they did before the turn of the century
- 40 They're stumbling
Literally
Gallagher just stops
You know,  don't care if  weigh 60 pounds on Mars
am one tired doggie
Gallagher sits down on a rock
Burchenal collapses nearby
They can't go any further
Burchenal catches his breath
Ten  short
The sun is a finger above the horizon
Redder than red, breathtakingly beautiful
It's pretty
Too bad we're gonna be dead
can't keep walking in circles
And there's nothing to keep us warm
They look around unhappily
Ugly way to die
It's gonna be like trying to live on Mount Everest
What would we do if we were on Mount Everest
Thinks a long time
would have brought a tent
If we didn't have a tent
Robby's so tired he's confused
We don't have a tent
Yeah
Yeah,  know
'd guess you'd dig a snow cave
Use the snow for insulation
You've seen the 3Ds
There's a funky-looking hillock nearby
Five feet high, as big around
Burchenal totters to his feet
Goes over and kicks it
It's soft volcanic rock
Let's dig a snow cave
There's no snow
Burchenal kicks at it again
Gives
He takes out the entrenching tool, hacks at it
Knocks a piece free
Let's dig a snow cave or we're gonna fucking die
He starts to wail on it
Gallagher staggers over and joins him
The two of them start to flail away like a cross between prehistoric man and giant beavers, desperate as - The sun begins to set
30 miles away, the terminus, the line where night turns to day, begins to advance across the planet towards them
In the dark of the shadow, the  forms a dozen feet behind and follows growing,  - the cold advancing  us with a
It's as if the cold has a sound
Gallagher and Burchenal can see the darkness approaching
Digging madly
Cackling
Losing their minds
Can't tell who is who as they're silhouetted against the sun, one now inside the hillock throwing rock back as the other clears
The sun continues to drop
Terminus continues its pernicious  and freezing approach
Halfway inside now
On his knees, suit light on, Gallagher chops away at the rock
When he's thigh-deep in debris, he backs out, dragging the leavings with him
Burchenal leaps in, replacing him
Dripping in sweat, nutty, but at least they're doing something
The last of the sun disappears
Their breath is in the air
The darkness and frost reaches them now
The sweat begins to freeze, ice in their hair and eyebrows and stubble
But they've dug most of the shelter
They continue to thrash and chop away
The frost is now everywhere
Gallagher climbs inside
Burchenal drags a lava boulder over to seal the entrance
Climbs in, hooks his tool into the rock and seals it shut
- It's not big
The two of them are scrunched into balls
They chop away and pack the debris in the entry tunnel to block the cold
Shaking bitterly
Lips blue
- Nothing
Darkness
Rocks
And in the midst of it all, our crazy hillock/snow cave
/ - Gallagher looks up to find Burchenal staring at him
Actually, not exactly at him
At his forehead
What
Is this some kind of cartoon moment where you're imagining 'm a giant chicken and you're going to eat me
It's melting It's a Wizard of Oz moment
The ice on your forehead is melting
The rock's really insulating us
We might not freeze to death
Oh
Good
And then the enormity of what's gone on hits them
And the exhaustion
Adrenaline is gone
Gallagher physically droops
Burchenal follows
've never been this tired
've never hurt this bad
You think dead is worse than this
Hell, we'll probably know soon
Shut up
Rest
We oughta probably tell someone we're not frozen solid
Yet
Burchenal checks his watch
We're on the nightside, can't reach Houston
Bowman's dayside for another forty-five
- Common viewscreen shows ground crew's projected position
Darkside of the planet
Estimated temperature of -20 degrees fahrenheit and falling
The room's downcast
And bewildered
Not a word before it got dark
-25 degrees
-30 degrees
They're dead
Or dying
Let's get Bowman home
She's gonna wanna waste a pass trying to get them on the radio
Let her
She's got five and a half hours before the orbit starts to decay
If she has to do this so she can concentrate later on, so be it
Skavlem gets busy on the radio with Bowman - Ares, this is Houston
- Their breath condenses on the ceiling
Freezes
Then falls down
It's snowing
They've got their own weather system
Gallagher watches it fall
Burchenal seems kinda pissed
No,  don't know why the worms are here
No,  don't know why we're still alive
There's gotta be a reason
moment, then - You're talking about faith, son
Faith is another way of saying  know something you don't know but  can't tell you 'cause it's a secret
But  don't know why  know it
(agitated) live in the real world
've lived there my whole life
'm comfortable there
We're not in the real world
We're on Mars
(softly) Nobody gets in a rocket ship to outer space without some kind of faith
Do they
Burchenal doesn't answer
Not directly
But he looks like a third grader busted in some elaborate story he can't keep up
If you think 'm gonna have some kind of weak-ass epiphany for you right here in this cave, you're wrong
Now, why don't you get that light outta my eyes and let me try to rest
Gallagher's satisfied
Lowers the light to a dull glow, leans back against the rock and
- / The ship slips into darkness
-   - Bowman reaches for the mike, begins - Ground crew, this is Ares
Do you read
(off no response) Ground crew, this is Ares
Do you read
- The radio lies on the ground
The green light flickers with her transmissions
But little signal seeps through the rock
What there is is  and
(
) Zzzzz zzz, zzz zz, zzzzzz
And Gallagher and Burchenal are fast, fast asleep
-   - Time's passed
Bowman has searched with the 10m scope
, thermal
She picks up the occasional footprint
Tracks their progress
Finds some odd rock configurations
And
nothing
They're just gone
Finally, she gives up
Picks up mic sadly for one last time - Ground crew, this is Ares
It was a pleasure and an honor to serve with you, gentlemen
Sits quietly a moment, then turns off the screen
Brings up a new image
Shows her current fuel status, position and projected path
She begins to work on getting home
- Dead quiet
The two small moons shine faintly
rime of ice covers everything
The hillock shimmers in the feeble light
The rock entrance is sealed over with frost
- Gallagher and Burchenal breathe shallowly
The inside of the cave is covered in white flaking hoarfrost
Lips are blue
Skin is pale
Gallagher's eyes open
Something's wrong
Doesn't know what
And then he realizes the air moving in and out of his lungs isn't doing him any good at all
The door is caked shut with ice
There's no air
He moves badly, uncoordinated, but manages to chop and shove it open
Fresh ice cold air rushes in
Burchenal awakes
Only half-responsive
Gallagher grabs him, drags him out
Breathe
Breathe
- Cognizance returns
Burchenal looks at his watch
It doesn't make any sense
Three hours have passed
Three hours
Son of a bitch
Son of a bitch
We've been asleep for three hours
Gallagher desperately hauls out the radio
Ares, this is ground crew
Ares, this is ground crew
Forget it
She's dayside again
If she's even still here
(then) We gotta get to Cosmos
Burchenal looks around
Oh God
It gets worse
Can't see the landmarks
Gallagher starts to madly scan the night sky
We gotta keep moving
He yanks out his
Mutters rapidly into it
We see the map appear
Hab/Cosmos line marked
Then a star chart for Mars on this day and time
He calls for it to change to a horizon projection
The machine freezes, computes
Brings up a horizon
It matches what Robby sees
And highlights a star sitting just above the horizon that will lead them on their way
Canis Minor
They start to run
beat
rises up silently from behind a rock and watches them go
-  - The two men run
Lit by the two moons Phobos and Deimos - Fear and Terror
It's unbelievably cold
Plumes of breath light up around them as they go
Following the star on the horizon
Across a valley, over a ridge
Over a dune
Scrambling
Up and over the next long, long gradient
They lose the star over this false horizon as they climb
There's something odd, however
faint broad wash of light coming over the lip
They crest the rise to reveal - Completely covered in phosphorescent algae
Pale green and glowing
mile across, a mile wide
If they weren't rushing for their lives, it would be worth stopping to stare
Across the vale Canis Minor sits directly in the center of a small mountain pass
They're about to dash onward when something - intuition, it's hard to say what - hits Burchenal
Stop
What
Burchenals' not quite sure at first
But won't enter the algae
Walks left, walks right
Kneels down
The algae glows
Otherworldly
And then movement
In the f
g
a worm, green, glowing and filled with algae, slithers through
And then another
And another, indistinguishable from the plants around them they've imbibed
And then as Burchenal plays his light out across the valley we realize it's entirely full of worms
Gallagher takes an appalled step back
They're fucked
We're fucked
Burchenal considers for a moment
And yeah, probably has that epiphany
Then- (re the pass) Get to the closest point you can safely
'm gonna go down to that end
He starts to run to the far end
What are you gonna do
Burchenal's far enough away now that his voice comes over the
(
) 'm gonna distract them
You're gonna distract the worms
(
) Yeah
Perhaps Gallagher ought to give this more thought
But he doesn't
Maybe it's the exhaustion
Maybe it just never would have occurred to him
Burchenal disapears into the darkness and the distance
Gallagher waits
Then - (
) You ready
Yeah
(
) Good
Lemme know when it starts to clear
Gallagher doesn't get it
But a moment later, a shiver runs through the worms
And they start to undulate away
Towards Burchenal
Pulsing faster and faster until it's clear in a moment or two, like a giant amoebae withdrawing, he will have clear access to the pass
at the far end, is five hundred yards into the worms
They know
They've told each other
And they're coming in pulsating waves
Towards him
At the epicenter
He gags
And hears - (
) (stunned) It's clear
Burchenal tries to turn around
He's mired now
And they're up to his waist
It's a fucking nematode feeding frenzy
Good
He can't even lift his feet
They're beginning to cover him now
He can see the color of his suit spreading around him as they devour it
(then; oddly calm) You were right, son
There's gotta be a reason
This can't just be an accident
don't know what the worms're doing here or how they got here
But science don't explain it
And it pisses me off to no end
Gallagher turns
He can see now what Burchenal has done
tiny glowing figure can be seen 1000 yards away
Gallagher's speechless at first
'm gonna have to turn off my radio in a sec
So you don't have to hear me screaming like a girl
What have you done
Finding out there's things  don't understand
That science don't know squat about
Maybe even the damn Earth's worth saving
Someone's gotta give it a try
Gotta find out about these worms
Go, get off this fucking planet
During which we've   Gallagher, 'cause you don't want to see this
(
) There's two women in Missoula, one in Bozeman
Tell them each they were my last words
And make sure my horse gets sold to someone who knows how to ride
(then) Oh, my Lord
Across the distance we can see a figure, now entirely coated in luminous worms, writhing wildly
Gallagher leaves his light on, starts to run
As Robby flees, we  ,  and  until he's just a tiny figure in the landscape - until we are  what was Burchenal
The frenzy is all but over
The phosphorescence is gone in the center of the circle
The edges are the color of his suit
Then blood red for forty yards
Bits of bone white
And then right in the dead center, as we watch; gray, spreading, spreading as what was once Burchenal's brain is food for worms
- Gallagher scrambles up, steeper and steeper, to the edge of the valley and the ridge line
From the top he can see the way below is his prize - the Cosmos
Checks his watch, hopefully, desperately triggers the radio
Ares, this is ground crew
Ares, this ground crew
Do you copy
- Above him somewhere in the sky
-   - Bowman is locking out parts of the ship to conserve power on the way home
At first she's not sure she really heard that
Rushes across the room to the radio interface
Ground crew
Status
(
) Me
Alone
The worms just ate Burchenal
Thought you might be gone
(shaky) Guess you promised you wouldn't leave
Robby, 'm
still here
They both know he's caught her still here sheerly by happenstance
(
) 'm about a kilometer from the Cosmos
It's in sight
Call you when 'm there
() - Gallagher heads down
Bounding down the hill
No algae on his side
He leaves a trail of phosphorescent footprints as he goes
They grow fainter and fainter as he descends
-   - Bowman comes rushing in
Too fast
Slams up into a wall
Resets
Belts herself in
- It's been sitting there for 30 years
As he approaches, the solar panels turn and track towards his light
It's still waiting
Sits on six over-built legs
Sample return vehicle launches off the base
Liquid fuel tanks, sample return container the size of a large trash can
We hear - (
) How you doing
(unsettled) It's really cold
My fingers aren't sure they want to work
(
) You can do this
(then) The maintenance port has a cover
It should be marked
Gallagher looks it over
Minor stumbling block
Yeah
In Cyrillic
Finds it anyhow
He flexes his unresponsive fingers, and after a try or two, unscrews the cover, reveals an  port
Got it
(
) All right, 'm gonna download this to you
Gallagher yanks out his
Dozen adapters in the back
Finds the one that fits the old modem port on the jerry-rigged radio
Go
Plugs it in
Stuff flashes
On the , Windows comes up, the Cosmos LaunchMaster program, Cyrillic crudely relabeled in English
Unplugs the modem so he can speak again
It's still got power
(
) You should be able to run diagnostics
There's a diagnostics check and launch check
He hits diagnostics
The two talk, link up, and  - a Windows error screen comes up on the : "Warning - your system has become busy or unstable
Press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to exit programs and reboot
" know now why it didn't launch
(says the magic words) Control alt delete
Reboots in the blink of an eye
Systems check positive
It's looking good
(
) Okay, this thing only has two settings
On and off
One sends it all the way back to Earth
As you don't have air, food or water, that would be bad
-   - Bowman is calculating madly as she goes on
Trying to sound calm
She's anything but
We want just enough lift for escape velocity
With the weight you left at and the suit
peg you at 165
It was designed to take 200 pounds of rocks home
Tanks are seven liters each
You need to take two liters out of each tank
There's a central purge; you're gonna have to be exact
- As she continues - (
) And you better try to find something to put the fuel in and get it the hell away from there, as we don't want it to go up when the rocket goes off
Gallagher considers
Yeah, it all makes sense
But how
: - Gallagher, using the few tools he has left, has unbolted the sample return container
Measures its width - need you to do some math
cylinder 50 centimeters wide, how deep is six liters
(
) Eleven and three quarters centimeters
He measures and scribes in the line
Somewhere, Mr
Plummer, my 10th-grade math teacher, is cackling like a son-of-a-bitch
Under which, he slithers underneath, opens the main purge and fills the big steel bucket with rocket fuel
It looks just like the guy at Texaco, working on your car
Lugs it away from the Cosmos
Now what
(
) Launch diagnostics
Avoid pressing anything that says ignition
He runs it - seals are good, pumps are good, engine's ready
And the ignition power force, all 300 volts of it, is dead as a doornail
The program suggests the replacement part number
And suggests he order it quickly
Checks again
Answer's the same
He slumps down, sits beside
He ain't going nowhere
Just sits there
Can't move
Can't speak
After all this, he's fucked
Stares out into the distance
Finally - (
) Gallagher
No
No go
There's enough power to run the computer, but not enough to launch
(
) How much do you need
need 300 volts at six amps
And 've 28 volts running the computer system
Ignition battery's stone cold
Beat
(
) Is there anything you can use
Let me look around and see if  see a high voltage source
No, just rocks
In fact, everywhere  look, there's just fucking rocks
And more fucking rocks
Then, as he tries not to break down - 'm gonna die here
-   - She's shook
She knows he's right
Not a damn thing she can say
Tries to maintain
Barely
Looks up at one of the screens
In four minutes she's back on day side orbit
And then home
: - Gallagher steadies himself
Picks the radio back up
He's just babbling to keep himself sane for a little while
didn't come here to be a citizen
came as a tourist
You know, visit Mars, check out the sights
Go home
Bowman tries to do the right thing
Whatever the hell that is
Takes a breath, wipes away an errant tear, tries to be calm for him
Is there anything you want me to do
(thinks; then) Tell all of Burchenal's women that they were the only one
Sell his horse to somebody nice
For you
No
Then, burbling up, unplanned
shoulda kissed you
There's a long beat
Yeech
He shouldn't have said anything
Then - Yeah
You shoulda kissed me
Gallagher can't believe it
He could kick himself
(to himself) Okay
This is like all the worst parts of high school math and the beautiful girl you're too stupid to tell you're madly in love with
And then,  get to die
What a shitty day
(into radio) Commander Bowman,  am really sorry  didn't kiss you
Really, really sorry
He pauses
Only half a beat, but
-   - She bursts from the darkness into the light of day side and is gone
turns to
- When he goes on - Loved you madly, shoulda said so
It's too late
She never hears
He realizes she's gone
Puts the radio down
He is very, very alone
-   - She sits there, just gut-shot for a moment
Picks up the mike
Houston, this is Ares, commencing return sequence
- On all the 's her return trajectory is plotted
She's to come all the way across the day side, enter night, begin acceleration and slingshot around the backside of Mars and head home
Copy
Ares, beginning return She steels herself then reports the rest of the news - (
) Ground crew, reduced to Gallagher, reached Cosmos, failed second diagnostics
No joy, no launch
While crew member is still extant, mission commander declaring him
Commencing return
There's silence in Mission Control
Not everyone has followed the circumvention
What was all that
Gallagher made it to the Cosmos, won't launch, he's alive, she's gotta leave him
Whoa
Da
- Gallagher sits there
And sits there
Alone beyond imagining
Hope gone
Just staring 1000 yards out into the distance
Not looking at anything
Waiting to die
He's given up
And then
he shakes himself out of it
Just feels foolish he's let himself go this far
Gets up
Done with feeling sorry for himself
Well, this can't get any worse
guess
Grabs himself to stay warm
Hops up and down
On one of the hops he ends up facing the direction he came from
There's something green and phosphorescent coming over the ridge
They've tracked him
Footprint by footprint
He looks closer
It's not just the ridge
They're down in the valley with him
The ones in the front are back to translucent, not glowing anymore
They're hungry for something new
He gets down low to silhouette them against the sky
There are already four or five hundred thousand on this side of the hill
And they're coming
Faster
guess  was wrong
It can get worse
lot fucking worse
(shouts at them) Forgive me if  don't feel like getting eaten before  die
They don't really respond
Except the ones in the front who rear up, and seem to listen or sniff for him
And gnash their little crystalline teeth
They split now to come at him from two sides
Gallagher gets caught in a dry-heave
Oh, man
Sees the bucket of rocket fuel
Lot closer to them than it is to him
Gathers his nerve, runs, grabs the bucket
Drags it twenty feet back
Then tilts it, carefully pouring it out in a ring around himself and the Cosmos
Worms closing in as he goes
Leads a fuse of fuel back towards him
Lights it
It burns low and yellow in the oxygen-depleted atmosphere
Doesn't look like much
Certainly not a defence
First worm gets near it
Unsure
Bewildered
Pulls back
But his compatriots are behind him, still coming
No choice
He advances
And
in burst of red-orange as he touches the flame
And the next
And the next
Like little sparks
Gallagher watches, puzzled by this
And then it hits
Right as the ring of flame is about to die out
The main wave touches the ring of fire
And
they do burn
And
Little   that multiplied by tens and hundreds of thousands begin to pierce the air
That's for eating the Hab
And killing Cooper, you slimy worm fuckers
Rolling waves of flame
Half plasma
Flying blobs of burning worms rain down like napalm
One lands on and torches the cobbled-together radio
It's so damn hot for a moment Gallagher panics, thinking everything might explode
Then it drops to embers and the wave burns over the hill like a wild fire
Gallagher does a dance of triumph
However short-lived
Then it hits him - How do you burn like that without oxygen
There's a  of flame from the far side of the ridge that rattles rocks and Cosmos
Knocks him to the ground
Holy shit
Holy shit
Gallagher stares with wonder over the hill
He figured it out
There's a couple of dozen worms, unburnt and thrown free
He picks one up, looks at it
You motherfuckers stole all the oxygen
(realizes) And you can give it back
Motherfuckers
gotta tell someone
It could work
It could work here
He turns, looks - the radio is still burning
He snatches it up, scorches him
Tries to put it out
It's cooked
Deceased
He's devastated
Drops to his knees
No
Not after all this
No
It ain't gonna work ever again
All the shouting isn't gonna make a difference
He knows the answer, he knows how to save the species and there's no one he can tell
As he stumbles back onto his feet, he's jarred the switch that links to 's display
it comes on, shows: ' The fire on the far side of the ridge
She's approaching it
And fast
Gallagher stares at it for a moment
My day is not getting better, is it
There's a look on his face somewhere between inspiration and fear
Like he's got an idea
But it might be a really, really bad one
- skitters along
Moving fast
Climbs up and ever so carefully peers over the ridgeline
' The Cosmos down below
And beneath it, his feet sticking out as he works on something, Gallagher
He messed with her once; she recognizes him
If she could bare her teeth like an angry dog, she would
considers for a moment
Makes her move
- She comes down the hill
Twelve, sixteen, twenty-foot strides
Doing forty or fifty miles an hour easy
And all but silently
Gallagher hasn't yet responded
And then she's all the way to him
She rears up to strike and - And Gallagher, in his skivvies, bursts up from where he's buried himself in the sand, avenging, entrenching tool high over his head, already swinging as  wheels back around and
He chops off both her eyes
Sidesteps as she rushes him blindly and backhands her in her electronic Marine cranium from behind
Whatever he's hit, the jolt stiffens his arm, throws him off
The tool stays embedded
She runs headlong into the Cosmos
Smashes, stumbles, falls
And before she can get back up to her feet
He wraps the sleeve of his shirt around his hand, rescues the entrenching tool and deals a death stroke to the silver arachnid
Robust real-time response to the environment, my butt
Gallagher grabs his satchel of tools and begins to unbolt her as fast as he can
Checks his watch
Whatever he's racing, there's only minutes to go
Deep within the electronic entrails of , he dredges up her Esource
Size of a soda can
that runs her for year and a half
as he removes it from its shielded container
It's 280 volts
Work
He rips open a panel on the Cosmos, yanks out the dead cell and hooks the new one in
It doesn't fit
He's got nothing left but a couple of wrenches and a tube of epoxy
Glues it in place
Runs the launch Diagnostics on his
It flickers, goes to yellow, flashes on and off to green
He yanks back on his suit
Grabs a handful of the uncharred worms and seals them in the container that held the Esource
Stuffs it in a side pocket
Looks at the top of
Wedges himself under some cables and wiring on the top
This oughta be interesting
Checks his watch
It's now or never
- The ship is just about to enter the darkside
-   - Bowman's got her suit on
Screens show the apogee launch and a slingshot around the backside
Houston, this is Ares
am go for return ignition
(
) Copy that, Ares, you are go for return
She slides into the darkness
- Gallagher watches the second hand come around, takes a deep breath, and
Fuck you, Mars
slaps the helmet shut
Hits ignition
Nothing happens
Then the  of thirty-year-old
And then a  flaming
And it launches
Gallagher, epoxied to the top, is pinned flat
Face squashes, eyes bulge
Ship starts to glow friction
Thirty-year-old paint chips off like tiny shooting stars burning away as this reverse comet leaves the atmosphere
We can hear him roaring at the top of his lungs as the   by and
pulls away in the b
g
Rapidly contracting
the ,  a red circle below
Atmosphere thins, the friction and flame decrease and disappear
turns from deep red to maroon to black as he blows through the clouds into the outer reaches of the Mars atmosphere and beyond
The
Fuel's expended
And
Quiet
He comes skittering back from the edge of blacking out
He floats silently, orbiting the planet, slowing receding into the distance
Until he's
gone
- We see Bowman  the front viewport
Unhurried
Making the last of her preparations
Downhearted and slow
Then - -   - She's strapped in now
Counter on a screen is ticking down
13, 12, 11
She tries to allay her horror at what she's doing
Reaches for the mike
Robby
(no answer) If you can still hear me
'm so sorry
And  shoulda just kissed you
Radio, three-quarters cooked, lays there on the still-smoking ground
-   - Countdown continues
Nine, eight, seven
Then just breaking the horizon way out in front of her, a shiny metallic speck breaches into the light
It's a man, glued to thirty-year-old spacecraft
Four, three
She slams down an abort button, as with the other hand she twists the radio over to the suit-to-suit frequency
Gallagher
No response
Gallagher is sucking on a few useless raspy breaths
He can see her, ten kilometers away
Barely hanging on
No
Air
- They stare up at the screen awaiting her return ignition
She should be clearing
Starting the burn
She's not showing
Still not showing
And then
There's secondary object in orbit
- Bowman has flipped a set of joysticks/collectives out from underneath the dash in front of her
She's shouting at the computer
Reroute
Orbital maneuvering
Power the , power the
need roll, pitch, yaw, , ,
Now
Goddammit now
- They've figured out what's up
Some are thrilled, others are freaked
No
No, there's no fuel for maneuvering
Stop her
Skavlem shakes his head
Not a chance
Nor would she listen to him
She is going to burn fuel to rescue this man without enough to come home
(very Russian of her) like this girl
- Which is exactly what she does
want ten milliliter bursts
Now
And puff, puff, puff
- Ares, bit by bit, dives down into a smaller orbit to catch up with the Cosmos
- Bowman grabs the whole orbital maneuvering assembly, yanks it out of the flight deck, turns and rushes from the sphere
-  - As he watches it come closer, he's depleted what little air there was in the suit
And starts to die
-   - It's now an empty docking port
Bowman careens in
No artificial gravity here
Floats as she shouts at the computer
want a 180 degree
Now
-  - Puff, puff
The ship turns end over end
As
- Kate plugs the maneuvering deck in with one hand, slaps an oxygen bottle on and her helmet shut
Seal this level
Open the dock
Clips herself in just in time as the   behind her  shut and the giant doors in front of her open
Air purges
And in front of her, 300 yards away, is the Cosmos
Gallagher
Gallagher
He doesn't respond
- Because he's unconscious or dead
His head lolls there
- There's no time left for subtlety
Bowman yanks a device off the wall
It looks like a 40mm rifle with a power cable
Points it at him
Triggers it
It's a huge laser pointer
Lights him up
Shouts to the computer
Hard Dock
The ship pauses, like it's thinking
And refuses
(
) Object out of range
Emergency braking will commence in seven seconds
Ares turns off the pointer
Kate throws it angrily aside
There's a linear acceleration track on the side of the wall with a line thrower attached
She clips in
Grabs something the size of a medicine ball with seventy nozzles sticking out of it in her free hand
And shouts - Last acquisition
Line release
Full velocity
And it does
The linear accelerator wrenches her violently along the track and hurls her into space
and a line behind her
It's like the world's largest angler has cast her into the void
- Tumbling, she half-regains her bearing, holds out the mini-thrust ball
Shouts something at it
Drags her by the arm towards Cosmos
She hits it
Twisting, flailing, way too hard
Half knocks herself out
Recovers, clips in with the tether on her suit
Gallagher is completely insensate
She shouts something in the silence we can't hear
The reel in the ship starts to spin
So damn fast it's smoking
The Cosmos is reeled in, oscillating wildly at the end of the line
The Ares, giant by comparison, is about to swallow up the tiny  and its two passengers
At 45 mph
/
- Dock comes careening at them
They're both going to be squashed like bugs
Bowman slashes loose the line
And fires everything left in the portable thrust engine at once
Blue plasma flares
Her arm is wrenched wildly, pulled from its socket
But
The Cosmos spins 180 degrees as they plunge through the opening of the port into the Ares
They're on the lee side as the Cosmos hits the far side of the dock like a freight train
Seal
Emergency atmosphere
Now
The
The room is buffeted in white mist
She grabs an emergency cutting tool, hooks it into the front of Gallagher's suit
Rips it open from stem to stern
He's limp, unresponsive
No
Not after all that, dammit
No
She checks, he has no pulse
Dammit, no
first aid station is bolted into the wall
She grabs him by the shirtfront, launches them over there
Takes out a pair of pre-gummed  , slaps them onto his chest and  them
Gallagher is thrown entirely across the room by the current
Slams into the far wall
Opens his eyes
Starts to breathe
Hey,  knew you wouldn't leave without me
(beat) You promised
- They're all stunned
And freaked
They've got a serious problem now
(
) Mission Control
This is Ares
Recovered ground crew
Request recalc and reconfiguration for return flight
Orbit is stable but diminished
The scientists have been figuring madly
And they don't like what they're coming up with
We can get 'em back
Slowly
Fifty extra days
And we're not going to be able to support food and and air for two people
Russert nods
Motions to Skavlem
-   - Bowman and Gallagher listen as - (
) that travel has been increased by approximate two months
Concern is that available life support is untenable for duration and current crew strength
Gallagher's unimpressed
Worms tried to eat him, robots tried to kill him and they're worried about this
Feh
Scientists
Scientists sent us here
Scientists figured the whole thing out with Mars
hate to bring this up, but they got us into this whole mess in the first place
Hell, they shouldn't be allowed to drive 'cause they miss the turnoff as they consider the ramifications of the internal combustion engine
He picks up the mike
Hey, guys
How 'bout we come about halfway home and you send a ship with air and food and stuff to meet us
In the middle
And we don't have to get all the way back
Huh
- Schlissel nods
That'd work
As Russert, Lowenthal and the big guys start to talk this over, Borokovski motions to Schlissel and his new friend the Tech
know where there is a rocket in Uzbeckistan
For cheap
friend of mine has kept it
-   - the window, Mars drifts by in the view port
Bowman looks at it kinda sadly
So much for saving humankind and living on Mars
guess the worms took care of that
The worms are not our enemy
They're our friends
He's pulled the container out of his pocket
Unscrews it to show her the little slimy monsters
She recoils in horror
You brought them back
Are you insane
It's okay, 'm pretty sure they don't like titanium
(then) We're gonna live
On Mars
Hell, maybe even back on Earth
Maybe anywhere we want
And the reason we're gonna live, is the damn worms
Yeah, they ate all the algae, and damn near everything else, but they store and excrete oxygen
She finds this hard to believe
But he explains
That's why we could breathe
You should have seen these suckers burn when they went up
had some time to think about this
was in orbit for six minutes before you found me
shoulda been dead
But the air locked in the suit was almost pure O2
'Cause of the worms
We didn't just find a new place to live on, we may have saved our old one
Toxic waste, they'll eat it
Poisonous landfills, they'll eat it
She's still trying to absorb all this
It's been a long couple of days
God's got a sense of humor
He's giving us another chance
If we can all get along this time
Burchenal knew somewhere that it wasn't the science, it was about having something to believe in
Bud always knew
Wonders of the deep
We just had to go to Mars to remind ourselves of what we should have been able to see back on Earth
It's not all about us
We can't kill everything and survive
Bowman looks back at Mars
Astounded
Believes
You wanna tell them back on Earth the species is saved and we're gonna live
How should  know, 'm the janitor
(then) Look, Commander
just fought off half a million screaming nematodes, and a killer robot and glued myself onto a rocket to get offa Mars, and  was wondering
If you could kiss me
Yeah
Yeah
He does
She kisses him back
They continue for a long damn time
Finally, they break apart and
It's an extra fifty days back
Gee, wonder what we'll find to do with ourselves
As she starts to laugh
