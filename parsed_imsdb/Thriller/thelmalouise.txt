She is in her early- thirties, but too old to be doing this
She is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift
She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter
It is making a lot of , which she is oblivious to
There is   in the b
g
, which she hums along with
'  - is a housewife
It's morning and she is slamming coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left from last night's dinner which had to "soak"
She is still in her nightgown
The  is  in the b
g
From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it- yourself" attempt by Thelma
- Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number
'  - Phone
Thelma goes over to answer it
(hollering) got it
Hello
- (at pay phone) hope you're packed, little housewife, 'cause we are outta her tonight
'  - Well, wait now
still have to ask Darryl if  can go
(
) You mean you haven't asked him yet
For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father
It's just two days
For God's sake, Thelma
Don't be a child
Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud
Tell him 'm havin' a nervous breakdown
Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them
We see various recipes torn out from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook Pork
" He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl
Are you at work
(
) No, 'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion
'll call you right back
Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister
Darryl
Honey, you'd better hurry up
comes trotting down the stairs
Polyester was made for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry
He manages a Carpeteria
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that
Haven't  told you  can't stand it when you holler in the morning
'm sorry, Doll,  just didn't want you to be late
Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees
He exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent
He likes to think of himself as a real lady killer
He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair
Thelma watches approvingly
Hon
What
(she decides not to tell him) Have a good day at work today
Uh-huh
Hon
What
You want anything special for dinner
No, Thelma,  don't give a shit what we have for dinner
may not even make it home for dinner
You know how Fridays are
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night
You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and  am
He's finally ready
He walks to the door and gives Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek
'Bye, honey
won't wait up
See ya
Darryl leaves
We see his Corvette parked out front
As he closes the front door, Thelma leans against it
He's gonna shit
Thelma laughs to herself
She goes back into the kitchen and picks up the phone and dials it
- The pay phone on the wall
, a busboy in his 50's, answers
Good morning
Why, yes, she is
Is this Thelma
Oh, Thelma, when you gonna run away with me
Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand
(to Albert) Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me
(into phone) Hi
What'd he say
(
) What time are you gonna pick me up
You're kiddin'
Alright
'll be there around two or three
(
) What kind of stuff do  bring
don't know
Warm stuff,  guess
It's the mountains
guess it gets cold at night
'm just gonna bring everything
(
) Okay
will, too
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff
(
) don't know how to fish, Louise
Neither do , Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be
'll see you later
Be ready
They both hang up
- Louise pulls out in a green '66 -Bird in mint condition
'  -  -    - Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, -shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two-day trip
Thelma, standing in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something
The room looks like it was decorated entirely from a Sears catalog
It's really frilly
'  -  -    - perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and orderly
Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, one nightgown
She could be packing for camp
Louise
Her room is as orderly as the suitcase
Everything matches
It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, but it is of the same ilk
She is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks
She decides not to and closes the suitcase
She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials
We hear: (
) Hi
This is Jimmy
'm not here right now, but 'll probably be back 'cause
all my stuff's here
Leave a message
Louise slams down the phone
framed picture of Louise and Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone
She matter-of- factly slams that face down, too
'  - Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now
She talks to herself quietly the whole time
She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, fingernail scissors, etc
She opens the drawer of her nightstand
Her attitude is purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision is completely arbitrary
As she rifles through it, plucking various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection
It is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets
She picks up the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse
(muttering to herself) Psycho killers
She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too
She tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out all over the place
She stuffs things back in the sides and heaves all her weight against the top
'  - Louise's green '66 -Bird convertible pulls into the driveway of Thelma's house
The garage door goes up and Thelma is standing in the garage with all her gear
suitcase that looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a lantern
Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in there, too
Louise gets out of the driver's seat
We don't need the lantern
The place has electricity
wanna take it anyway
Just in case
In case of what
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us
(going along with her) Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy
Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs
We'd have to
That thing barely makes it down the driveway
They load everything into the car
The trunk barely closes
Thelma heaves all her weight against it
They get into the car and pull out of the driveway
As they drive down the street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl
She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the air
- They are driving down the interstate
Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun
Louise, will you take care of the gun
Louise shrieks at the sight of it
Why in hell did you bring that
Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive
Oh, come on, Louise
psycho killers, bears
snakes
just don't know how to use it
So will you take care of it
Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse and holds it in her hand
She tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat
Thelma puts the bullets under the seat
They are speeding off down the highway with the  blaring
Louise puts in a  of wild &
Whose place is this again
It's Bob's, the day manager's
He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys
've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl
How come he let you go
'Cause  didn't ask him
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you
Well, he has never let me go
He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun
All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what
They are both silent for a minute
(looking straight ahead) left him a note
left him stuff to microwave
After a pause
guess you haven't heard anything from Jimmy
yet
Louise's jaw tightens
The car speeds up
never mind
huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway and
The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women
There is a bumper sticker on the back that says: "Lick you all over -- ten cents
" One of your friends
Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to smoke a cigarette
'     alongside the road that reads "See you in church on Sunday
" Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out
Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything
-   - How much longer is it gonna be
'm hungry
Another hour of so
We've got enough food for a month
'll never make it
Can't we stop just for a few minutes
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma
Then what difference does it make if we stop
Come on
never get to do stuff like this
Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in
Alright, but it's gonna be a quick stop
- They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon
It's called the
The sign flashes --  --  --
There is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars
Even though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night spot
It's already pretty crowded
- This place is jumpin'
There are ten pool tables with crowds all around
The long bar is filled with customers
There are tables and booths
The room is dense with smoke
There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up
There are a lot of single men
Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an empty table
haven't seen a place like this since  left Texas
Isn't this fun
comes over and drops two menus on the table
'all wanna drink
No thanks
'll have Wild Turkey straight up and a Coke back, please
As the Waitress leaves: Thelma
Tell me somethin'
Is this my vacation or isn't it
mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl
just haven't seen you like this in a while
'm used to seeing you more sedate
Well, 've had it up to my ass with sedate
You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down
Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down
As the Waitress returns: (laughing) Alright
(to Waitress) changed my mind
'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please
Yeah
As the Waitress leaves, a  comes over with a chair which he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards
He is in his late-40's, heavyset, his face is shiny in the neon light
Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls like you doin' in a place like this
Mindin' our own business, why don't you try it
Well, we left town for the weekend 'cause we wanted to try and have a good time
And because Louise here is mad because her boyfriend won't call her while he's out on the road
Louise kicks Thelma under the table
(quieter) We just wanted to get somethin' to eat
Well, you come to the right place
You like chili
They got good chili
The Waitress returns with Louise's drink
Harlan, are you botherin' these poor girls
() Hell, no
was just bein' friendly
(making eye contact with Louise) It's a good thing they're not all as friendly as you
Louise understands
Your name's Harlan
got an uncle named Harlan
You do
Is he a funny uncle
'Cause if he is, then he and  got somethin' in common
Harlan laughs
Thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get the joke
Louise does not laugh
(to Harlan) don't mean to be rude, but 've got something  need to talk to my friend about
In private
Aw,  understand
didn't mean to bother ya
It's just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves
(standing, to Thelma) You better dance with me before you leave, or 'll never forgive you
Oh, sure
That'd be fun
Harlan leaves, then: Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you
So what if he was
It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all
Maybe
Well, just relax, will ya
You're makin' me nervous
Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her glass to the Waitress to bring her another one
The Waitress sees her and nods
She turns back to face her friend
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine
Asshole
'm sorry, Louise
know you're all upset
It's just 'm so excited to be out of the house,  guess
(pause) wonder if Darryl's home yet
wonder if Jimmy's gotten back
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours
They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic problems, until the Waitress comes over: (rolling her eyes) This one's on Harlan
Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at her, making dancing motions
She smiles and waves at him
Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise
Jimmy'll come in off the road, you won't be there, he'll freak out and call you a hundred thousand times, and Sunday night you'll call him back and, by Monday
He'll be kissin' the ground you walk on
Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at which she speaks can be staggering
Louise is used to it
Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the situation
Exactly
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun
So let's have some
She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her glass, as the  strikes up a lively tune
Practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance floor
Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass, too
Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while
Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named
Thelma is breathless, drunk and giggly
She holds a beer bottle in one hand
She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan is studying her closely
Louise notices this
(over the noise) Thelma, 'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road
(eyes closed, swaying with the music) Ready when you are
Louise heads off to the bathroom
(eyes still closed) Louise, 'm gonna come with you
(she gets a funny look on her face) don't feel so good
She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle
Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her
(catching Thelma, copping feels) Oopsy-doopsy
We need to get you some fresh air, little lady
He steers her towards the door
Louise leans against the wall, waiting in line
: - Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot
She is pretty limp
Oh shit
What's wrong
Stop
What for
'm spinning
- The Waitress is going over to their table
She picks up Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair
She sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she can see them and walks away
- Louise goes into the bathroom
She stands in front of the sink and looks at herself in the mirror
- Thelma has been sick
She has Harlan's handkerchief and is wiping her mouth
Harlan has backed off for this part, but he's right back in there
How you feelin' now, darlin'
Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her head away
guess 'm startin' to feel a little better
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too
He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her
Thelma pulls away
(uncomfortable) think  need to keep walking
- Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in
She scans the room looking for Thelma
She doesn't see her
She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there
She picks up the check and looks at it
- Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot
He is trying to kiss her now
He is pushing her arms down and turning her head away
Don't
'm married
don't feel good
've been sick
It's okay
'm married, too
Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning to push him away harder
- Louise is paying the Waitress
The Waitress is shaking her head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either
Louise picks up Thelma's stuff and heads towards the door
- Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck
He has her ass in his hands
He is beginning to hump her
She is pushing him away as hard as she can, but he is relentless
(breathing heavily) You're beautiful
It's okay won't hurt you
It's okay
(struggling) Stop it
Goddamnit,  mean it
Louise is gonna wonder where  am
Let go
Louise is alright
is now standing outside the door of the Silver Bullet
She is looking around
is pulling at Thelma's clothes
Thelma gets one of her arms free and hits him hard in the face
He hits her back and grabs her face, squeezing it hard
Don't you hit me
Don't you fucking hit me
There is no trace of friendliness in his face now
He looks mean and dangerous
He lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her
He holds both of her arms with one hand
You just shut up
With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her dress up
Thelma is still struggling and there are tears running down her face
Don't hurt me
Harlan
Please
Shut up
He turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of the car
He holds both her arms in one hand and continues pulling her dress up over her hips
He starts to undo his pants as we hear the  of gravel
(
) Let her go
Get lost
Louise
of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into the nape of Harlan's neck
Louise's thumb pulls back the hammer
You let her go, you fat fucking asshole, or 'm gonna splatter your ugly face all over this nice car
Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts out, pulling her dress down
Now, calm down
We were just havin' a little fun
Louise glances at Thelma
Thelma shakes her head no
Looks like you've got a real fucked up idea of fun
Now turn around
Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to his face
His pants are undone in the front
She is still backing away with the gun raised
Thelma is inching away as well
Just for the future, when a woman's crying like that, she's not having any fun
Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second
Then she turns and walks away
Thelma does, too
(pulling up his pants) Bitch
should have gone ahead and fucked her
Louise stops in her tracks
What did you say
said suck my cock
Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the gun and  a bullet into his face
We hear his body the gravel parking lot
'
The car behind him is splattered with blood
Thelma and Louise are both silent
We hear the  of the nightclub in the distance
Louise lowers the gun
Oh my God
Get the car
Jesus Christ
Louise, you shot him
Get the car
Thelma runs to get the car
(quietly, to herself) You watch your mouth, buddy
Thelma comes careening up in reverse
Louise hops in and Thelma  , spraying gravel
As they speed out of the parking lot back to the road, we hear  blaring from the nightclub
They hit the main road with tires
Get back to the interstate
Louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the gun
Shit
, which way
West
Left
-   - They get onto the interstate going west
-- - Louise picks up the handkerchief from the car seat and wipes the gun off
Her movements are as if in slow motion
She puts the gun under the seat
Thelma is watching her
Louise
Louise does not answer
Louise
Where are we going
(shaking) don't know, Thelma
don't know
Just shut up a minute so  can think
Thelma starts to cry quietly
Shouldn't we go to the cops
mean, think we should tell the police
Tell them what
What, Thelma
What do you think we should tell them
don't know
Just tell 'em what happened
Which part
All of it
That he tried to rape me
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma
Who's gonna believe that
We just don't live in that kind of world
Pull over
- Thelma pulls off to the side of the road
Louise gets out and starts to walk around the car
She stops when she gets to the back of the car, and she is sick
Thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side
Louise gets in the driver's side
Louise
Are you alright
Louise rests her head on the steering wheel
Oh Christ
(to Thelma) Thelma
Thelma doesn't hear
Thelma
Thelma looks at her blankly, without answering
've gotta stop for a minute
've got to get it together
'm gonna find a place to get a cup of coffee and 'm gonna sit down for a second
Do you want to come
Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly
Louise studies Thelma's face
Is that yes
Are you up to this
Again, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod
Louise puts the car in gear and pulls
-  - The green '66 -Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks
Louise turns to Thelma
We gotta be inconspicuous
Do you know what that means
Yes
It means you don't talk to anybody
You don't draw attention to yourself in any way
Do you understand that
Again, she twitches more than nods
Tell me you understand that
Thelma nods more firmly now
She understands
of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee shop
They look small and incongruous with the surroundings
-   - '  - 4
slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter
Louise and Thelma sitting at the counter
Louise is looking at a map
The car is parked outside, near the door
(halfway to herself) We have to think this through
We have to be smart
Now is not the time to panic
If we panic now, we're done for
Nobody saw it
Nobody knows it was us
We're still okay
Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move
Our next move
'll say one thing, Louise
This is some vacation sure am having a good time
This is real fun
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now
Just what is that supposed to mean
It means shut up, Thelma
So this is all my fault, is it
Louise looks at Thelma for a long time
Just shut up
The Waitress comes and fills their coffee cups
Thelma stands up to go to the bathroom
She grabs her purse from the counter, and the strap catches on her coffee cup and it falls to the floor with a
All heads turn and look at her
have to go to the bathroom
Sorry
on Louise
- 4:00
Police cars are parked around
The activity has died down
Doors on the coroner's van  shut
In the back of a police car sits the Waitress with the door open
in a suit leans over the car door with his note pad
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again
() Hal, 've told you about twenty times, yes,  could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and  could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot
'm just surprised it didn't happen before now
Who do you think did it
Has anybody asked his wife
She's the one  hope did it
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya
Do have any ideas or don't ya
been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and  still got to go file a report before  can go home in time to get back up again
Well, if  had to guess, 'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband
But it wasn't either one of those two
The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal
don't follow the customers to the parking lot
Alright, Lena
Go on home
We might have to call you in for some more questioning
Lena gets out of the back of the car
Those girls are not the murderous type
- Outside the bathroom there is a pay phone
Thelma picks it up and dials
(into phone) Collect from Thelma
There is no answer
'  - Phone
of the interior of the empty Dickinson house: exactly as Thelma left it
The drawer of the nightstand still open
taped to the refrigerator
The interior of the microwave with a now completely thawed microwave dinner still in the package in a little puddle
- Thanks
'll try later
She hangs up and goes into the bathroom
As the door closes behind her, Louise comes up with a handful of change and starts putting it into the phone
She dials a number
It for a long time
She hangs up and goes into the bathroom
She looks at herself in the mirror
She notices a tiny speck on her cheek
She takes a paper towel and wets it and rubs the spot
She looks at the towel and there is a bright red streak
Thelma
Come on, Thelma
The door of the stall flies open and Thelma comes charging out and heads straight for the door, without even looking at Louise
Louise charges out after her
They head out of the restaurant and,   , we see them get into the car and drive away
-   - The -Bird barrels down a fairly empty four-lane highway
truck passes going the other way
- The top is down on the car, and Thelma is slouched on the seat, her hair blowing wildly
We're gonna go to the next town and stop
We'll get a motel room can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money
We're gonna need money
Thelma
How much money do you have with you
What
Oh,  don't know
Let me look
Thelma is rummaging through her purse
She finds her wallet and takes it out
Thelma finds some bills stuffed in the change compartment and takes them out
She straightens the money out
Sixty-four dollars
As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her hands
Thelma's not that good at handling money
Umm
Shit
Forty-four dollars
Louise has not noticed any of this
She is so intent on her driving
'm cash poor
Hmmm
We gotta get some money
-   - The motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops
-  (6
) The curtains are open and we can see the car parked right outside the room
Thelma is lying on the bed staring up at the ceiling
Louise is bustling around the room, putting things in drawers
Why are you unpacking
You said we were just gonna take a nap
Louise did not realize she was doing it
Oh,  don't know
'm just nervous
gotta figure out what to do
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up
Just what the hell is wrong with you
Louise slams the closet door
Thelma jumps
What do you mean
Why are you actin' like this
Actin' like what
How am  supposed to act
'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off
They are silent for a moment
You could help me try and figure it out
gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me
suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, 'm all out of ideas
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma
If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us
Oh Christ
'm just not ready to go to jail yet
Why don't you go out to the pool or something and 'll figure it out
Give me the keys
You're not touchin' that car
My stuff's in the trunk
God
You care more about that car than you do about most people
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it
- Hal is at the police station where they're dusting the car with Harlan all over it for prints
Hal looks closely at the back of the car
He holds his hands over two sets of hand prints
He moves his hands to the outside of the prints so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car
His face is one inch away from the trunk
He sees a very clear drop of blood
It's different than any of the other blood splatters on the car
He calls the identification technician over and points it out
(pointing) What's that
The
comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders
Blood
Whose
His,  guess
Hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache
He stares at the guy
You guess
Hal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the area of the black smudge and the drop of blood
He shakes his head slightly
- Thelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool
She stops, then decides to go on to the pool
She lies down in a lounge chair facing the road
- Louise in the motel room
She's looking at the phone
She picks it up and dials it and watches herself in the mirror
She stares as if she's trying to see into herself, see through herself
- Thelma arranges herself in a lounge chair, trying desperately to feel like she's on vacation
- (
) Hi
This is Jimmy
'm not here right now
interrupts the message: (
) Hello
'm here
Hang on a minute
The machine switches
'  - , mid-30's, musician, is standing in the kitchen on the phone
He's not the type you'd expect Louise to like, not quite straight-looking enough
(
) (on phone) Jimmy
- Louise is looking at herself on the phone in the mirror
She is very choked up
(
) (on phone) Louise
Where are you
Are you alright
Honey
Hi
'm okay
How are you
Long time no see
(
) Louise, honey
Where are you
You sound funny
Louise is still looking at herself in the mirror, as if she's never seen herself before
am funny
'm real funny
(
) Are you in town
This sounds long distance
No, 'm out of town
'm in
'm in real deep shit, Jimmy
Deep shit Arkansas
(
) Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here
come back, nobody knows where you are
Is Thelma with you
Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts
don't envy her if she is
- Thelma at pool basking in the sun
- (
) (on phone) Where'd y'all go
Fishing
Look, Jimmy
need you to help me
This is serious
'm in trouble and  need you to help me
Can you do that
'  - Jimmy is shocked by the gravity of her tone of voice
He realizes this is very serious
Yes, yes, darlin'
can help you
Tell me where you are
- Louise covers the mouthpiece with her hand
She is trying very hard not to cry
have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it
Now  know you won't be able to get it out, but 'm good for it
need that money
Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and 'll pay you back
Please, 'm desperate
(
) What the fuck is going on
Something real bad has happened and can't tell you what, just that it's bad and  did it and  can't undo it
Can you help me
(
) Of course
Of course
Where
Can't bring it to you
For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad
Louise sits on the edge of the bed
She is looking at her hand
Jimmy
She takes the ring that she wears on her left hand and turns it around backwards to make it look like a wedding band
Do you love me
(
) Christ, sure
yes
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City, '  - You're in Oklahoma
(
) Not yet
Louise, let me call you back after wire it, so you'll know which office to go to
(
) Can't it go to any office
No, for that much money  have to tell them exactly which office know, 've had to have money wired to me on the road
And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you
'll have to tell you the code
- Tell me now
(
) Call me back
Okay
'll call you back
In an hour
Don't tell Darryl
(
) know
Call me back
Louise, love you, okay
Okay
- Thelma by the pool
car , a loud horn
(bellowing) Come on, Thelma
Get in the car
Thelma bolts upright and grabs her sundress and dashes to the car
She jumps in over the door
She's in a mild state of shock
Did you finish thinking
think better when  drive
Louise   of the parking lot
- '  - Hal is in the office talking to his superior
He stands in front of the desk with his hands in his pockets while his sits behind the desk looking troubled
All we know is there were two women in a green -Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast
We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet
So far, we got nothin'
Well, you'd best get something
Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it
want somebody to at least talk to 'em
Put out an  with a description and see what we get back
Alright
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state
That's certainly possible
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this
have no problem with that
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que
-  -   - - Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going
Oklahoma City
Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then
You talked to him
Is he mad
Did you tell him
No,  didn't tell him
And that's something we gotta get straight
Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise
When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this
You gotta make sure everything sounds normal
called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home don't know what he's got to be mad about
'm the one who should be mad
've been tellin' you that for the last ten years
Do you think Darryl's having an affair
don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair
But you think he fools around
Thelma, 'm going to Mexico
think can make it in two and a half days, but 'm going to have to haul ass
Are you up to this
mean,  have to know
This isn't a game
'm in deep shit
gotta know what you're gonna do
don't know
don't know what you're askin' me
Don't you fall apart on me
Goddamnit, Thelma
Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time
Not this time
Everything's changed now
Now you can do whatever you want, but 'm going to Mexico
'm going
Are you coming with me
Thelma is staring down the road
She does not answer
Then: think he does
Fool around
-  -   - -   - of an "indent-a-kit" likeness of Louise
On a table nearby lies a drawing strongly resembling Thelma
Lena, the waitress, sits next to the plain-clothes cop who holds the indent-a-kit
Hal picks up the drawing and studies it closely
- The -Bird rolls into town
- Louise and Thelma pull up in front of an old store, the kind with a wooden front porch, the kind that sells bait and flannel shirts
They enter the store and see an behind the counter
Do you have a pay phone
'Round the side, by the restrooms
Louise gets change while Thelma strolls around looking at rubber worms and pickled pigs' feet
Louise goes out to the phone
- Louise dropping change into the phone
It  and Jimmy answers
'  - Louise
- Is that how you answer the phone
(
) (on phone) got it
was afraid 'd missed you
almost couldn't get a check cashed
It's Saturday
Who did it
(
) Friend of mine, owns a club
Dickie Randall
You'd know him if you saw him
His brother was in your class
Terry
You didn't say what it was for, did you
(
) (on phone) No, honey
told him  was buyin' a car
What is it for
(not responding to the question) Good
That was good
Where do go
(
) (on phone) It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel
The address is 1921 North East 23
It's under your name
And what's the mysterious code word
(
) (on phone) Peaches
What
(
) That's the code word
miss you, peaches
Louise rolls her eyes and tries not to melt
Okay, Jimmy
Thanks
She puts her finger down on the receiver
'  - Jimmy is still holding the phone to his ear
Louise
- Thelma in store buying gum, beef jerky
Next to the cash register on the counter on display are those little tiny bottles of liquor
Thelma picks up a little bottle of Wild Turkey and puts in on the counter
The Old Man rings it up
She takes another one and puts it on the counter
The Old Man is still ringing stuff up
She takes two more and puts them on the counter
She takes the rest of the little bottles of Wild Turkey out of the display and puts them on the counter
She takes one little bottle of Cuervo and puts it down on the counter, too
The Old Man finally looks at her
From the wall behind him, he takes a pint of Wild Turkey down
Ma'am, are you sure you wouldn't rather have the large economy size
- Louise is hanging up the phone
She walks away towards the front of the store
- Thelma comes out of the front of the store
The store is at a crossroads with a fair amount of vehicular traffic
Go call Darryl
Thelma is walking towards the car
She puts her purse in the front seat
She looks at Louise
Call him
Call him
Don't tell him anything
Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night
Will  be
don't know
won't be
Thelma and Louise look at each other while this sinks in
walks around to the side of the building to the phone
She picks it up and dials
(into phone) Collect from Thelma
- Louise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo
- Honey
'  - Darryl in the den of their house
The room is a mess
There are beer cans everywhere
The large screen  is , showing a
Darryl is in a recliner
He is wearing loud shorts, a -necked -shirt, and a couple of necklaces and bracelets
Goddamnit, Thelma, where in the Sam Hill are you
- 'm
'm with Louise
We're in the mountains, we're
'  - (interrupting) What in the hell do you think you're doing
Have you lost your goddamn mind
Is that it
leave for work and you take complete leave of your senses
- Darryl
baby
Darryl, calm down now, honey
Please don't get so mad
can explain
'  - Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game
Hold on
Hold on a minute, damnit
He covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where "his team" fumbles the ball
This only makes him madder
He puts the phone back to his ear in time to hear Thelma say: (
) only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night
No you won't
You'll be back today
Now
You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit
Thelma, do you understand me
- Thelma is trying not to cry
She's trying to be strong
Darryl, please
You're my husband, not my father, Darryl
'  - (interrupting) That does it
That Louise is nothin' but a bad influence
If you're not back here tonight, Goddamnit, Thelma
well,  just don't wanna say
Neither one of them say anything for a moment
Thelma
- Darryl
(
) What
Go fuck yourself
She hangs up on him
- Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car
So she makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see
Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision
Whoa
Excuse me
Miss, are you alright
Thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue
Her crying is silent
Is there anything  can do
Thelma shakes her head "no
" She tries to control her tears
She notices how blue his eyes are
No
Thanks
Sorry
collects herself as she walks back to the car
She gets in and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror
In the mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the side of the building
He is several feet behind the car, and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and stuffs it into his duffel bag
Now he is just in -shirt and jeans
He looks good
Really good
She watches in the mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road
She can see him as he's walking
He stops
He's thinking
He heads over to the car
Would you mind me asking which direction you and your friend are going
'm trying to get back to school and my ride fell through, so 'm kinda stuck
Are you going my way
Thelma doesn't know what to do
Umm
think we're going to Oklahoma City
But 'm not sure
Do you think you could
mean, could help pay for gas
Thelma knows Louise isn't going to like this
Ummm
Well, see, it's not really up to me
It's not my car
Umm, we'll have to ask my friend, but she'll probably say no
She's a little uptight
Well
Maybe we better not ask her
But thank you anyway
Now she wants him to come
He starts to walk away from the car
Well, we can ask her
That won't hurt
Just then Louise comes out of the store
She sees Thelma talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car
Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that it's possible she might kill Thelma
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and thought since
It's probably not a good idea
Louise
The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road
'all have a nice day
Drive safe
The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to confront her
See how polite he is
He was really nice
Louise lowers the top and backs the car out
They watch him walk away
Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road
They pass the Hitchhiker
Thelma waves
(to Thelma) You cheer up now
She turns around in the seat to continue waving
He smiles and waves
They drive down the road
of the Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face
: -  - Thelma looking sulky
wish we could've brought him with us
What did Darryl say
(sarcastically) He said "Okay, Thelma
just wanted to know you were alright
hope you're havin' a good time
You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time
love you, honey
" Louise doesn't say anything
How long before we're in Goddamn Mexico
- Hal goes over a list of every registered green -Bird in the state
- Names are scrolling by as Hal stares blankly at the screen
We see the name    scroll past
It means nothing to Hal
- It's twenty minutes later
They are clear of the town
Thelma is like a dog with a bone
She just won't let it drop
just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride
Did you see his butt
Darryl doesn't have a cute butt
You could park a car in the shadow of his ass
'm sorry
'm just not in the mood for company right now
Here
Take this map
need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City
think we should stay off the interstates
We're too conspicuous
(taking map) Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to
(interrupting) don't want to go that way
Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas
(looking at map) Wait
What
You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas
You know how  feel about Texas
We're not going that way
know, Louise, but we're running for our lives
Don't you think you could make an exception just this once
mean, look at the map
The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas
Thelma
'm not gonna talk about this
Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and  will
You understand
No, Louise
How come you never said what happened
Louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and Thelma is totally puzzled by Louise's reaction but is reluctant to press her further
just
just don't think it's the place  wanna get caught for doin' something like
if you blow a guy's head off with his pants down, believe me, Texas is the last place you wanna get caught
Trust me
Now,  said,  don't wanna talk about it
Louise looks very shaken up
She keeps her eyes on the road but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles are white
She does not look at Thelma
Suddenly she reaches over and locks her door
Thelma flinches imperceptibly at this gesture
Okay
We'll go around Texas to get to Mexico
This is crazy
-  - Two Harley-Davidson bikes tool past, driven by a couple of ex-hippies from the 60's
The Hitchhiker is on the back of one, and he waves to them as they go by
Thelma waves back enthusiastically
'll tell you what
He is gooood lookin'
Louise pops a  into the cassette player
'   - Hal walks up the sidewalk past a couple of elderly people sitting outside, to the door of an apartment complex and knocks
'  - of Louise's empty apartment
There are pictures of Louise and Thelma in high school
The kitchen is spotless and nothing is out on the counters
is unwrinkled, perfect, and next to it on her nightstand is a picture of Jimmy and her in a small heart shaped frame
Everything is extremely neat and orderly
'   - Hal is walking back down the sidewalk past the old people
He stops, turns around and goes back to them
We see him stand and talk to them
: - Thelma and Louise are singing along with the
/ (pointing) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
- Hitchhiker standing on the side of the road
Thelma looks at Louise pleadingly
Louise's car pulls over and he hops in the back seat
An animated Thelma turns around backwards in the front seat to face him
/
- Hal walks into the coffee shop where Louise works of him talking to other employees
Albert, waitress, etc
Some cover their mouths as they recognize police sketches of Louise and Thelma
The Day Manager comes over, looks at the pictures and talks to Hal
Thelma passing out beef jerky and Wild Turkey to Hitchhiker and Louise
'  - Hal's unmarked detective car pulls up in front of Thelma's house
Corvette, completely customized with everything, sits in the driveway
Hitchhiker leans over resting his chin on the back of the front seat
So
, what are you studying in school
Human nature
'm majoring in behavioral science
And whaddya wanna be when ya grow up
waiter
Louise laughs
He has charmed her too
'  - Hal is walking up the sidewalk as the front door flies open to reveal a drunk Darryl in Hawaiian shorts, necklaces and a beer can in his hand
'  - Hal and Darryl in den
The   in the b
g
Pictures and papers are on the table
of Darryl's face
What
: '  -  - of Darryl's face
What
- (to Thelma) So how come you don't have any kids
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready
He's still too much of a kid himself
He prides himself on being infantile
He's got a lot to be proud of
Louise and Darryl don't get along
That's puttin' it mildly
She thinks he's a pig
He's a real piece o' work
wish you could meet him
Did you get married real young
Twenty-four isn't young
'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married
've never been with anybody but Darryl
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole
It's okay
He is an asshole
Most of the time  just let it slide
is looking down the road, way off in the distance
Better slow down
That's a cop
Louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car coming down the road towards them
She does not look alarmed but veers off the road into a "rest area" drive that has trees and shrubs that obscure the view from the road
She glides along as the cop car passes on the other side without seeing them
Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual has happened at all
They realize they have not been spotted
and Louise look at each other
Maybe you got a few too many parking tickets
We'll take you on to Oklahoma City, then you'd best be on your way
'  - Hal is on the phone to the  man
Darryl is sitting on a chair looking dazed
Other law enforcement types roam around the house
The prints on the trunk of the car match those of Thelma Dickinson
- , an   in his early forties, is looking at the ident-a-kit drawings of Louise and Thelma
Well 'll be damned
Isn't that strange
'  - And the husband says a gun is missing
She took a lot of stuff
It looks like she maybe planned on being gone a while
The strange thing is, her husband said she would never touch that gun
He got it for her 'cause he's out late a lot, but he said she'd never touch it, wouldn't learn to shoot it, just left it in a drawer for years
- What kind of gun was it
(
) 38
Right
Where are they
'  - We're lookin'
They were on their way to some guy's cabin and they never showed up
We're lookin'
We hope you're lookin' too
-  - The -Bird barrels down the road at high speed
'   - Louise, Thelma, and
pull into the motel parking lot
just gotta run in for a minute
Louise looks at
in the back seat and takes the keys out of the ignition
You two better go on and say your goodbyes
Louise gets out of the car and goes inside
- An older  behind the counter is looking at a computer screen
Louise Elizabeth Sawyer
Are you sure
Nothin'
Nothin' came in today at all
Louise turns and sees Thelma crawl over into the back seat with
Nothing under peaches
Check again under peaches
Naw, nothin' under peaches neither
comes up behind Louise and stands close behind her
() Did you say Peaches
Why that's the secret word
Show her what she's won, Don
He drops an envelope in front of her
Louise is startled and turns around quickly
Hey, peaches
Oh my God
Jimmy
You
Oh my God
What are you doin' here
(to Woman) Can we get another room
Just put it on my credit card
The Woman hands them a key
'Round to the back
- Louise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very close to
Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat to the other side of the car
She tries to look nonchalant
Jimmy
Hello, stranger
What in the world are you doin' here
Ask me no questions, 'll tell you no lies
Good answer
Same goes double for me
Who's your friend
is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable
This is
He's a student
We're just givin' him a ride to
to here
Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go
And that's what he's doin'
He's goin'
Aren't you,
Yup
Thanks for the ride
You all take care
He quickly turns and walks away toward the road
(watching him) Yup
That's him goin'
love to watch him go
(to Jimmy) Thelma kinda took to him
Jimmy is smiling
(to Thelma) Well, come on, gal,  got you a room
You can go on in and take a nice cold shower
Don't mind me, Jimmy, 'm just a wild woman
always knew that
regular outlaw
Louise shoots Thelma a look
The three of them drive around to the back of the motel
Thelma turns and looks at the road
is standing there
He blows her a kiss
- They stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them climb out of the car
Let me just go in and freshen up for a minute
need to wash my face, you know
Thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk
Okay, honey
don't want to rush you
just wanna talk to you and
(whispering) be alone with you
'll just be in my room, 115, you just come on down when you're ready
Jimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room
He stops at the door
'll be waiting
Louise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe he's acting this way
He turns on his heel and slinks away
don't care what you say about him
The boy has got it bad
He's always got it bad as long as 'm running in the other direction
Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy
He knows how to chase and that's it
Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do
So he runs away
heard that
- They close the door to their room
Louise sets the envelope of money on the table
(indicating envelope) Our future
Louise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup
She stands very close to the mirror
She is putting on lip liner
Thelma is watching
So what are you gonna tell him
Nothing
'm not gonna tell him a thing
The least  can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are
Imagine not wanting to drag him into this
He is a lucky man
Louise is still putting on her makeup, making sure it's perfect
didn't ask him to come
It's like said, Thelma, he just loves the chase
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he
Put a lid on it, Thelma
It's hard enough as it is
Just let me get this part over with
Now stay here and guard the money
If there's any problem 'm in room 115
won't wait up
Louise turns to face Thelma
How do  look
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are
Have another drink, Thelma
Louise walks out the door
Good idea
- It's raining out
Louise goes to Jimmy's room
Louise knocks on the door to room 115
The door opens slightly and one red rose pops out
Hello
(in a falsetto voice) Who is it
It's me
The following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with
'   - Thelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut-offs and a - shirt
Her hair is still damp but she looks better than she did when she arrived
Thelma is fixing a drink of Wild Turkey and Diet 7-Up in one of the motel room glasses
There is a on the door
She stops what she is doing and is completely still
Louise
Another
Louise, is that you
(
) (through the door) Thelma
It's me
Thelma opens the door and there stands
, soaking wet from the rain pouring down behind him
just thought
know 'm supposed to be gone, but
He's kind of looking over towards the road
He's still slightly shy
'm not havin' much luck gettin' a ride
He notices looking past her into the room that Louise isn't there
Thelma just stands there looking at him
Well,  guess 'd better
Wait
Um, where ya going
don't know
Nowhere
What are you doin'
don't know
Nothin'
Took a shower
That sounds nice
Well, you wanna use the shower
You can tell he does want to but doesn't want to say so
So instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin on his face
Oh
where's Louise
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend
That's lonely for you,  guess always think of motel rooms as lonely
Thelma pretends like she's had a lot of experience with this sort of thing
(letting him in the door) Oh, yes, well, they can be
'  - Jimmy is pouring champagne into Louise's glass
There are a dozen roses in a vase on the table
He pours for himself as he sits as close to Louise as possible
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here
Tell Daddy everything
(cringing) Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble
Louise just looks at him for a minute
Jimmy, 'm not gonna tell ya what the trouble is
Someday soon you'll understand why  can't
But  won't tell ya, so don't ask me
Jimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is
(almost at a loss for words) Okay, peaches, okay
But can  ask you one thing
Maybe
Does it have something to do with another guy
Are you in love with him
It's nothin' like that
(exploding) Then what
What, goddamnit, Louise
Where the fuck are you going
Are you just leaving for fucking ever
What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what
Louise spills her champagne
Stop it
Stop it, Jimmy, or 'll leave right now
'm not kiddin'
(calming down) Alright, alright
'm sorry
They both take a second to regain their composure
Can  just ask you one other thing
Maybe
Jimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket
Will you wear this
He hands Louise the box
She opens it and it is a diamond ring
Louise is flabbergasted
Will you at least see how it fits
Jimmy
it's beautiful
You didn't see that one comin', did ya
'   - is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still undone and no shirt
He has an incredible physique
He also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety
Thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from a vending machine and is into her second Wild Turkey and 7- Up
She sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror
He definitely looks better with his shirt off
She suddenly feels awkward and stands up
You wanna drink
'   - Louise has the engagement ring on her finger
It's really beautiful
So whaddya think
mean could
uh
get a job
Of some kind
mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right
Why now, Jimmy
(this is hard for him) 'Cause, Louise
don't want to lose you
And for some reason  get the feelin' you're about to split
Permanently
Louise doesn't know how to respond
She struggles for a reply
Jimmy, we've gone all these years
we never made it work
We're not gonna be able to just
'm not
What kind of job, honey
Can you see it
can't
Jimmy doesn't answer right away
He's trying to see it
'm the one
never made it work
just
It's not that  don't love you
It's not that
just never thought 'd be thirty-six years old and  never thought
don't know what  thought
What do you want, darlin'
What do you want me to do
don't know
It doesn't even matter anymore
just want you to be happy
It's not that  don't love you either
But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse
Jimmy does not really understand why this is happening
Are you just doin' this to punish me
Believe me, the last thing  want is for you to get punished
'   - Thelma has poured a drink for
who's sitting on the edge of the bed
She walks over and hands it to him and as she does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the other
He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds her hand with both of his
He closely studies her wedding ring
He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as intently
He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring as if to say, "This is not right for you
This isn't going to work
"  He looks at the ring as he moves it through space finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink
He drops it in
He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to say, "There
Now don't you feel better
"  He smartly kisses her hand
'  - Louise and Jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed
Jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking at it, as Jimmy holds her hand in his
They both ponder it
It does look good
'  - is standing on the dresser with a towel tied around his neck like a cape
Faster than a speeding green -Bird, able to leap tall babes in a single bound
He leaps from the dresser and flies across the room landing on the bed, straddling Thelma
(in his deep man's voice) Hi
Could  interest you in some Fuller brushes
Thelma has not stopped laughing since he came in the room
He is the greatest guy she's ever seen
He is sniffing her neck like a dog
(giggling) Stop, stop, stop
Thelma tries to catch her breath
Who are you
attacks her again
am the great and powerful Oz
Just tell me
know you're not some schoolboy
Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit
'm just some guy
guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now
Thelma gasps
What
Parole officer
You mean you're a criminal
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole,  haven't done one wrong thing
What did ya do
'm a robber
You're a bank robber
Nope
've never robbed a bank
What
Well,  robbed a gas station once, and  robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores
And that's it
How
Well,  was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin'  was good at so
(interrupting) No,  mean how would you do it
Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what
Naw, honey, that would be burglary
never got arrested for burglary
Burglary's for chicken shits
If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it
Just take the money
That's robbery
That's a whole 'nother deal
Tell me
Well, first you pick your place, see, then 'd just sit back and watch it for awhile
Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught
Then 'd waltz on in
jumps up and picks up a hair dryer and holds it like a gun
He starts acting it out
And 'd say, "Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's see who'll win the prize for keepin' their cool
Simon says everybody lie down on the floor
If nobody loses their head, then nobody loses their head
You sir
You do the honors
Just empty that cash into this bag and you'll have an amazing story to tell all your friends
If not, you'll have a tag on your toe
You decide
" Then 'd split
Simple
My gosh, you sure gentlemanly about it
've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience
God
You're a real live outlaw
may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart
And smooth, boy, you are smooth
They kiss passionately
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time
You're a little angle, you are
turns out the light
'  - Louise and Jimmy are wrapped in each other's arms, quietly making love
Through this, Jimmy is ardent
Louise
think you are so damn beautiful
mean that
always have
She smiles
Completely
(whispering) think you're beautiful too
- of early morning staff, a truck driver climbing into his cab with a silver thermos, squirrels hopping around on the ground
- of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee pot
Louise and Jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the same side
They are both playing with their wedding rings
Don't worry darlin'
'll say never found you
'll say anything you want
We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff
'm choking on it
They sit for a minute
Honey
Ummm
Do you want me to come with you
They look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see that Louise is already gone
Louise is really touched that he asked her that but she knows it's impossible
She is very kind to him
Oh
now
it's probably not such a good idea right now
'll
catch up with you later, on down the road
In her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box
She puts it on the table and slides it back to him
He stops her, suddenly
He covers her hand with his
You keep this
Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still
taxi pulls up outside
Your taxi's here
Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that employees in the coffee shop look away
cook fans himself with a spatula
The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at his watch
Are you happy, Louise
just want you to be happy
Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand
'm happy, sweetie
Happy as  can be
Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop
Louise watches him go
comes over and fills her coffee cup
Good thing he left when he did
We thought we were gonna have to put out a fire
The Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too
Louise waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab
The cab driver winks at her
She smiles to herself
'   - The room is totally trashed
and Thelma are both asleep, naked and hanging off either side of the bed
starts to stir
'  - Hal is in bed with is
He has to get up
He is holding his wife in his arms
Honey
Yes, baby
Do you think you could ever shoot someone
What
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone
could shoot your cousin Eddie
Why
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole
'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger
don't know, honey
guess it would depend
On what
(trying to picture it) Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids
'm sure  could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children
Yeah,  could too
But
don't know why 'm even asking you this
It's just
we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie don't know
keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable
If just one person would say
Honey
Nothing's impossible
You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason
Maybe he was askin' for it
Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan
That's what everybody says
Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night
Could you shoot Eddie in the face
At point blank range
(thinking) In the leg
(getting up) gotta go to Little Rock
- Louise is sitting in the booth by herself
Thelma comes hurrying by
She looks disheveled but is grinning like an idiot
She sees Louise and charges into the coffee shop
Her energy and volume is several notches higher than the rest of the people in the coffee shop
There are a couple more customers in there now
Thelma slides into the booth seated directly across from Louise
Hi
She is shocked by Thelma's appearance
What happened to your hair
Nothing
It got messed up
Louise is studying Thelma closely as Thelma squirms in her seat, barely able to contain herself
What's wrong with you
Nothing
Why
Do  seem different
Yes, now that you mention it
You seem crazy
Like you're on drugs
Well, 'm not on drugs
But  might be crazy
(shaking her head) don't think  wanna hear what you're gonna tell me
Thelma is just about to shriek when the Waitress comes over and puts a coffee cup on the table and pours some
Thelma gets a grip on herself for a moment then loses it as the Waitress goes away
Oh my God, Louise
can't believe it
just really can't believe it
mean
whoa
Thelma is just laughing hysterically
Louise suddenly understands
Oh, Thelma
Oh, no
mean  finally understand what all the fuss is about
This is just a whole 'nother ball game
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself
You're making a spectacle
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend
You could at least be a little bit happy for me
You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life  have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting
'm sorry
am happy
'm very happy for you
'm glad you had a good time
It's about time
Where is he now
Taking a shower
You left that guy alone in the room
Louise is getting a bad feeling
She is already standing up putting money on the table
Where's the money, Thelma
Thelma has forgotten all about the money
Ummm
it's on the table
It's okay
They are both leaving the restaurant now
As they hit the door they both break into a full run
don't remember
- They run across the parking lot around the back to the room
The door is ajar and no one is in the room
Louise goes in and Thelma stays outside the door
Goddamnit
've never been lucky
Not one time
Louise comes back outside
She doesn't say anything
She is stoic, fighting tears
Shit
That little sonofabitch burgled me
don't believe it
Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room
Thelma comes and sits beside her
Neither one says anything for a moment
Louise
Are you okay
Louise shakes her head no
Louise
It's okay
Louise
'm sorry
mean it
Louise has seen the end of the tunnel and there is no light
It's not okay, Thelma
It's definitely not okay
None of this is okay
What are we going to do for money
What are we gonna buy gas with
Our good looks
mean
Goddamn, Thelma
Louise quietly starts to fall apart
This causes Thelma to leap into action
Come on
Stand up
Don't you worry about it
'll take care of it
Just don't you worry about it
Get your stuff
Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk
Come on
Damnit, get your stuff and let's get out of here
Louise slowly gets to her feet
Move
(to herself) Jesus Christ, take your damn time
Thelma is hauling stuff out of the car
- of rear wheel of green -Bird   out of the motel parking lot
Thelma and Louise, both looking a little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away
'  - Hal,  Man, various other police and detective types, pull up in front of the house
The front door swings open and there stands Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a cannon
- Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store
'  - Police are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc
, while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull expression on his face
(to Darryl) As you know, we've tapped your phone
In the event that she calls in
Max comes up and joins them as they walk down the hallway
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in
Someone will be here until we find them
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything
We want to try and find out where they are
Now  don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife
Are you close with her
Yeah,  guess
mean, 'm about as close as  can be with a nut case like that
Well, if she calls, just be gentle
Like you're happy to hear from her
You know, like you really miss her
Women love that shit
- Thelma and Louise are sitting in the car
They've put all their money together
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl
(getting out of the car) Don't worry about it
You want anything
No
Thelma marches off to the store
Louise puts a tape in the deck and is listening to loud &
She checks herself in the rearview mirror
She takes her lipstick out and is about to put it on
She makes eye contact with herself and, instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans her head back on the seat
She's in a world of shit
Thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the car
(breathless) Drive
Louise looks at her
Drive
Drive away
(driving away) What happened
Thelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills
What
You robbed the store
You robbed the Goddamn store
Thelma shrieks with excitement
Louise is completely stunned
Well
We needed the money
It's not like  killed anybody, for God's sake
Louise shoots her a look
She puts the car in gear and it out of the parking lot
She is still looking at Thelma as if she has completely lost her mind
'm sorry
Well, we need the money
Now we have it
Oh shit, Thelma
Shit
Shit
Shit
(sternly) Now you get a grip, Louise
Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya
Okay
Shit, Thelma
What'd you do
mean, what did you say
Well,  just
-   - Hal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as plays back   of Thelma in the convenience store pulling a gun
In perfect lip sync is: (
) Alright, ladies and gentleman, let's see who'll win the prize for keepin' their cool
Everybody lie down on the floor
If nobody loses their head, then nobody loses their head
of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a state of shock
of Hal, Max, etc
, all looking intently at the screen
of Thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her purse with money
As he's loading the purse with bills, she's taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in there, too, while she points the gun at the cashier
(
) (videotape playback) You, sir
You do the honors
Just empty that cash into this bag and you'll have an amazing story to tell all your friends
If not, you'll have a tag on your toe
You decide
: - Thelma and Louise in car, driving
(incredulous) Holy shit
: -   - : Jesus Christ
: Good God
: (wearily) My Lord
- Holy shit
Lemme see the map
Louise throws the map across the front seat at Thelma and it
: '   - Jimmy is entering the apartment building, carrying his overnight bag
Two men are sitting on the stairs
They stand as he comes in
They are plainclothes police
They show their badges
He leaves with them
-   -
'  - made only more prominent by the bulging wallet in his back right pocket
is walking down the road and continues to walk as an Oklahoma State Patrol car pulls up alongside him
He smiles and gives a friendly wave as they cruise along slowly beside him
We can see the cop nearest him talking, and then we see
stop walking and set down his duffel bag
He reaches for his wallet
It's clear that they have asked for some - Louise is driving
They fly past a kid on his bike on a long gravel driveway
He watches them
huge cloud of dust blows up as they pass him
He turns and rides his bike down the driveway towards the house
- Louise, you'd better slow down
'll just die if we get caught over a speeding ticket
Louise looks at the speedometer touching 80 mph and lets her foot off the gas
Louise is looking a little nervous
For the first time in my life, wish this car wasn't green
Are you sure we should be driving like this
In broad daylight and everything
No we shouldn't, but  want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime
Oooooweee
You shoulda seen me
Like 'd been doin' it all my life
Nobody would ever believe it
You think you've found your calling
Maybe
Maybe
The call of the wild
Thelma howls like a dog and drinks a little bottle of Wild Turkey
You're disturbed
Yes
believe  am
-   - Jimmy is in a small room with Hal, Max, other cops, looking stunned
swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing
Christ
You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em
Tell us about him
Just some young guy
Around twenty years old
Dark hair
Jimmy is really upset and has to really struggle to control himself
(trying to remember him) They said they'd picked him up along the way
He was a student
But he didn't look right
But he left when they got to the motel
Do you understand that you may be facing an accessory charge
This is serious, son
man is dead
know
'd tell you if  knew
Goddamn
know something happened, or she wouldn't have left
'm trying to remember everything
Find that fucking kid
He probably knows something
- Thelma and Louise are in the car
Thelma is taking empty little Wild Turkey bottles out of her purse and throwing them out the window
So what's the plan, Thelma
You just gonna stay drunk
Try to
Litterbug
They come  up on a semi-tanker carrying gas
We see their -  in the shiny tanker
The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that Thelma and Louise saw earlier
The truck is going slower than they are
Aw, great
This always happens
Whenever you're in a hurry
She noses out to see if she can pass, but there's a car coming
The car passes and the truck
The truck driver's arm comes out his window and waves them past
Isn't that nice
Truck drivers are always so nice
The best drivers on the road
As they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling and waving at them
They smile and wave back
He flicks his tongue at them
Louise screams
/ Ugh
Gross
Oh my God
Aw, God
Louise  it and speeds past him
Ugh
Why do they have to do that
They think we like it
Maybe they think it turns us on
Louise shivers with disgust
-   - Jimmy is looking at police mug shots of a lot of young guys
Hal shows Jimmy a mug shot of
Is this the guy you saw them with
(looking closely) It's him
(clapping his hands) Oh, happy day
You gotta be kiddin' me
They picked up a murderer
Armed robber
Oh, great
(to Hal) They're flying him here right now
He was picked up this morning for parole violation
They also found about six grand on him, so he probably knocked over something while he was out there
They can drop him by here for questioning
'm so happy
(overhearing) How much cash did he have
- arriving, handcuffed, at State Police building
- The -Bird is entering terrain that looks more like desert
The top of the -Bird is up
- Thelma
Yeah
want you to call Darryl
What for
To find out if he knows anything
If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone
You think so
(agitated) Oh, come on
Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma
Murder one
God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense
But it wasn't
We got away
We were walkin' away
They don't know that
It was just you and me there
'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him
mean, it's almost the truth
It won't work
Why not
No physical evidence
We can't prove he did it
We probably can't even prove he touched you by now
They both pause for a moment
God
The law is some tricky shit, isn't it
Then: How do you know 'bout all this stuff anyway
Louise does not answer the question
Besides, what do we say about the robbery
No excuse for that
No such thing as justifiable robbery
Alright, Louise
-   - As the sun sets, the -Bird drives deeper into the vast desert
- Darryl is sitting in the hallway
Two officers are leading down the hall
Hal, Max, other plainclothes officers follow
Darryl looks at Hal questioningly
Hal doesn't respond and the entourage quickly goes into a room
Darryl stands and crosses the hall to the room as the door shuts in his face
(yelling at the door) Hey
Hey
-   - Who's the nut
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband
Aw, God
-  - Darryl tries the doorknob, but the door is locked
-   - Hal, Max,
, other officers
There is a  and monitor set up in the room and they view the videotape of Thelma in the convenience store
(pleased) Alright
She did good
Didn't she
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now
Where did you get $6600
00 in cash
friend
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer
Do you know her too
Umm, yes
She was driving
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City
He also says that at that time he met a man
He identified you through a series of mug shots
He also told us that you and Mrs
Dickinson seemed "close
" Is that true
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes
Did you know that Mrs
Dickinson and Miss Sawyer are wanted in connection with a murder
What
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law
(surprised to hear this) Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy
You know what
You're starting to irritate me
Yeah
Me too
Hal thinks for a moment and then looks to Max
Do you mind if  have a word with him alone for a minute
Max agrees and opens the door for the others to leave
He and Hal make eye contact before Max closes the door
What
What'd  do
Hal sits down across the table from
and looks at him
Son,  gotta feelin' about somethin' and  just wanna ask your opinion
Do you think Thelma Dickinson would have committed armed robbery if you hadn't taken all their money
doesn't say anything
They both just sit there for a moment
Cat got your tongue
shifts in his chair
How do you know  took it
How do you know they didn't just give it to me
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance
And you blew it for 'em
Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, 'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them
've got no feelin' for you
But  may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance  can actually do them some good, or 'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life
Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life
That's a sincere promise
Hal walks over and opens the door and Max and the others straggle back in
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out
And you know Judge Hainey
He hates this sort of thing
Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high
And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well,  think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you
Oh, definitely
(convinced) Okay
Is somebody gonna write this down
- Darryl is sitting in the hallway
Hal comes out of the room first
Mr
Dickinson, if you'll just hang on,  want a word with you and then we'll take you home
Police officers lead
out of the interrogation room, down the hallway
Darryl is watching
closely
is smirking at him
(slyly, to Darryl) like your wife
(going after him) Come back here, you little shit
Hal and another police officer are restraining Darryl
is led off down the hall
- Louise and Thelma pull into a gas station
- gas station attendant approaches as Louise and Thelma are getting out of the car
(to attendant) Fill her up
(to Thelma) There's a phone right over there
Let's get it over with
Thelma and Louise walk to the phone
'm not kidding, Thelma
If you think he knows, even if you're not sure, hang up
'  - The  is  and the place is a mess
Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action as the phone , putting on headsets, turning on tape recorders
Darryl picks up the phone
Hello
- Darryl
It's me
'  - Hal, Max, etc
, all are gesticulating wildly
(real friendly) Thelma
Hello
Thelma hangs up the phone
(matter-of-factly) He knows
'  - Everyone is very disappointed, taking off their headsets, turning off tape recorders and looking at Darryl like he's an idiot
Shit
Darryl still holds the phone in his hand
What
All  said was hello
- Thelma and Louise are staring at each other intently
Louise steps up to the phone
You got any change
Thelma digs in her bag and hands Louise a roll of quarters
Louise gets out of the car and goes to the pay phone
Thelma follows her
She puts the money in and dials
It
Darryl, this is Louise
Are the police there
'  - Again everybody springs into action
Darryl is fumbling with the phone
Uh, no
No, why would any police be here
Hey, where are you girls, anyway
Darryl gives Hal and Max a look as if he's got it completely under control
Clever guy
- Let me talk to whoever's in charge there
'  - What are you talking about, Louise
Hal comes over and takes the phone away from Darryl
Hal looks at Max who nods, "take it
" Hello, Miss Sawyer
'm Hal Slocumbe, Chief Investigator, Homicide, Arkansas State Police
How are you
- (chuckling) 've been better
(
) You girls are in some hot water
Yes, sir
know
'  - You're both okay
Neither one of you hurt
You're bein' careful with that gun
- We're both fine
(
) Good
You wanna tell me what happened
Sure
Maybe over coffee sometime
'll buy
'  - just want you to know, neither one of you are charged with murder yet
You're still just wanted for questioning
Although, now, Mrs
Dickinson's wanted in Oklahoma for armed robbery
- No kiddin'
Listen, we gotta go
'll call you back, all right
Louise looks at her watch
(
) Miss Sawyer,  don't think y'all are gonna make it to Mexico
We should talk
Please
wanna to help you
On hearing this Louise mouths the word "shit" in a very frustrated way
Louise hangs up the phone
'  - All are busy trying to see if the call was traced
Darryl is back in his recliner still in shock
- She is stomping back to the car
Thelma follows doggedly
moving van pulls in and parks in the b
g
That
kid is a little shit
What
Louise stops as she is about to get in and faces Thelma who's standing on the other side of the car
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'
Louise yanks open her car door, gets in and slams the door and fires up the
Thelma hops in quickly
just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up
asked him not to tell
didn't think he would tell anybody
Why not
What's he got to lose
Other than my life's savings, that is
Shit
Louise careens back onto the road
'm sorry
mean
Louise slams on the brakes
Goddamnit, Thelma
Let me explain something to you
Right now we have only two things goin' for us
One, nobody knows where we are, and two, nobody knows where we're going
Now, one of our things that was going for us is gone
Louise stops yelling for a moment groping for self-control
Thelma looks pitiful
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma
Stop bein' so open
We're fugitives now
Let's behave that way
You're right
-  ( ) The -Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route 66
(
) Louise
Where are we
(
) Just past Boise City
(
) Idaho
(
) Oklahoma, Thelma
We're crossing into New Mexico
(
) always wanted to see New Mexico
'  -    - - The car goes streaking by
'  -  ( ) All's quiet
The large screen  is  and the room is filled with dense smoke
Hal, Max, sit at a table going over paperwork
Other plainclothes and surveillance guys play cards
Darryl sits crumpled in his recliner staring blankly at the
'  - Jimmy sits on his couch with his guitar while two plainclothes cops sit reading the paper, doing the crossword puzzle
- Over music from tape: Thelma is sipping on a little Wild Turkey
Now what
Now what what
Whaddo we do
Oh,  don't know, Thelma
guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays
Maybe we could have children with the prison guards
'm not suggestin' that
'm not goin' back
No matter what happens
So don't worry about me
Louise speeds up
Thelma hands Louise a little bottle of Wild Turkey and she drinks it down
Thelma has one too
Can  ask you kind of a weird question
Yeah
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most
You mean now or before
Before
guess  always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs
What little dogs
You know those little dogs you see people with
Like a Chihuahua
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones
Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth
Oh yeah
You mean Peek-a-poos
Yeah
Those
That always put the fear of God in me
What about you
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me
can see that
mean, look how different he looks just since high school
It's bad enough  have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse
(quieter) mean,  don't think he's gonna be very nice about it
Well, now, maybe you won't have to
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya
-  ( ) They are driving through Monument Valley
The -Bird speeds through the beautifully moonlit desert
It is almost like daylight
of silhouettes of cacti, huge rock formations, desert beauty , etc
-    - The sky is bright and expansive and the road goes on forever
This is so beautiful
Gosh
It sure is
always wanted to travel
just never got the opportunity
Well, you got it now
They both look forward for another moment
And then, at the same time, they look at each other, each taking the other one in completely, in this moment
They're saying everything to each other in this moment, but their expressions don't change and they don't say a word
plays on the
- semi-gas tanker is up ahead on the road
It looks like the one they saw earlier
It's got the same mud flaps
- Look
Look who it is, Thelma
'll be darned
What's he doin' way out here
Just ignore him
Louise passes him and, as she does, he
They look up and he is wildly pointing to his lap
Oh, Christ
hate this guy
We should have just ignored him
-  ( ) The car is flying down the road
-   - They are quiet for a moment, then Thelma starts quietly laughing to herself
She is trying to stop but cannot
What
(shaking with laughter) Nothing
It's not funny
What
What's not funny, Thelma
Thelma is trying to compose herself but cannot
Okay, but
(she can barely speak) can't say
Thelma isn't making a sound
She is stuck in a convulsion of laughter
What
(gasping for air) Harlan
What
What about him
Just the look on his face when you
(she is falling apart again) it's not funny
(shocked) Now, Thelma, that is not
Thelma is still trying to get a grip on herself
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that
(scolding) Thelma
(impersonating Harlan) Suck my dick
Boom
Thelma is laughing wildly
(quietly) Thelma
It's not funny
Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying
(trying to catch her breath) know
They both get quiet
Thelma leans back just watching Louise
She studies her as if she's never really seen her before
All of a sudden a look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face
She jerks upright and startles Louise
(carefully) It happened to you
didn't it
Louise knows what she is talking about
She becomes immediately agitated
don't want to talk about it
Thelma, 'm not kidding
Don't you even
in Texas
didn't it
That's what happened
Oh my God
Louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee
(fighting hysteria) 'm warning you, Thelma
You better drop it right now
don't want to talk about it
(gently) Okay, Louise
It's okay
Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems completely serene
- The car is  down the road
They drive through a little stand of buildings
-    - car speeds up to try and catch them
The red and blue lights pop on
It is a New Mexico State Patrol car
- Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror
' at 100 mph
Thelma is asleep
Shit
Thelma, wake up
Shit
We're gettin' pulled over
Thelma jumps awake
What
What
Oh shit
Oh no
They are trying not to panic
They are slowing down, but still doing 70 mph
The patrol car is right behind them
What do we do
What do you want to do
don't know
Shit
Let's just play it by ear
He may not know
He may just give me a ticket
Please, God, please don't let us get caught
Please, please, please
Louise pulls the car off the road
The patrol car pulls up right behind them
The lights shine brightly in through the windows
- (
) Turn off your engine
Louise does
The  gets out of his car and approaches their car
He comes to the driver's side window
It is rolled up
'    smiling up at him
He gestures to her to roll her window down
She does
Hello, Officer
Is there a problem
You wanna let me see your license, please
Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and shows her license
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please
Oh yeah
She does and hands it to him
told you to slow down
Hell, Officer,  told her to slow down
About how fast was  going
About a hundred and ten
You wanna step out of the car, please
They walk to the back of the car
He notes the license plate number
Is this your car
Yes
You wanna come with me, please
Walk around and get in the car, please
In the back
Front
Am  in trouble
As far as 'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are
Patrolman gets in the driver's side
He picks up a clipboard and clips Louise's driver's license to it
He picks up the hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun comes in his car window
It's Thelma and she puts the gun to his head
Officer,  am so sorry about this
Could you let go of that
He drops it
really, really apologize, but please put your hands on the steering wheel
See, if you get on that radio, you're gonna find out that we're wanted in two states and probably considered armed and dangerous, at least  am, then our whole plan would be shot to hell
Louise, take his gun
Louise reaches over and takes his gun
(apologetic) am really sorry about this
swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this
But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why just can
You wanna step out of the car, please
(she opens the door for him) You wanna put your hands on your head, please
Louise, shoot the radio
What
Shoot the radio
Louise  the car radio
The cop flinches with each shot
The police radio, Louise
Jesus
Louise fires   into the police radio
It  all to hell
You wanna step to the back of the car, please
Louise, bring the keys
Louise reaches over and takes the keys
She takes her license off the clipboard
She gets out and trots around to the back of the car
Thelma is holding the gun on the Patrolman
Suddenly Thelma the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover
(to Louise) Open the trunk
Louise opens the trunk
(to Patrolman) You wanna step into the trunk, please
Ma'am, please
got kids
a wife
You do
Well, you're lucky
You be sweet to 'em
Especially your wife
My husband wasn't sweet to me and look how  turned out
Now go on, get in there
As he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise: Air holes
He's all the way in and Louise closes the trunk
- Thelma opens the glove compartment
She takes a box of spare ammo and closes it
Thelma takes the keys and gets out of the car
She walks around to the trunk
- (to trunk) Sorry
(from her car) Sorry
Thelma hops into the car with Louise
They look at each other
Ready
Hit it
Louise pulls the car back onto the road and they drive away
- (shaking her head) know it's crazy, Louise, but just feel like 've got a knack for this shit
believe you
-    - They are in really beautiful country now
(
) Drive like hell
'  - Hal and Max are alone in the kitchen
Hal switches on the Mr
Coffee
It's just not working like this
We gotta do something
It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad
don't know
maybe they're not movin'
Maybe that little creep lied
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'
Nothin' at all
He already got all their money
just don't know what we're dealin' with here
Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype
Let's just wait it out a little longer
She said she was gonna call back
Let's just sit tight
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we
can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky
It don't matter
Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out
cop walks into the kitchen and hands Hal a file that says Louise Elizabeth Sawyer on the outside
He opens it up and starts looking through a personal history
One piece of paper is a case file from Texas containing an incident report of a rape
Stamped across it are the words "charges dropped
" - Louise
are we still going to Mexico
Yes
Thelma pauses while she searches for the logic
Then aren't we going in the wrong direction
Well,  figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can
Just asking
They are both quiet for a second
Louise goes a little faster
Thelma is digging through her bag
She hands Louise a piece of beef jerky
don't want to see any more beef jerky
mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window
It's drivin' me crazy
The whole car smells like it
It's good
It's what the pioneers ate
don't care what the damn pioneers ate
You just keep that shit away from me, now  mean it
Thelma puts down her bag
And  don't want any more Wild Turkey, either
It's burning a hole in my stomach
Okay, okay
've got some tequila
You want some tequila
You do
Yeah, you want it
Yeah
Thelma starts to dig through her bag again
It's in here somewhere
Louise is rubbing her face
She looks pretty bad
Her hands are shaking
Shit
'm gettin' tired
Are you alright
Louise does not really seem alright
think 've really fucked up think 've got us in a situation where we could both get killed
Why didn't we just go straight to the police
You know why
You already said
What'd  say again
Nobody would believe us
We'd still get in trouble
We'd still have our lives ruined
And you know what else
What
That guy was hurtin' me
And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse
And probably nothin' woulda happened to him
'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night
And they woulda made out like  asked for it
And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now
At least now 'm havin' fun
And 'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead
'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me
And if  haven't, wanna take this time to thank you, Louise
Thank you for savin' my ass
said all that
No, Louise, you said the first part
said all the rest
(tired) Whatever
- Louise is at a pay phone as the sky is just starting to get light
Thelma is in the bathroom nearby
Louise has already dialed and the phone is
'  - The   on in the b
g
as the phone  there, everyone leaps into action again
Max picks up the phone
Hello
(
) Let me speak to
Slocumbe
(to Hal) She wants to talk to you
Hello, Louise
- Hey
(
) How are things goin' out there
Weird
Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'
(
) You're still with us though
You're somewhere on the face of the earth
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here
'  - Hal smiles
swear
Louise,  almost feel like know you
(
) Well
You don't
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone
(
) Would you believe me if  told you this whole thing is an accident
do believe you
That's what want everybody to believe
Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it
need you to help me here
- Louise does not answer
(
) Did Harlan Puckett
Through clenched teeth, repulsed: (interrupting) No
(
) You want to come on in
Louise thinks for a minute
don't think so
'  - Then 'm sorry
We're gonna have to charge you with murder
Now, do you want to come out of this alive
The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going
Darryl comes in and immediately realizes Hal is talking to Louise
Darryl looks attentively at Hal
- You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing
So, come out alive
don't know
Let us think about that
(
) Louise, 'll do anything
know what's makin' you run
know what happened to you in Texas
Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this
reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up the phone
She has her finger on the lever
Come on, Louise
Don't blow it
Let's go
She walks away towards the car
Louise is still standing there holding the phone
Thelma stops and looks at her
Come on
Louise doesn't move
'  - Frustrated, Hal slams down the phone
He looks over at the surveillance man who nods to say "we got it
"  The whole room reacts excitedly
Everyone in the room springs into action
Max immediately picks up the phone and Hal watches him intently
He mouths the words to Max -- " wanna go" emphatically
Max slightly shakes his head, still of the phone
Hal goes charging over to Max
Max
You gotta take me there
'm
'm the only one she's ever talked to
don't want anybody losin' their heads
You know what happens
The volume gets turned way up and the next thing you know those girls are gonna get shot
Max, still holding the phone, is surprised by this outburst
(calmly) Okay, Hal, okay
- Louise is still standing there
Louise
Yes, Thelma
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya
What do you mean
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you
mean,  just wanna know
No, Thelma
'm not gonna make any deals
can understand if you're thinkin' about it
mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for mean Jimmy and everything
Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma
Thelma, that is not an option
But  don't know
something's crossed over in me and  can't go back
mean,  just couldn't live
know
know what you mean don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show
They are both quiet for a moment
He said they're charging us with murder
(making a face) Eeuww
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all
Louise  the car
They lurch into reverse then forward as they tear off down the road
as they fly down the road
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car
Sure
You know how to hotwire a car
No
Well, let me know when you figure it out
- car pulls up on an airstrip and stops next to a small jet
Hal and Max get out of the car and board the plane
- of driving shots as Louise and Thelma drive through the intense beauty of the Arizona desert
- You awake
You could call it that
My eyes are open
Me too
feel awake
Good
Wide awake
don't remember ever feelin' this awake
Everything looks different
You know what  mean know you know what  mean
Everything looks new
Do you feel like that
Like you've got something to look forward to
Louise and Thelma both get quiet for a second
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita
We can change our names
We can live in a hacienda
wanna get a job
wanna work at Club Med
Yes
Yes
Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that
It'd have to be pretty good
It would have to be pretty damn good
They are both laughing
The car is still flying down the road
The sun is coming higher in the sky now
They come to an intersection in the middle of nowhere
Louise stops and looks at the map
We should head a little further in
There's not that many roads in this state
want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico
They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico
You're drivin'
Louise takes a right turn and speeds down the road
- Louise and Thelma are singing along to a wild &
They do the hand movements as if they are the Supremes
They come roaring up on the semi-tanker, the same one they have seen three times before
(screaming over music) Oh my God
Louise
Look
Look
See if that's him
It's him
He's got California plates
It's the same guy
Pass him
- Louise bears down really hard and passes him
Again as they get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them
He is leering at them and laughing
Louise and Thelma drive further down the road
Louise pulls the car off to the side of the road
As the truck gets close they start waving to him to stop
He pulls his truck off the side of the road and stops
Louise and Thelma smiling up at him
He chuckles to himself
He leans out the window
Hi
Hi there
You alright
We're fine
How are you
Grrrreat
Follow us
They turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop
- The Trucker reaches over and opens a glove compartment crammed full of condoms
He grabs a few and shoves them in his pocket
He turns off his engine and gets out of the truck
- He walks up to the car
Louise and Thelma get out of the car
Where you goin'
Fresno
We been seein' you all along the way
Yeah
been seein' you, too
We think you have really bad manners
Louise nods
We were just wonderin' where you think you get off behavin' like that to women you don't even know
This is not what is supposed to be happening
What
What are you talkin' about
You know good and damn well what 'm talkin' about
mean really
That business with your tongue
What is that
That's disgusting
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap
What's that supposed to mean exactly
Does that mean pull over,  want to show you what a big fat slob  am or
Does that mean suck my dick
You women are crazy
You got that right
We think you should apologize
He is getting a little panicky
'm not apologizing for shit
Say you're sorry
Fuck that
Louise pulls the gun they stole from the State Patrolman
Say you're sorry or we'll make you fuckin' sorry
He looks at the gun
Oh, Jesus
You probably even called us beavers on your  radio, didn't you
Yeah
sure did
Damn
hate that
hate bein' called a beaver, don't you
Are you going to apologize or not
Fuck you
Louise looks at his truck off in the distance
She points the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then  two of the tires flat
The truck slowly sinks as the air escapes from the tires
Oh goddamn
You bitch
Louise and Thelma look at each other
They both turn towards the truck and  rounds into the tankers until they in a huge ball of fire
The truck driver screams at the top of his lungs
Louise starts the car and starts driving in circles around the truck driver
Thelma and Louise are both howling at the top of their lungs
Thelma is sitting on the back of the front seat with her legs on the dashboard
You fucking bitch
Aaaaaaarrrgghh
You're gonna have to pay for that
'm gonna make you pay for that
You hear me
Louise stops the car right next to him
Shut up
Louise takes off again and Thelma falls into the back seat
They drive off trailing a huge cloud of dust
- Louise drives through the desert back towards the road, past the burning debris of the truck
As she gets to the road she stops
Thelma climbs into the front seat
- Hey
Where'd you learn to shoot like that
Texas
You were right about what happened to me there
They pull away from the burning wreckage
- As Thelma and Louise talk, their voices are heard over the following scene
(
) You know what's happened, don't you
(
) What
(
) (smiling) We've gone insane
(
) Yup
- battered old pickup truck is parked by the New Mexico State Patrol
An old man uses a crowbar to pry open the trunk
The New Mexico State Patrolman hops out of the trunk
-   - Police Bulletin       following scenes: police helicopter flies over the burning wreckage of the fuel truck
The truck driver is waving his arms as the helicopter descends, blowing dirt all over him
'  - Darryl sits practically comatose in a big chair
His eyes have a dull glaze as he stares first at one wall, then another
- of a  being shoved into the cassette deck
- Max and Hal sit next to each other in the jet
Hal tries to appear as if he's used to all this
Max holds a cellular phone to his ear
of Max as we hear through the phone: Police   becomes part of scene
(
) (on phone) Abducted
shot up the car
stole the officer's weapon
tanker
blown up
terrorized
Max's face becomes troubled and more serious than we've seen so far
He looks at Hal as he hangs up the phone
You're not even going to believe this
- The jet banks off to the left
- of car speeding through the desert on an empty highway west
-- Thelma has her face to the sun with her eyes closed
Louise is driving with a fierce intensity
They hardly resemble the two women that started out for a weekend in the mountains two days earlier
Although their faces are tanned and lined and their hair is blowing wildly there is a sense of serenity that pervades
- Hal and Max are climbing out of the jet and running across the tarmac to a waiting helicopter
Max is carrying a walkie- talkie now
- Thelma sits up suddenly
An Arizona police car passes them going eastbound
Oh shit
Louise
Do you think he saw us
don't know, but let's get off
'  - The police car cuts across the median to begin pursuit of the girls
The lights are flashing
- Is your seat belt on
Thelma puts her seat belt on
Louise floors the car and it streaks off, putting some distance between them and the police car
Thelma looks back at the police car
She looks scared
guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught
Yeah, right
We're not gonna get caught
- is on his radio
#1 requesting assistance
In pursuit of a green -Bird, 1966 license, seven, one, nine, William, Zebra, Adam
(
) Roger
Be advised
(breaks up) armed and extremely dangerous
- steady stream of state police cars pulls out of the parking lot with lights flashing while other policemen are running to their cars still parked in the lot
- How far are we from Mexico
About two hundred and fifty miles
How long do you think that'll take
- There are now two police cars behind them about half a mile back
They are going really fast
police helicopter catches up to them and orders them to stop
Thelma stands and flips them off
We're going to Mexico
- (looking back) Uh oh
There's another one
Louise and Thelma both are looking back at the two police cars following them
They turn back around just in time to see a third Arizona State police car has pulled into the middle of an intersection of the only road that crosses it for miles
They both scream
Louise swerves just in time to keep from hitting it broadside
She goes off the road and has to struggle to pull her car back onto the road, leaving a huge cloud of dust
Shit
Did you see that guy
He was right in the middle of the road
- The first two police cars are approaching the same intersection
They are driving side by side
There is still a huge cloud of dust that now covers the third car in the middle of the intersection
#1 -  - huge cloud of dust blows across the road as he approaches the intersection
It clears to reveal the third police car in the middle of the road, just as he and police car #2 reach the intersection
#1 as he screams and swerves to the right
#3 - #3 right for him at 120 mph
He screams and ducks down into the seat
-   # swerves to the right
Police car #2 swerves to the left, both barely missing police car #3
as police car #1 and police car #2 both pull back onto the road right next to each other
#3 - Policeman #3 sits up in the seat
He can't believe he isn't dead
He puts his car in gear and takes off down the road after them
- (looking in rearview mirror) Shit
What
What
What d'you think
Oh
- Louise and Thelma blow through a stand of buildings left from when the train went through here
There are two parallel streets on either side of the one they're on and, as they pass by buildings, they can see police cars  down these parallel streets trying to "head them off at the pass
" Louise  it and her car screams ahead
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck
Why
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas
know this whole thing was my fault
know it is
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault
Louise
no matter what happens, 'm glad  came with you
You're crazy
- Louise swerves off the road and begins driving across the desert
All the police cars take off across the desert after them
They are now being pursued by at least fifteen cars
- You're a good friend
You too, sweetie, the best
guess  went a little crazy, huh
No
You've always been crazy
This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself
guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty
Unbearable, 'd imagine
guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway
How do you stay so positive
They smile
- It does look like an Army
More police cars have joined, and from every direction, police cars are swarming across the desert, although none are in front of them
Way off in the distance, a helicopter joins the chase
- Thelma is looking way up ahead in the distance
Louise
What
What in the hell is that up there
Where
Way up ahead
Louise strains to see
Whatever it is, Louise is barreling towards it, the car leaving the ground as they fly through the desert
Oh my God
Louise starts to laugh and cry at the same time
What in the hell is it
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon
- Behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police cars following them
In front of them, looking larger every moment, is the awesome splendor of the Grand Canyon
- Isn't it beautiful
It's grand
Louise has tears streaming down her face as she realizes there is absolutely no escape
She continues barreling towards it without slowing down
- All the police cars are still following about a half a mile behind
The car is bouncing and flying across the desert
Finally, they get about twenty yards from the edge and Louise on the brakes
Thelma and Louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up
The police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind them
The dust from the cars is blowing across them
They just sit looking at the Grand Canyon
From the canyon, the  helicopter rises up in front of the car
- Hal sees Thelma and Louise for the first time
They are sitting in the car, oblivious in a way, to all the activity around them
He only takes his eyes off of them long enough to look at Max
- God
It looks like the Army
All this for us
Thelma starts to laugh
Louise is only concerned with missing the cacti and other obstacles that lie before her
- The helicopter lands behind the row of police cars
' He sees Thelma and Louise facing each other
They look so nice
He can't stop looking
He borrows the binoculars from Max
He sees Thelma and Louise in the car
Some of the police sharpshooters are sporting semi-automatic rifles
Hal looks at Max
Hey
Don't let them shoot those girls
This is too much
They got guns pointed at 'em
The women are armed, Hal
This is standard
Now you stay calm here
These boys know what they're doin'
Max climbs out of the chopper
Hal sits for a moment and then leaps out and follows Max
(
) (over loudspeaker) This is the Arizona Highway Patrol
You are under arrest
You are considered armed and dangerous
Any failure to obey any command will be considered an act of aggression against us
- Now what
We're not giving up, Thelma
Then let's not get caught
What are you talkin' about
(indicating the Grand Canyon) Go
Go
Thelma is smiling at her
Go
They look at each other, look back at the wall of police cars, and then look back at each other
They smile
- being loaded into automatic rifle
- - by their cars, as they are loading weapons, talk quietly
#1 heard they shot a cop
#2 No shit
#1 With his own gun
Put him in the trunk and blew him away
- Louise and Thelma are looking at each other
(
) (over loudspeaker) Turn off the engine and place your hands in the air
- Hal is about to crawl out of his skin
He can't believe this thing is getting out of control
He jumps in front of Max
Max
Let me talk to 'em
can't believe this
You've gotta do something here
Max goes around Hal and continues walking
Hal jumps in front of Max again and blocks his way
'm sorry to bother you,  know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max
How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over
You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that
(grabbing Hal) Get a hold of yourself
You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on
Calm down
Don't make me sorry let you come
Max lets go of Hal's lapels
(under his breath) Shit
can't fucking believe this
Hal walks along with a look of total disbelief on his face
He's shaking his head
Slowly he breaks into a trot and starts heading toward the front line
(shouting) Hey
Hey
Hal is running now and clears the front row of cars
There is a lot of confusion among the officers on the front row
Some shout, some lower their guns to look
#1 What in the hell
#2 (lowering his rifle) The son of a bitch is in my way
- They are still looking at each other really hard
You're a good friend
You, too, sweetie, the best
:
King song entitled "Better Not Look Down" begins
It is very upbeat
Are you sure
Thelma nods
Hit it
Louise puts the car in gear and  it
: - Hal's eyes widen for a moment at what he sees, and then a sense of calm overtakes him and he mouths the word "alright
" (
) 've been around, 've seem some things, People movin' faster than the speed of sound, faster than a speedin' bullet
People livin' like Superman, all day and all night won't say if it's wrong or  won't say if it's right
'm pretty fast myself
But  do have some advice to pass along, right here in the words to this song
- The cops all lower their weapons as looks of shock and disbelief cover their faces
cloud of dust blows as the speeding car sails over the edge of the cliff
(
) Better not look down, if you wanna keep on flyin'
Put the hammer down, keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up cryin'
You can keep it movin' if you don't look down
