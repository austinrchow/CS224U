She looks gorgeous, then ordinary, sloppy, white waitress uniform, gorgeous again, dishes stacked in her arms, turning, looking, happy, tired
Hi, can  help you
What would you like
Want a menu
Hey Billy
Hey Tom
You take care, Rosie
We get a sense of her: 23, smart, good attitude, proud to be on her own and supporting herself even if the job is menial
She moves quickly, physically, with an almost athletic grace - Sure thing, Annie
Have a good one
That's two straight up
You're good to go
Morning
Hey there
Morning to you
(beat, embarrassed) What
(looks down, sees she's carrying lunch food) Right
Afternoon
sense of the diner too
50's-style joint: hip, lively; a fun pl ace full of wacko signs that tell us we're in some modestly sized So
Cal
beach community
What can  get you
Whattaya like
Whattaya want
(rolls eyes; good-humored rejection of a
come-on:) Nice try, bud - () Does that ever work
Hey, lemme get that for you
Hey
Common' right up
as we   : beans/eggs/pie/burger/shake /waffle/grilled cheese, fast flow of too much grub as words fly : " "
,  setting up for lunch, Slim joking with  (28, knocked around but still spirited; two kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good attitude)
Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not her life
Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly offended, working-class accent: Why not
My grandfather was a lawyer
Plus:  have a logical mind
And you're only like 299 thousand short of what you'd need for law school
: Piece of cake - Piece of pie - Piece of ass
So what would you do
don't know
- () 'm also thinking
well
could go back to school
In what
thought you hated - Psychology maybe,  don't know
know it's not cool to say so, but 'd like to contribute something to society, even if - (it's just) We contribute
We give 'em food, energy, so they can go out and save Western Civilization - bell rings, a  comes in, and the owner of the place, (45, Syrian, also the cook) sticks his head between them: Ladies, please
Am  paying you
Not that we noticed
( : 11:15) Oh my God, speaking
of time - The lunch rush is coming; they start working triple speed - "
"
Ginny and Slim converge carrying dirty dishes, piling them up for the ,  (21, Hispanic)
They haven't stopped moving for two hours, but now they can take a breath, survey the scene
Slim notices Ginny has a wet spot under her arm
Ever try the rock, hey
Excuse me
The deodorant thing
It's salts or something, it comes in like a
it looks like some kinda hippie crystal
You're saying  sweat
Perspire, Ginny
You lightly - () (a vow to get even) 'll remember that
(as someone comes in) Your turn, 'm sweatin' too much
Slim gives her a look, grabs a menu, goes over to where the new customer, whom we will call for the moment  , is seated
When she reaches his booth, she notices he's got a book and a long-stemmed red rose
She hands him a menu - Waiting for somebody
He shakes his head
She can't help noticing he's very handsome
(
Something to drink
Just water, thanks
'll give you a minute to look over - That's okay
was in yesterday
(reads her nametag) Slim
She nods, slightly uncomfortable
He hands her his menu
What's your real name
No
Hmm
like it, but don't you think it's kinds negative
No,  don't tell my name
Okay
Coke and a turkey burger, coleslaw no fries, couple extra slices tomato
write books
Oh
You read books
She kind of half-nods half-shrugs
(
) What're you reading now
She stares at him
Finneaan's Wake by James Joyce friend told me it's the hardest book in the English Language
Not the hardest hardest, just the hardest one it's actually possible to read, and  figure if  can get through that one,  can do the others
How long you been reading it
Six years
'll be back with your She leaves, goes back puts the order in, mutters to Ginny: {
} Asshole
What'd he say
Wanted to find out how smart  was so  told him  was reading the hardest book in the English language
He likes you
think he's just a dick
Slim
he was in yesterday - know - And he's back today with a rose, he pulls you into conversation
Honey, if you can't tell he likes you, you need to study psychology
Okay, so he likes me
Do you like him
don't know him
What's that got to do with it
Slim: he is a major piece of cake/piece of pie
didn't notice
Trust me
Carrot cake
And when a guy like that - cuter than you
- he actually likes you - He's cuter than me
tinny gives her a long stare; this is obviously a favorite : Hey
Wise up, huh
No-one is ever gonna go for you 'cause of your looks
( ) That is bad news, 'cause my personality bites
Ginny grins
Slim writes up a check for a  at the counter
When she finishes, the turkey burger is up
She carries it to the table: , coleslaw, and so forth
You don't really write books, do you
Nope
don't read Finnecan's Wake either
'm goin' into law
Enforcement
She nods
This is more like what she expected
Who's the rose for
He shrugs
She's busy, so she starts to go: Enjoy your grub, huh
She's seven feet away when she hears: - Sheturns back toward him - He smiles, offers the rose: You
She smiles back-their eyes meet
a sudden utterly magical moment
This is also the moment to
note   should be played by a famous actor doing a cameo
Because at this instant the scene changes
The man () in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns and looks at Slim
Stands
Looks down at Our Hero
How much did you settle on
Excuse
me
Slim frowns, steps closer so she can overhear: The bet
How much is it
Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face - (
) You and your friend
Yesterday
Was it 200 or 500 or -
( ) What're you - He bet his friend he could get in your pants in less than twelve hours, starting noon today
Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger - Is this your business
(right in Mitch's face) What are you, the morals police
He pushes again and Mitch,s hand shoots out like a snake striking
Grabs him by the collar
Lifts him
frozen moment, more violence just a breath away, and a sense of things about to spin out of control
Our Hero's eyes are popping; he tries to hide his fear: Take it easy,
man
She and were just having some fun - (to our Hero) Was it two hundred or five
( ) want to know what 'm worth
Our Hero gestures to Mitch: would you mind putting me down
Mitch reluctantly obliges
Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity
Looks at Slim
Drops a ten on the table and smirks: The bet was two, but now that know you
Way too high
pained look flashes across Slim's face - Our Hero starts toward the door, but Mitch steps in his path
Speaks quietly but with authority; there's a physical power in his words
Since he's protecting Slim, the power is : Don't come back here, buddy
Ever
Our Hero nods nervously
Mitch steps back 3 inches, just far enough to let our Hero leave
Which he does with considerable relief
Slim's leaning vs
the counter, shaken, tears in her eyes - Mitch tugs his baseball cap, mutters as he heads for the door: Sorry to get in your business
No
Hey
Thank you
He nods, keeps going
(
) (blurts out, grateful:) can't believe you actually said something
(turns, shrugs) If 'd kept my mouth shut, 'd'a felt bad later
Good luck, huh
She nods
He ambles out the door
touch of the cowboy in him
She shakes her head, looks at Ginny
Ginny gestures as if to say, well
At first Slim doesn't get it
Ginny gestures more urgently: Come on
What're you waiting for
She looks toward the door - Slim follows her look
'  as she tries to work up the courage
Just as she starts toward the door, we: : 10 : Wedding photos
Mitch has lots of (surprisingly upper crust) family, Slim has a few friends
The more photos , the more pronounced (and sad), the contrast
: Bacchanalian
French Champagne has flowed; shoes and inhibitions were abandoned hours ago
weaves through the  to find: Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move intense, physical, like subtle public sex
Their eyes are locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building
We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely physically involved - and how much fun they have
Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents,
(58, confident, at ease with her power and family money, and likeable despite monstrous flaws) and
(someone Mrs
Tyler married in a moment of cupidity)
Mitch was kind of
evasive
Is her father dead too
Dead to her
He left when she was two
Oh
Well, 'm happy to pay for the - Yes, we're very happy - , (ignoring Mr
) It's a way to build bridges
Not that you can
(repair all the damage) When there's such a vast body of water
11 You don't get along with your son
She gives him a look
She's both offended by, and appreciative of, his bluntness
Looks out at Mitch: He's like my father
Which means, guess, that he'll do very well
He's done well to get Miss Slim
Yes, he has, hasn't he
He's married down, but he's gotten value
As Phil reacts, he notices his wife, , has joined him
With her are two kids (5 and 2)
Salima's looking out at the floor: not at Slim, but at Ginny and her dance partner
We see a thought cross her mind
She bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids
They whoop their response, run out to Ginny (who looks quite uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress)
Mom
Mom
Mom
Can we spend the night at Phil and Salima's house
Ginny looks over, winks at Salima, and kisses her kids: Don't eat at their ice cream, huh
They squeal with pleasure and run off
Ginny turns back, resumes dancing with  (24, handsome in a casual way, a good guy): So this was during college or after
During
What was wrong with you
(off his puzzled look) mean-why'd you and Slim break up
12 Oh
Well
'm terrible in bed
(lets this hang for a moment for shock value, then:) Plus,  don't know: we just sort of
evolved into being friends
Evolution
You were going the wrong direction, bud
That's kinda what
1 thought, but guess  was so totally pathetic - Why am  not believing this
() Can  take you home right now
If you've got a sense of humor
My kids are out for the night, and
Another thing:  live in Chicago; women always want the possibility of - - didn't propose, huh
just want to have
(looks at him
) a brief and completely unsatisfying sexual encounter
Hey
'm your guy
She pulls him into a kiss, and
well: he's not a bad kisser
We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving
Suddenly: tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him
You sure,you love me
Uh-huh
13 For ever and ever
He stops dancing
Senses the real issue beneath her questions: You're safe with me, Slim
You're safe, and it's okay to be happy
We deserve it
They kiss
Others stop to watch: how cute
Phil comes over, waits
When they break: 'm sorry,  gotta get up five o'clock to buy green beans
He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand: In my country, it's tradition to give money to groom
You don't need it, but
Slim shakes her head, touched, as: That's very sweet - ( ) Thanks for giving me away, okay
You're the best substitute Dad a girl could possibly have
No substitute
am real thing
She kisses him, and he goes
They look after him
He really loves you
She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away
Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is this going too far
)
He pulls her to him, whispers: You gonna give me babies
14 Oh yeah
How soon
How soon can we get out of here
He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor
Applause from the
It's a grand romantic gesture
You have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true
: -
Slim (4 months pregnant) stands'on the walkway leading up to a large, simple,' beautiful house
Mitch is knocking at the door
The man who answers the door is 62, white-haired, vigorous
Looks like he walked out of a Viagra ad
Hello
Hi
We've been driving around, and my wife has completely fallen in love with your house
It's great, isn't it
We want to buy it
The Home Owner's jaw drops as Mitch gestures toward his bulging : (
) My wife wants it for our family
(polite but firm) Well
we're not selling
Sure you are
15 Mitch hands him a slip of paper
Totally amiable: That's the price
Don't worry, it's well over-market
(stunned, a little scared) You
You're out of your mind
know
That's just it
So before you say no again, think how miserable one determined crazy person can make you
Miserable today, miserable tomorrow, miserable for every single day until the day you sell
We glimpse the Home Owner's will just starting to crumble
(
) Your kids are grown, you'll be happier in a smaller place
the Owner's face
the window of the house the  that time is passing
and when we reach the window, we see  inside
the window
Six weeks later
She's happily putting away groceries
Whistling to herself
What we can see of the house feels good: the furnishings are simple, casual, friendly
She's putting a bottle of oil up on a shelf
but it never quite gets there
Her face changes
Something's happened
The hand holding the oil lowers
the oil bottle slips through her fingers and smashes on the floor
Oil spreading across the floor
She stares at it
Claws the air, grabbing the cordless phone as she plops down on a kitchen barstool
Starts to cry
Punches the autodialer
It's Slim, is he there
Water is flooding down the barstool; she's miscarried
16 (
) Well, will you please just
Just tell him 'm sorry, okay
: '
central area with large offices surrounding it, ,    , , all moving quickly, purposefully come out of a room putting envelopes into their pockets
Projects everywhere
Models, photos, charts and timelines: when the concrete's going to be poured, when the inspector comes, etc
Mitch is building mini-malls
In the center of this activity, Mitch moves from one locus of energy to the next: answering questions, making suggestions
Gradually we perceive something, motion slower than the rest of the office
Slim
Coming toward him
He sees her
Sees her expression
She stops
He realizes: You saw the doctor
It's so obvious from her face that she barely needs to'say it: lost this one too
: Slim lies in bed
Very pale, a light dust of sweat
We assume she's between contractions
Mitch's face inches from hers; smothering her with kisses
The Nurse brings the baby in, starts to give her to Slim - Can  hold her
The Nurse looks at Slim,
who nods, and gives Mitch the baby
17 He kisses her head, dances with her
Slim looks adoringly at father and daughter: the sight is almost unbelievably sweet
His cell phone rings
He keeps dancing, ignoring it
After one ring, it stops
He's kissing the baby's head over and over, just like he kissed Slim, and staring into the infant's eyes - She looks just like my baby pictures
His cell phone rings again
As if the previous call had been a signal
Slim looks at him as the phone keeps ringing
With some difficulty, juggling the baby, he turns the phone off
But he doesn't look at Slim
Who was that
don't know
Who cares
Some construction thing,  guess
She stares at him
He stares at the baby
Isn't she the most beautiful thing you ever saw in your life
Slim nods cautiously
: Remains of a picnic
Slim's playing with their daughter, , now 4
Says something and Gracie laughs
Slim laughs
Keeps laughing, which really gets Gracie going
Mitch looks on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that: they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter; it's all between the mother and child
So he stops trying
Just watches them
And before his eyes, they become - for an instant - strangers
As this reaction, and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face, Slim looks up at him - For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf between them
Then Gracie says something
Slim turns back toward her, the "girls" are laughing again
and Mitch is not
: /
Glass, opaque, streaked with water and soap so as to give a slightly freaky aspect
Someone inside
Slim watching
Smiles
Starts to take off her clothes
Hey
Hey
() Should  join you
'm about to get out
(down to her panties) Oh
have to go to back to work, 'm just doing this to wake myself up
() Okay
(starts to go) 19 () Sorry
( ) Yeah
(Me too
) She's in the bedroom now
It's underlit, full of shadows
In scary-movie nomenclature, she's exposed, vulnerable; it feels like someone's going to leap out and attack her at any - Not this time
She throws on shorts and a t-shirt - She looks in on Gracie, sleeping peacefully
Consoling image
She's washing dishes, bored, humming to herself
The counter's covered with take-out food containers: she didn't cook
noise
Pager
Not beeping, just humming slightly: she wouldn't even hear it except it's on the tile counter
Sounds vaguely like a vibrator
Lying there, just a few feet from her
With Mitch's wallet and keys, his cell phone
She looks at it
knows she shouldn't
decides not to
Can't resist
Dries her
hands methodically on a dishtowel
Picks up the pager
Reads: 33
She stares, realizing: it's code
She looks at the cell phone
Wonders whether
Looks toward the hall
We  the shower still running
She picks up his cell phone
Tentatively - she's not sure this will work - she presses:  33
The phone flashes , but instead of a name there's:
She stares at this, glances again down the hall-takes a deep breath
and presses
Waits
listens nervously
20 ' () Hello there
You just paged my husband, right
( ) Mitch
( ) Who are you, what's your name
' 'm sorry,  - It's too late to deny it
Tell me your - (name) rustle on the other end - (
) Don't hang upl Don't be a cowardl Silence
(
) Just your name
That's the least you could do, don't you think
simple plea, one woman to another
' 'm
Darcelle
Not only the name
Now we hear it in the accent: she's French
Dialtone
Slim goes into slow motion
How oddly her arm moves downward
She looks at the phone
Blinks
Presses
Scans the room as if she's never seen it before
One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor
Slim stares at it
Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up, her body moves down
She slumps to the floor
Sits
Stares
Slim sitting on the floor
Frozen
Head bowed
21 Mitch comes out, dressed, sees her
Hey
She doesn' t say anything
He approaches her
Some instinct keeps him from speaking
He sees she's holding his phone, the silly toy
How can you do this to Gracie
He doesn't say anything
(
) Darcelle paged you
That' s where you're going, right
(off his silence) Yeah
Wow
Mitch
Can you please
Can you sit here with me
He does
She doesn't know where to start, how to talk about it
She's French
She isn't important
No
You're important
Yes
And Gracie
She nods
Mitch
,  can't
couldn't stand for this to
(destroy our lives) 'm happy, 've really been happy, and  don't want to - (give that up) 22 You won't have to
Believe me
She's nothing, she's no-one - You
Damn it
You said  was safe with you
You are, Slim
You are
promise
They fall into an embrace
We feel how keenly they need each other
: They're hugging
Begin  on them
At first it seems like this is the same embrace shot from a different angle
Then we see we're in the kitchen, his briefcase is at his side; their clothes are different
We watch Slim's expression slowly change
From pleasure
To confusion
Pain
Outrage
She whispers: smell her
What
Her perfume
Darcelle or whoever
- (intense, sad) How many, Mitch
How many are there
How many have there been
What does it matter
stunning statement
Even more stunning because of the casual way he says it
23 (
) mean what're you saying here, that don't deserve to get laid
Please
'm a man, Slim
With the pregnancies, Gracie, you don't have time and energy like you used to, and understand that,  really do
Men and women have different needs, and that's okay
Darcelle is willing to take care of it, and maybe that's better for everybody
Including you
He contemplates his answer
and shrugs
No
No
No
Calm down, Slim - Wild, violently invading his space and assaulting his authority, screaming at him, her face just inches from his: can't do this anymore
can't
Just take it, and take it, and take it
'm not strong enough
don't know who would be
love you, okay
love you and 'm your wife and you can't do this
You understand me
No more
No more
With the same speed he attacked "Our Hero" at the diner, Mitch's hand shoots out like a snake striking
Slaps her
warning: stop it and stop it now
Her face: shock
Confusion
Outrage
She raises her hand to her cheek
Touches her skin where his fist landed
He reads her expression and is almost amused: What,  can't hit you
(low, strong) No
You can't
He hits her again, this time with a closed fist
24 Knocking her to the ground
Stands over her like a boxer
Sees rase flare across her face - You want to fight
'm a mom, honey; it's no contest
She's silent, but we see (very small) her reaction: Oh yeah
{
} You have to understand, Slim
thought you did: make the money here, so  set the rules, right
It's my rules
He waits for her response, but again she's silent
You with me
It's your rules
Yeah
She keeps her voice meek so as not to offend: And if  don't like the rules
If you don't "like" them
She nods cautiously
{
} Come on
Life isn't onl stuff we like
We take the good with the bad, right
That's what life is, what marriage is
So maybe, for you, today is a bad day
Tomorrow may be great
Tomorrow may be great
That's right
25 Tomorrow will be great
(Without you
) He appears to miss her inference
Yeah
Today is the price you pay for having such a good life
She stares at him
'm going out
She says nothing
{
} This is gonna be better, don't you think
She just cannot process the absurdity of this statement
{
} don't have to sneak around, pretend 'm going to work
can just say: "'m going to Darcelle's, 'll be back in a few hours
" Her face is completely blank
He bends down, gives her a kiss on the head
We feel her skin crawl
She watches him go
Waits
Hears the front door close
She gets up, walks to the window, watches him walk toward his car
She turns away, looks at the room
We  his car start
She goes to the phone
Thinks
Starts to dial-slowly, deliberately
Shock:
He's there
26 She reacts with guilt, but he doesn't look angry now
Behind him is his idling Mercedes convertible, driver's door open
He motions for her to open the window
She does
Who you calling
Your mother
What're you gonna tell her
'm supposed to bring Gracie tomorrow
Maybe  better cancel
() was thinking
You
you know that  adore you, but if you ever want
if you want out
For a second he can't talk
He's choked up
She watches coldly
His emotion appears real, but who cares
(
) 'll understand
really will
( ) But there's one thing: you can't have Gracie
She's my daughter
Don't even think about taking her
Slim stares at him
He adds calmly: (
) If  see that thought even cross your mind, 'll kill you
There
He's said what he needs to
He walks toward his car
She shuts the window
Stares after him
In an odd and defiant way, she starts to whistle
Loudly
To herself
Almost daring him
27 He keeps walking
: Emotional, impressionistic
her face, almost inside her skin: a visual symphony
The countryside behind her is out of focus, a blur
She pulls up at a gate, punches in a code
Drives up a long a driveway to: JAGUARs lined up
At a respectful distance sit an old Toyota (the maid's car) and a pick-up (the gardener's truck)
Slim parks near the truck
Her hand moves to the door handle, but she can't bring herself to open it
She sits
paralyzed, a failure
In this prolonged pause, Mrs
Tyler bursts out of the house - You're late, you're late,  was worried you wouldn't comet (looks, realizes) No Gracie
Slim shakes her head
Mrs
Tyler is clearly disappointed, but quickly covers it up: Well then, you and  will have a girls' luncheon and gossip about simply everybody
She's about to hurtle into the gossip when Slim turns her head and Mrs
Tyler sees (and we see for the first time) the result of Mitch's brutality: a nasty bruise on Slim's cheek
Mrs
Tyler's face falls as she realizes what this means
Underneath it all, she's a warm person; she hugs Slim: Oh baby
Oh baby, 'm so sorry
28 a moment; like a mother-daughter tableau
Her tone stays sympathetic, not at all accusatory: (
) What did you do
What'd you say to him
Slim freezes
On her sad, shocked reaction - : ""
Ginny in the middle of an intense rap
She and Slim are wedged in a corner booth
The off-season lunch rush has died down
Men are land mines
Some you trigger the first week, others it's years in
Problem is: you want a man man, meaning his veins run thick with testosterone, which is good 'cause he can fuck your brains out but he can also turn around, no warning, and beat your brains out too
never touch Salima
Ginny waves at him: of course not
But the other part, first part: can - (do that) Relax, Phil
Nobody's talkin' about your dick here, okay
Phil brings Slim an iced tea and slice of pie: You went to cops,  hope
(Don't be stupid
) Mitch is in construction, Phil
() He knows every cop in the city
29 Even if he didn't
My aunt
She got a restraining order
When it was up, this slimeball beat her into a coma
If he wants to put her in coma, why worry restraining order
'Cause he's a man, Phil
He's psychotic
(calmly, to Slim) You're leaving him today
Right now
(shakes her head, trapped) gotta pick up Gracie at pre-school
: -
4--  running toward a car, squealing
They're all blond and adorable, and it takes a moment for us to realize none of them is Gracie
Slim sits in her car in the pick-up line
The Four Girls get in the Volvo station wagon in front of her
The Volvo pulls out, and Slim moves to the front of the line
The very hip -  smiles at Slim: Your husband got her
What
(
) Gracie was totally psyched
told him he should do it more often
Slim nods with feigned casualness and pulls away
Slight smile frozen on her face
: She pulls in
No other car there
30 She looks around
Nothing abnormal except the quiet
As if they've gone and are never coming back
She digs out her cell phone, punches the first number on the automatic dialer
Presses
Thinks
After one ring, she disconnects
Immediately presses , then
: ' ( ) How is my little croissant
It's your loaf of bread
' (cheerful, no guilt) Oh
Hi
How's it going
Where are you
' Zoo
Why didn't you tell me you were going to - (pick up Gracie) ' called you at home, left messages - He's interrupted by a   from Gracie, followed by a question, which he answers: '  (
) Your Mom
' Hey Moml The elephants are peeing
' (pleased with himself for being a good Dad) She's a little excited
31 When are you coming home
: Dinner
It's scary that Mitch will have this conversation in front of Gracie, who's playing at their feet: It made me nervous when couldn't reach you
Slim shrugs
He stares at her
Smiles
His voice so soft and calm: {
} Do you have any idea how bad things can get
Educate me
(embarrassed to say it) Slim
'm a determined person was determined to have you, and did
This house
the company am, and always will be, a person who gets what he wants
You can either share in my success or leave us (meaning him and Gracie) right now
Which way you wanna go
Beat
want to be happy
He's not sure of her subtext, but he's willing to give her the benefit of the doubt : Good
With a sudden shock, Slim sees Gracie staring at Mitch: the girl has picked up on his tone
Slim glances at Mitch to see if he notices Gracie's expression
He doesn't
32 Slim looks back at Gracie: still staring at Mitch
If she already senses what's happening, how long before she's affected by it
How long before she sees Mitch become violent
Slim's jaw tightens slightly; her resolve grows stronger
: Mitch asleep, Slim awake, listening
His breathing deep, rhythmic, slight hint of a snore
In the distance, a  coos
She looks at her clock: 2:15
She eases out of bed
Goes into the bathroom
We hear the sound of her peeing
She's no peeing
is propped up, running water into the toilet as Slim gets dressed
Quickly, silently
She leans out the bathroom doorway, sees: he's still asleep
She moves quickly, bathroom to hall
'
Gracie's fast asleep
Slim lifts her up, piles her prized teddy bear on top
Slim carries Gracie toward the entrance
We  with her
She's silent, terrified
Glances over her shoulder - No one there
She keeps walking
The eerie sense of a house that's awake rather than asleep
The almost imperceptible but anxiety- provoking  of her footsteps
the suspense as long as we possibly can
33 She reaches the front door
Waits to make sure all is quiet
It is
She turns, looks back down the hall
Empty
Reaches toward the doorknob
hand closer, closer
she starts to turn it - '
Ginny, Phil, and Teddy are clustered under a tree, staring at the house
Waiting
Their  is parked down the road
We expect the front door to open any instant
It doesn't
They wait
Casually
Not knowing where Slim was
But we know
Did something go wrong
Slim was right at the door
In a casual way, her rescuers start to wonder
Maybe she didn't hear the signal
She heard it
No
Teddy's right
She could still be asleep - She's not asleep, okay
She's coming out any second
Phil nods
They wait
She does not come out
Ginny shakes her head, looks at her watch
34 Do it again
Teddy nods
Cups his hands, coos like a dove
They wait again
Beat
Slim still frozen in exactly the same spot
Still carrying Gracie, still with her hand on the knob
Listening
Turning her head this way-that way
She hears the come again from outside
That settles it
She pulls the door - - Grabs her, catches her, catches Gracie, pulling Slim's hair hard, leading her away from the door - The three rescuers still wait
Frozen
Phil shakes his head
We see a baseball bat in his hands
We better go in
It'd be crazy to wake him
If anything's wrong, she'll flick the lights
Right
Phil nods skeptically, and Ginny herself doesn't seem so sure
They look at the house-and wait
and wait
We want to scream: "
" Suddenly something
Subtle
Was that   from inside
They go on alert
step forward
listen more closely
But hear nothing unusual
35 Phil
looks at Ginny, shrugs - Ginny shrugs back - , then darkness
The signal
They run toward the house - Slim
Intense horrible spit of sound, replaced by an even more horrible silence
Deadly silence
as they run: as if we've lost Slim and Ginny's
our new protagonist
As we near the house, we realize: it's not silence
There are sounds from inside: almost inaudible
Sound of a beating
On Ginny's horrified reaction - Baseball bat
Phil smashes a window
They climb through the hole into the house - Silence
They move quickly, carefully toward the living room; it's very dark, we can hardly - Another step and you're dead
Mitch emerges from darkness
Light glints off his pistol
Thirty feet behind him: Gracie's sleeping on the couch
Mitch moves and they stare in horror
Lying at his feet is Slim's body
Pain springs from Ginny's throat, she rushes to Slim - Mitch rams the gun into her head: Didn't you hear me
i Ginny feels Slim's pulse, says to Phil: She's alive - Unless you go, your brains'11 be on imy rug i 36 Sir
We are three people
If you kill us all, you will go sure to electric chair
could give a shit
Slim makes a  as Ginny strokes her head
Mitch  the gun into the wall over Ginny's head
Muffled sound: silencer
But he has everyone's attention now: (
) This is your last chance
We are happy to leave, Sir: with Miss Slim and Gracie
Ginny's helping Slim to her knees
(
) And make no mistakes
If you keep them here, we will go to police, who will arrest you with pleasure
/ Mitch stares at Phil
Walks to him
Is he going to hit him
Shoot him
Mitch leans in, gun to Phil's head, and whispers: don't want to say this in front of the group, but you're just a rug-head, nobody'll believe you
You go to the cops, it's her word against mine
They'll find drugs in her bureau
(before Phil can laugh) Or her car, whatever
( ) Trust me on that
(casual, confident) 'll have custody of Gracie by the end of the week
() And if we take them away, you will shoot all four of us
That's right
37 Then we die young
The others are uncertain, but Phil helps Slim up; Teddy joins him
Ginny tentatively follows his lead and picks up Gracie
( ) (This is no good
) You're humiliating him
What
(a little louder) He'll come after me and kill me
Mitch overhears this, smiles
You hear that
That's why she loves me
(off their horrified looks) Nobody cares like  do
The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward the door
Mitch leans toward Slim, whispers: See you soon
: Gracie awake now in Slim's arms: staring, confused
Gentle rocking of the van
The others barely visible, like shadows
, Gracie asleep, Slim holding her
Blinds down, movie playing
Despite Gracie's age, the angle and soft lighting make this resemble a Madonna and child
: 38 ()
Open air market: shops, stalls; yuppie heaven
Slim carries Gracie on her shoulders
They're with Jog (her old boyfriend, from the wedding)
Horsing around, having a good time, Gracie eating a pastry
They stop and look out at Lake Michigan
Wow
whattaya think, Toots
It's a big ocean
Well
It's only a lake, but we like it
(nods, stares out
Can we stay here a while
: '
They're driving along, suddenly Joe says - Coming up, whattaya say
& ( ) Bobbing for apples
Slim (front seat) and Gracie (back) both drop their heads so they can't be seen from outside the car - Joe turns the corner, presses a garage door opener, and drives into the basement garage of a nice-looking 4-plex
' 4-
They come in from the garage, throw off their coats
All the curtains in the apartment are drawn
Is there anybody who likes ice cream
Gracie whoops - The doorbell rings - 39 Slim and Joe freeze - Slim whips her hand over Gracie's mouth - Gracie looks horrified: why are you covering my - Slim puts her finger to her mouth: shhh
She takes Gracie's hand; they scurry out of sight - Joe hurries to the stereo, puts it on
Music to cover Gracie's "whoop
" He goes to the door, looks through the peep hole
Sees a
Yes
Can we talk
He holds up an
Not readable through the peep hole
Go ahead
Would you mind opening up
Joe glances over his shoulder: no sign of them
He opens the door, but not far enough to let the man in
Behind the large man are
We're investigating a kidnapping; we'd like to look around
You got a search warrant
Oh, we got a warrant all right
He slaps a paper and pushes past Joe; the other men follow
Can  she the warrant
First  Man ignores this
40 (
) Who're you looking for
The  Man gives him a sarcastic glance
(
) mother taking her own child isn't kidnapping
don't think you're at all
This elicits no response
Joe moves to where he can see the other two guys
Looks down the hall toward: searching the pantry, looking around
He opens the door to the garage and vanishes - looks under the bed, in the closets
yanks clothes aside
At any moment we expect him to find them
Mister: unless you leave right now, 'm calling the police
Oh
jeez
that's a scary thought
Joe picks up the phone - First  Man slams it down
marri a cop, okay
'm not in the mood
Joe accepts this
but only for the moment
Second  Man looks in the car, under the car
isn't this the logical place for them to hide
41 Third  Man returns from the bedroom emptyhanded, starts to search the living room: 'll look around here
The Second  Man returns from the garage, starts to search
We're scared with every cupboard he opens that he'll find them
Third  Man searches the room
we go to '
she and Gracie are in a cabinet, looking out through a narrow horizontal slit
Watching the Third  Man makes his way methodically in their direction
First  Man stands over Joe, keeping him silent
Joe watches the Third  Man search the room
And then Joe blinks
Moves his eyes, and looks right in Slim's direction
He realizes where they must be hiding
The Third  Man's getting closer and closer to them
Joe realizes he has to do something
Abruptly Joe stands: That's enough
( ) You hear me
It's time to go
Now
(off First 's
shocked look) know who you are, okay
know who hired you
First  Man whirls
Suddenly he's got a knife in his hand
Definitely
Putting the
knife to Joe's throat: "  " Yeah
You know what it feels like to have a knife hit your carotid
(trying not to move) No
42 Inside the cabinet, Gracie gasps
Slim puts a hand over her mouth
But Slim herself has to fight the impulse to burst out of there to save Joe - "  " You know what it's like to bleed out in less than two minutes
No
"  " (stopping his search) Oh please, John Boy
Not the shiv - "  " 'm just going to cut him a little - Slim's eyes bulge - "  " You are not going to cut him
"  " sure as hell am
Slim's on the verge of bursting out when "Second " enters: "  " John Boy, this is not listed on the program
Come on, they're not here; let's ride
"  " Can't  just - (cut him a little} "  " No
No slice and dice
They head for the door
As he goes, "First  Man" (a
k
a
John Boy) runs his knife along the couch, spilling out its contents
passes the tv set and stabs the tube
runs his knife along the wall, making a vicious scary mark
And they vanish
We hear the door
The horizontal band through which Slim was looking widens - 43 The cabinet door falls open, Slim and Gracie come out
Gracie's crying
Slim hugs her, says to Joe: Jesus, are you okay
guess
(feels his neck) needed a shave, anyway
The phone rings
They look at it
It can't be who they think it is
it rings again
Joe goes to it
Hesitates
Answers: Hello
' This is Mitch Tyler, Joe
Hello, yes, how are you
Joe points at phone: "It's him
" He nods toward Gracie, indicating Slim should take her into the next room
Slim does
' (calm, friendly) assume Slim's called you
Joe thinks for a split second, then: Of course
' Will you give her a message
(off his silence) If she calls again,  mean
Slim and Gracie are in the next room, but Slim's looking through the door back at Joe
don't know
'm on her side here, not yours
44 ' Her side
Come on, Joe, you're a smart person
Let me say two words, okay
"Lug nuts
" You don't want to worry they're loose every time you get in your car
And how 'bout the windows to your apartment: are they still locked
person could go crazy thinking about stuff like that
Goodbye, Mitch
' Tell her to call her friends
Joe hangs up
Slim comes back out
Wow
Charming
He scare you
Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her question
{
} shouldn't be here - Sure you should - 'm dangerous to know right now
(calm, forceful) Slim
You can be here anytime
She nods
They both know what he's saying: if he's willing to take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend (which he is) or he's still in love with her (which he is, also)
(
) Oh
He said you should call your friends
At the restaurant
45 Slim on the phone, listening as the phone rings
And again, again
Joe watching her, concerned
Finally: ' Awright already
Orcal Hey
Gin
You okay
' We had to clear the customers out, some ridiculous bomb threat - What
""
Ginny on the cordless; Phil working nearby - Yeah, right during dinner
Like anybody's gonna bomb a diner in Carpenteria
' What about you and Phil, did you - You know Phil
He won't leave his ship
We're doin' cleanup
' Get out
What
' got a bad feeling, Gin
You got more than a bad feeling, hon
You got a bad husband
' know
That's what 'm saying
Get Phil and get out of there
Nowt 46 All right, all right, take it easy - ( ) Let's go - The police are - (heading out the door) Screw the police, we're outta here
' Run, okay
t Ginny
Runt "
"
They step out
The restaurant is at the end of a long pier
Ginny turns skeptically to the overweight Phil - Can you run
Like Michael Jackson
As they sprint, sort of, toward the boardwalk: It's Michael Johnson, Phil
know
But  run like Michael Jackson
And he kind of does: arms flailing, not quite connected to his body
Just as when we're enjoying this comic sight - behind them - They're thrown   - Debris flying everywhere - They lie on the
ground
Not moving
Are they dead or just stunned
Slowly they raise their heads
Blink
Look back at the restaurant: Starting to go up in flames
47 '
Slim holding her phone
Peculiar expression on her face
The line went dead
Joe stares at her, concerned
She presses redial, and we hear   start to ring
She- goes to the window, parts the curtain:  in the street, the   sit in their car - No answer on the phone
Slim looks at Joe and shakes her head: this isn't good
: Slim walking a crowded street, carrying Gracie; TransAmerica Pyramid in the b
g
Slim goes down an alley behind a converted warehouse, enters a basement garage
One floor, lots of windows, lots of  young people in jeans working on lots of different projects
Sign on the wall says:
Viet Cong Venture Capital
, 24, nudges   (52, ponytail, handsome, confident): Hey Jupe
Girl here says she's your daughter
Jupiter gives Slim and Gracie a skeptical look
know you don't want to see me or know about me, but  am desperate, had nowhere else to go
need your belg
(off his blank look) You want me dead
He shrugs affably and leads her into his office - It's a good gig
To claim 'm your father
What year were you born
48 You are my Dad, Jupiter
When Mom died,  wrote you, you didn't answer
didn't have enough money to bury her, that was really fun
Don't look at me,  didn't kill her
No, you had help
That's a stupid thing to say
What do you want, money
thought you should meet your granddaughter
(perfunctory, to Gracie) Hi
Gracie looks at him skeptically, nods
And yes, we need money
To survive
Look sweetheart
From '68 to like '72, had maybe 5 kids
Different women
It was like a joke to me
It's like a joke to me too
You're the third to show up here with a hand out
give all of you the same thing
(taking it from his wallet) Six bucks
Enough for a sandwich
For you, it's' twelve, you can buy the kid a sandwich too
(stunned
} Well
Now  know
Yeah
49 Used to be if  did something nasty, my temper got the better of me
, 'd wonder where the hell it came from
Thanks for clearing that up
No problem
She goes, leaving the $12 on the table
He pockets it
: Slim stands behind Jupiter's building
In the shadows
Still carrying Gracie
It's only after we hear Gracie - Don't cry, Mom
Please don't cry
- that we realize Slim is crying
(
) You have mtg
Beat
: Slim and Gracie climb off the train and are immediately shepherded away by    in Hawaiian shirts - Wait
Wait
What're you
Who're you
() Mommy
One of the Swarthy Men speaks to Slim, but in the flurry, we can't hear it
She looks relieved, turns to Gracie - - but before Slim can speak, their bags are thrown in the trunk of a car and they're pushed into the back seat - The car speeds off, whips into a left-hand turn - 50 Now the car makes a right-hand turn, and a  pulls out, blocking traffic so no one can follow them - Slim looks out the back, sees the Truck's maneuver
Turns to face forward again
Tries to meet the Driver's eyes
Hello
Where are we going
The Driver answers her in a Middle-Eastern language
Gracie looks alarmed
It's okay, Sweetheart, they're friends of Phil's
( think
) Gracie plays as Slim talks to Ginny and Phil
The car's parked below
Phil gestures toward the Driver, who'e standing guard
so secret we don't even know who this man is or where he takes you
Slim nods
You're not afraid to help me
In my country people bleed their enemies to death out of their genitals
fire
This is for roasting lamb
No letters, Slim, but you can call - Must be very short
51 Slim nods
Phil ceremonially hands her a thin envelope
She looks inside
and clearly finds money - No
Phil, wait a minute,  - have insurance from fire - know, but - ( ) will not discus, okay
We are family
She nods
Gratefully
Ginny takes her hand
Beat
What about the police
The fire
Do they - Mr
Mitch - of course - he has beautiful alibi
Slim nods again
Looks at Ginny
who's been working up to: You know,  keep having a bad idea
The first time he hit you, we saw your bruises
Second time, he beat you unconscious
The next time
Well
If you should fight back, defend yourself, and he dies
Who'd convict you
Who'd prosecute
This is American law
l called my cousin, he's some shit- for-brains lawyer over in Tarzana, he says it's 2-1 she'd walk: self- defense, justifiable homicide

That's good on a race-horse, Gin, but for Gracie
, to lose both parents
Besides, this is me, i couldn't kill anybodyl 52 We're talking about Mitch here
Even so
'm not that kind of person, okay
Ginny nods reluctantly
She's not sure the subject is closed

"Erin" works at her desk
Gracie shoots paper basketballs- into the wastebasket

FedEx is like underground railroad

She looks inside the package, finds another FedEx pack
Opens that
Inside it is a wrapped present and note
She reads: ' "Dear Daughter - (

Jupiter's at his desk as the  " " are shown in
He says something gracious to them
For
a moment they don't respond
Then one of them speaks

Joel She waves
"Queen

Joe waves back
65 But that's not what we're looking at
We're
looking at Robbie: walking slowly toward them with the other Reno passengers
He doesn't see "Erin", but in a moment he will
He'll turn the dogleg corner and be right next to them
Robbie pulls out his boarding pass
With it are old photos of "Erin" and "Queen
11
He shuffles past the photos, finds his claim check
He's now only a few feet away from them
And they're oblivious of him
And he turns the little dogleg and looks at them - Except they're no longer there
They've moved toward the unloading area for Joe's gate
And Robbie goes safely past as Joe enters the terminal, sees them, shakes his head: can guarantee one thing in my lifetime:  was not followed
He embraces "Erin" and "Queen

He's not

"Erin" and "Queen

"Erin" gives him a look: she's not telling
She resumes the tour, points to an old crumbling "movie palace:"' "" There's the one-plex

Right

"Erin" pulls up in front of their house, gestures: here it is

Continuing the tour, they're showing him: "" And this is the guest bedroom

He comes in, looks around
Clearly "Queen

) normally known as Buckingham palace

colorful
"" You better warn him, huh
"Queen

"Erin" whispers in her daughter's ear, and she confides in Joe: 67 " " Oh yeah
The dreams in here get really noisy
Joe sets his suitcase down
look forward to that
: Baseball diamond
Joe pitching underhand to "Queen
" He's using plastic balls the size of soccer balls, so it's easy for her to hit every one
"Erin" is running, retrieving the hits
as she's caught in a photograph
The image unfreezes and is followed quickly by a series of frozen frames, photographs of her, some wide, some tight
The park
Mostly empty
No one taking their picture
stand of green bushes
on the bushes for a moment - "Queen
" is curled on a blanket taking a nap as "Erin" and Joe finish the picnic
You seem like you're doing great
"" Yeah
How long can you stand it

68 "" (quiet, strong) Gracie is safe
Yeah, but what, now Mitch started some kind of custody battle
, what - Are you Denise
There he is, standing right over them, in bad clothes and a baseball cap, dark glasses
Completely unrecognizable
"" Pardon me
You're Denise, right
Used to work at the Pack '' Ship
"" 'm not Denise
Oh
Sorry,
You look-but you're right, your voice
(isn't) You're not from New Zealand, are you
"" Never been there
Boy
Sorry to bother you folks
He backs away, embarrassed
Joe stares after him warily
What now
We call Pack '' Ship, see if Denise ever - (worked there) "" Because of some homeless guy
Joe: it could be the Pack''Ship in Trenton, New Jersey
(over his protest) One thing  learned:  can't jump every time someone says boo
can't do that to her
69 Joe looks at "Queen
" and nods
: "'"
Looks peaceful
But why do we need this establishing shot
Its very existence in the narrative is menacing
"'"
Joe gets up from "Queen
's" bed and goes into the kitchen
Gets some juice from the fridge, drinks it
Looks into "Erin's" bedroom
"Erin" is awake, "Queen

Half -whisper: Gracie was right

As he gets into bed: "" You remember the house rules

"Erin" nods

This routine
It might work on other people, but you forget: 've actually had you - didn't forget - "" (like a compliment's coming) - and 'm telling you, from memory

They both laugh
It subsides into affection
"" You really go tomorrow
He nods

) Couldn't you quit your job, and stay here and play the horses or something and become independently wealthy

Please kiss me, Slim
know we're not supposed to, it's against house rules and all, but for me to come all this way and feel the way  do and for us to not even - She kisses him - And he kisses back
And they stop
Incredible self control
Lie next to each other-hold hands again
You're a great person, Slim
You're a great person just like your daughter

past a tree, through the windows
as "Erin" comes warily out to the counter, looks over the customers

"Erin" working a calculator, muttering in frustration
Here, lemme do that
As
wrestles with the calculation, "Erin" looks up
Frowns slightly, her eyes shift
She senses something
This strange sensation, as if she's being watched, or
She looks out the window, doesn't see anyone
Glances into the back office - and notices the clock: 4:15
"" (runs for door) Oh my Godl, the Queen is out of dance class
'll be back in 20 - "" --
We watch from across the street as "Erin" hurries to her Taurus, gets in and drives away

"Erin" in line for Pick-up
Betty the Pre-school Director comes up to "Erin" and says casually: Erin
'm glad you're here
We can't find Queen Elizabeth - "" You can't find her
So many kids're staying for these after-school things - She turns, distracted, as   calls - 73 n "Erin" blinks
looks around frantically
in gym or dance gear, but no "Queen
"
and the knowledge of what's happened is hitting her
her eyes're dilating, breathing becoming frantic
Betty turns back as "Erin" mutters: "" should've
should've known

She rams the car in gear, rockets out of the pick-up line - Almost hits a  and 4    - Slams the breaks, calls: "" 'm sorry, 'm sorry,
Freaked out, frantic, she pulls to the side of the road, yanks up her brake, grabs her cell phone
Auto-dial #2
' Double "" Rent "" Did Queen Elizabeth call
' No, of course - (not) "" Anyone else
' Nobody called, Erin; are you - (okay
) "Erin" presses , then Auto-dial #1, waits, looks around
Betty staring at her like she's crazy, walking toward her car - "'" Hi
Leave a message
"" Gracie, are you there
Is anyone there
Please
Pick up
No one picks up
Silence
She beats the wheel in frustration
lowers her head
For one long second, she seems completely beaten
74 on her window - She looks up, sees Betty
Betty's talking, but it's as if "Erin" has gone crazy
For a moment there's no sound, and then the sound is there but unintelligible, and finally the words and sounds come together: what 've been trying to tell you
"Erin" nodding now, beginning to grasp the words
(
) At the end of dance class, the teacher lets them go hide, and for a minute no one could find her - "Erin" looks past Betty, sees "Queen
" in her tutu and leaps out of her car - "" Thank you, thank you,
'm sorry
'll explain later,
She rushes forward, wraps "Queen
" in a big, not quite appropriate hug
"Queen
" looks at her as if to say, "This is nice, Mom, but will you please tell me what gives

From a distance, we watch "Erin" and "Queen
" trudge toward their Taurus
The end of the day; they're tired

Making meat loaf
"Erin" consults the cookbook, seems confused, puts meat, breadcrusts, eggs, sauces, onions, etc

The normalness of it makes us exceedingly nervous

He seems calm and utterly content
It would be, hard to imagine a more terrifying attitude
"Erin" wakes with a start, sits up, looks around - Everything's normal
Peaceful
No Mitch
"Erin" shakes her head, as if clearing away a dream
As she looks again around the room, her nostrils flare slightly
as if she smells him
She rubs her nose
Touches her wrist, and we notice something she's worn the whole time she's been Erin: a colorful elastic bracelet, probably a Swatch
She gets out of bed and looks out the window - Cold morning - She goes toward the hall
Moving down the hall
each open door feels like a trap ready to spring
She glances into "Queen Elizabeth's" room
We half expect some sort of reaction or exclamation - "Queen
" may be gone - but instead "Erin" keeps right on going
Vanishes into the bathroom
the empty hall
the sound of her peeing
From the doorway, we see her on the potty
The window over her head is open slightly
76 As she pees, she stares at the shower curtain-it rustles slightly in the wind from the window
She wipes herself
Still staring at the curtain
She stands, pulls up her pajamas
Stares
Yanks the shower curtain aside - Nothing
She goes into the kitchen
She puts on the kettle
Drinks a little o

Walks back down the hall - In every moment of this, the tension is excruciating
Facing her as she comes down the hall, passing the living room doorway
we wait for Mitch to leap out at her - He doesn't
She keeps coming, past "Queen 's - - " Erin" starts to scream, looks toward "Queen

They wrestle
Silently
Grim pantomime
The only sounds are ,  vs
the walls
He's far too strong for her - They slam against one wall, the other,  to the floor - 77 Wanna know a secret
Whispering to her, his hands moving to her neck

Without your body, they'll think you disappeared again
Her hands at his hands, clawing, trying to pry them loose - {
} Which is kind of true
One of her hands moves-away from his hands to that Swatch or whatever it is on her wrist - (
) 'Cause where you're going, they will never
ever
find you
She turns the gizmo so it points away from her face
Toward his face
At the last instant he realizes what she must be doing - But it's too late
She presses a button - Orange spray hits his face, eyes - He screams and releases her - She leaps up - and Sees "Queen

Staring, mute and horrified
How long was she watching
"Erin" grabs "Queen

Mitch writhes on the floor - "'"
"Erin" bursts out the back door, whirls, pulls a rope - - Causing a slab of 2-by-4 to slide over the door: primitive locking device - She sprints for her Taurus
Still in her pajamas, still carrying "Queen

She punches numbers, opens the door, puts "Queen

Parked in back, near dumpsters
"Erin" jumps out of the Taurus, runs around to the trunk, pulls out a small suitcase
"Erin" and "Queen

of pajamas and underwear and suitcase and the last thing we expect to see: at the window
Robbie
"Erin" whirls, looks
For an instant   as she stares at him
,  : she recognizes him - And realizes: he's with Mitch
Which means: Mitch was phony from the moment she met him - Robbie reaches for her door handle - She rams the accelerator, leaving Robbie behind - The car rockets forward, toward the dumpsters - She spins the wheel; the car swerves, kisses off the dumpster - Robbie running for his car, and now we see the Chevy Suburban, hidden behind some nearby bushes - The Taurus pogos over the concrete/grass divider, rockets across the next parking lot
Robbie jumping into his Suburban - "Erin" half in, half out of her clothing, trying to drive, trying to see, sticking out her arm to keep "Queen

Robbie's Suburban right behind them, closer, closer
finally slams into their Taurus, knocking them half off the road
He pushes them off again, again, "Queen

This looks like totally the wrong place to be leading someone

Up ahead is a one-lane covered bridge crossing over a stream
The bridge is very narrow

Eyes widen
He realizes - shit
too late

Using her keys, "Erin" unlocks the trunk of the Olds
Two large suitcases inside
"Erin" throws their small suitcase in on top
"Erin" reaches up under the driver's seat and pulls out a wallet
Checks the contents: cash, credit cards
"Queen

They're on a lightly travelled two-lane highway
"Erin" (now a redhead) looks in her rear-view mirror: no cars

You're not the Queen of England anymore either

No, but he's - 'm not a crazy person
She walks past the Receptionist - Wait a minute
You can't Slim opens the big door, enters: '
The moment we see   we know Slim's okay
The actor playing him is one of those cranky avuncular types who pisses and moans but always comes to the rescue and outsmarts the bad guys
As we expect, he starts out disliking her: 83 don't know where you learned manners, young lady, but this is not the way to get my attention
know, but 'm desperate
(digging into purse) My husband keeps trying to kill me, and  need to talk to somebody who's smart, okay

just two minutes, okay
Please
She's so charming and intense and discombobulated, he can't help but give in

Good poker player; we can tell nothing from his expression
His voice very quiet and calm: Pardon my French, dear, but  hope you got pleasure from it, 'cause you have really fucked yourself
You had two chances to file a complaint with the police and put his violence on record
You ignored them
Which tells him to keep comin' till he kills you
Slim reacts to this
(
) As for Gracie: his next move
he'll initiate a custody hearing
He
he already did
84 If you don't show up, the judge'll rule against you, you become a fugitive from the law
If you do show, Mitch will, as you say, portray you as a drug addict
For all  know you are one: you break in here, uninvited
'd say your husband has a good chance for sole custody
Now if you don't mind: (pushes the money back at her) 'd like to go back to my work

No one can help you, lady

And does not go
After a moment we see him have a thought

The custody hearing, if he pushes for it, is just a trick
She says nothing

Watches as: He plucks a $20 bill from her stack of funds
Obviously he's giving her a valuable piece of advice: (

so he can kill you
He pockets the $20

Of course
He's right

Looks back at the road
Back at Gracie
Something building
Finally, softly: 85 gotta make you a solemn promise, Grace
Gracie is, of course, fast asleep
(
) Ever since you were born
well-one day  started to think of all the awful things that were gonna happen
People you'd love who'd die, or leave you, betray you, break your heart
Physical injuries: broken bones or sickness or guys who hurt you some way

That's my deadline
Deadline for what
Slim looks at her
: '    '   ' :

Intense, focussed
88 ' You ready
She nods
, we see more of her face
' Sure
Another nod
Perspiration streaming from her pores, running down her face
And a look we haven't seen before
' Can you lose
She shakes her head
' Can he hurt you
She barely dignifies the question with another shake
We're now far enough back to see we are: Slim in a leotard
' Even though he's bigger

quiet) He's a lot bigger
' Even though he's stronger
Finally see her  (6'4", 235 pounds, African-American, 0
4% body fat)
He's a lot stronger
So if he hits you - No way
89 Say it
It takes
twice as much energy to swing and miss as to swing and hit
After he misses, what do you do
She answers him with an intense look
He nods and moves after her
Slow, strong, powerful: predator
She backs up
Her movements simple, graceful, economical but athletic: they remind us of the easy way she moved around the restaurant in the first scene
Scattered over the mat are old-fashioned plastic  that kids use as punching bags
He backs her toward one
then another
As she nears them, she slides deftly to the side: like she has eyes in the back of her head
He maneuvers her toward a desk-her back to it
Rushes at her - For a moment she seems trapped - But as he reaches her, she slips to her left, tosses him over the desk and onto the mat
She moves quickly to an attacking position, standing over him
He pats the mat beside him
She sits
He makes a motion and she closes her eyes
One last thing
The hardest lesson: we can't control the universe
She listens
(
) The unexpected may happen
He slides his hand over the mat, an order
She lies down

) Suddenly his maid enters, you're distracted for an instant, and he hits you
That's not possible - 4 We must prepare even for the impossible
She stirs slightly, uncomfortable with this idea
(
) We bend the universe to our will, but it will only go so far
You're saying - ( ) That's right - (
) For the sake of this exercise, he hits me
He's standing over her
She looks completely vulnerable
: Yes
And you lie there as if dead
But hear me
Hold onto my voice
She nods almost imperceptibly
(
) He's standing over you, he thinks he's won-and as sure as he's a coward, he'll try to kick you
() Yes
91 And because you know what he'll do, you're smiling inside,
(
) Her face blank, eyes still closed-but something changes; we sense her confidence and serenity returning
He draws his foot back as if to kick her

Slim strides through the office unapologetically interrupting various conversations
Finally she spots Jupiter, walks over, and without saying a word, demands his attention - (to the others) Ah
Just a sec, 'll be right back
(to her, irritated} thought  made it clear you weren't supposed to come here
don't care what you want
This almost makes him smile; he's getting to like her
You're a different person
So
How's that black guy
set you up with
Good
Did he teach you how to think
It's not the question she expected; it's more interesting and complicated
92 hope so
(before he can speak) The English guy is good too
( ) But that's not why 'm here
need a woman who looks like me
Someone who can handle herself: an off-duty cop or something

That's awful short notice; don't know if  can - What
thought Jupiter was like all-powerful, king of the Gods
Oh yeah
One more thing
At some point
not right now 'cause it'd be phony
need you to acknowledge that 'm your kid
She walks away
He stares after her
Hint of a smile comes to his face
: Slim is signing the credit card slip as the  puts the merchandise in a distinctive red bag - You sure this'll work
You bet your life
Thanks,  will

as she goes: She walks up the street, punches in a number

Yes

Could you please tell Mrs
Tyler that 'll call her around f our this afternoon
' Of course, Miss Slim
My pleasure
Slim hangs up, goes into a
bagel shop
Slim sits at a table with a cup of coffee
short guy, 28, built like a fireplug, dressed in sweater and jeans and wool cap, enters, walks to her, and says in an English accent: Today, hon, you graduate
: Alex and Slim are across the street from a strip joint
It's closed
Till six, eh
And 'd guess whoever owns it isn't a very nice person
That's a safe one
Slim starts walking toward the shop
As they go: Why here
You've got soft hands, you've worked hard
The tricky part now is nerves
They reach the entryway; Slim takes out her tools
94 People on the street
Yeah
And you have to go in when his alarm's turned off - () Meaning he's inside
(has tools out) 'm ready
Alex moves slightly to block the view as Slim bends over and slips her tool into the lock
Slim working quietly, concentrating
Alex looking
around
noticing them
Hesitating
Coming over
We got company, doll
Slim still working
The Shady Character has almost reached them
Forget it
You're too slow
She opens the door - Alex glances down, nods - She closes the door again and stands just as: Hey
What're you guys up to
Slim stares at him
We were hoping to see some action, but it looks like they're closed
The Shady Character stares back
He is ve skeptical
He watches Slim and Alex walk off down the block
Alex mutters under his breath: 95 "Action

Her hair is done; now she's getting a manicure

Why is this call different
You were always worried about how long we talked - was out in the country, Mrs
'm in a big city now, meeting with my lawyer, so there're lots of cell phones

Stops outside for one moment, glances around - Sees a guy in a   across the street
She walks hurriedly away
Glances over her shoulder, sees Trenchcoat following her
She smiles slightly, to herself
: '
From a discreet distance, across the street, we watch her go into her hotel

As Slim walks over, Tova pulls on a wig which matches Slim's haircut
There is now a strong resemblance

Slim stares
Tova's voice is an octave lower than Slim's
Say something else
was a cop
got shot, took the benefits
Slim thinks about Tova's voice
Takes out her cell phone
They have to think 'm still here, so use my cell phone, tomorrow, to call my dad
Autodial 2
Slim presses the autodial number, then , and motions for Tova to put on Slim's gray coat
It fits Tova perfectly
(
) (lowering his voice) Hey, it's me
' What happened to your voice
; you okay
don't know, 'm getting some bronchial thing
' Otherwise everything's okay
Yeah
97 ' Get some rest, huh

) Wish me luck, huh
Good luck
Luck has nothing to do with it
Tova smiles
Slim waiting as the Service Elevator arrives
Gets in
Slim going out the door, down the alley
98 Slim getting on the plane to Los Angeles
: Slim parks, looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts
She takes a duffle from the back seat
Steps into the shadows, stares at the warehouse: Brick building, modern door and light fixtures
She looks both ways: The street's dark
Deserted
She hoists her duffle, takes a deep breath
And crosses the street
Goes up the stairs to the stoop
Looks at the alarm panel on the door: green
Crouches, starts to work on the lock
/
Mitch in bed, sleeping
Peaceful
, Off
He stirs slightly
He sits up
Frowning
dazed
Cocks his head
Listens
The  seems to have texture
He gets up
99 We glimpse: a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside into an open, loft-like space filled with bird'seye maple, metal beams, etc
Modern, glistening, expensive
He walks around the place in the dark
In his boxer shorts and t-shirt
He looks vulnerable
'
From one corner
Observing him
She has become the stalker
, watching
He decides everything's okay and goes back to the semi partitioned sleeping area
He gets back into bed - next to a   , 22
She turns over, mutters something, goes back to sleep
He lies there, eyes open
Stays very still
Listening
: Bright light
Mitch in his bathrobe making coffee
The Young Blond Woman comes out, fully dressed
Coffee
gotta get home, change for work
He nods, gives her a perfunctory kiss: 'll call you
She stares at him a second
You want my number
Sure
She sees how "eager" he is to talk to her again
Irritated, she scribbles the number quickly, hands
it to him - Thanks for everything
100 For the sex, in other words
She gives it right back to him: You too
really appreciate it
He's too self-centered to notice her ironic tone
She lets herself out
The instant she does, we go to a   looking down at Mitch
Alternate  and   during: Mitch pours coffee, goes back into his "dressing area" and pulls on some clothes as he talks into his cell phone: Janie
Hey
() Yeah,  was working late
() No, tonight's no good either
've got a morning flight to San Francisco
Slim in therafters, listening
(
) If it was pleasure, you'd be going too
No, 'm going down to get my daughter
Slim's reaction to this
(
) Sure, the custody hearing's here next week, but it looks like Gracie's being brought to San Francisco and my ex-wife
well, seems like she completely vanished
His words echo his threats when he was trying to strangle her in her hallway
(
) Right off the face of the earth
doubt they'll ever find her this time
Slim's jaw tightens
When we come back to Mitch, he's dressed and packing his briefcase
101 (
) Yeah,  want her to meet you
We'll call when we get in
( :) You too
He hangs up, takes a sip of coffee
looking down on Mitch as he heads out the door
Slim waits in the rafters until the alarm system beeps: it's armed
She climbs down, walks into the kitchen
Notices his Mr
Coffee machine is still on
Hesitates, turns it off
Opens the fridge to find something to eat - The alarm beeps again
Slim drops silently to the floor
of the     - Slim scuttles away as we hear: coming toward her
She slips around the edge of the counter just as: Mitch enters the kitchen
He goes to the Mr
Coffee
Looks at it
Frowns
Didn't he leave it on
Slim in the foreground, crouched down, Mitch 15 feet away
He looks around
Is something wrong
Is someone here
Slim frozen, trying not to breath
Mitch listening
Wondering: should he search the place
She looks for a place to hide - He looks at his watch
He's late
He walks right toward Slim, curls around the counter - But she's not there any longer
He heads for the front door - 102 Goes out
the hall, where she was, where he walked
The alarm beeps again as he resets it
One silent beat, then Slim rises in the kitchen
(She did a 360
) She sighs
Pours herself some coffee, replaces the liquid with water
Auto-dials her cell phone
'm in
' Hey
Can you stay off the phone
' For you, honey
(Anything
) hope so
She hangs up
Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out tools, equipment, etc
Picks up a screwdriver and starts searching the apartment, checking the phone line, following it to the place where it enters the apartment
of Slim' a face: a running tab on her emotions
Intensity, focus, determination, fear,
and, as the sequence builds: concern about what she doing
: She disconnects the phone line
Finds the electrical box, opens it, finds the main switch
Removes all the knives from the kitchen
hides them
Walks the apartment-familiarizing herself with every inch of it-occasionally she moves a piece of furniture slightly
we realize: she's assessing fighting spaces
angles
She looks from one piece of furniture to another, back and forth, gauging the distance between them
She eats a snack from his refrigerator
103 Looks out the back (bedroom) window
and sees the water of the San Pedro harbor below her
Uses a metal detector to search the apartment: in a drawer of the night table beside his bed, she finds a pistol
Removes it
There are papers in the same drawer, notes or something
She throws these in the trash
She takes out three letters
As the  sweeps over one of them, we hear her voice: (
0
) "
thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie
And 'm glad you're willing to admit your temper, and - let's not mince words - the physical abuse you subjected me to
" And glances at  : (
0
) "Perhaps with your new attitude, we can really work something out
Per your last letter, 'll see you the evening of
" She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was
They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open
She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search
The machine beeps insistently around his desk
She can't find anything
Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the drawers: a second gun is in there
With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights
She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper
Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie
Rips it up
Puts the metal detector back in the duffle
Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants
Takes the distinctive red bag (from the electronics store) out of the duffle
There's a machine inside
She plugs it in, tucks it behind the couch
Puts her cell phone beside it
104 She makes one last check: every wall, surface, every drawer
Barefoot, she begins to glide around the space
Backing up
Moving with ease and grace, sliding deftly to the side as she approaches a couch, desk, chair
She's building on her earlier reconnaissance: learning where the furniture is and how to navigate around it
: Light fading toward darkness
She's still moving backward, only now her sliding is smooth, graceful; almost a dance
As if hearing a distant signal, she slows to a stop
For a long moment she stands perfectly still
Poised
Like an animal in the forest
There's a chair facing the front door
She glances at it
No
She walks behind the couch, turns off the machine, picks up her cell phone and auto-dials
' Hey
Slim says nothing
'  (
) You okay
() Say it again
' Say what
You know
What you told me
Beat
On Slim's face as: ' Oh
You have a divine animal right to protect your own life and the life of your offspring
Silence
105 Yeah
She hangs up, turns the machine back on and stashes her cell phone
With simple ease, she lowers herself onto the chair
Facing the door
Waiting in the fading light
: Mitch walks down the street
Up the steps, punches in his alarm code
'
Mitch enters, closes and locks the door
Turns on the light
He walks back to the rear of the space, hangs up his coat
Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket
The lights go out
Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness
He looks out the window, sees: The neighboring buildings still have light and power
He cocks his head, listening
Silence
Walks to the door of the bedroom area
Waits
Take two more steps - ' It's me
He nods slowly
Yeah
( thought so
) 106 He moves quietly to the bed
to the night table where Slim found the pistol
Covers this by talking: {
} This morning too
' You always did forget to turn off the coffee
He rummages in the drawer
We hear the  of the letters Slim put there
He fails to find the gun
Gives up trying to be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor - '  {
} found it, Mitch
His hand leaves the drawer
He thinks
Picks up the phone, listens
Dead
Looks around
can't see her
Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes out his cell phone
We see the  of its dial
He punches 911 and pressed
The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on
He stares at it
Tries again
911,
Again it goes dead
' It's a machine
Knocks out cell phones
He throws the cell phone onto the bed
Walks out of the bedroom area
Looks around the vast space
Spooky
Slanting light and dense shadow
He doesn't see her
107 Walks toward his desk
' found that gun too
He stops
Doesn't know where to go
or what to do
' Scared
( ) Of what
' Now is when you decide, Mitch
(off his silence) Whether you're a coward
If you are, you can run
won't stop you
(meaning the match is unfair:) You have my guns
' Threw 'em away
Then someone's here with you
' No
() You're alone
' Why not
'Cause it'd be stupid
Silence is her answer
(
) You're sayin' this is man to man
' Woman, Mitch
108 That's what  meant: man against woman - you sure that's fair
The lights go back on
Slowly Slim comes out from hiding
Fair to whom
As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area between two couches
She has no weapon
She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms just slightly raised
Compared to him: she's tiny
He moves toward her
This is what you wanted, right
What you were going to San Francisco for: the chance to get me alone
He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses
He begins to stalk her
And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in the way she was practicing
don't understand, Slim
How does this work for you
She ignores his words
Watches his eyes and his chest
Wants to know where he's going to attack
(
) mean: this is carefully thought out, right
She does not respond
He throws three punches
None of them hits her
He's unfazed, keeps stalking
109 (
) But say you succeed - beat me up or whatever
You're not going to murder me
(
) Her expression remains neutral, focused
He takes this to be agreement
(
) So all you've done is further piss me off
Self defense is not ,murder
This stops him cold
He lowers his hands a moment
Stares at her, trying to assimilate this new information
You don't have the guts
She just looks at him
He blinks, worried for an instant
Covers it with a smile: It's not self-defense when you break in here and attack me
So far you're attacking me
He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in - She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps over the couch to avoid being hit
He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good, and she's waiting for him as he stumbles - With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose
He goes down
Stays there
For the first time it occurs to him: this might not be easy
He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood
You see
'm just defending myself
He resumes stalking her
Only he's angry now, and it's scary
110 If you fail, you can count on this: you'll never see Gracie again
She reacts - He sees it, rushes her - Punching as he goes
From the standpoint of pure physics, he makes a terrifying force
Until: She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs
the brick wall - He hits it, bounces off
Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face
He stares at her
breathing hard
trying to put it together: You really (think)
you think you'll kill me and get away with it
l told you
Self-defense
came here, as arranged in our letters, to talk about Gracie - Letters
There are no - In the drawer where your pistol was
You just left prints all over them
He stares at her, stunned in every way
Touches his forehead, feels the blood
You attacked me,  fought back
And of course if you never touch me
( ) 'll have to give myself bruises
He goes berserk
Leaps at her, covering ground quickly with his long stride, swinging his massive arms
This is the most terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one
If he should hit her even once, a glancing blow, she will go down, she will break, it will be over
But he misses, and misses again
Sometimes his punches are wild, almost comical
Others come so close we hear-the wind, feel their power, feel his sweat on her
this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction for as long as it will hold
At every instant, we fear for her bones and her life
Sometimes she leans back like Muhammad Ali to barely slip a punch, and we see terror on her face, married to determination
She knows the score
and the odds
Finally, in frustration at so many misses, he grabs an ashtray, hurls
it at her - it flies over her head - He punches again and again, wildly
She remains untouched
He stops
With all the blood, he looks like a wild animal
He makes a great effort to pull himself together
This doesn't bother me, Slim
don't care how long it takes
We both know: Ionly have to hit you once
Once, and it's over
She laughs at him
This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can stand
He rushes at her again, fast - She starts left - He blocks her way - She starts right - Again he's blocking her - She lunges to the left, through a narrow space - He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and a third time
We feel the awesome power behind these blows
She's in the clear again
Smiles casually
Clearly part of her strategy is to keep him angry: 112 'm confused, Mitchy
Aren't you a man
( ) thought it was "no contest
" mean, can't you hit me even once
He grabs a lamp, yanks out the cord, wields it like a club
(
) () weapon
He smashes the lamp down, just missing her head - (
) It's a martial-arts cliche, honey
weapon throws you off balance - - - - He misses her three times, the last time smashing the lamp into the wall so hard that the impact hurts his hand
He yelps - (
) You see
He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand - And she truly attacks for the first time
Smashes her fist against his head - He flies back, bounces vs
the wall
As he comes off it, she punches him again - He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed - She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed - Right into the opposite wall
The top of his head hits the wall
He shudders like someone in a cartoon: a spasm running head to - He drops
113 Face down
Does not move
At all
She stares at him
Goes to him
Wary
Gives him a reflex test - No reaction
He's unconscious
She tests his neck for a pulse
Apparently he's still alive, because she raises her hand over her head
Her palm vertical, like a knife
She's about to deliver a karate chop
To his neck
it will break his neck
It will kill him
Her hand stays there, poised
: - Mitch hitting her the first time - - Midwest house, Mitch leaping out from Gracie's doorway - - Mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of their house
(Something we didn't see before
) She reaches up, flicks the light switch; Mitch jumps on her back - - Mitch: "You'll never see Gracie again
" - Earlier: "She's My daughter
Don't even think about taking her
" - Strangling Slim, whispering: "
where you're going, they will never
ever
find you
" 114 Face contorted in rage, confusion - She brings her hand down - Misses
him
Intentionally
Turns away, tears in her eyes
She retrieves her cell phone, turns off the cell-phone blocker, presses redial
Stares out the window
We see the turmoil on her face, hear it in her voice: can't, Gin
' 'Re you okay
Yeah
' You're okay
, you beat him
- ' It worked
Listen to me
did it, but  can't do it
can't kill him
Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur
'  (
) () Slim
He'll come after you - know - '  (
) He'll come after Gracie - 115 An indistinct shape, something rising over her head
know all that
have to, but  can't
'm not a killer
'm not him
Mitch
Crazed and bloody face
In his hand: the wooden lamp
She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side - - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull
Still sends her crashing to the floor
Now she does not move
He stands over her
Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but triumphant
' Hello
Slim
You there
The lamp moving in his hand
He's rotating it
simple menacing image
and we realize: he' s aoinq to hit her again
'  {
} Should  call the cops
Answer me
He's distracted by Ginny's voice
Picks up the phone
Listen to me, bitch
Ginny's silent
(
) if you value your children, don' t call anybody
It's over, okay
It's all over
He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim, lamp clenched tight in his fist
We're almost inside her head as we hear: ' Hold onto my voice
116 Is that the hint of a smile on her face
'  (
) You're ready
Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it - Rage
He pulls his foot back to kick her - Her eyes are open, just a slit - His foot swinging forward
As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it - He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her - But she's already rolling, out from under him
and up - Coming to her feet - He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug
She's ready
Her face alert
Center of gravity low
Arm low,
fist low
As her motion unfurls: Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly executed, is the most difficult, powerful, and beautiful of punches
Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of- gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin - as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely
Mitch flies backward
There's a table behind him
His head cracks on the table
His neck snaps
He lands on the floor: twisted, broken
Slim stares at him
There's no way a living man could assume the position now occupied by her former husband
117 She stares in disbelief
Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery
Her face registers what she feels
Horror, relief
She walks slowly to her cell phone, picks it up
Listens: no one there
She presses redial, waits
' (in a panic) o
d Hi
' Oh thank God you're alive
Gin, he's
he hit his
he's not breathing
' oh
Yeah
' Well:  called the cops, they're on their way
Slim nods
' Slim
can you hear me
, this is important
Beat
Okay
As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building
' You're not him, okay
You're not him, and you never will be
118 See you soon
She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water
Then the duffle
They both sink
She comes out, sits on the steps
siren is audible
Cop cars speed down the street, screech to a stop
, run toward her
You okay
She looks at him, considering the question
Shakes her head
Where is he
She makes a slight motion to indicate that Mitch is inside, and the   runs into the apartment
Slim lowers her head
First Cop looks at her, sees the blood on her scalp
Looks like you're one of the lucky ones
She looks up, stares at him, and starts to cry
: : Slim jumping up and down and generally making a fool of herself as Gracie runs off the plane into her arms
Ginny follows with her own kids; hugs all around - : 119 Slim looking
waiting
seeing: Joe
He hurries to her - and picks up Gracie instead, gives Gracie a big hug
Joe lingers in the hug as Slim waits
and waits
Finally he turns to Slim, hint of a smile: What rules are we playing by now
She answers him with the kind of kiss you can get away with at a bar or airport and almost nowhere else
: Jupiter comes off the plane, is hugged by Ginny, shakes hands with Joe
As he turns to Gracie, Slim says: This time be nice to her
Is it gonna be like that
Yeah
Jupiter smiles, shakes hands with Gracie: hope  can work into being your grandfather, okay
Gracie shrugs
: ""
all over:    BOMBING1
Slim, Joe, Jupiter, and Gracie eating, Ginny serving large platters of gorgeous food: 120 So whattaya say, Slim-girl, you comin' back to work
(passing by, overhears and :) After all  do for her
She better not
Ginny gives him a look - She has to go back to school, make big success
Sigmund Freud, yes
( ) Don't worry, Mr
Moneybags will pay
Jupiter gives Phil a playful look: thanks a lot
Phil whispers to Gracie: But don't let her cook, huh Gracie
You eat here all the time
Gracie nods thanks, whispers back: Call me Queen Elizabeth
The longer it runs, the happier this odd family (including Ginny and Phil) seems
