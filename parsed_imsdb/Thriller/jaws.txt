"   " : "" by Carl Gottlieb and Peter Benchley From the novel by Peter Benchley Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward
Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture
It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undersea world at night
a symphony of underwater sounds: landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that certain undersea species share with each other
Also, the hint of familiar music, twisted and distorted by the depths
: ' , It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June
We see a long straight stretch of white beach
Behind the low dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses
Hear a number of voices singing
It sounds like an eastern university's alma mater, no longer distorted
Around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum types
The group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing eastern Ivy League anthems - Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard, Penn, etc
Two young people break away from the others
They are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie
Behind them, there is considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more serious
Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from behind
She squirms playfully out of his grasp
We discover he's not especially sober
Hey
Hey hey
'm with you, right
Tom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is plodding along in the sand, winded
Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, leaving Tom reeling atop the dune
As she runs, she is shedding her clothes
Tom is trying to trail her by her clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods
But Chrissie is way ahead of him
'mon
She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly into the water with a light "Whoops
" as the cold water sweeps over her
Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery chorus of alma maters
Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that passes her a dozen feet away
pressure wave lifts her up, then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell
Tommy
Don't dunk me
She looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his ankles
She starts to swim back in to him
Her expression freezes
The water-bulge is racing towards her
The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to her hips
She reaches under water to touch her leg
Whatever she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking off any scream she might try to make
Another jolt to her body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the surface
Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible jerking motion
on the eddies and swirls until we're sure it's all over
In his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from a tight sleeve
As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the background, from the fire
-  - shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the heads of the sleeping couple on the bed
It catches Martin Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep
The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on with local fisherman's report and weather
(
) Hayes Landing reports conditions good, with stripers and jacks
The Coast Guard has no storm warning from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; a light chop with freshening winds, continued clear and mild
(etc
) Ellen Brody burrows her head under the covers, avoiding morning for a few precious minutes more
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn
This is summer
Feed the dogs
We hear the scampering toenails of two cocker spaniels scrabbling around the foot of the bed
Brody swings out of bed, wearing shorts, socks, and tee shirt
Right
Do you see the kids
Probably out in the back yard
In Amity, you say 'Yahd
' (she gives it the Boston sound) The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah
How's that sound
Like you're from 'Yawk
(gives it Brooklyn sound) Give me 30 years, 'll get it
He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen
- Brody enters, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, starts to fill kettle to boil water, the cold water rushes through and out the burnt-out bottom of the kettle
Did you burn another kettle
'know you're a fire hazard
This is the third one
(
) never hear the whistle
Feed the dogs
Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, enters from upstairs
She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call an "Instant-On" person
Mornings are not her best time
You want to go through those
(she indicates bag of clothes) 'm taking them to the Thrift Shop
It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity
Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes
(looking through bag, remembering) used to wear this to the Garden
Garbage strikes
Dog shit
Muggers
(he puts it all behind) Ship it
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them
Before Brody can answer, Michael, his oldest boy, enters, holding his hand
There is bright new blood on it, but he is sensibly unconcerned
It's a normal childhood scrape
Cut my hand
Hit by a vampire
On the swing
told you not to play near there until  sanded it down
(to Ellen) See what your son did
Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band- aid
Michael goes on out and upstairs
Ellen fumbles in her pocket and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to him
Don't forget these
Oh, yeah
(he puts them on) How do  look
Older, huh
think they make you look sexy
Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly
Then more seriously
Sexy, hm
What was  before
Older, sillier
(as he goes to make coffee, he fumbles with the new glasses) don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes
He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovering some new wonder in the fresh sunlit morning
' Sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer air, enjoying the very air he breathes
Let's see
The phone rings
Brody answers one of two phones on the wall
Brody
yeah, what's up
mmm
Well, what do they usually do, float or wash up
Really
okay, 'll meet both of you at the beach in (checks watch) 20 minutes, okay
Okay
(hangs up) First goddamn weekend of the summer
Michael reenters in bathing trunks, with a towel on his shoulder, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready for application
Ellen takes it, and bandages the finger with care and affection
There
(to Brody) What was that
Michael heads toward the beach
(struggling to get his shirt on over his glasses) The office
He gets his shirt on with Ellen's help
She flicks imaginary dust from the badge on his chest
Be careful
Here
You gotta be kiddin'
He gives her a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup
Love ya
(kissing him back) Hey Chief
Bring my cup back
At the door, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on out
We can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a van parked outside
- Martin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past, taking the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer day in Amity
beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, languishing in a Solarcaine sun
is written above her flailing arms
- Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach
The surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn about from the receding tide
Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred yards down wind
Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in last night, walk down the beach
Brody fingers the missing girl's shoes, purse and clothes
In the daylight, Cassidy misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and tear-blown adolescence
Christine what
Worthingsly
Worthington -- no one ever died on me before
You picked her up on the ferry
didn't know her
And nobody else saw her in the water
Somebody could've --  was sort of passed out
Think she might've run out on you
Oh, no, sir
've never had a woman do that
'm sure she drowned
You from around here
No
Cambridge
Harvard
My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though
You here for the summer
Some friends and me took a house
(genuinely curious) What d'you pay for a place just for the summer
thousand apiece, something like that
There's five of us
And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that
Pretty stiff
shrill whistle makes them turn
Hendricks is fifty yards away, on his knees
He blows again, a feeble report this time
Maybe that's your girl
Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows with: (pathetically) You can't make me look --
- skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune
The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible
Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet
Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and ventures up
Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying something at the same time
Brody nods understanding and steps up cautiously and looks down
He adjusts his glasses, trying to make sense of what he is looking at
Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique
Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the top of the dune and down its slopes
Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves him over
He shakes his head
An awkward moment
Then Cassidy shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes looking everywhere but down
Brody says something else and Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea
Brody puts his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder
Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time
He looks
He, too, can't make out what it is at first
Then he understands
The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected
He falls backward in a sitting position as though shot
Nods yes -- it's her
Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling close
Hear his breathing
He looks around, envisioning the week ahead of him
Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, horribly bitten
(: See Hooper's dialog in Sc
91 for complete description of corpse
) '  - Brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer
Polly, his sixty-one year old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand pad of messages and reminders
In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs, sipping from fizzing dixie cups
Brody dips into file drawers for the appropriate forms
He gently turns on Polly, who is behind him
If this is going to work, you've got to keep current stuff out here, and put 'closed' files in there
The 'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay
Brody slips behind his typewriter, putting paper in the machine with the effortless ease of years of practice
He's obviously no stranger to paperwork
He touch types, hardly ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one ear to Polly
He is affected by what he's seen, but there's work to be done
This is in no order of importance, Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity Town Council on Aging this Monday night, Bentoncourt Hall
The Fire Inspector wants you to go over the fireworks site with him before he catches the one o'clock ferry
Mainly, you have a batch of calls about that new Karate school
- Brody has just typed the girl's name
He skips the space for Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin information he has collected from her wallet
Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale, Tisberry's Hardware
they say it's those nine-year-olds from the school practicing karate on all those nice picket fences
The phone rings and Polly picks it up
It's the Coroner
Somebody pass away in the night
Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening, as he turns to the typewriter
Jesus, Santos
- Cause-of-Death line rolls into place
The hammers punch out: leans forward, staring at what he just wrote
Polly cocks her head and removes the phone from his ear
What's the matter
Brody takes a breath
new resolve comes over him
Polly,  want to know what water recreation is on for today
Right this minute
Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door
' Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody enters
(To Hendricks) Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs
We never had any
What's the problem
local merchant comes through the door
Glad  caught you
There's a city truck with New Hampshire plates parked right in front of my
Brody pushes past him and out the door
In the busy center of a town preparing for the big Fourth of July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activity, purpose and haste in each stride
As he turns a corner a little man in a white smock emerges from the Funeral Parlor
This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time coroner
Santos looks both ways before crossing Colonial Drive
Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward course through an odd assortment of Schwinns that line the sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence
Keisel intercepts Brody on the run
(he stares at Brody's face) Wait-a-minute
(stares some more) Glasses, right
Brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but Keisel holds on to him
Look at those fences
Little guys about eight to ten years old
And look at this
He holds up bicycle
The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken from some sort of blows
They did that with their bare hands
Call me later in the day, okay, Harry
-     - Santos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties editor of the Amity Gazette
Together they cut a beeline for the other side of the street
- Past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Hardware and Sporting Goods
so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color from the display window to the sidewalk
The store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list with a mainland delivery man
Stuff's no good to me in August when the Pilgrims come in June
(to Brody) Go on and help yourself to whatever you need, Chief
Can you work the register
- Brody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island
He starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the street in the patrol jeep
He stops fast enough to call attention, leans out the window
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there
(hands him the sign material) Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing
What's the matter with my printing
' Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other city Selectmen
They come out in a group, reach the sunlight, and squint down the street as Brody careens around the corner and out of sight
Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and crafts, passes them on the street front
What have you got there, Lenny
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor
Fatal
Gotta batten down the beach
Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news
Who've you told this to, Lenny
just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl
Avril Bay, thereabouts
Chief went to dry them off
(to Meadows) Take my car, okay
(to Hendricks) You come with us, Lenny
've got all these signs here
'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say
They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty signs on the doors
- flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that marks the official course
rowboat with Scoutmaster using a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on
(bullhorn effect) Let's go, Robbie
You too, Hofner
Boyle, keep your head up
Alberts, keep kicking
(etc
, ad lib) - Two older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards, while some Parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching their offspring
Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep, and starts toward the people
Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac pulls up and skids to a stop
In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the Doctor, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still full of sign material
Vaughn intercepts Brody, the others circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through the sand to the scouts
Martin
(he catches up with him) Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority
Do  need any more authority
Technically, you need the instruction of a civic ordinance, or a special meeting of the town selectmen
(the good guy) That's just going by the book
We're just a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here
This is your first summer
Now tell me something  don't know
All 'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island
So we should set out a smorgasbord
We're not even sure what it was
What else could've done that
(to Doctor) Boat propeller
think, possibly
sure
boating accident
Some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far, she's a little drunk, a fishing boat comes along -- Remember when Fred Ganz went scalloping in his 's
He was going to swim to New Bedford, he said
The men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this foolishness
and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net
(interrupting the merriment) Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was
was wrong
We'll have to amend the report
We never had that kind of trouble here
don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things
was only reacting to what  was told
Brody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding another buoy on the home stretch
(taking Brody aside) It's all psychological, anyway
You yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 'huh'
You yell 'Shark' and we've got a panic on our hands
think we all agree we don't need a panic this close to the 4th of July
Vaughn indicates the beach where the Scouts are flopping out onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished
can't work in a vacuum
Why don't you make Hendricks Chief
His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins
Martin, we hired the best man we could find
All ad lib agreement
We need someone who isn't prejudiced by old feuds or family ties, someone who can referee things
You have our complete support
Now then
We've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about
The others surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate choppers
Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's Cadillac
Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmers who are vigorously toweling off in the background
- In front of Amity's only Music Store, a battered old pick-up truck pulls in to the curb
Quint and his mate cross silently heading into the music store
- gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance
Inside the store, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet
He is playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy
" Quint looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a club on flesh
The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and meets Quint
Hello, Mr
Quint
Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, Okay
ordered them
(finding them under the counter) Yessir, right here
What do those fish do, eat this stuff
They choke on it
Without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter
Bye now
No answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the boy
The little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward squeaks and blurps, as Quint stares at him
Quint continues out the door, threading his way through the people in the street like some great fish
As he gets up into the cab of his pick-up, its door swings open so we can see a crude stylized shark decorating its side
It slams behind him as Quint gets in and drives away
- plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean
There's enough there to satisfy the most gluttonous shark
Buoyant, joyful, she splashes away in abandon
From her, we pan off to reveal other cheerful bathers enjoying that last uncluttered weekend before the season starts in earnest
Man and his dog are romping at the water's edge
The Man is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy retriever, is bounding into the waves after it
Girl and her Boyfriend leave their blanket and run for the water, playing tag, chasing each other, having a wonderful time
- He is sitting stiffly in a beach chair, scanning the beach with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing everything that's going on
Around their particular blanket and umbrella are a number of adults and their kids, the youngsters gathered to celebrate Michael's birthday
Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-year-olds
Michael's hand is still bandaged
(an adult) Looks like another big season
Gets worse every year
And none of them from the Island
Just a lot of bother
Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the water
He stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening out there
'    - The young lady is disappearing under the water, pulled under the waves by some force
She is shrieking
She pops right up again riding the shoulders of her boyfriend, who pulled her under
She's laughing hysterically
Brody is unamused
(to Taft) What
Present company excepted, but off- islanders are a pain in the butt
Pardon my French
Ellen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example
What about this kid
What if he were born here
That make him an islander
Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an oven, it don't make them muffins
'm not a muffin
'm a boy
Brody rumples his hair and sets him off to play
, It's Alex Kintner, and his mother, nearby, reading a novel
Alex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the water
Alex
Alex Kintner
Where do you think you're going
Water
Just once more, please
Let me see your fingers -- He holds out his hands
They're beginning to prune
10 minutes more
Alex starts for the ocean
Behind him, Michael and his gang are also heading for the inviting waves
Brody is watching them go, his spine rigid with tension
As Alex and the boys hit the water, we see the man throwing his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after it
' Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing around, out way too far, isolated from the other swimmers
-
- fish's-eye view of the bathers: lots of little kicking legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing circling, favoring one raft (little Alex's)
The Kintner boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing bizarre underwater vibrations of more than passing interest
Dog goes by, dog-paddling along
Brody is half-rising, looking out over the water
The Fat Lady is not where he remembered her
He scans the water anxiously
Do you want the boys to come in
Honey, if you're worried
Black Object swims across the water
It's the dog, breasting against the surf
- ' It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing
black object swims up to her
It's not the dog
It rears up out of the water
It's a man in a black bathing cap
They exchange distant pleasantries, he strokes away
- Alex Kintner, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting, going "vroom, vroom
" They kiss, embrace, kiss again
Strong stuff
They sink beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace
He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of birthday cake, holding it above the water, paddling with his other hand
The bandage has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the water
Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing himself to relax part way
His eyes still nervously scan the beach in a constant surveillance
Mr
Keisel is coming out of the water, toweling off vigorously, exclaiming to himself
(to Keisel) How's the water
Too cold
'm going in again Labor Day
Hope we get this weather next weekend
You're very tight, y'know
(digs in) Right there
Ow
(he sees something) He's gotta be more careful in the water
Michael has just been drenched
He splashes back
big waterfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the water, shouting battle cries and karate whoops
Alex is paddling around near them, but not involved with them
The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking for his dog
Buster
Hey, Buster
Here boy
(whistles) He continues to ad lib calling his dog, but there's no answer, no dog in the water
huge splash explodes in the water near the gang, an eruption of foam and spray that stops everyone cold for a moment
They stop to see who was responsible
() Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes
Before anyone can answer, another kid (
) renews the battle, whooping a karate cry, and slashing at the water with his hand like a little kung-fu warrior, advancing through the waves
, He hits the water, which sprays up suspiciously pink
He stares at it, surprised
His hands are dripping deep pink, the red matting his hair, running into his eyes
He looks down
The boys are surrounded with a deep pink slick, their little bodies ringed by a spreading stain of blood
, He's pointing frantically out to sea
Something in the water
Right there
Didn't anyone see it
There's blood in the water
He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking Ellen over, and starts for the water
What is it
Brody is pelting towards the water
He kicks sand over an annoyed Mrs
Kintner, who looks up, just in time to hear Brody's bellow
Michael
Sean
Out of the water
Everybody out of the water
Michael
Get out
His urgency communicates itself to the others
Ellen snatches Sean up from where he's been playing in the sand
Other parents are calling their kids, hysteria mounting
People rush into the water, dragging their children and families bodily out of the ocean
The first kids coming out of the surf are frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off their bodies
The sight of the red sends the beach into a full panic
He rushes into the water, up to his ankles, and suddenly stops, unable to move into deeper water
He is urging Michael out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through the surf towards his dad
He stands there immobilized by the water, nervously helping people out of it onto the beach
As he emerges from the water, Alex Kintner's raft washes in behind him, ripped in half, the water pink, the foam spreading the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks
Her voice rising into panic and hysteria with each unanswered cry
Alex
Alex
Alex
-       - We are looking at the closed double white front doors of the building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated conversation
After a beat, they open to reveal Mrs
Kintner, looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God; in effect, she has
Her eyes are puffy and swollen from weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, her gait is not normal
As she walks toward us, Quint enters with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs
Kintner moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doors into the town hall
- crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, their voices a babble of confusion
Many of them are gathered around a roughly lettered notice that has been posted on the town's official bulletin board
It reads
" $3000 ,  29, " Vaughn and Brody are on the outskirts of the crowd, which includes Meadows, some selectmen, and others
Look, 've got to talk to her
This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering
agree
If she's going to advertise, wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers
Amity people could take care of this
'm responsible for public safety around here
Then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt
(addressing the crowd) Everybody, could  have your attention
Since this affects all of us,  suggest we move into council chambers, where there's more room
There is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges themselves and makes their way into the Amity Selectmen's Council Chambers
- The crowd is thronging into the large room
Already in the room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear, watching everyone as they enter
Against the back wall is a large blackboard used for town business during meetings
Well, here we all are; anyone have any special questions
Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in cash or check
(laughter from all) That's private business between you brave fishermen and Mrs
Kintner
(to Brody) -- Chief -- (stepping in) 'd like to tell you what we're doing so far
These are some of the steps 've taken as Chief of Police
(leading the direction of the discussion) What's going on with the beaches, Chief
All react
'll get to that in a minute
First, plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea
'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and 've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland
(Interrupting -- sotto voice to Brody) No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin
Are you going to close the beaches
Larry and  have also decided to close the beaches for a short time
Pandemonium
collective nerve has been touched
Only 24 hours
didn't agree to that
That official business could take all summer
Maybe it's better to close
Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the point of view held forth
We should make sure there is no danger
didn't raise my kids to be some fish's lunch
The motel is all  own -- you pull the plug on this town and  go down the drain with it
Nobody's seen a shark
We'll lose business, we lose taxes, we lose our shirts
, He has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the blackboard
He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin
There is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer- whale
(after taking a deep breath) You all know me
You know what  do for a living
'll go out and get this bird for you
He's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods
This is a fish that can swallow a man whole
little shakin', a little tenderizing and down ya' go
(a look to Vaughn) You gotta get this fellow and get him quick
If you do, it'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you've got your business back on a paying basis
(beat) shark of that size is no pleasure and  value my neck at a hell of a lot more'n 3,000 bucks
(a deadly look) 'll find him for three
But 'll kill him for ten
Crowd reaction
(he rises up) The bastard is costing you more'n that every day
Do you wanna stay alive and annee up the ten or play it cheap and be on welfare next winter
(a final moment) 'm gonna kill this thing
just a matter of whether  do it now -- or at the end of summer
Thank you very much, Mr
Quint, the Selectmen will take your offer under advisement '    - riffly blur, color alternating with black and white
The dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white rendering of eight species of shark
The banner at the top of the page reads:
The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of scar tissue on six former shark victims
Riffling -- stop
Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the family Carcharodon charcharias
his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks
The door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's mood
Can you stand something to eat
Love a cup of tea
With lemon
Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window which overlooks the south bay
It is the hour of dusk
Mikey loves his birthday present
Where is he
(with a slight laugh) He's sitting in it
Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window
Honey
He has it tied up to the jetty with a double-knot
' Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school chums are in the water, swimming around it
Brody opens the window and calls down: Son
-- Out of the water now
My boat's neat, dad
(turning to Ellen) want him out of the ocean
It's three feet deep, Martin (angry now) Michael
Come inside
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey
told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday
don't believe he'll ever do it again
told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself
Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream," showing a black fisherman in a small dinghy similar to Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating sharks, circling his boat
You heard your father
Out right now
Hendricks and another deputy are assisting Brody
Silhouettes of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral
In the background some workmen are taking down the shutters from a quaint summer cottage
They pause to watch the declining moments of the day
Three Selectmen also stand watching
One of them seems to be whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby dune
Sounds: Surf and hammering
: - Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Charlie, a professional angler, row towards a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty feet out into the black water
You wanna call it a night after here
It's only two-thirty
What, are you tired
Yeah, Charlie,  got my second wind three nibbles back
Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog chain and a large patched inner tube
Charlie takes out a monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the rickety pier that is only about five feet across
(reaching into the bag) Leg of lamb this time
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin
(a hyena laugh) We're blowin' half the bounty on bait -- The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the end and start to work
Charlie baits the hook with a massive chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of chain to a skinny piling
Charlie then fastens the inner tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook
One more after this, then 'm going home
Set
Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it is
Charlie heaves the bait
Splash
The inner tube follows and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain playing out from the wheelbarrow
Tide's taking it right out
Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling
He turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a fractured board
Denherder paces, bored to death
You do this all the time, right, Charlie
Twenty years
can't believe that people pay money to go fishing
This is really dumb
This isn't even relaxing
it's just boring
- Suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men straighten
Denherder is goggle-eyed
Hey
What's this
The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty
section of chain tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into the air
Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under
Look at him take it
Do  set the goddam hook
Let him do it
Go-go-go-go-go
It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow pilings
- lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings  with a resounding
- The end of the jetty is yanked loose
Denherder is flipped like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber
' The severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards, is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top of it, his lit pipe still going
Charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the flotilla of wood draw away
- looking seaward
' The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back in his direction
Holy Jesus Christ
Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out of the water
Get the hell out
Charlie
Swim
Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore
The jetty is getting closer
Suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes for Charlie
Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his balance on his way to help Charlie
Charlie has reached the last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold
But -- - ' The algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back
That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky and Charlie manages, with Denherder's desperate help, to make it safely to shore
The remains of the pier float belly- up in the inlet
- He is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a bowl of Cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes
The Amity Pier area is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cars elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islanders, off-islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an unarmed shark of indeterminate size
Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons, shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has been cannibalized to equip this weird array
Not having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion
So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat
That wasn't funny
Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of recognition, or an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," or "Hey, Lenny
" Mrs
Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer
- An argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the Boat Rental Man
-- You're charging me double the usual rent
didn't come up here all the way from New Rochelle to be gouged by some Yankee Cracker
Prices go up June First every year
You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, you go down to the Hamptons
(he sees Brody) Right, Chief
Making its way through the channel towards the dock is a sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm" on the stern
It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as it coasts in towards the dock area
Some other boats clear the way for it, zig-zagging in the harbor, causing an annoying chop
Matt Hooper, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent look, is maneuvering the vessel peering through his windscreen at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around him
Hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody sees something that makes him move towards the other side of the dock
We see him cross to a little boat built for two or three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man climbs in with his gear
Hey
You know how many men that's supposed to hold
() Whatever's safe, right
What you got ain't safe
You take some guys off or you don't go out
, Matt Hooper is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him a line to help make fast as he moors
It's a small island of courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob
Hooper nods politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock
Hello
Hello, back
He's standing near where Brody is finishing after his encounter with the chummers
Brody approaches Ben Gardner
You going out too, Ben
Might give it a try
That three thousand bounty beats working for a living
(yells to his Mate) We ready
The Mate nods "Yes" and starts to prepare to get under way
Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towards the channel and the open sea leaving Felix and Pratt to scamper around the dock looking for another ride
, particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a couple of powerboats
The sailboat is trying to hoist sail to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's conceit, since Hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate through this mess
Brody, a landlubber for sure, is trying to direct traffic to untangle this new mess
Just back up
No, the other way
Cut it to your left
Your other left
The big boat, your front end is out way too far
Little boat, stay still
Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled crews
1 ( ) Dammit, a vessel under sail has the right of way
2 () You schmuck, you ain't under sail, you're goddam drifting
(stepping in to help) Ahoy, sail
You got an oar
Well, scull it out
Tell that stinkpotter to belay
Tell that ragsetter 'm going to poke him in the snoot
Just cast off in turn and make for the channel,
Thanks
Brody starts back towards the shore, Hooper is by his side
Excuse me,  wonder if you could tell me
Before he can finish, Brody spots something on shore that moves him to shout to his deputy
(noticing something) Is that dynamite
Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off
He holds out his hand
If that's dynamite, give it here, or don't leave port
Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks
Sharks like fireworks, it attracts them
Hand it over
The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks
Brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down the pier
Hooper is still with him
All around them are two distinctly different breeds; the quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly tourist clothing
- Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get Hendricks' attention
He throws a handful of washers at the window
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater
You're tellin' me
swear, this town has gone crazy
Officer,  wonder if you could tell me where  could find Chief Brody
Who are you
Hooper, Matt Hooper
From the Oceanographic Institute
(holds out his hand) -  - Ben Gardner's boat is in the lead with Gardner's shouting derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land
The armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen boats in all
One man heaves cherry bombs into the water smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup
speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading instructions aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast, Vol
" boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net overboard, full of gaps and split ends
The professionals look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 make it impossible for everybody
Collisions are barely averted
The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and death struggle, his rod in a tight arc
His buddy leaps across to lend a hand
Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues
This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop fishermen
Shouts of '
Then a tangle of tackle springs from the water
They have hooked each other
Joy turns to swearing
Arnold Felix stands up to applaud the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it were a clay pigeon
The tangle explodes -- Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over backward -- - ' Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast arc
few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty tail threshing
One man is screaming success, the other two slapping the angler on the back
- They spot it and sour
Well, get over there
He ain't caught it yet
The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes a
45 automatic from the holster of his belt
He tests it, firing once in the air
As they near the scene of the struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until -- ' Everyone wants to get into the act
They are attacking the threshing beast with all they've got
Pratt uses his automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun
There are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck from time to time as bullets skip by
Finally, the shark stops threshing
Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's
(exultant) Hand me that pole
Quick
One of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and leans out to grab the moribund shark
But Harry won't give up the line, still reeling in
Beat it
hooked him
How's the family, Harry
(to the man with gaff) Go on and do it
We split down the middle
Pratt nods reluctantly
The man swings, lodges the gaff and hauls the shark up onto the gunwale
paroxysm of cheers from the surrounding boats
Smoke flares are fired into the air
(a tug-of-war) Let go my shark
It is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices
But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to capsize the boat
Pratt panics and fires six times with his 45
The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water rises
Everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them
- The Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victorian house that normally serves as the community's mortuary
The Coroner, a professional small-town , is standing by as Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement with a calibrator or calipers
Let's show Mr
Hooper our accident
With a shrug, the Coroner slides open the drawer
He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matter- of-fact, turning on his recorder
Victim One, identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian
The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stares down at the lump on the slab
He stops, turns off his recorder as emotions wage war with his senses
Rationality wins, and he turns on the recorder again
height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains
Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining
May have a drink of water
Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature
Portions of denuded bone remaining
(tense, to Brody) -- did you notify the coast guard
No, it was local jurisdiction
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact
(to Brody) Please don't smoke
With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions
Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas
Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters
(to Brody again) -- Did you go out in a boat and look around
No, we just checked the beach
(turns off the recorder) It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper
It was a shark
It was a shark
- We open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood and gore
As the shark is hoisted up into the air on a gin- pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his secretary and a photographer from the Amity Gazette
crowd of returning fishermen from the Armada and townspeople are gathering around the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the classic sports fisherman's trophy shot
Ginny, get this out on the state wire to  and  in Boston and New York
Have one of them pick it up for the national and call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him this is from me and he owes me one
let's get a picture
As he and the photographer turn to mob, we see Hooper and Brody arriving from the morgue
Hooper immediately heads towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look of relief and delight cross his features
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then  guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck
(crossing to men around shark) You did it
Did Ben Gardner catch this
Men ad lib "No,  caught it
" " hooked him," etc
Okay, everybody,  want to get a picture for the paper -- could everyone clear out of the way
He continues to call directions and move people out of the way to set up his shot
Hooper is measuring the shark
Could you get out of the shot, young man
Who, me
Okay
(he drifts off) The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the shot
The whole town and the Armada fishermen all line up in a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the victorious fishermen kneeling in front, and the rest of the Armada and Townspeople arranged behind them
Hendricks hold up the "Beach Closed" sign in ironic victory
Brody spots the Mayor coming towards the dock, and detaches himself from the group to join him
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything
But they got him
That's good
That's real good
Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper
Sure he is
The men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster, debating something with Hooper, who is dwarfed by the big beer bellies and ham-fisted hands all around him
It's probable we don't even see him
The Men ad lib "What kind of shark is this
" "It's a shark like in the movies they got sharks
" "It's a man-eater, for sure
" " bet it's a record-breaker," etc
(
) It's a tiger shark
Very rare in these waters, and definitely a maneater
Hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off, measuring the shark's teeth
Others watch him
Charlie and Denherder walk over to the shark
Charlie punches it
They are walking down to the shark together
Who's that young man
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute
(speaking to everyone) think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster
Brody and Vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen, who are surrounding Hooper, raising their voices at him
Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius
' What's that
Teeth are teeth, right
didn't say this wasn't the shark, just said  wasn't sure this was the one
What d'ya mean
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips
any one of them could've attacked
Look -- shark digestion is slow
We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside
That's disgusting
This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside
Why not, Larry
We could get a positive confirmation that way
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish
Ben
(to Meadows) do you have all the pictures you need
Plenty
Wait a minute
Felix, Pratt and the others ad lib disagreement
"You're not gonna cut up my trophy," etc
(seeing something offstage, with low intensity) am not going to stand here and watch this fish cut open and see some kid fall out on the dock
Besides
(he indicates off) We see Mrs
Kintner approaching, dressed in black
(to Brody) Chief, 'll take responsibility for this
Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch down before he stinks up the whole island
Harve, tomorrow you and Carl take him out and dump him right in the drink
She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him
Chief Brody
He nods, she slaps him full across the face
There is an embarrassed silence
Some people leave, following a trend that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark
My Alex was a beautiful little boy and you killed him
Did you know that
You knew there was a shark out there
You knew a girl got killed here last week
just found that out
But you knew
You knew it was dangerous, but you let people go swimming anyway
You knew all those things, and still my boy is dead now and there's nothing you can do about that
My boy is dead
wanted you to know that
She stops, unable to continue
Her father takes her arm and leads her away
Pratt, Harry and the others trail off after her
During the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on Brody to the exclusion of the others
'm sorry, Martin
She's in a sick, terrible state
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but 'm not sure
Before Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he goes slack
(almost to himself) She's right
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks
'm going home
He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Vaughn and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration
-  - Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinner
Brody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf
His glass, on the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff scotch and ice
He is staring across the table at the youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him
He makes a face back
They play this game together for a few minutes
'mere and give Daddy a kiss
Why
Because he needs it
Sean gives Daddy the kiss
Brody shoos him and Michael off to bed
Ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few dishes
Brody is not letting her into his world for the moment, and it shows
There's a knock at the door
(
) Martin Brody residence
Ellen opens the door for him
Hi
'm Matt Hooper
If your husband is here, 'd like to talk to him
So would
Come on in
Hooper enters
He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine which he picked up in town
He sits down near Brody
Would you like something
Some coffee
(seeing Brody's plate) Is anyone having this
He starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go ahead
" Dynamite
(to Brody) How was your day
Swell
They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly desperate, but shared laughter
(producing wine) Here
one red, one white
They laugh some more
Ellen is again left out of it
(boning his fish) Ummm
Really good
Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a corkscrew, etc
My husband tells me you're in sharks
wouldn't put it that way
But love sharks
You love sharks
do
(he tells a story about his boyhood and a shark) But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere
How come you have to tell them that
Excuse me, but what are you talking about
Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon
It was on the Cape station news
They caught a shark, not the shark
Big difference
could've proved it this afternoon, by cutting that one open and examining his stomach contents
Also, his bite was too small
Brody has the cork out of the wine
Pop
was lucky to find that in town -- it's an estate bottled vintage year
Brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, and the wine
(as Brody pours) We ought to let it breathe
Whatever
Let's all have a drink
He extends the bottle to Hooper, who politely accepts a token sip
He takes some for himself, and offers some to Ellen
You too, sweetheart
Thank you
(toasting) Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island
Day after tomorrow, 'll be gone, and he'll be the only one
You're leaving
Going out on the 'Aurora
' Is that a boat
Is it
The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark
around the world in 18 months
Like those Cousteau specials on television
think it's for the kids, but  love them
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding
saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle
Mikey loved it
Made me promise to get him one
Will you live on the boat
Yep
Martin hates boats
Hates the water
On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over
He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it
Drowning
Lemme ask you something
Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach
Yeah
Like the kid on your beach
wish  could've examined that shark they caught
Something else
Do most attacks go unreported
About half of them
lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh
Rogue
Yeah
Rogue
Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts
It's called Territoriality
It's a theory
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing
You could say that
Brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has gleaned in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species
There is a long pause
Why don't we have one more drink, you and , and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not
Can you do that
am Chief of Police
can do anything  want
(to Hooper) You want to come
'm flattered you should ask
He gets up and they both start out
Ellen watches them go
- Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding
At one end, the large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a tarp
single dark figure is bending over the dead shark
The large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open, and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark
The new entrants move into the shed
It is Hooper and Brody and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on the way over
As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize him as he backs against the wall
And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and  was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders
So we broke up and  went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence
What stinks so bad
Our friend, the shark
They bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers
We always had a summer place on the water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so figured 'd major in something knew about
Oceanography, marine biology
It was that, or design racing yachts like my older brother
Hmmm
He we go
Up the old alimentary canal
Hold the light
We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife and dips into the shark with a major incision
We open the abdominal cavity and check the digestive tract
Simple
(he attends to his work) From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two men
Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex, fascinated by the bizarre ritual
What's that
Half a flounder
Hmmm
a burlap bag
a paint can
aha
What
What
Just as  thought
He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters
How can you tell
(showing it) Florida license plate
He ate a car
(laughs) No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean
They eat anything
But this one didn't eat any people
There's nothing here
He kicks the remains around below camera
Nothing
What do we do
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land
You go out and chum for him
Chum
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat
Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything
They can sense it miles away
If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him
(checks his watch) It's a good time, too
They're night feeders
'  -  () We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at night
His glasses are already flecked with the white salt of dried seawater
He is wearing a life-preserver
Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit
green glow shines from the instruments on his face
Two closed-circuit cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto monitors in the dash
In the aisle between the seats is a large container filled with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs of shark, and chumming
(indicating distant flashing beacon) That's the Cape Light -- we're on the stretch where he's feeding, if he's still here
Brody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat
He stares at the sophisticated electronics displays
What is all this stuff
(ticking them off) Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit  -- fore and aft -- , single side band
(points to themselves) And two loose nuts behind the wheel
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around
Sometimes
(indicates display) Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together
And staying right with us
- It's blipping and peeping
Where'd you get all this
Bought it
Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so  don't have to touch my principal
You're at the Institute full time
Or do you have a job
(a nerve has been touched) It is a job
'm not fooling around like some amateur
It's my life
We gotta get back soon
"' " The two men looking very small and vulnerable in the open sea, the low-hanging mist obscuring their visibility in the night
He hears something, his eyes widen
It is the "bump-thump" of something scraping the hull
Hey
Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time dropping the engines into neutral, and then reverse
The sudden change throws Brody to his knees
What the hell
' : '  "" It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales, loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear looking like floating garbage in the cockpit
Hooper's light sweeps across it
That's Ben Gardner's boat
It's the Flicka
Ben
Ben
Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka
' The electronic display is showing increased activity, but only Brody, who is clinging to a support for dear life, can see the blips and hear the chatter
Hooper is leaning out to look at the Flicka
Hooper is examining the Flicka, tying a towline to it
The light picks its way across the ruined boat
The rail where a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw timber, and the heady cleat has been torn bodily out of the hull, ripped out screws and all
' Something he has seen moves Hooper
What happened
want to check something
Hold my feet
He sticks his head over the side, into the black water
Don't they have lifejackets or something
An extra boat
(surfacing) They must've hit something
, Blip, chatter, blip, chatter
Hooper moves to get a better look, the boat rocks in the swell and from his movement, Brody clutches the rail in a death-grip
Hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight
He didn't have a dinghy aboard
'm going down to take a look at his hull
Why don't we just tow it in
(hyperventilating) We will
There's something 've got to find out
Be careful, for chrissake
Hooper takes a last few breaths, orients himself, takes a long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the sea
He is studying the surface, trying to follow Hooper's movements
Brody is forcing himself to stay at the edge of the boat by sheer willpower and grim determination
Brody is fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra
He is very much alone
He grasps a flashlight or boathook as a fragile defense against the unknown
' Beep, chatter, blip
- Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles
Warily he turns a full circle with his hotlight
At first we see nothing out of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low in the water
But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way forward
The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood around it has been bashed and splintered
Hooper explores the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath and begins to dig at something
Whatever it is comes free in his hand
As he studies his find, his light wanders upward, pointing directly into the dark hole
Hooper looks up
- Ben Gardner's dead face stares out through the hole in the Flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horror, his skin pinched like a prune
- bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through escaping bubbles
We hear the gasping shout as a bubbling roar in the ears
His mask fills with water as he flails for the surface
Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the eternity of the ocean bottom
He finally bursts through the surface
, He is gasping for breath, his whole body vibrating with urgency
The salt water in his lungs combines with the adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech
You all right
White
Great White,  found a tooth buried in the hull
He must've attacked
knew it
Gardner's dead in there
didn't see the mate
No shark did that to a boat
Hooper, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated, almost giddy with the wonder of his discovery
Jesus Christ
Great White
Who'd believe it
We're not talking about a shark, we're talking about a Shark
Brody sinks weakly into a chair
Brody huddles in the stern, Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiver with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to port
-   - Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboard is a group of selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and another deputy standing by with paint and brushes
Brody's wagon is there, along with a few other cars
Busy late afternoon traffic is starting to pile up as early weekenders and curiosity seekers slow down to see what's happening
Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to one side
They are making a closely reasoned presentation to him
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days
It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island
shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it
4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake
just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up
Is that tooth here
Did anyone see it
don't have it
He lost it on the way up
What kind of a shark did you say it was
Carcaradon carcharias
Great White
Well, 'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence
We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished
We have got to close the beaches
We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support
It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have
don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems
'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass
There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply
That means closing the beaches
Come here,  want to show you something
He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on which we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a frantic bather fleeing a pursuing monster
Sick vandalism
Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message
want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns
(who has followed them around) That's it
'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch
Goodbye
Wait a minute
need you
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all
Look at that
Those proportions are correct
(indicates fin) know sharks
You'd love to prove that
Getting your name in the National Geographic
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August
August
Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business
It's going to be our best summer in years
If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend
- Two cavernous iron doors
Then a crack of vertical light as six burly crewmen muscle them apart
The Amity ferry landing is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside for the first filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season and -- Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this wholly visual montage of disembarkation
The next two minutes should be treated like a "short film" taking into account all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety of Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for the ninety-day season
Intercut with this montage is Brody's home, where Ellen, Hooper and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effort to enlist some support
Elements in this montage include: train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumper
Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, , wearing knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs
Hooper, bent over the phone: " know it's a long weekend, could you get me his home phone number
Sidewalk vendors hawking "Shark Killed" souvenirs, big photo "Personality Posters" of the dead tiger shark hung on the dock
Brody: "You're acting senior officer
Where's Chief Petty Officer Feldman
Where's the Coast Guard Executive Officer
" Souvenir stands selling Genuine Sharks Teeth from The Amity Killer Shark, Captured This Week
Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with their college student drivers like a bomber wing
Hooper:  "Well then, operator, could you try him in the dining room
" Brody: "All  get is a recording
Is there some other number  could try
" Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously to the window
Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm, their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years before
Hooper: "When did he check out
Did he leave another phone number
" Brody: "How can  reach him in Chambers if he's not in Chambers
" Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences
Some local delinquents about 10 or 12 years old, towing behind their bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs: "Amity Monster Shark
" "Killed Here
" 5 Cents a Hit
" Etc
Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend the ramp
They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and matching collegiate windbreakers
They scour the landing, looking for someone to save
The boat is empty
Everybody heading inland, anticipating the best Fourth of July ever
Already there is debris on the docks and the cleaning crew works away at it
As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their combined weight against the Cathedral doors, closing out the light and locking in the trade
The doors latch shut with a resounding clang
, He is studying everything, trying to make sure he has it covered as well as possible
He almost doesn't hear the approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, starched, pressed fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark aviator's sunglasses
The Steve Canyon of Amity
He presents Brody with a clipboard
Martin Brody
(Brody nods) 'll need your signature here
here
and here
What is this
Authorization for direct payment of flight expenses not directly connected to a normal mission of this command
(Brody doesn't understand) You pay for the gas
Brody signs
The Officer shakes his head as Brody makes an error
signed on the wrong line
Just erase your signature and initial your erasure
Brody complies, shaking his head
The Officer snaps him a salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copter, buckles in, and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of sand and ice-cream wrappers
- And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only forces that the frantic phone calling produced
Hendricks, and the regular summer extra deputies
The lifeguards
Half a dozen state troopers
Some deputies from neighboring towns, and a Coast Guard ensign with a handful of regulars in work dungarees
Some of Hooper's friends from the institute
Brody and Hooper, badly in need of sleep, are watching the crew straggle in
Already the first of the holiday beach- goers are piling out of their cars in a brightly colored cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, portable bar-b- ques, radios, sun visors, reflectors, rafts, balls, tubes, and newspapers
Hooper watches one such group:  Family of Ten getting out of a camper-van
He watches in dismay as the family bumbles onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun
Brody addresses his troops, such as they are
want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating, and  hope we won't actually be needing your services
But 'm glad to have you here
The Men ad lib responses: "Happy to do it," "Any time," "When's lunch
" " hate holidays," etc
want to get our lines and repellent out, so we better shove off
He nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalers (or similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into the surf to patrol the swimming areas
(a last caution) We're all on one channel, so let's keep radio traffic to a minimum, okay
Everyone kind of nods acknowledgment
hope we get some more help
wish it would rain
-   - In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade machines sucking quarters from holiday beach-goers mechanical shark traverses the screen, is hit with an electric harpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a hit
Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun
Meadows is there writing it all up for the paper
move away from the screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panorama of the beach that July 4th has created
- four foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore, riderless
The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color as one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not in the water
Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are everywhere
- half-dozen lookout lofts
As many handsome lifeguards with Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loud-hailers at arm's reach
Bored, two of the hot dogs train their binoculars on some local color
Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to cameras, a camera with a big sports zoom sitting on the platform atop the truck, a spiffy announcer-type in a blazer with his station's call letters on the pocket
Inside the darkened control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitors in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcher
Hooper is methodically patrolling in his boat
Tactically flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are four small watch-boats
tiny pleasure boat darts around the repellent line
Farther out, crossing back and forth, are patrol boats
To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopter hovers and patrols three hundred feet above
At least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and effects monitors
:  1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathers as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water
:  2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping repellent into the ocean
:  3: Close on the Bandstand, where Amity's band is playing lilting patriotic airs
After we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six o'clock news
Put 1 on the line

Roll
On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitors, we see Vaughn being interviewed by the Announcer in the blazer
and with me is the Mayor of Amity, Lawrence Vaughn
Mr
Vaughn, how about those rumors
How about them indeed
'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here
As you can see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open, and the folks here are having a wonderful time
Amity, y'know, means 'Friendship
' :  1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitors, the monitor for Camera 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods, telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or swimmer
1   : Close on the Announcer, Vaughn out of the picture
Also here today is a Marine Biologist and Research Fellow from the Oceanographic Institute, Matthew Hooper
Mr
Hooper, what've you heard
What 've heard and what 've seen are two different things
believe there is a large Great White Shark -- Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters off this very beach, that he has killed and that he will kill again
Hooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials his mike off, and brings up the Announcer's lavalier
(moving into center frame) And there you have it -- two different opinions, by men of good will
The holiday crowd here at Amity seems to be making up its own mind
The camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the beach
:  3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba player
:  2: Brody and the Announcer
:  1 and : Back on the Announcer, his lips moving, but his sound turned off
We hear, instead, the sound from Monitor Camera 2, Brody and the same Announcer
'm sorry,  just don't have the time
Recue the machines
2, pan off the Chief and show me some tits and ass
1, get me some cute kids
3
see if you got a shot at the water
:  1, 2 and 3: The cameras seek out the appropriate activity as the Director calls for it
(holds up stopwatch) Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45 seconds
That's equal time, right
Right

2 - : Starts showing us the assembled interview segment we've just seen, starting with the Announcer's opening remarks
(
) Amity Island is famed for its clear air and white sand beaches
But a cloud appeared
His voice is dialed under as the Announcer himself appears in the control room to watch himself on the monitors
() Look at that shine on my nose
It's a beacon
Close enough for remote
As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitors show us the action on the beach
(
) 'm pleased and happy
Think we ought to stick around
What else you got
Teachers' strike downtown
'  (
) Christenson, this is Al
Union says time for Engineering Five
That's five minutes, guys
Coffee
Vaughn is in his shirtsleeves, having slipped out of his jacket
He mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront
At this moment, there's nobody swimming
He approaches a familiar Selectman, nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand
Why don't you get in the water
don't want to wash off my suntan lotion
'll get a burn
(some urgency) Nobody's going in
On an adjoining blanket, a spirited Ruth Gordon type is sitting, watching brightly as her manservant, a polished Eric Harrison type, prepares some tea from a thermos
Is there nobody going in
What a shame
Arthur, should  be going in
( ) (pouring tea) If you'd like
He puts down the tea service, and leads her towards the water
At the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in
(as he enters the waves) It's very nice
Not too cold
Quite refreshing
Very pleasant
He ducks his head under for a final look around
His dripping head rises triumphantly from the surf
No sharks, m'lady
She starts into the water, he takes her parasol, escorting her the rest of the way into the ocean
This is marvelous
Arthur,  want to come back to this very spot
Will you make a note of where we are
- Encouraged by the sight of the Woman and Arthur, and Vaughn's quiet urgings, people begin to wander into the surf, a few at first, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing
The Selectman goes in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming
#7 Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guard spotter works the sonar
Anything
Thought  saw a shadow
Over
Pan to the water
As before, 400 pairs of enticing, yummy swimmers' legs, kicking like animated hors d'oeuvres
- breathtaking view
The copter spotter looks down with naked eye and binoculars
Nothing from up here, Daisy
Over
- (into walkie-talkie) False alarm
Must be this glare
-  - He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the happy hordes
Meadows nods "hello
" Who's scared to go in
was in
Up to your knees, yeah -- So come with me -- 'll go again
Beautiful day, Chief
group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy
They are hauling it toward the surf
Hey Mikey --
Michael turns as Brody trots toward him
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son
'm all checked out for light surf and look at it
Do me this favor just once
Use the ponds
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies
Just a favor for your old man
(confused) Sure, Dad
- cameramen are packing up their gear
For them it's a wrap - Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's voice overloads the speaker
Copter to Daisy
Red Four, Red Four
#7 - Guns are up, heads turning everywhere
(into walkie-talkie) Where --
Went under your -- There
The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales
slick black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area
Jesus Christ -- Shark
- Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying to transmit
Everybody out
Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please -- lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his whistle
- shouting hysterically
No whistles
No whistles
Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see
More whistles, and they start toward shore
We hear panicky voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc
The loudhailers sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one person after another
Entire groups of people begin pulling toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a growing hysteria in others
#6  #7 are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if tracking an underwater shadow
The fin is beyond the repellent cordons and heading into the crowds
' Caught on the other end of the line, he is wheeling in a broad, hot-dogger's circle turn, headed back
- People begin screaming
Kids are suddenly separated from their parents
Others seem to forget how to swim
One myopic little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry in blinded panic
Ellen Brody looks around frantic
#2, #3, #4 The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too many civilians create a hazard
The Coast Guardsmen attempt to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing area and the heaving fin
- This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown headlong water panic
Screaming vacationers claw their way over the bodies of the less able
Some literally attempt to walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others pulling for dry land
- Horrified faces
Some are stunned and wandering in slow, tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends
Five people try to mount a rubber raft
Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One
Brody enters shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone charges past him to help an old man out of the water
Dragging the helpless from the surf
Tears well in Brody's eyes
The screaming is deafening
The  unit is hopping up and down in rage and frustration
Why did we wrap
Get that
Somebody get that
One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely still
numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against each other
Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing
The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts
- The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line
All boats converge on the dynamic fin
Men raise their guns to fire
Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated fashion
- It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny blue snorkel
Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom we will recall from the coven behind the dune
The fin bobs back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially submerged surfboard
One youngster looks up and is greeted by: ' Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him
Surrounding him on three sides
Some of the policemen start to lower their guns -- struck dumb
He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his eyes still restlessly searching
- his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his hands in unconditional surrender
- The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today
Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl points
is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond
He sees it, and jams his throttle forward
He steers with one hand, fumbling urgently for his walkie-talkie with the other
The circle of boats around the little pranksters, the crowds huddled on the beach, Hooper's boat suddenly arrowing towards the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake
He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye
Curious, he follows its progress
It's urgency finally communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot across the dunes towards a rise overlooking the estuary
Vaughn gets there just in time to see the disaster
He watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath
Stunned
- Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit
Kit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by it
The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them
They are not yet aware
The fin seems to circle and return
It heads toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee when he is "bumped
" The entire boat is overturned
Michael sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side
Michael and Kit are thrown head first
Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between them crossing back
Michael freezes
The fin comes directly at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and panicked weekend novice
Catches him
Michael watches
That all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing behind
(passing a horrified Michael, who half extends one hand, as if to help) It's no good
'm dead
(and he is) renewed cry of shark
- He turns
Oh God
Running through the slogging sand
- sudden turn
She runs
- He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth
Block the estuary
The estuary
Three boats racing to carry out the orders
The black fin re- passing the two children, racing to get out
Hooper reaches the mouth before the others
The fin won't veer off
It smacks into the little vessel, bumping it aside
The fin is left racing into open water
Blood leavings
Hooper leaping over the side, slogging towards Michael
Copter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late
- They are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes up
Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at nothing
(feeling his face) He's in shock
Get blankets
People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their hands
They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet raised above his head
- Michael is wheeled out in the bed
Brody and Ellen are there
Sean is sleepy in Brody's arms
Vaughn is waiting in the hall
The doctor said it's okay -- mild shock
He can come home in the morning
(to Michael) Hey, big guy -- you want anything from home
My cars
And a comic book
(sees Vaughn) Here -- (gives baby to Ellen) Take him home
Home
New York
No
Home here
Ellen exits
(crossing to Vaughn) Got a pen on you
Why
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher
Here
It's an authorization to employ a contractor
don't know if  can do that without a
(interrupting) 'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish
want to see that shark dead
Maybe we can save August
Forget it
This summer's had it
Next summer's had it
You're the mayor of Shark City
You wanted to keep the beaches open
What happens when the town finds out about that
was acting in the town's best interests
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head
You do the right thing
You authorize me
(indicates paper) Right there
Whatever it costs
My kids were on that beach
Just sign it, Larry
Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the paper and exits
'  - Brody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house
They enter through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell
Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires fills the air
Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding pieces of pilot whale into chum
The whale lies bloody on the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in the air
Diesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor
Wall hangings of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all conspire to frame the killing floor
Brody and Hooper navigate the obstacle course
This has got to be one big violation
(handling some gear) This is quite a place
' Keep your hands off my stuff
He emerges from the steam and smoke
Did you bring a check
What
Cash
Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise
'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor
We'll meet your price
$10,000
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not
You got it
And incidental damages, if any
You got it
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap
Nobody tells me how to run my property
You got it
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch
Two cases
And dinner when you land
(pours drink) Try some of this
made it myself
Brody tastes
Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged women
Herschel interrupts
He's stopped working, and is wiping his hands on a bloody rag
Mr
Quint
Quint wheels to face him
'm not goin'
No sir
You want to get paid, you go
Forget the money
You can't pay me enough
ain't crazy
worked some big mean fish with you, but  ain't goin' on this one
This is the last time  hear from you
don't want anyone with piss for blood on my vessel
Put that blackfish on board, pump the bilges, and top off the fuel tanks, and finish up in the morning
Then you're on the beach
You're going to need an extra hand
Quint turns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards him
This is Matt Hooper
know who he is
He's from the Oceanographic Institute
've been to sea since  was 12
've crewed three Trans-pacs -- Transplants
-- and an America's Cup Trials
'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating
'm talking about working for a living
Sharking
And 'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark
'm talking about a Great White
Are you now
know about porkers in the water -- (throws him some rope) Here
Tie me a sheepshank
Hooper ties the knot effortlessly
don't need to pass basic seamanship
Let me see your hands
He takes Hooper's hands in his own big bloody fists, and feels them as he talks
Ha
City hands
You been counting money
If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr
White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls
If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means
Look,  don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap
Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks
(interrupting) Hey
Knock it off
don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there
What do you mean 'We
' It's my charter
My party
All right, Commissioner
But when we're on my ship,  am Master, Mate and Pilot
And  want him
(indicates Hooper) along for ballast
You got it
'  - The Mate is loading
He hands Quint the items on his check list as Quint takes them aboard
5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number 14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs, tail rope, eye splice, -1, 20 clips, pliers, irons
As he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock
Wheeling a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants from the Institute
On the wagon, among other things, is a big shark cage
At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he signs for his issue
Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator, tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra magazines, cage
- You got everything you asked for
All of it
And thank Dr
Miro for me
And tell Borack 'll catch up with them in New Zealand
This is actually a killing expedition
An eye for an eye, you know
Hey, Squirt
You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast
It ain't good for much but bait
(to Assistant) 'll see ya
Tell Dorothy hello
Hooper sees his gear approaching
Quint sees Hooper approaching with the large cage
Hello, Junior
What are you
Some kind of half-assed astronaut
(to himself) Jesus Christ, when  was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman
What d'ya have there -- a portable shower
Anti-Shark cage
Who's inside, you or the shark
Hooper indicates "me
" You're in the cage
(Hooper nods) The cage is in the water
(Hooper nods) The shark is in the water too
(Hooper nods) You're in the water with the shark
Hooper nods
Quint sings "Spanish Ladies" half to himself
Comin' aboard
, She's carrying a little plastic shopping bag, he's wearing shiny new foul weather gear, bundled up, sweaty, uncomfortable
She gives him as good a hug as she can manage under the circumstances
Did you take your dramamine
(Brody nods) Here
She straightens his coat, and gives him a shaving kit to carry aboard with his toiletries
From the deck, Quint whistles derisively
Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'
Is that him
(to Ellen) Colorful, isn't he
You going to be all right
Nothing to worry about -- 'll survive this
'll see you back soon
There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit
Brody nods, and holds her hand for a wordless moment
(
) (sings) 'Here is the body of Mary Lee
For 15 years she kept her virginity
Not a bad record for this vicinity
' There is a sputter and roar as the Orca's diesels kick on
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
(hugging him) What'll  tell the kids
Tell 'em  went fishin'
They laugh together, and exchange a short, fierce kiss
Cast off the bow line
Now your stern
Its diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier
Ellen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is walking off the dock back onto dry land
Quint has set a course out towards the open sea
He lashes the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who are standing together in the stern
(to Brody) Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, Starboard
Aloft, Below
It's not a staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a rope, it's a line, and if you don't get it right
(indicates porthole) 'll throw your ass through that little round window
He laughs at his joke
This is probably something he tells all his charters
Now hear this
You're aboard the fishing vessel 'Orca,' and 'm her Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner
You'll jump when  holler
We're doin' a job here, and Christ,  ain't got time to watch you birds get hooks in your ass and fall overboard
Ship with me, and you'll do all right
Cross me, and 'll slap you upside your heads
Now -- if you boys are ready -- let's go fishin'
He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way
: - It is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide chum slick spreading behind it
couple of flag buoys spread along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone
Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark attracted by the chum
He rigs a small pole with a piece of bait, and throws it over the side
Here's something for you
The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside
He hauls it part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff
Hooper and Brody watch
- Tailrope dropping on him
Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is immobilized by Quint's practiced hands
He takes one of his big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish
These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat their own guts
He slices into the shark's underbelly
We hear the sound of entrails plopping into the water
Brody is almost retching, and Hooper is just displeased
The gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own entrails
Fins closing in on the wounded shark
Go ahead, you cannibals
Tell 'em where you got it
boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory drive of the fearsome species
What's that supposed to prove
Just a little appetizer
want our porker to know we're serving
want to put some iron into that big yap
: - The Orca is drifting in neutral
The ocean is like gelatin, the sun sucking heat waves from its surface
Brody at the stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt: the ladling out of chum
There are several empty chum barrels
flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to be tossed over the side
Brody is reeling with nausea
He opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and some Old Spice after-shave
He pours the after-shave into the cloth, presses it to his nose
Hooper is also in the stern
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles
Don't break it
Who's driving the boat
Nobody
We're drifting with the current
(using the fish finder) Nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
(to Hooper) Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass
Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing
Quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, crushing the empty and throwing it over the side
Hooper drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his hand with a silly "plup
" He stows the pieces in an empty chum barrel
(to Brody) Get a fresh barrel
Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out the knots
He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all comes loose
barrel, shark cage, and, most important, Hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck
(jumping up) Watch it
Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom
Careful, huh
(mutters) Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr
Whitey, of course
he didn't go to schools in electronics
He was born with what he does best
Eat
He's a swimming appetite
'Course he might eat this stuff, but then 've seen him eat a rocking chair, too
(to Brody) Next time, ask me
: The men are in different positions on the boat
Hooper on the flying bridge
Quint in the stern, Brody hanging over the rail, puking
Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled squid from the garbage pail, and searches for a No
2 hook rig
He holds up a strip of whale
(eyeing bait) That's pilot whale, isn't it
It ain't a Big Mac
(to Brody) The expert don't approve
What do you thing
You're closer to the situation
(laughs) Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up
(croaky) Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there
(snapping bait to his leader) 'cause this is where he lives
You gotta think like they do
(to himself) Easy for you -- they got a brain the size of a radish
Quint sits in the fighting chair
He casts off, murmuring as the line feeds out
(to Brody) Now if he weren't around, we'd of hooked something else by now, wouldn't we
But he scared 'em all away
Big lonesome son of a bitch
: Quint at ease in his chair, Brody near him, practicing tying knots
The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both men watch
Then the line whizzes off the reel
Brody jumps up
Hooper springs to the deck
Quint puts his hand on the drag and addresses the situation softly
-- he'll gulp it down now
(making gulping noises) Hooooooo
Quint tightens drag and strikes
The line goes whizzing out
Brody runs to Quint's side
Hooper springs up to the flying bridge
You got it
(turning with the pull) Get behind me, dummy
(shouts to Hooper) Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line
(to Brody) Wet my reel, quick
Brody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers
Brody pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now
Hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes direction
(straining, muscles popping) Starboard, for Chris'sake -- Hooper steers it sharply
(to Hooper) Hey, you
Farmer
Half-speed there
(almost to himself) Aye, Aye
Stand by to repel boarders
Poop the mainsail
Argh, Jim Boy
Again the line changes direction, down this time
(to Hooper) Neutral
(to himself) Where the hell is he going
Quint reeling in like mad
Oh, this ain't foolin' me -- (rod arcs down with a surge) Sure -- try it
He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes out and there is less tension
Quint is horsing up and down, reeling in
Makin' believe it's easy now
The line is almost vertical, and Quint shows a hint of bafflement
He reels in suspiciously
Gettin' ready to run again -- no
No
(suspicious) What's he playin' here
(reels in furiously, to Brody) Put the gloves on
(to fish) Let's see who's gonna tease who now
Let it go, don't waste your time
(to Hooper) Down here, Hooper
Hooper is rushing down
don't know what it is, but it's not a shark
(bathed in sweat; hauling, reeling) Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as  say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home
Now get down here
The leaders show above the water line
Brody is wide-eyed, waiting for that first look
The wire's showing
(to Brody) Unbuckle me -- fast
(to Hooper) Grab the leader
He ain't normal, this one
they never -- It's too wild, too erratic
It's a marlin or a stingray
It's a gamefish
Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on
Watch your hands -- (suddenly to Brody) Grab onto this
Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily clutching at the big rod, appalled
Quint skips away for a flying gaff
He picks one, turns
That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's forehead, drawing blood
Quint snatches up the rod and reels in
The wires have been bitten through
(to Hooper) marlin, or a stingray
Huh
Don't ever tell me my business again
Get back up on the bridge
(stunned) 'm okay
(to Brody) Fasten the pole
What's the point with hooks and Lines
-- Don't tell me my business
(to Hooper, points) Quarter-mile, that way
Full throttle
Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys
Brody watches Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait
(nursing forehead, gesturing at rod and reel) How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking
What  do is trick him to the surface, got that
Then  can jab him, understand
(goes to flybridge, muttering) Think 'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does
Brody goes inside to inspect his forehead
- (suddenly, pointing) Over there
What do you see
(still looking) At least you handle the boat all right
Stop
Here
Cut the engine
Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down
He stands stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent
Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it over to the chair
About to sit down, he freezes
- looking hard at something
- staring, eyes widening
- moving in, surprised, interested, fascinated
We see the shark
First the fin
then the head and upper jaws, ten or twenty yards off the side of the boat
It finally submerges, its tail giving a final slap
He puts his rod away and stares at it
And stares
And stares
Hooper is the first to break the silence
20 feet, if it's an inch
25 feet
And three tons of him there
Hooper is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy
He leaps toward his gear
(quietly, to Brody) never saw one that big
What do we do
Get some help
Radio in
Quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin to assemble something inside it
Brody is alone on the deck with Hooper
How're we gonna handle this
Hooper is contained in his own excitement
He has finally come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon through which he peers intently at the shark alongside
He is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder and focus
He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional boil
(very, very high) There's a formula
Girth, about 150 inches, squared, divide by 800 -- son of a bitch, they are not going to believe this
-- divide by 2000
three tons
(after Quint) You're right, you old fart
Three tons
(ad libs ecstasy) He is assembling the Greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line
Past him, on the deck, we can still see Hooper
As Quint is working with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life
(
) Amity Point Light Station to Orca
This is Amity Point Light Station, to Orca
Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips
Orca here
(
) have Mrs
Martin Brody here
Put her on
' push this
Oh
It's working
Hello, Martin
This is Quint, Missus
' just wanted to know if you were all right
the Coast Guard let me use their radio
Is Chief Brody there
He's busy
' Well
is everything all right
Just fine, Missus
We'll be back soon
Everything's fine
We haven't seen anything yet
Orca out
He snaps off the radio, and, for good measure, pulls the plug from the power source
The big shark is slicing through the water just below the surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the teeth gleaming
- (on deck) Damn it
need something in the foreground to give it some scale
Martin
Stand here
No, to your left
He is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody, the shark, and the Orca in the same frame
Quint finishes with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive cartridge into the breech
He empties the box of cartridges onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow pulpit
Quint appears with the harpoon gun
He throws one end of the line to Hooper
Here
Rig this to the forward keg up there
He indicates the barrels on the foredeck
(to Brody) Get up there and steer her
Follow my hand, and hold 'er steady
've got to get a clean shot at that porker's head
Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck, but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he desperately hunts for something
Hurry up, rig the line
He finds what he's looking for
small, powerful strobe unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon
He triggers it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in the sun
Hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the bow
(to Brody) Come to port
Watch my hand
Steady now
He guides Brody with hand signals
Brody tries urgently to get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is indicating
The line, man, the line
Hooper is rigging like crazy
Brody steering f
g
, Hooper on the foredeck with the barrels, Quint leaning out over the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the shark crossing inexorably in front of them
Agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches, glancing back to see if the line is properly rigged and Hooper is clear of it
Get clear, damn you
The shark is in position, Hooper shouts, a moment too late
Clear
Quint fires
The harpoon slams into the shark behind his head, half-way along the back in front of the big dorsal fin
Jesus
Christ On a Crutch
- The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hooper jumps back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the line rigged to the harpoon
It bounds forward and into the sea, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting another steel shaft
In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips violently in the water, dragged by the shark in his merciless moves
- Now you've done it, you piss-ant
Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to my gear
Let the bastard fight the keg for a while
He can't stay down with that on
Hooper, furious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to take the helm from Brody
, Hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn
(to Quint) Rig another keg
'm bringing her around
His eyes dart about the ocean, looking for the barrel, as he hot-dogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own disgust with himself
(to himself) God damn it
We had him
(to Quint) 'm coming about
He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle like a formula speedster
The decks tip and the rigging sways under the sudden strain
Brody is caught unaware, and tumbles off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a wall
the M1 Rifle is close to his hand
He stares at it
Hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark, spinning the wheel, compounding his error, tipping the boat in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake
Quint has turned his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at Hooper, staring at him, excluding everything else
As Quint folds his arms and stares at Hooper, we realize the sun is going down, and it's getting dark
Why don't we go in
Get another crack at him tomorrow
We got a barrel on him
We can't lose him
We stay out here until we find him
Hooper throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly circling the ocean
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour
(grim) You hired me, remember
It's my $10,000
It's my shark
-   - Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat circles the water endlessly, staying over the shark like an avenging angel
Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the interior of the pilot house
bright strobe glints on the water winking once like a firefly
- Brody and Hooper at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping his eye on the light
He's up again
He corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight
Hooper is sitting at the table, morose
Brody is staring at a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some other crappy rations Quint has on board
Dirty spoons stuck in the open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner
Quint fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home brew
He takes a pull, and hands it to Hooper, who takes a double
Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead, where the fishing rod caught him
Quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show something near the crown
That's not so bad
Look at this: St
Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, in Boston, where some sunovabitch winged me upside the head with a spittoon
Brody looks politely
Hooper stirs himself
Look here
(extends a forearm) Steve Kaplan bit me during recess
Quint is amused
He presents his own formidable forearm
Wire burn
Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off
(rolling up a sleeve) Moray Eel
Bit right through a wet suit
Brody is fascinated
Quint and Hooper take a long pull from the bottle
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room
This love line here
(he bends an ear forward) that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife
caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas
Ever see one like this
He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar
Bull shark scraped me while  was taking samples
Nothing
pleasure scar
Look here -- He starts rolling up his own dirty pants leg
Slammed with a thresher's tail
Look just like somebody caressed me with a nutmeg grater
Brody is drawn into their boasting comparisons
He secretly checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enter the contest
'll drink to your leg
And 'll drink to yours
They toast each other
Brody looks around, sees the strobe blink once through the darkened window
Wait a minute, young fella
Look
Just look
Don't touch
He starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip where the tissue is scarred and irregular
Mako
Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck
You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last
(considerably drunker) think  can top that, Mister
Hooper is pulling at his shirt, trying to get it off, but it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone
Gimme a hand, here
got something to show you -- Brody lends a hand
The shirt slips part way off
(indicating his chest) There
Right there
Mary Ellen Moffit broke my heart
Let's drink to Mary Ellen
The two men raise their mugs in a toast
And here's to the ladies
And here's to their sisters; 'd rather one Miss than a shipload of Misters
He drinks, Hooper follows
(shows belly) Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima
(aside) 'mon
Middle appendix -- (aside) almost had 'im
Brody is looking at a small white patch on Quint's other forearm
(pointing) What's that one, there
(changing) Tattoo
Had it taken off
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor
' 'Mother
' 'Semper Fi
' Uhhh
'Don't Tread on Me
' 'mon -- what
'
Indianapolis
' 1944
What's that, a ship
(incredulous) You were on the Indianapolis
In '45
Jesus
Quint remembering
Yeah
The
Indianapolis
June 29th, 1945, three and a half minutes past midnight, two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine slammed into our side
Two or three
We was still under sealed orders after deliverin' the bomb
the Hiroshima bomb
we was goin' back across the Pacific from Tinian to Leyte
Damn near eleven hundred men went over the side
The life boats was lashed down so tight to make the bomb run we couldn't cut a single one adrift
Not one
And there was no rafts
None
That vessel sank in twelve minutes
Yes, that's all she took
We didn't see the first shark till we'd been in the water about an hour
thirteen-footer near enough blue
You measure that by judgin' the dorsal to the tail
What we didn't know
of course the Captain knew guess some officers knew
was the bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signals was sent
What the men didn't know was that they wouldn't even list us as overdue for a week
Well,  didn't know that --  wasn't an officer -- just as well perhaps
So some of us were dead already -- in the water -- just hangin' limp in our lifejackets
And several already bleedin'
And the three hundred or so laying on the bottom of the ocean
As the light went, the sharks came crusin'
We formed tight groups -- somewhat like squares in an old battle -- You know what  mean -- so that when one come close, the man nearest would yell and shout and pound the water and sometimes it worked and the fish turned away, but other times that shark would seem to look right at a man -- right into his eyes -- and in spite of all shoutin' and poundin' you'd hear that terrible high screamin' and the ocean would go red, then churn up as they ripped him
Then we'd reform our little squares
By the first dawn the sharks had taken more than a hundred
Hard for me to count but more than a hundred
don't know how many sharks
Maybe a thousand
do know they averaged six men an hour
All kinds -- blues, makos, tigers
All kinds
(Pause) In the middle of the second day, some of us started to go crazy from the thirst
One fella cried out he saw a river, another claimed he saw a waterfall, some started to drink the ocean and choked on it, and some left our little groups -- our little squares -- and swam off alone lookin' for islands and the sharks always took them right away
It was mainly the young fellas that did that -- the older ones stayed where they was
That second day -- my life jacket rubbed me raw and that was more blood in the water
Oh my
On Thursday morning  bumped up against a friend of mine -- Herbie Robinson from Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it seemed he was asleep but when reached over to waken him, he bobbed in the water and  saw his body upend because he'd been bitten in half beneath the waist
Well Chief, so it went on -- bombers high overhead but nobody noticin' us
Yes -- suicides, sharks, and all this goin' crazy and dyin' of thirst
Noon the fifth day, Mr
Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung around and came in low
Yes
He did that
Yes, that pilot saw us
And early evenin', a big fat  come down out of the sky and began the pickup
That was when  was most frightened of all -- while  was waitin' for my turn
Just two and a half hours short of five days and five nights when they got to me and took me up
Eleven hundred of us went into that ocean -- three hundred and sixteen got out
Yeah
Nineteen hundred and forty five
June the 29th
(pause) Anyway, we delivered the bomb
- Quint has just finished his story, and we are looking across the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the night, the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures of the three men inside, the red and green running lights winking along the ship's flanks
We hear the distant boom and drawn-out hoot of a whale
- What the hell
It's a whale out there
There's a brief, eerie pause
Quint breaks the silence by muttering into song, which he slowly swells
(singing) Show me the way to go home
'm tired and  want to go to bed
had a little drink about an hour ago, and it went right to my head
(etc
) Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse becomes a warm cozy place
The Orca and its song in the night
In the foreground, the barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, the big dorsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towards the ship
The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men
Quint's eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to hear the abrasion of his ship
Things vibrate on the shelves
Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet
The scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it
He drops out of the song, leaving Brody singing solo
(quietly, to Hooper) Start the engines
As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the vessel
Water bubbles up into the hold
Brody starts, and looks at the radio
He is about to move towards it when Quint's urgent instructions stop him
He's busting the shaft
Start the pump
Where
The bilge pumps
There -- He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, grabbing his -1 rifle as he goes
Brody hits a switch and we hear the pumps starting
Hooper is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the diesels sound wrong
Cut the engines
Hooper does
Rudder bearings
The boat is assaulted again
Quint fires over the stern, emptying a clip into the water
(to Brody) Get up forward
Watch for him
Brody moves cautiously up to the bow
Keep your eyes open, Mr
Hooper
Hooper stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stern deck
Nobody sleeps
Nobody
He jams a fresh clip into the -1
The men scan the seas around them
Quint resumes their song, louder this time, more defiant
(sings) Show me the way to go home
'm tired and  want to go to bed
(etc
) Hooper and Brody join in from their respective positions
, The men in place, singing, the water sparkling towards the horizon, the stars twinkling above
The sound of a distant whale in distant counterpoint
- Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hooper and Quint have a hatch up on the stern, and are working together to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark
Hooper is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammering away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin
The engine is idling
Bits of iron clutter the deck, along with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets
More left rudder
More
Left hand down now, Chief
Brody tries to comply
(shifting his grip) Lemme get a better angle on it
Now
Quint hammers again
He's bent the housing
You can hear it
And we can
The Orca's diesels are no longer smooth
Brody suddenly sees something, and points
'    - The barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the port side
They are drifting up to it
The barrel
The strobe light winks at them
Quint holds up a hand: "Quiet
" Everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up on them
It's him
He takes a killing lance from the rack
Hooper gets a boathook
He's under the keg
Careful -- Hooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook
It bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander
Hooper shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in
(suspicious) Easy -- just want to goose him up
The minute he runs, drop it or you'll lose your hands
Hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up
No resistance
It comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck
He and Quint exchange looks
Here -- gimme
don't see what he's been doin'
- Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching the water on the aft side
From the opposite starboard direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great White
First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper border of wide, grinning teeth
It knifes through the water in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed toward the unsuspecting men
- His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of direction
(top of his lungs) Shark
Starboard
- They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them from instant decapitation
The Great White passes the transom, the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed- off cable
It rolls on its side and looks at them as it passes
Past the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters out of "Orca
" The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting the water, and starts circling the boat
Quint notices his cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing it
(to Hooper) Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us
(then to Brody on the bridge) Start the engine
The diesels start with a terrible grinding
Easy
It'll tear right out
(hauling) The shaft is giving
Hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing the deck for action once again
(on bridge) That's it
Radio in for help
Shut up
Just pump her out
(coming down off the bridge) Yeah, Captain, as soon as  make a call
Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house
- perfectly terrible look comes over him
He raises up and starts after Brody
Brody disappears into the cabin
Quint pauses outside and sees: - ' - his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely
Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on the complex console
(
) Beg your pardon -- - Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, raising his bat
Duty first and pleasure after -- - looking up in horror, covering his face
- Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon
Crash
Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the ship-to-shore radio
Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the bat
Excuse me
Brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage
His glasses are cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio
He seizes the bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis
Some great idea
Now where are we
Some goddamn skipper you are
You're certifiable, y'know that
You're a real treat
Certifiable
Bananas
His tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from Hooper
- Pointing at the fin
Coming right to us
No -- comin' right at us
Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on -- (the engine clanks) Slower
Throttle back --- - (raising harpoon) Hard to port
Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot at the upward rolling flank
He sinks it with careful precision
Try shakin' that out
Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash
(shouting to Quint) Did you get him in the head
(to Brody) No
No
No
(to Hooper) Swing around
After him
Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel
Diving down
Up again -- Quint prepares another iron
Brody is digging in his bag
He comes up with his 2"
357 service revolver
More gas
go to half
Get me right alongside him -- The engine thuds and knocks
(shouting down) We can't rev it up this high -- Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca
Watch it
Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope
Atta boy
Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head
The Great White breaks water and
Take two, they're small
He sinks it deep
We hear shots
As the new rope whips out, Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation police combat pistol stance, holding his
357 in both hands, firing at the shark's head
Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the barrel goes over
(shouting at Brody) Don't shoot him any more
He's crazy on his own blood already
can't stand here doing nothing
Order in the court
He has seen the two barrels pop to the surface
(racing over) Three'll do it
He's havin' trouble with two
He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls
Grab yourselves a couple of poles
Quint steers "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers toward the moving barrels
Quint peers down, steering closer and closer
Get ready
Now snag 'em
Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for dear life as the shark changes course
Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto the transom -- free ride
Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint helps out by wheeling in a circle
He laughs to himself, enjoying the spectacle
- securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang overboard
Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat
- The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to and fro, up and down, side to side
- are both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward
- sees the fin ahead
It is pulling the boat
Get tired
That's the idea
Here's a little reverse for you
The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is both horrifying and awesome
Its jaws break water, snapping at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated
Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down: Haul in -- watch the prop
With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and balance
The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing closer
Now
Untie 'em
Quick
He'll tear us to pieces
He fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing shower of spray
They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are stretched too taut
They jump out of the way, falling flat on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over objects, skeetering across the deck
tight jerking motion, and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards
And much too fast
Water is splashing up over the transom in its backward wake
The engines groan and complain
Damn head is too far away
He's too big
Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet
- moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength
The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water
They disappear beneath the turbulent grey surface
The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, look out at the blank water
- Pop -- pop -- pop
One, two, three, the barrels surface -- ready for more
(amazed at the shark's strength) He can't go so deep
Not with all those on him
Brody looks down at his feet
There is salt water up to their shoe tops
What about us
(mentally assessing the damage) Have to pump her steady, s'all
The barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind
(to Hooper) Follow him -- (to Brody) You start pumpin' out here
Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his -1, and checks the load
(
) (on bridge) He's heading under --
(incredulously) No way
He can't
- The barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one -- two -- three
Where'd he go
Brody looks around
Hooper on the flying bridge searching in all directions
Quint is looking more appalled every second
(helplessly) He can't stay down with three barrels on him
Where is he
Have you ever had one do this
(and he means this) No
Booming thud at the keel
Brody slides on the wet deck and Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms
It seems the only place out of reach of the shark
Quint climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol
Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck under
Follow him
He's under
There
(points wildly) The barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless
Violent scraping sounds
He's trying to sink us
(to Hooper) Dead astern
Zig-zag
Quint is grimly silent
Brody senses that Quint is in the fight of (and for) his life
The Orca taking evasive action
But the three barrels are closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft
He's chasing us don't believe it
Full throttle
To port
Hooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is pounding and knocking wildly
The barrels circle and move in
Quint has his rifle ready
(suddenly giving Quint the wheel) Hold her
He leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart gun
Just then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, falling sideways
vast spray drenches the men
Quint fires into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness
(loading) Keep him there
Keep him
The Orca shudders from side to side
From Hooper's point of view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull
Quint has reloaded and is firing into the fish
Brody has a wicked pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing and gouging it, trying for the eyes
The killing lust is on all three men
Throttling back
The boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, and disengages
The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide loop around the boat
The engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling half awash, a wounded victim
The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath the waves
There is complete silence
In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and pops of the cooling, dying engines
He eyes the stern
Huge cracks and broken timber testify to the fury of the attack
(very quietly, to Hooper) What can that gun of yours do
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate
If  can hit him
can kill him
But  gotta be close
Very close
(the awful realization) You gotta go in the water
: , Quint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny bars the only undamaged things on deck
Brody is working too, bolting the sections together
(in command now) Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts
The men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence that surrounds them
Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting weights, mask, tanks, etc
The cage is standing in the stern
Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section
Hooper climbs in though the top
Take me up
Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the air
Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out his hand
Quint puts the spear gun into it
He examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor point
Lower away, Chief
(then, to Quint) Try and keep him off me till 'm under
Hooper inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his teeth and checks his regulator
Brody steps back, and with Quint guiding the cage, begins lowering it off the gin pole boom arm into the sea alongside the boat
Brody and Hooper stare at each another as their faces pass, Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean
As Hooper disappears beneath the surface, Quint and Brody exchange a long look between them
- ' Submerging
The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea air then
the magnificent innerspaces, with bubbles sparkling in front of us
- as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around 360 degrees
He removes the rubber guard from the needle and waits
- Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still circling
Suddenly, both heads stop turning
The barrels have come to a stop
Delicately, they change course and meander toward the lowered cage
- His back is to us
He is just now completing a visual sweep and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on something monstrous
and fascinating
' The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in the blue
From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- comes the shark
It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous beyond comparison
As it nears the cage, it turns, and its ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye
Hooper tentatively reaches out
It is too far for the strychnine pole
The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge the passing currents with pink
The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca above
Brody and Quint leap back
- The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt
Hooper, expecting the shark to attack out of that same general direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and
we see that the shark attacking from behind him
The cage is sent careening
Hooper grabs the bars for dear life
The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending the bars like clothes hangers
Hooper can't turn the pointed end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the non-rational attacker as possible
Hooper is trapped
The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges again
The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, the tail thrusting it forward
Hooper drops the strychnine pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture depth
All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating Hooper at the waistline
Through frantic bubbles Hooper fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of the cage
The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad head won't shake loose
Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole
- The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after Hooper
Hooper nearly recovers the pole
Again it slips from his frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss
Hooper turns and looks up
The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above
One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls taut
- Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward
- The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost to the breaking point
Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul up the cage
Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a hand-winch
The ginpole is splitting
Let go of it
The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale
the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging it, but Quint won't give up the winch
Brody hauls on the rope barehanded
- maneuvering downward, away from the jaws
Suddenly the crazed shark veers upward for the surface
- The winch is working faster now, Quint demonically winding it in
The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks water
Brody is horrified
The cage is empty
(a horrible scream) He's comin' up --
He's taken him
The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a great whooshing noise
It rises vertically, towering overhead, blocking out the sun
The pectoral fins seem to reach forward
The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing Quint and Brody
It drives the stern underwater, the ocean pours in over the transom
The jaws snap from side to side
Brody flounders backwards away from it
- He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins to tilt to stern, and everything starts to break loose around him
- The giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything: great chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure
Deck chair, irons, rope, gear, beercans, bottles, Brody's bag, all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning away
Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at this ultimate violation of his territory
He snatches up a lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow
The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a treacherous incline, slippery with blood and seawater
Quint's footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell, the big teeth seize him and snap
Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his torso
Blood gushes onto the deck
The remnants of his body tumble from the shark's mouth
Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air tanks, and hurls it at the monster
It tumbles into the bloody well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel blocking the cruel jaws
The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to clear the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay
, To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling deck, bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching down into the bloody mouth
He fights his way into the cabin, already a shambles
Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting weight so that the boat in now stern down, and listing to the side
Water from the sea pours into the cabin
Another lunge by the shark
The huge snout and jaws slam up against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing
More seawater
To stay in the cabin is to go down with the ship
Brody clambers as far from the shark as he can, against the forward wall of the pilothouse
He sees the window Hooper used before
It's blocked by barrels and debris
He breaks the side window highest above the water, edges out onto the battered bridge
The shark rolls around, now half in the water
The ship is sinking, the sea is not a viable alternative
Brody climbs up into the flying bridge
The shark is still lunging and snapping
Brody is forced to climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath him
- He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the - 1 stuck there, seizes it
, He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth
He fires
And fires
Bullets shatter the shark's teeth, punching holes in the dripping snout
With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's shot hits the pressurized tank
30-foot cloud of water, steel, shark and debris covers the sky
gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body into the sea
The Orca slowly begins to turn over in its death roll
The shark's carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and debris
shadow clouds the waters, and the Orca's mass begins to slip into the frame
- Emerging from beneath the surface, he raises his mask, spits out his mouthpiece and kicks toward Brody
- Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, relieved the shark is dead, yet stunned to see Hooper is still alive
The two men share weak laughter, which soon trails off
Quint
No
(notices something ) You think we can get back with those
-    - They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats, as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the surface
What day is this
Wednesday
No, it's Tuesday, think
Think the tide's with us
Just keep kicking
'know,  used to hate the water
can't imagine why
: The two tiny, miserable heroes swim ashore as the credits roll
