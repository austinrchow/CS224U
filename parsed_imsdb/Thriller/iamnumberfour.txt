4 Written by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar 1/08/10 The events in this film are real
Names and places have been changed to protect the Lorien Six, who remain in hiding
Take this as your first warning
Other civilizations do exist
Some of them seek to destroy you

fingernail moon silvers the whispering canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise
:   ,
- the eternity of treetops until it It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden shutters
The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness
- Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the space
sleeps in one and a -  lies in the other
Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat
The numbing    fills the silence until The Teen's eyes fly open
Fear grips his face as he looks over at the Man, who is now upright and awake
They hold their breath, listening over the
It's louder this time
Unmistakable
The Teen watches as the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow and stealthily creeps to the door
The Man cautiously leans in and peers through the bamboo slats
: The empty porch
No sign of life
Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his face contorts
He looks down and sees the tip of protruding from his chest
As the sword is viciously protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted eyes and whispers his last, desperate word
- Run
: 2
- The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints through the maze of trees
Flecks of moonlight ricochet off the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck
He moves impossibly fast
Faster than any human could
as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins thrashing in pursuit
The Teen's face tightens with dread and the  of his pursuers hammer his ears
He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive
He races up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of 100--
as the Teen leaps across the abyss
He kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite lip
Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side
It utters a chilling   of frustration
Relieved, the Teen turns to make his escape when wraps around his throat
He is effortlessly hoisted by a with skin as cold and pale as alabaster
He wears the long red coat of a Commander
We catch the briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant
Silhouetted against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps towards the Teen
The boy's   echoes as the the pendant that glows brilliant-bright
: It glimmers to life on the ankle of another  10,000 miles away
His name's  and he's in the middle of a wild jet- ski race with

The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages on the beach
Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his opponents and victoriously pumps his fist
But his moment of triumph is cut short
His face contorts in agony as he feels searing into his skin
As he leans forward to grip his ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams across the water
- as Daniel crashes into view
Needles of light flicker from the symbol
It's cauterizing into his flesh like a brand
- Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand, clutching his ankle
He rolls onto his side as a gathers
leans down to help
Daniel, what's wrong
Did you break your ankle
But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from between his fingers and reels back
Oh my God
He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to his feet and takes off running
- The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines
Through the trees, we     of a figure outrunning the hurtling vehicles
- Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track
The pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique
He peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive
sits at the end
It's cake-frosting pink and is built right on the edge of a coral-white beach

- The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold
looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news feeds
He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French
Number 3 is dead
Henri's eyes narrow with urgency
He is immediately on his feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on the teen's ankle
It has stopped glowing but is painfully raw
Directly below this fresh wound are They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different
Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars
Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen
Did anybody else see this
Daniel's panicked nod
: -   - skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag
The walls are bare
No photos, no posters, no personality
Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables
Taillights in five minutes
What we can't carry -- -- we burn
know the drill
- It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an intricate geometric design
Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old Jeep Wagoneer
It's the kind with wooden trim
He looks at Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring
Time to go

Daniel clicks the  card from his cell phone, snaps it in two and drops it into the fire
Bitter, he takes one last look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep
As the engine  to life, It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk, and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail
: - The Jeep powers across the long elevated bridge
The dying sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues
(
) This is the part  hate the most
The running
But it's the only thing in my life that's real
The rest is a lie
My name
My birthday
Even Henri
People think he's my father
He's not
His job is to keep me alive
-  - Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil
The speedometer never brushes past 60
Daniel has his head against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod
(
) We are hiding from the Mogadorians
brutal race that wiped out our entire planet, Lorien
-  - Plastic flags whip overhead
Daniel leans against a silver and watches Henri negotiate with the
(
) Only nine children escaped the genocide
We were each given a number and sent here to hide don't know where the others are only know when one of them is murdered
-  - Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub
He gently unwraps the bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat scab that has formed over the wound

(
) got the first scar when  was eight
woke up screaming
We lived in Vermont
The second was on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in Michigan
was 12
Yesterday was the third
His finger traces the lines of the other two scars
- The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant farmland
The silver  charges through the bleak monotony
(
) Because of the spell our Elders cast, the Mogs can only kill us in order
That's the reason 've survived this long
But our enemy is relentless
-  - Daniel is asleep with his earphones on
Henri glances over, his mask of certainty momentarily slips
He looks like a soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won
(
) Now their hunt has turned to me am number 4
: -  - tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that  past, headed to destinations unknown
-  - Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes
Henri slides into the booth, all business
Florida's clear
sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers
didn't even get a chance to say goodbye
Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table

New IDs
Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name
Just when  think you can't get any less original, you lower the bar
'm not interested in originality
'm interested in untraceable
There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United States
(Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John
) John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away
Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him
-   - row of ancient arcade games blinks
John angrily stabs the buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches
They are alone
John's eyes never leave the video screen
It's been so long since the last scar
You got lulled into a false sense of security
That's my fault
John struggles to keep his temper in check
liked Florida
liked having friends
liked feeling normal
Henri's face softens with paternal compassion
wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't
Only now does John turn and face him
His eyes blaze with frustration
Then why fake it
Why not just go hole up in the wilderness
That's exactly what Number 3 did
8
John looks at him, confused
Henri pulls up an article on his iPhone and hands it to John
It's from an African news site man and his son went missing two nights ago
The locals think they were taken by strange beasts
John understands the implication
Piken
The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters
Blending in is our best protection
So we just keep moving from town to town
Until  say otherwise -- yes
John waits as a  passes through the room
His voice softens but never loses its intensity
want to be from someplace, Henri
You are
Lorien's your home,  don't even remember it
John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way
Like it or not, it's your home too
You have a responsibility to those who died
- Henri and John climb in
want a say in where we live
(off Henri's face) You already picked it, didn't you
9
Henri  the  to life
Cheer up, you're going to be living in Paradise
: frigid sheet of   the sign that's planted on the side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop: aWELCOME  ,
5,243a The silver  streaks past, its wipers working overtime
It kicks up a spray as it speeds down Main Street
The dinky storefronts are garishly decorated for Halloween
- The leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold
The barrels along the drive that twists through the woods
-  - Henri pulls up in front of a small house
It sits by itself, surrounded by trees
Water sluices off the weather-worn garage in the yard behind it
steps out of a minivan to greet them
She looks even perkier than the realtor in Florida
warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a fruit basket
For the record, she is called
What's your name
John Smith
Where are you from, John
Arizona
Why did you move to Paradise
Because you're an asshole
John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one
10
Because my dad needs peace and quiet to research his book
Henri nods and smiles wryly
This was a lot easier when you were 12
- The front door swings open and Annie proudly escorts Henri and John inside
Here we are
Home sweet home
They scan the faded interior
The place is in desperate need of a makeover
grandfather clock pensively  at the end of the hall
Annie remains relentlessly optimistic
First impressions
It's perfect
Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins turning on the lights
That's one word for it
Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag
Annie reads the strained dynamic
feel your pain
have a daughter his age
Apparently, ruin her life on a daily basis
John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring great Bernie Kosar
This guy was covering a hole in my wall
Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance
told the handyman to patch that before you arrived
'm so sorry
11
Henri is all charm, gently leads her to the front door
Don't you worry about it
She nods, grateful
We'll knock it off the rent
Keep the poster, Bernie Kosar brings good luck here in the Buckeye State
: - The rain has stopped
The wind  the trees
John lifts out the last box
As he closes the trunk, he doesn't notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out
-  - Henri is busy setting up his computer station
John dumps the box on the floor
That's the last of them
'm hitting the sack
need a new photo first
John crosses and stands against the wall
Say Paradise
John gives him a withering look
Henri flashes off a shot
The camera is cabled to one of the laptops
: The image of John pixelates onto a digital grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial structure
Henri turns to another laptop
've imputed the new search words: Daniel Jones
Big Pine Key
Sunset High School
You think of any others
Yeah, this place sucks
12
Henri swivels to face him
If there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it
Our enemy doesn't know who you are --  want to keep it that way
John nods, knows he's being a jerk
Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we were jet skiing
Henri types it in when something  at the door
Their heads instantly turn towards the sound
Tense
as another  echoes
Henri is on his feet
He flicks off the lights and silently signals John to retreat down the hall
With the cool air of an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek crystal-handled dagger
As he steps to the door
- '  - John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat
Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on
He holds his breath as the door swings open
He looks up and is relieved to see Henri
found our intruder -- he's a little small for a Mogadorian
At that moment, slips between Henri's legs
It cocks its head, studies John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek
-  - The dog greedily laps a bowl of milk
He's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags
Must have been dumped
13
You know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing
Henri considers the request, nods
John playfully ruffles the dog's head
What are you going to call him
Since  need all the luck  can get -- how about Bernie Kosar
: -  - John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of school
He dumps his backpack on a chair
Henri places a plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in front of him
Wow
You outdid yourself
What's up
Henri lifts a red backpack into view
John stares at it
already have a backpack
This one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld Keep it with you at all times
Henri, come on
Game's changed
You're in the crosshairs now
You have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice
With or without me
John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality
He pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out the door
Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out
It takes Bernie 2
5 seconds to race over and start to eat
14
- Jack-o'-lanterns stare out from the aHALLOWEEN  PARTYa banner strung across the red brick facade
Henri drives away
John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he hears a
He turns and is surprised to find The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white- tipped tail
John crosses to him, baffled
Bernie, what the hell
were you hiding in the car
He scoops the dog into his arms
(
) Hey,  was about to take a picture of the little guy
John turns and finds She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon
There is something about her unforced beauty that is instantly enchanting
John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous
He's not supposed to be here
( ) Go home
Now
Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home
He's really well-trained
How long have you had him
John turns away
Sorry about your shot
No worries
He begins walking towards the entrance
You just moved into the house on Old Mill Road
It's John, right
15
John swings back, concerned
Don't worry, 'm not stalking you
My mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age
Since  know every other face on this quad, that had to be you
() 'm Sarah
He nods
Where are you from
Someplace warmer
don't think that qualifies as an actual answer
need to register
She raises her camera to snap a shot of him
Whoa
What are you doing
Capturing your first day, even though you're technically six weeks late
Please don't point that at me
Afraid the camera's going to steal your soul
She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus
Annoyed, he covers the lens with his hand
What's your problem
said no
It's only for the yearbook
John regains his composure
16
'm not big into having my picture taken
Sorry
As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued monitoring the encounter
He's the star quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy
-    - Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a locker
He reaches for the combination lock when viciously sideswipes him
The textbooks scatter across the checkerboard linoleum
John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne, who offers him a taunting grin
John fights his urge to react and watches as Mark struts over to his
(
) Welcome to Paradise, irony not included
John looks at the teen standing two lockers down
He's got a battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an Army surplus jacket
This is   -- genius by birth, slacker by choice
He nods after Mark
His name's Mark Jayne
Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's three years into the best four years of his life
John begins retrieving the fallen books
Sam helps
Do yourself a favor -- stay off his radar
Didn't know  was on it
You were talking to Sarah Harte
She was talking to me
Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since Freshmen year
17
John looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around Sarah's shoulder
If there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down
You got a warning shot
John piles the books into his locker
Maybe 'll fire back next time
Look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater
Football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals
If you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves
You sound like my dad
Obviously a wise man
() 'm Sam by the way
Sam extends his hand
John doesn't take it
Thanks for the download
As he  his locker shut
: -   - It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers
The Junior gym class jogs around the track
John hangs in the middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in
They pass the  who are stretching on the pristine field
Sarah's eyes drift towards John
The  blows a whistle
Alright, people
Let's hit the gym
The assembled teens  and fan off towards the mouth of a tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers
18
-   - John emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage
Some of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling
Okay, half court, three on three
Girls have this basket, boys have that one
: Two simultaneous games are in progress
John sits on the sidelines waiting his turn
He avoids eye contact with Sarah who is sitting in the shadow of the basket
However, he does notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her
New kid, you're up
Show me what you've got
John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his way
He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing blur of orange
John swings back and catches the ball
Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice
goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard with such force that it Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards rain down
All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his momentary lapse
The Coach  his whistle
Enough
Hit the showers
( ) LeBron, grab a broom
As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah watching him
this silent exchange
: - is clutched in Henri's hands
He heads down the hall and stops in front of the grandfather clock
Its tarnished pendulum sways
He unlocks the glass panel and slots the Box out of sight behind the clock's brass face
19
Satisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes the key
When he turns back, he finds The dog is studying him with his head cocked
Let's keep this our little secret
Bernie's inquisitive eyes
: -   - John joins the line
He sees Sarah sitting by herself, inspecting a photographic contact sheet
His view is blocked by Sam
John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty
First day here and you're already destroying school property
So much for not making waves
John moves past him and grabs a tray
He's flushed and his face is now hot and red
It was an accident
hear the real spectator sport was Mark and Sarah's blowout
John wipes his brow, distracted
Dude, you okay
Fine
At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, , cut in front of them
Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder
You got a problem
Line starts back there
Football players get priority
20
Where's that posted
Unwritten rule
(: ) 'm surprised your boyfriend didn't tell you
Sam puts his hands up and backs away
Mark smirks at John
If you don't know your place around here, things can get rough
John holds his ground
In that case,  guess  better ask you where  should sit
was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend
In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into John's chest, knocking him to the floor
You want to talk trash
Let's see you back it up
John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of pain
He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see blooming from his palms
He quickly balls them into fists, extinguishing the light from view
Get up
has fallen
Still clenching his fists, John rises and stumbles out into the hall
Sarah's concern as she watches him exit
: -  - Henri is on a ladder, adjusting a hidden surveillance camera above the front door, when Bernie starts
It's an anxious, urgent
21
- Henri steps inside and sees the dog is  at -- shaft of white light blooms from within
The shadow of the swaying pendulum cuts across Henri's face
As he sprints for the door
: -   - Disoriented, John staggers down the hall
Sam catches up
Dude, hold up
John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight
You look like crap
'll get the nurse
But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction
: - Henri's  roars into view, whipping up a tornado of leaves
: -   - Strips of negatives hang on drying lines
John bursts in and the door
He slips off his backpack, opens his hands
-- the brilliant light from his palms shrinks his irises to pinpricks
The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows stronger every second
Suddenly, the door opens
John spins in shock
figure strides through the blinding glare, gently takes his hands and folds them into fists
'
John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face
Henri, what's happening to me
22
Calm down
You're going to be okay
John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands
On what planet is this okay
Yours
() need to get you out of here
-   - John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat
His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets
Henri leads him quickly down the hall
: -  - John fearfully studies his hands which have returned to normal, then looks over at Henri who seems oddly calm
Okay, start talking
What the hell's going on
Your first Legacy is starting to manifest
Legacy
An extraordinary ability
Yours is called Lumen
They start a lot sooner on Lorien
was beginning to fear yours would never emerge
You knew this was going to happen
Why didn't you say anything
didn't want to worry you
You were already under enough pressure
() 'm sorry
John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious
23
What else have you been hiding from me
: -  - The curtains are drawn
Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box
This couldn't be opened until your first Legacy appeared
Ready
John nods nervously
Henri places the fingertips of his right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid
John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the apetalsa fanned across the opposite side
momentarily glow and a   echoes from within
John and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box miraculously comes to life
Fissures of light sweep across the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami
Whoa
Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold
Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup, creating a new pattern on the lid
It's a familiar geometric symbol
John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his neck -- the symbols are an exact match
Open it
John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks
They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty
What are they
Crystals from Lorien's core
They'll guide us in your training
John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away
24
Place your hand over them
John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut- sized crystal floats up from the Box
It slowly begins to spin and project Our solar system
Henri points to a planet
Its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless
That's what Lorien looked like thousands of years ago
We had all the problems that Earth has today
The planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly Lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the Legacies started
John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his eyes
Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land masses become a lush emerald green
Only a select few developed these abilities
They became known as the Garde
That's what  am
Like your parents and grandparents
John considers this new information
The other children in the ship
Henri finishes John's thought
They're Garde as well
Once you've mastered your Legacies, we'll find them and face the Mogadorians together
John looks at Henri, curious
25
What Legacy do you have
don't have any and never will
'm your Cepan -- a teacher
My job is not just to protect you but to train you
() Give me your hand
Henri takes one of John's hands and pulls a cigarette lighter from his pocket
John flinches, unsure
Trust me
Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's outstretched palm
You feel that
Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin
But when Henri moves the lighter further up John's arm -- Ouch
John jerks his hand away
Henri kills the flame, shrugs
When we're done, your entire body will be shielded against fire
John rubs his singed wrist
You'll get other Legacies too
Flying would be cool
You don't get to pick them off a menu
As John spins to the door, the shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor
Mogs don't knock
26
Henri steps to his computer bank and examines a laptop featuring live feeds from a dozen surveillance cameras he's installed around the property
It's a girl
John looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise
-  - John opens the door and finds Sarah amped
How'd you do it
Her accusation startles him
Do what
Eviscerate the entire senior class
She pulls a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat
was in the darkroom before lunch and they were hanging on the line smiling and looking forward to the future
When  got back,  found 15 rolls of negatives wiped clean
John shrugs innocently
don't know what you're talking about
So you weren't in the darkroom today
No
Here's a tip
If you're going to lie, don't leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime
She swings his backpack into view
John is mortified
He struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to quell the feeling welling in his chest
27
don't know what happened
Maybe it's a sign that you should invest in a digital camera
Digital sucks
Film tells the truth
Clearly, 'm not going to get that from you
He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs into her car
John glances at his palms and is surprised to find they are dimly luminescent
- Sarah's car sweeps out of the drive and powers towards town, unaware of the truck parked in the shadows
is behind the wheel and watches as her headlights fade into the night
his simmering jealousy
- Bernie Kosar waits expectantly as Henri pours aDoggie Chowa into a bowl
John steps in
Everything okay
She was returning my backpack
He dumps it by the door
think you should stay home from school for a couple of days
'm fine
Just to be safe
: '  - John lies on his bed, staring at his luminescent palms, conflicted by his emotions
28
'  -  - Moonlight cuts across Bernie Kosar who is  peacefully at the end of the bed
John tosses and turns
He finally sits up, unable to sleep
-  - Nursing a mug of black coffee, Henri diligently scans the laptop screens
He's clearly never gone to bed
He looks up as John enters wearing track gear
'm going for a run
Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly
Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up
: : - as it soars above the rich kaleidoscope of trees
It almost seems to be following John, who is powering along a narrow track below
: John moves at superhuman speed, leaving a blurring wake of leaves
His foot splits a log as he bounds over it
: John charges towards a secluded stream
It's 30 feet wide
He doesn't slow, leaps off the bank and effortlessly hopscotches from boulder to boulder to the other side
: - It offers a high-def view of Paradise
John reaches the top and is exhilarated by the sense of temporary liberation
He alights in a nearby oak tree
John bends to tighten his laces, his eyes fall on the trio of scars branded on his ankle
His happiness dims
29
He grits his teeth and takes off for home
As he passes the oak, the     the gecko scampering down the gnarled trunk
: -    - Sam is at his locker
He glances over at John's, hoping he'll show
Disappointed, he joins the crisscrossing throng
: - John apracticesa turning his Lumen Legacy aoffa and aona
Henri watches as John's palms glow
John focuses intently, causing them to flare with sudden brilliance
Momentarily blinded, John jerks back and topples off his chair
: -   - Sarah sits in the stands, doing homework, watching Mark and the football team practice in the cold metallic floodlight
the ball is hiked to Mark
He looks for an opening and fires a perfect spiral to the  in the end zone
Mark thumps chests with Kevin and looks up at the stands, only to discover that Sarah is gone
: -  - John's playing asupercatcha with Bernie
He watches as the little guy races back from the woods, clutching a ball
Panting with exertion, the dog lays it at John's feet
John smiles, swings back his arm and hauls the ball again
: It arcs up, sails right over the garage and drops earthwards in the heart of the woods
Unperturbed by the superhuman throw, Bernie hightails after the ball
Henri steps out and watches, amused, then tosses John a pair of black driving gloves
John's eye roll
: -   - It's now fingerless and on John's hand
He weaves through the preclass crowd and is about to head into the chemistry lab when he sees 30
disappearing into a room at the end
He's torn, then makes a decision and does something he shouldn't -- he strides down the hall after her
-   - Sarah is alone, tacking photographs to a large board that's lying flat on the carpet
She hears the door , turns and coolly regards John
think you have the wrong room
She rises, walks past him and begins searching the photos scattered on the layout table in the middle of the space
Wanted to apologize
Does the apology come with an explanation
He turns to go, has his hand on the door when -- Wait
He looks back
Her face softens
How about we delete Monday and start over
She steps forward and extends her hand
'm Sarah
John
as they shake
She checks out his fingerless gloves, amused
Nice gloves
She crosses to the board, reaches down to lift it when John steps behind her
31
He effortlessly picks it up and hooks it onto the wall
They stand back
John stares at the collage of high school images that captures a life he'll never know
You know all these people
She nods

She studies him, sensing a kindred spirit
You ever feel you don't belong in your own life
Every single day
Wow
That almost sounded like a straight answer
They look at each other
There's a charged silence
The moment is broken when -- (
) What's he doing in here
John and Sarah spin to find Mark
Sarah is flustered
thought you were on two-a-days
Coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come
You didn't answer my question
John was helping me move some boards
John turns to Sarah
'm going to take off
Mark doesn't take his eyes off John and blocks his way
Seriously, Sarah, what's up with this guy
don't have time for this, Mark
But you had time to go to his house the other night
Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission
33
You were following me
Just trying to figure out what's going on with you
Sarah's shock turns to anger
You've crossed so many lines can't even speak to you right now
She hustles out of the room
Mark glares at John
This isn't over
John, unmoved by the threat
: -  - The sky is even pinker than the house

The place has been totally trashed
Floorboards have been ripped up
Sofas shredded
Nothing has been spared

She wears a biker jacket, combat boots and has a striking adon't-fuck-with-mea face
Frustrated in her search, she flings the desk against the wall
It splinters on impact

Raw gas The Teen Girl makes one final scan, then heads for the door
-  - The Teen Girl strides down the steps and crosses to a sleek Ducatti
She slips on a helmet
on her Arctic-blue eyes as they focus on the house with a strange intensity
34
The house detonates
The concussive force of the blast rips the structure right off its stilts
Tornadoes of flame through the windows as the house catapults into the air
Orange reflections flicker on the Girl's visor as she flips it down,  the motorcycle and - down the drive backlit by the glittering inferno
: -   - Sam catches John at the lockers
Nice freakout the other day
Wasn't feeling well
They twist their combination locks
Sam swings open his door, there's a   and It's the kind banks use to foil heists
In a shocking instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered
It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray
has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the ink pack planted in his locker
The spray misses his face but violently spits across his chest and arms echoes behind them
John spins and finds Mark and his posse
John's hands as he balls them and an angry glow flickers through his gloves
(to John, taunting) Told you it wasn't over
Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks
He frantically clears his locker, looking for something
He finally pulls out a photo which drips with ink, reels at the jocks
Assholes
John looks back at Sam
Mark seizes his chance and launches a sucker-punch at John
But John sees it out of the corner of his eye and in a blur of motion whips up his hand and 35
'
John squeezes it vice-tight
Mark grimaces in agony
His buddies back into the    that has gathered
John leans in close
That sensation you're feeling -- remember it
With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers
Mark  a door and slides to the floor, his eyes flaring with lacerated pride
Show's over
The crowd disperses
Mark gets to his feet and exits with his friends, but shoots John one final wounded glare
: -   - Red, ink-stained water Hitchcocks down the drain
John wrings out his black -shirt
He sees Sam's reflection in the mirror
Sam puts some clothes on the bench

He holds up a puke-green sweater decorated with red snowmen
John turns back to the sink

Nobody loses anything cool
He sits and begins to change
Dude, the way you thrashed Mark back there
Awesome move
John acknowledges that with a nod
Whip-dries his shirt
Sam plucks up the photo
The ink is now dried and cracked
Who's in the picture
Sam stares at it, nostalgic
My dad

John strides towards the tree line, headed home

) John
He turns in surprise as Sarah approaches

'm sorry

He starts off again
broke up with Mark
He stops, slowly turns back
've been thinking about doing it for a while
today just finally pushed me over the edge

He studies her face
Why are you telling me
She bows her head, suddenly embarrassed
don't know
You made the right call
The certainty of his voice soothes her
She looks up and holds his gaze
Their attraction is undeniable
Halloween Block Party's tonight
saw the banners
'll be on Main Street hiding behind my camera if you want to swing by
He says nothing
wasn't expecting an actual response
could text you later
Do they have cell phones on Planet John
She holds out her phone
John looks at it tentatively, then takes it
As he inputs his number, he hears the  of a car horn, looks up and sees Henri waiting in his
- John climbs in
Wasn't that your friend from the other night
Her name's Sarah
() didn't ask for a ride home
Principal called
Said there was an incident
38
John stares out the window, guilty
guy was messing with me
took care of it
Problem solved
You're stronger and faster because of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores
It was no big deal
Don't blow it out of proportion
You can't risk everything over wounded pride
wasn't looking for a fight
It just happened
Get off my back
Henri pulls a printout from his coat
John unfolds it
: It's from the Florida Keynoter website and features a photo of the charred stilt house
John's gut churns as he stares at the image
Article says it was arson
We were clean
There's no way the Mogs can track us here
Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off
They can track us anywhere think it's time you saw what you're really up against

Henri and John stand in the middle of the space

is open on the floor between them
John lifts his hand and holds it over the crystals
It's white and as thick as two fingers
It floats in front of John's face
He tentatively reaches out
When he grips it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally and transporting him into - rock and the  of the dying echo hustles    through the murderous bombardment
The air is choked with ash and smoke
The boy is 7-year-old John
The man is his grandfather
Young John glances up and sees eclipsing Lorien's two moons
The angular hulls of the craft are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash an endless crisscrossing
(in Loric with subtitles) Keep moving
- It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome
Young John and his grandfather race up the steps
-  - statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore, towers in the middle of the chamber
His noble face is illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight
Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and straight into the path of The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles
Swords drawn, they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat by a crystal-handled dagger

spurts from the wound
The Soldier's body fractures like glass and  in a shower of embers as he drops to the floor
The other Mogadorian spins and trades sword strokes with It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into the Mogadorian's chest
The Soldier  in a cloud of  cinders
Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps towards him and pulls back his hood
'
He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him
John's grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck and places it over Young John's head
This is your Cepan
Go with him
No
Your life is my life now
will always protect you
( ) He must survive
scorches across the space
Henri spots hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him like a curse
They are already hunting you
Go
Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs young John and charges up
As the Commander breaks cover, Henri hurls the dagger
dives out of its path but  as the blade - across his right cheek like a hot poker
41
- Henri yanks Young John by the hand
They take off in one direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other
suddenly swoops between them
The  of its occupants ricochet through the night
The heat from its engines washes the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as two bay doors open
Young John looks back through the heat- haze and catches a impressionistic view as leap out
Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws
The Piken mercilessly rip into John's grandfather
Young John races to help, but Henri wrenches him back '  as he screams
Nooooooooooo
and we
: - screaming
Nooooooooooo
He drops the crystal and stumbles back
The experience has left him traumatized
Henri steps towards him, but John is too overwhelmed and runs out
-  - stone angrily  across the water
John is about to toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view
He ruffles the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the woods and crosses to his side
saw my grandfather
saw what you did to the Mogadorians -- you saved my life
lot of Lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live
42
John is still trying to process the memory
He said  must survive
The Elders had a plan
You weren't on that ship by chance
The nine of you were chosen for a reason
Even if only two of you live, together you'll pose a grave threat to our enemy
Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone
You saw what they did to Lorien
How can nine or six or two of us take on that army
It's hopeless
Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk
never thought we'd get off Lorien alive -- but we did
didn't know how we could survive on a strange planet -- but we have
gave us six months before the Mogs found us -- it's been 10 years
Don't give up now
Henri grips John's shoulders
You have the potential to do great things
Even if you don't see it -- do
How can you put so much faith in me
Because your life is my life
If you quit, then everything 've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless
() Remember -- nothing is inevitable
The fragile  is broken when John's cell phone
He scans a text
43
It's Sarah
The Block Party's tonight
'll say  can't make it
Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion
No
go
John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture
You've had enough for one day
: -  - Halloween parade drifts past the  packing the sidewalks
Icicle lights twinkle in the trees in costume zigzag past John
It's small-town Americana at its best
waddles by holding a 's hand
John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store
'    - An annoying  plays as the door opens and John enters
The store is deserted
The stock needs to be updated and the shelves could use a dust
Sam approaches wearing an apron
You work here
Not by choice
(pointing to sign) Ed's my stepdad
He's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they'll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods
John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter
put those on special tonight for any wannabe Jason Voorhees
Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a -shirt emblazoned with the words aFuture Supervillaina
44
Screw this
Let me lock up
'll hang with you
He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view
What about your stepdad
He hit the tavern at 6:00
He's already hammered by now
'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep
Every night is trick a r treat at my house
- John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the road bordering the woods
Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton candy
John subtly scans the crowd
She's over there
John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some dunking for apples
She pulls the camera from her eye, sees John and smiles as he approaches
You made it
(re: Sam's shirt) Like the -shirt, Sam
Guidance Counsellor said  need to set goals for myself
Figured 'd aim high
She looks back at John
What do you think of Halloween in Paradise
John regards a particularly over-the-top float
They should pull out all the stops next year
Well, you haven't had the full experience until you've been on the Haunted Hayride
45
She motions to the picnic area where  are lining up to get on tractor-pulled hay wagons
The wagons lurch through the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods
Give me a sec
She steps to the face-painting booth
It's sponsored by the local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie
Sarah hands Annie her camera
Sam whispers to John
'm impressed
Before John can respond, Sarah steps back
You guys ready
Three on a wagon might get a little crowded
'll meet you two on the other side
He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement
John and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away
Sam's cool
Definitely unique
haven't really talked to him since 8th grade
Mark had a tight circle
If you weren't a jock or cheerleader, you didn't exist

Me too

Not even a flinch
None of this scares you, does it

He smiles
You can smile

What was that
Just part of the ride

He drops to the ground like a sack

In a blur of motion he reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by their coats and hammers their skulls together
As they drop, John spins to meet his other two foes with The assailants are illuminated in the phosphorescent glare
They're not Mogadorians but rather One is Mark Jayne's buddy Kevin
They're wearing zombie makeup and military fatigues and have night-vision goggles strapped to their faces
John angrily strides forward, palm outstretched
- : Everything is an overexposed blur until -- John brutally clotheslines one, then pummel-rams Kevin in the chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a tree
Kevin slumps, out for the count
John arcs a glowing hand through the darkness
He plucks up the Jocks' fallen goggles and heads off with Terminator-like determination

She
Let go of me
She futilely tries to wrestle free

Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam
Sarah
She doesn't answer
He hesitates a moment, then charges into the woods

Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand
: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles
Where's Sarah
Tell me
Shepherd Falls
Now turn off that damn flashlight
John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15 feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed

: 50
-  - rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall which drops into a swimming hole below
The Zombie Jocks carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark
She's wild-cat angry when she sees him
Are you crazy
Where's John
Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away
Relax
It's a practical joke
swear if you hurt him -- Why do you give a shit
Get out of my face, Mark, you're pathetic
'm the best thing that ever happened to you and 'm giving you one more chance
Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave
Don't walk away from me
Mark grabs her
Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance and falls back on the ground
Mark's rage is transplanted by concern
He steps towards her to help when -- (
) Back off
Mark watches John step out
Blood trickles from a cut above John's right eye
John
Are you okay
He nods
Mark looks past him, confused
Where the hell are Kevin and Joe
John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles
51
They got spooked
Hey, those are police property
John flings them over Mark's head into the water
'm going to kill you
With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him, pinning him to a tree
Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's arm up behind his back
John
Stop
Mark is in real pain
Transfixed with anger, John keeps twisting
Sarah looks at him, pleading
That's his throwing arm
But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps him across the face
Startled, John lets go
Football's all he's got
John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods
Sarah offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John
- John charges into view
John
Wait
Sarah catches up
'm sorry,  didn't want you to break his arm
'm not mad at you
'm mad at myself
She stops, faces him

had no idea Mark would pull something like that
He has seriously gone off the deep end
The guy's in love with you
Wants you back
That's not love
Their eyes meet in the moonlight
Walk me home
: - It's a picture-book perfect neighborhood
Most of the houses are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb- festooned trees
John walks with Sarah
They come to the prettiest house on the block
This is me
John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the porch
They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins

Wait until the Christmas decorations go up
My mom decks the halls with so many lights, you can see our house from space
Stray -- race past
She motions to the cut above his eye, concerned
You should see a doctor
For this
Wouldn't waste their time
She looks at him, curious
You're not going to tell me how you took out those football players, are you
53
He says nothing
She smiles
really don't get you
She steps closer
But  feel like  can trust you
You can
The air is charged
Good night
Sarah swings open the white picket gate
Wait
As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her
Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his passion
However, as their kiss intensifies, -'- rise and hover in midair
Sarah has her back to them, but when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs grinning back
Startled, he pulls away from her
instantly drop and  onto the porch, their candles blowing out on impact
Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'- lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells
Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an explanation
He does his best to cover his stunned reaction
Fat drops of  begin to fall
John puts up his hood
better go
Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour

Bernie is asleep on a blanket
John creeps into the darkness, soaked to the bone, when -- 54
heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight
Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee
Bernie wakes
John pulls off his hood
Henri looks at the cuts and bruises on John's face
They won't talk
That was a stupid thing to do
What were you thinking
They attacked me
If  hadn't defended myself, 'd be in the right now
Would that have been the better choice
( ) You've got to start trusting me
Emotionally charged, John points his finger at Henri, accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically Coffee and shards splatter across the floor
Henri looks at John, stunned
John shrugs sheepishly
was getting to that
got a new Legacy
Henri absorbs that revelation
Telekinesis
That's a big step
Must have been triggered by the fight
John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze
need to teach you how to control these abilities
We'll start working on that tomorrow
The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive They cross to the bank of computers
Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard

What is it
Henri pulls up a website
We got a hit on one of the search words

It's handheld and jerky
It - over some sand and joins a group of Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf
He's holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers
John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes
That's Sand Dollar Beach
Looks like a cell phone camera
There's enough for the Mogs to your face
Can you take it down
Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands
Working on it
'm sorry, Henri
This isn't your fault
There's still nothing to trace us here
Henri glances up from his screen
This could take all night
Get some sleep

The garage adjoins the house
The lights are out

It takes a second for his eyes to adjust
pickup sits under a white tarp
There's no sign of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him
've narrowed it down to three possibilities: you're a genetic experiment, you're a freak of nature, or you're an extraterrestrial

Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face
Your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you took off faster than an Olympic runner

(') () Did  leave anything out
John silently reels
What do you want from me
just want to know who you are
John looks at Sam, realizes he's not going to give up
He hesitates, then finally surrenders
'm a survivor from a planet called Lorien
Sam absorbs this confession with awe
Your dad
he's from there too
Henri's not my dad
He's my Guardian
If he found out you knew about us, we'd be gone by morning
() don't want to leave Paradise
won't tell anyone
John nods, grateful
There's something  want to show you
: The tarp is whipped off the pickup truck
It's an old Ford
Sam and John stand before it
The cops found it abandoned in the middle of Route 20, just south of White Sands, New Mexico
It was my dad's
He went missing six years ago
He was on one of his crazy fact-finding trips
He believed we weren't alone in the universe
Sam rubs his hand across the hood, wondering
58
Mom figured he was having an affair and took off
All these years thought she was right
Now you're here
That doesn't prove anything
It proves he wasn't crazy
'm starting to think that he didn't bail on us
that maybe something else happened out there -- that he was taken
The moment is broken by the  of the front door and the sound of
Sam instantly tenses
Guess the bar closed
(
) Sam
Where are you
His speech is slurred and aggressive
(
) You think  wouldn't hear you locked up early
John looks at Sam, shocked and concerned
You going to be okay
If he finds you here, it'll be worse

Sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and heads inside

John flinches, wanting to intervene, but finally turns, hustles under the garage door and slips into the night
: -  - Henri is hammering at the keyboard of one of his computers
John enters with two mugs of coffee
59
You look wiped
Henri turns and smiles playfully
wasn't the only who was up last night
John nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies
Sarah texted me
went over to her house
Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers
've tried every trick  know, but can't crack that blog's firewall
There must be a way
We need to find where the site's located and take it offline manually

The liquid instantly  and we realize John's lying in gasoline
He sits up, rests his hands behind his head as the  harmlessly lick his face

John stands 20 feet from Henri and nods
Henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball server
John's face is a mask of concentration as the yellow balls fly towards him
He holds up his hand and the balls It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his hand
They hang there
John sees a smile sneak onto Henri's face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to collapse and the balls to drop into the mud
: - Bernie looks like a drowned rat
He's sitting in the tub being scrubbed by John and Sarah
don't see any family pictures around
guess the photo aversion is hereditary
He greets the observation with a shrug
She carries on
Your mom
grandparents
Is there anyone else in your life
They died
'm sorry
It was a long time ago
It's just me and my dad now
John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle's ears
62
get the feeling he doesn't like me very much
It takes him a while to warm up to people
Sarah considers this
Thanksgiving's tomorrow
Why don't you bring your dad and celebrate with us
don't know
Are there going to be a lot of people
tsunami of relatives
But don't worry, 'll shield you from the wave
Besides,  want everyone to meet you
She playfully splashes him
Their faces inch closer
They begin making out hot and heavy until Henri suddenly walks in
've found the -- Caught in the act, the teens lurch away from each other
Just giving Bernie a quick bath
You're clearly putting a lot of effort into it
better hit the road
( ) See you tomorrow
Twoish
( ) Bye, Mr
Smith
John as she hustles out
-  - Henri sits in front of his computers
John enters with Bernie, who is wrapped in a beach towel
He begins drying the dog in front of the fire
Henri breaks the silence
63
finally tracked the location of that blog
It's a house in Warsaw, Indiana
About four hours from here
'm heading up there tomorrow
Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving
told her we'd be there
Send my regrets
You shouldn't go alone
It could be dangerous
won't risk taking you
'll leave early and be back by five
John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude
Don't you ever get lonely
Surprised by the question, Henri swivels to face him
How could
have you
You know what  mean
All these years, there's never been anyone
We aren't like humans
Once we fall in love, it's for life
The pain of separation is unbearable
Henri's face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up
As he heads into the kitchen John studies him with new eyes
-  - Steam billows as Henri washes up
He keeps his back to John when he enters
John waits then softly asks
What was her name
Henri slots a plate onto the draining board
64
Anastasia
You left her to save me
You're not responsible for what happened to her -- they are
He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal concern
looked at her the way you look at Sarah
() She can't come with us when we leave -- and we always have to leave, you know that
John nods, not wanting to deal with that reality
was hoping to protect you from that pain
You can't protect me from everything
Henri's sad smile of acknowledgement
: '  - The Halloween decorations have been replaced by a Thanksgiving display
Wearing khakis and a pale blue Oxford, John tentatively walks up the front path
The warm sound of  drifts from inside
He takes a breath and rings the doorbell
- '  - It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life
Every inch of counter space is filled with platters of food
John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving feast
rush in and out in a manic game of tag
John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration -- things he's never known in his own life
Sarah steps over
She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress
65
Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty
- '  - The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an elaborate pine cone centerpiece
Sarah places the last turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table
She smiles at John
You look dazed
Just taking it all in
She crosses
'm glad you came
They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes
Don't mind me
She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera
Let's get a picture of you two lovebirds
Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye
Mom
No
John really doesn't like having his -- It's okay
Let her take it
The gesture means the world to Sarah
He puts his arm around her
Sarah nestles her face against his
As the flash : - '  - Red candles flicker
Sarah's  is expertly carving the turkey
Everybody is at the table
John sits next to Sarah
She holds his hand under the table
It's Hallmark worthy until the carriage clock on the mantel

66
John looks at his phone
No messages
His brow creases with concern
He turns to Sarah, whispers
need to check in with Henri
He exits
- '  - John speed dials as he steps out into the cold
He holds the phone to his ear
It rings three times and then is answered
( ) Henri
The call is hung up
Suddenly on edge, John redials
This time it's picked up immediately
( ) Henri
(
) ( ) Are you one of them too
John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone
( ) Who are you
Where's Henri
John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it, panicked
He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea and punches another number
( ) need your help
- '  - The food is getting cold
Everybody is waiting for John
Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look
'll see what's taking him so long
- '  - Sarah steps out just in time to see John climb into a pickup truck
It's the one from Sam's garage
67
John
He looks back
It's Henri
have to go
Sorry
her confused disappointment as the truck  away
-  - Sam is behind the wheel
Thanks
owe you
Anything to get out of Thanksgiving at my house
He offers John a weary smile
checked out that blog on the way over
Saw the video
What was the deal with your ankle
John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars
Death scars
They kind of look like the symbols in my dad's research
() You guys don't -- Abduct people
No
Irritated, he covers them back up
How about the ones you said were hunting you
They're capable of anything
() We need to get to Warsaw -- now
68
Suddenly, John's cell phone
He snatches it up, but is disappointed to see the name aSARAHa flashing on the
He hits ignore and the truck hurtles into the dark
: - It's a dilapidated Victorian
Mist shrouds the yard which is littered with junked cars and trash
The pickup crawls to a stop in the shadows across the street
- The teens sit in silence
Number 417
Henri tracked the to that house
Sam scans the street
don't see his  anywhere
He would have parked it across town
Sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver
Stole it from Ed
() Let's move
John yanks Sam's arm away from the door handle
called you because  needed a ride, not a sidekick
If  could have run here,  would have
() Go home
'll call you when  get back
Sam as John climbs out alone
- It's graveyard quiet
John nervously sneaks down the side of the house
His breath fogs as he inch- up the wooden 69
He squats in front of the door
He holds up a luminescent palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior
: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter
The sink is swamped with dirty dishes
The light washes across a semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes
(
) See anything
Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him
told you to go
They might know where my dad is
John realizes Sam is determined
He sweeps his hand back over the kitchen door
His palm illuminates a familiar -
It's lying on the counter by the fridge
Henri's here
John aturns offa his palm and reaches for the door handle
Sam anxiously swats his arm away
Wait
Other than strength, speed and night-light, what powers have you got
Telekinesis -- but that's a work in progress
No invisibility, -ray vision, flight
Sam, we drove here
Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up
Okay
'm ready
Let's do it
But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light suddenly turns on and a  enters
He's built like a wrestler and goes by the name of
70
-   - With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty
He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door
-   - John and Sam are gone
Frank steps out and locks the door
He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs
the butt as it cartwheels into '
He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch
He frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub
John clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette between his fingers
Once Frank's safely around the corner, John releases his hand
The duo silently climbs onto the porch
John squats in front of the door
His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the lock and concentrates
Hurry up
Hurry up
Hurry up
There's a
You just dead bolted it
Way to go
New plan -- follow Lucky Strike
Text me if he comes back
Sam sneaks off after Frank
-   - as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door swings open
John cautiously crosses the threshold
He holds up his right hand, dims his palm to a dull-blue glow
He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into
-   - Everything is filmed with dust
It's freezing and John's in the hazy aura his palm casts
The naked floorboards
Fear bites as John scans the lifeless gloom, not sure where to start
as it brushes a mousetrap
71
His breath catches in his throat
He aturns offa his hand
His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the noise
But nothing does
As his eyes adjust to the dark, he notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door that leads down into
-   - The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends
The space is illuminated by a single naked bulb
The sound of hammers the silence
John scans the rabbit warren of rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner
Henri
He races over
But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat
John turns too late and the bat strikes his left side
He drops the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing
The man, , raises the bat again
John focuses his mind
whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who ducks out of the way as the bat flies past
Confused, Bret lurches forward
John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs
knocks the light as he topples into a column and  onto the cement, out cold
It's over in a violent blur
John sits stunned for a moment
The swinging bulb casts surreal shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically aunlocksa the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag
Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings
You shouldn't be here
Your life is my life, remember
Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze
talked my way in
Thought the big guy was buying it
He rubs a wound on his neck
72
was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind
some sort of animal tranq
() 'm getting rusty
Suddenly, John's phone
It's a message from Sam -- aGET
a We have to leave
John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's hand grabs John's ankle, tripping him to the floor
Henri
Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for good
John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as head down them into view
Frank holds the revolver against Sam's neck
Their shadows crisscross under the swaying bulb
Stay planted or 'll blow your friend's head off
Henri looks at John in shock
(: ) He came to help
John and Henri put up their hands
John focuses on the gun, but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to
Henri body-slams Frank, sending the revolver skittering
But as he wrenches Sam to safety, to the pickup fly out of Sam's pocket and slide under the stairs
John flashes on his palm, casting everything in eerie blue light
On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon
It's almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by an invisible force
73
Sam looks over at John, impressed
( ) You're the one from the video
You're the one they're after
With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against the ceiling
Tell me what you know
Franks says nothing
John trains his palm light on the big man's face
It's like a blinding interrogation lamp
Start talking
don't know what they're called
The one in the red coat said he'd kill me if  didn't do what he wanted
This revelation stuns Henri
The Mogadorians
they've been here
Frank nods in terror
He told me to call if anyone came asking about the video
Sweat beads John's face from the mental exertion
Did you
(: ) They wanted me to hold your friend until they got here
Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger
We need to go
Now
John areleasesa Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale and is knocked out
At that moment, a razor-thin line of dust drops from the floorboards above
74
John immediately extinguishes his palm
The trio stands frozen, necks craned up, ears pricked as the floorboards above them
They are definitely not alone
-   - stalk through the house
Their long black coats  sweep
One sniffs the air like a bloodhound and motions towards the basement door
-   - -- the door is shredded off its hinges and flies down the stairs
The Mogadorian patrol storms through the cloud of splinters
Frank and Bret lie where they fell, but there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam
Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small blacked-out window
He punches out the glass with his fist and catches sight of Sam clambering over the back fence
- John, Henri and Sam pile in
Sam, get us out of here
Sam reaches into his jeans, then frantically checks his pockets
must have dropped the keys
Henri keeps his cool, looks at John
Start the engine
can't
Henri's calm eyes never leave him
Yes, you can
John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes
The engine   but doesn't start
Sam looks up the street, panicked, as 75
climbs out of a black  and storms towards them
Hurry up
John's brow is furrowed with concentration
The Mog unsheathes his sword as he runs
With a superhuman leap, he lands on the hood --
John and Henri spin out of the way as the sword  the windshield and impales in the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair
As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck
The engine  to life
The Mogadorian tumbles off the hood, magenta light spurting from his wound
John turns to Sam, who is petrified, and
Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas
The Mogadorian  in a frenzy of embers
The truck bursts through the blizzard of sparks and - away
: -   - the swish of a familiar red coat as its owner slowly descends the stairs,    his right hand, which methodically twists two meditation balls, He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa
His men part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who are chained to chairs
Soldier stands behind each one
Frank looks at the Commander in terror
called you like  said
It's not my fault they got away
The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the window
We get our first good look at his face
gnarled scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien
His skin is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint
Where did they go
76
His accent is thick and his voice is unnerving
How should  know
The kid had me pinned to the ceiling
The Commander turns to Bret
Where did they go
Bret is too freaked to even speak
The Commander nods to the Soldiers
They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank open their mouths
Frank watches in confused terror as the Commander holds one of the meditation balls
- suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin
With cold-blooded calm, the Commander drops the ball into Frank's mouth
its terrible -
: - Vermillion clouds streak the heavens
Sam's truck pulls up next to Henri's , which is inconspicuously parked in front of a 24-hour pharmacy
- John turns to Sam
We'll meet you back at the house
We're not going back to Paradise
( ) Thank you for your help, but you'll never see us again
Henri climbs out
Sam looks at John, confused
Is he serious
John nods, numb
What am  supposed to tell people
77
Nothing
Forget about us
We never existed
() Goodbye, Sam
Sam as John climbs out
: - It's a rundown dump on the bleak edge of a no-name town
- John silently stews
smoke at the edge of the grimy pool which is drained for the winter and rattles with frozen leaves
Henri steps out of the motel office with a key
- Henri lets John inside, chains the door and draws the sun- bleached curtains
We leave at nightfall
Henri, this is insane
They still don't know where we live
Henri seethes
It's only a matter of time
They know our faces
They saw Sam
How long has he known
Since Halloween
Henri is floored and hurt by the admission
trusted you and you lied to me
John bows his head, can't meet Henri's gaze
Only because  knew how you'd react and  didn't want to leave Paradise
Henri paces, tries to quell his emotions
78
Now we don't have a choice
The Mogs are using humans to trap us
From this point on -- no more towns
No more schools
We're going off the grid until we find the others
No
His tone is defiant
This isn't a discussion
In a flash of pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and telekinetically sweeps Henri off his feet and pins him against the wall
Henri looks at him, stunned
'm not leaving without saying goodbye to Sarah
Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare
Let
Me
Down
Spent, John releases Henri who slides to the floor, shaken
The dynamics of their relationship forever changed
Henri finally stands
Give me your phone and IDs
John hands him his cell phone and wallet
Henri opens the back of the phone and pulls out the  card
John Smith dies today

She's kneeling by Frank's severed head which has rolled a short distance from the body
The Photographer pulls the camera away from his eye and looks at the Teen Girl, confused
Who the hell are you
She ignores him
He glances at the only window which is 20 feet away on the other side of the room
How'd you get in
The Girl continues examining Frank's wounds
Totally unnerved, the Photographer shouts up the stairs
Hey, we've got a live one down here
When he spins back, the Girl is gone, vanished into thin air

He tries to avoid eye contact, but she is determined
What happened last night

But his number's no longer in service
Forget about him, Sarah
Incredulous, she grabs his arm

John waits as Emily exits
'm sorry about last night
She pulls away, her relief turning to anger
No
Not good enough
Sam said you were never coming back
What are you doing here
couldn't leave without seeing you one last time
She looks at him, crushed
So it's true
What's going on
What kind of trouble are you and your dad in
We're going to be fine
Damnit
Whatever it is, 'll understand -- just tell me the truth
The truth is 'm not who you think am
You need to forget about me
Okay
Why are you acting like this
Because it's the only way to keep you safe
Safe from what
He turns away, shields her from his torment
Goodbye, Sarah
He doesn't look back as he walks out the door as she sinks onto the bed and the dogs comfort her

Immune to the heat, John heads into the front hall and finds is fully engulfed
Fearless, he clambers up the flaming steps
His jeans and shirt catch fire
He's almost reached the top when the staircase   behind him and in a cloud of embers

John beelines towards Dozer's which reverberates over the   of the fire

Don't let go of him
promise won't let go of you

Please don't look at me like that

It is for me
Who are you
(off his hesitation) For once please tell me the truth
It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do
My name isn't John
don't have a name, just a number

In fact, my whole life can be reduced to numbers: like 15 million -- that's how many light years it takes to get from my planet to Earth

Or 3,671 -- that's how many days 've been running from an enemy that wants me dead

Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul

Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree
She steps towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek

It was an accident

Only now do we sitting in the back
His face is masked in shadow
We're hunting for one of the guests at your party
He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo footage of John's rescue of Sarah
It's posted on YouTube
Do you know this boy
Yeah, John Smith
But  didn't invite him
He's a fugitive
We've been tracking him for some time
Mark smirks, vindicated
'll help you find him
He points to Sarah's image on the screen
He's not at Sarah's,  already checked
And one of my dad's deputies drove by his house -- nada
He poses a great threat to us
Where else could he be
Mark pulls out his cell phone
've got Sarah's cell number, maybe you guys can trace it
The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men in the front
He looks back at Mark
Tell me everything you know about John Smith
: 90
'  - Sam is at the kitchen counter, watching the YouTube video on his laptop, when headlights bleed through the blinds
'  - Sam steps out and reacts in surprise as Henri emerges through the headlight glare
John's not at the house
Is he here
No, but he's all over the internet

He turns back to his
Sam follows
Those things from Warsaw -- they're coming, aren't they
Go back inside
This isn't your fight
The hell it isn't
'm coming with you
this declaration
: -   - The crystal pendant glints against John's chest as he grabs a aParadise Higha sweatshirt from a supply closet and yanks it on
Sarah's phone suddenly , startling them
( ) Hello
She listens, then hands John the phone
It's Henri
: 91
-  - Henri careens through the night with Bernie and Sam
( ) Where are you
High school
Get out now
At that moment, all the  in the school  and the headlights of an  flash across the window
Fear registers in John's eyes as he realizes
Too late
they're here
- The Commander climbs out
Mark follows but is distracted as a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a tractor trailer from which inhuman  echo
What the hell's in there
He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the trunk of the
Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers
He backs away in fearful realization
You guys aren't
Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck and constrains him
The Commander pulls over his broad shoulders
The cartridges are made of crystal and swirl with purple light
Finally, he slips on his trademark red coat and spins towards the school
-   - One of John's hands holds Sarah's while the other lights their way as they hurtle down the passage
They've almost reached the doors when they suddenly fly open and 92
struts into view
We  her as the mysterious Teen Girl
She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and  right at them
scorches the air between John and Sarah but takes out the who was stalking up the hall behind them
John watches in shock as the Mogadorian keels over and  into embers
John swings back to the Teen Girl as she strides forward
6
You oughta keep your heroics off the internet
Who the hell are you
Number 6
Where's your Cepan
On his way
Where's yours
Dead
The Mogs got her four months ago
We had been tracking them
She heads past
John and Sarah follow after her
Tracking them
We discovered they plan to attack Earth
The only thing standing in their way is the six of us
The revelation hits John like a wrecking ball
You know what that means
John nods with new purpose
The war starts tonight
First we have to get out of here alive and find the others
Six leads them past the impressive trophy case
93
What are we up against
There's a commander, a bunch of soldiers and two Piken
They'll have all the main entrances covered
The gym, there's a tunnel under the stage
It'll take us out to the stadium
Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod
Six grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back against the wall
They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers prowls straight past
He stops for a moment, then turns the corner
Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and sees there's no reflection
We're invisible
John realizes, turns to Six
You got any other Legacies
can control the elements
You
Lumen and telekinesis
More
John turns and watches in horror as the Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps into view
The Commander is holding He is ashen with fear
Sarah has to catch herself from screaming
John makes a move, but Six holds him in place
Stay put
They want to draw you out
He's not dying because of me
94
They're heading past the trophy case when '  booms out of nowhere
(
) Mark
Linoleum
Now
Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy case
Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens against the far wall
The Mogadorians  as they flail
John, Sarah and Six break cover
John wrenches Mark to his feet and they take off running
They dash around the next corner and find , sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians
Six raises her hand-cannon,  one of the Mogs away, while John safely leads everybody into
-   - ( ) Barricade the doors
John telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly across the space and block the door
Sarah turns to Mark who is totally shell-shocked
What are you doing with them
They said they were
That John was a fugitive
What the hell's going on
You've stumbled into a war
So shut up and keep your head down
see age hasn't mellowed your attitude, 6
Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked
didn't know they were trying to kill you
(genuine, to John) 'm sorry
95
This isn't your fault -- it's mine
He offers Mark his hand
Mark shakes it
Suddenly, Bernie begins to
What is it, boy
Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes
He's telling us to run
They take off a second before - through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and paper
It utters a glass-shattering
John looks back and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground
Bernie
He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself at the monster
Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck
He's hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken tries to buck him off
Then something amazing happens -- He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing
His features become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns
Bernie's a Chimera
He came with us from Lorien
Guess  wasn't the only one keeping secrets
Somebody had to watch you when wasn't around
They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle
96
-   - John and Henri catch up to the others
The gym's this way
projectile  past John's ear and  a row of lockers --
-- it's like an incendiary grenade
The paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by
sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts
One another round
John telekinetically  a door off its hinges
It flies forward, blocks the charge and
John spins back and  -- Go
Go
Go
They take off
John follows and uses his telekinesis to fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the fiery onslaught
But the rounds are coming too fast and a projectile  him in the back
It's like being hit by napalm
As  wash across him, he looks up and snaps on that run the length of the hall
deluge sprays, dousing the fire
With his clothes smoking, John tears around the corner
The Mogadorians charge after him, but find She blasts them at point-blank range
Magenta light gushes from their wounds
Like rain hitting hot coals, their bodies  as they crack and cinder
Keep moving
Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view
Then John sees something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze
'
It utters a low, predatory  and launches itself forward
Oddly, Six doesn't move
She closes her eyes and lays one hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to 97
In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an icy tunnel
The sprinklers spray snow
The Piken struggles to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip- slides after John and Six, who disappear into
-   - The doors are  as the Piken flails off the ice
It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids to a stop
It  in humiliated , and its red eyes scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen
The Piken prowls behind the serving counter
Snow beads off its back
Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing something
It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans that are stored below
They're invisible
John clutches Six's arm
They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes
Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken pokes its head further
Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare right at them
With a final frustrated , it carries on
-   - Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view
Sarah stops, panicked and afraid
Where's John
Right behind us
He offers her his hand
She's about to take it when steps out of the shadows
There is nowhere and no time for Henri and the others to run
But as the Mogadorian squeezes the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall
They are still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug
The creatures  through the opposite wall and out of sight
It's over in a violent blink
-   - John and Six sneak through the shadows
She steps to the door, but it won't budge
98
They've blocked it
Use your telekinesis
We're not leaving without my friends
Don't you mean the girl
John ignores the jibe and turns back
Six grabs his arm
broke the Elders' spell to find you
The Mogs can kill me now
We have to go
We stay and fight
his determination
-   - Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark hide in the one opposite
Henri pulls a selection of weapons from the backpack
He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark
You know how to use one of these
My dad's the sheriff
He slides two across the floor
The door opens
They swing up to fire but find -- John and Six
Save it for the Mogs
Let's go
-   - Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which like dominos
Gashed and exhausted, the battling duo - into Water  from a broken pipe
The Piken slips on the slick tiles
As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck
99
desperately thrashes
Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's side
Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe finally jerks to stillness
As Bernie sinks to the floor, he back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding
-   - John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the side of the stage
The door's over here
The tunnel leads out to the stadium
Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of metal doors
John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and whips the chain free
The doors fly open, spring out of the dark
One tackles Henri while the other blindsides John
Henri struggles until The  cinders the Mog's head clean off
Henri looks over and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks
The second has John pinned when it suddenly  in agony and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing She sheathes her dagger and helps John up
Saving your life
My new hobby
Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and Six
-- three Mogadorian knives razor the air
One impales Six in the shoulder
She slumps at John's feet
Henri opens  on the who storm towards them
John  to Sam and Mark
(: ) Get her down the tunnel
They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel
Sarah glances back at John and follows after them
Henri takes out a Soldier
John sweeps up his hand and 100
The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the planks rip free of their nails
John and Henri charge into the tunnel
The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher stand rolls forward to seal the entrance
-   - Sarah is in the lead
Sam and Mark follow, holding the wounded Six
They've almost reached the end when lurches into the mouth of the tunnel
Without a second's hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and  it
Mark looks at him in shock as they race through the embers
Sam shrugs
play a lot of Xbox
-   - Sam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field
When they reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when John and Henri burst out of the tunnel
Don't stop
Get to the woods
She nods and exits with the others
John and Henri head onto the field after them when leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them
It's seriously pissed
It bounds straight towards John
Its fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards him
At the last second, nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the Piken's jaws
The creature shakes him like a rag doll and flings him 50 feet down the field
John watches, anguished, as Henri lands in a heap
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John
It almost seems to smirk
Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood
John's face hardens into a mask of rage
101
He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges
As it springboards into the air
'  -- as they suddenly clench
-- as they're  clean off their bases and fly skyward
-- as the Piken's shadow washes across him
-- as it arcs towards John with its mouth open and teeth bared
Suddenly, the goalposts spear its flanks, impaling it like supersize  forks
The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks onto the 20-yard line
John watches impassively as the red life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side
- The stadium looms in the distance
Sam wrenches the dagger from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch
-   - John sinks by Henri's side
Henri
Henri  as John cradles his head
His coat is soaked with blood and his torso is horribly mauled
John tries to drag him to his feet
Come on, taillights in five
won't be coming with you this time
Save yourself
We go together
Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment ' flies past John and impales Henri in the chest
Henri utters a  and his dying eyes meet John's
Find the others
His voice is a
102
Your life is my life
always
His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip
Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily flicker with a radiant blue light
He angrily spins to face But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air
He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers
John's feet kick uselessly as he's lifted face to face
Number 4
Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like mocking trophies
Your Cepan saved you on Lorien
The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty
He wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse
But this moment was inevitable
The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it
John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him
This is the moment his adolescence officially ends
This is the moment when a warrior is born
as it  into a million pieces, which flutter to the ground like glittering confetti
John stares at the alien with calm confidence
Nothing is inevitable
'
The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene torches
He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers
'  as he realizes it's over
The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction
'
103
John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell
- Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the night sky
Her breath catches in her throat
Oh my God
John
Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting for the stadium
-   - It's a smoking ruin
The seats have melted into puddles
Sarah bursts into view
She looks across the devastated field
The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet of stubble
Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians
John
She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope
Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes completely burned away
She stops, puts her hand to her mouth to stifle a sob, when he  and stirs
John
Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side
They wrap each other in their arms
Neither wanting to ever let go
: -  - The sky is cracked with the first light of day
Sarah is dressing Six's wound at a table
Six winces
Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't cover extraterrestrial dagger wounds
Six smiles, grateful
Thanks
104
As the two teens size each other up,   Mark
He hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are talking intently by the motorcycles
John is now wearing a pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket
The Sheriff's Department is starting to put up roadblocks
You guys better get moving
Six and Sarah join them
You good to go
Don't worry about me
John nods to Sam
Sam, ride with Six
We don't need baggage
Sam steps in front of her, determined
have to find out if the Mogs took my dad
Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam
You slow us down, 'll shoot you myself
Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions
want to come too
You need to stay here
Why
You could have died last night
'm not putting you in danger again
Mark's promised to look after you
105
Tears tumble down her cheeks
don't want to say goodbye
'll come back for you
When
When it's safe
She bows her head, anguished
He gently lifts her chin
Where 'm from, we only give our heart to one person
've given mine to you
() love you, Sarah
Their lips meet and they kiss
It only ends when John hears an   in the woods
They turn and watch as limps into view
Blood mats his fur and his face is scratched but he's alive
John's relief
: - Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle
John holds Bernie as he straddles his Harley
Bernie morphs into a gecko and darts into his pocket
Sarah studies John and Six, unsure
John  the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah
He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at Mark's side
spits as the motorcycles start off
(
) This is the first town 've left without Henri
The first one have a reason to come back to
John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to brand the image of their faces onto their memories
- The bikes blur past the aWelcome to Paradisea sign
106
(
) He warned me the pain would be unbearable if  left her
He was right
- straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness
(
) But  don't regret it
The pain reminds me what's at stake
dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view
(
) We must find the others and face our enemy together
'm not sure how we can stop them
But nothing is inevitable
know that now
Thunderheads darken the horizon
(
) am Number 4
His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the battles yet to be fought
He's ready to face a future unmapped and uncharted
Ready
