We are panning across the words on the side of the plane
on a tray table
Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it
Hands are counting the money
The airline hostess announces the arrival at  - in
hand reaches into a breast pocket - pulling out two passports
One is opened
Belongs to
The next passport belongs to
The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to him
We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table
The passport is set down
Oleg picks it up
We hear Emil's voice in The scene is subtitled in
(
) Just do what  do
Say the same thing say
Don't open your mouth
(
) Okay
-   - down a long line of passengers
They are split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for visitors
finally arrives at
An unshaven Czech in his mid-30's
Tall, scraggly beard
Piercing blue eyes
He's dressed in an outdated suit
His eyes are alert, cunning and smart
, stands in line behind Emil
Oleg is big
Not tall - but wide
wrestler's body
Emil looks at Oleg
(The following is in  and subtitled in
) Don't fool around
Okay
Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to take a picture of himself
Did you hear what  said
want to document my trip to America
Next
(Emil steps up) Could  see your documents, please
Yes sir
He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an image swipe
Emil glances furtively back to Oleg
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States
Two weeks holiday
How much money are you carrying with you
have five-hundred dollars
Can you show me
Sir, no cameras in the area
Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration Officer
Oleg puts the camera away
Smiles sheepishly
(') (to Emil) Is he with you
Are you travelling together
Yes
Please join us
(to Oleg) Come on forward
Is there a problem
No, you're travelling together
want to talk to you together
Hi, how are you
Can  take a look at your documents
(takes Oleg's passport) Are you related
Yes
he's my friend
Okay
You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national
How do you know one another
Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off
We are both from Prague
(to Oleg) How long are you planning to stay
Two weeks
'd like to speak for himself, okay
He doesn't speak English
speak English
(to Oleg) Then answer my questions
Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here
New York
Yes, we're in New York now
But where are you planning to stay in New York
cheap hotel
What are you coming here to do
'm here for movies
Movies
to be in the movies or to see movies
Yes
No
Both
When  was a boy, see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra
Ever since  want to come to America
Land of the free
Home of the brave land where anyone can be anything
As long as they are white
Excuse me
He made joke, bad joke
First time on airplane
The  comes over to see what the problem is: Well, they've got valid visas, but they don't have much money
Uh
and 'm not
uh,  think there's a possibility they may be coming to live and reside
Look how long the line is
We gotta move 'em out
'll take them down to secondary
Emil looks at Oleg, pissed
'  - The place is empty except for one table at the end of the bar
, Manhattan's most famous detective, and his savvy, black partner,   are having cocktails
Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired
Not only is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen, he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been the subject of several magazine articles
There's even been a  movie about one of his biggest cases
Leon has been with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the  movie
Sitting with Eddie and Leon is  , host and star reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story
"  Hawkins is also the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and
Wait staff bustles in the b
g
doing the morning set up
Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war story" and a vodka tonic at the same time
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go say, lemme get a cigar outta the car go to get the cigar and
All the sudden  turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go
Right where  was standin'
That coulda been it coulda had my head blown off and for what
Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over
If hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit -  would've had my head blown off
Jesus Christ
, the owner, walks up
Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay
Another martini
Coffee for me,  gotta slow down
Vodka tonic
(rethinks it) Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell
Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of vodka
(') (of Eddie's story) It was freaky, 'll tell you
Stupid kid
What's the kid gonna say - sorry
Meanwhile 'm not here anymore
Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan
Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk
Who knows
But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and 'm thinkin' that's me
Sooner or later
That's me
Sooner or later that's everybody
Not chopped up
Not chopped up like that
mean, what do  got left
Coupla articles
medal or two
Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore
think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie
'm not moody
Hawkins and Leon share a look
Isn't he a little moody
Of course he's moody
He thinks he's in love
In love
With who
Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table
Takes a seat next to Eddie
Eddie asks Hawkins
How old are your kids
My kids
Let's see
Susan's 15
Aundrea's 9
Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid
How old are you
Never mind
Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole
(beat) It's all true
Before  had kids when friends talked about their kids, wanted to vomit
Now --  get it
Am right, Leon
Absomotherfuckin'lutely
You can have all three of my ex-wives
But somebody so much as looks sideways at my four girls -- 'd kill 'em
(takes out his wallet) You haven't seen my youngest have you
As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings
(') Yeah
Paulie, you've got kids, right
My kids don't talk to me anymore but they were great when they were young
(into the phone) Sure it's him
Great
(collapses the phone) Unique's home
They all rise from the table
Paulie,  need the cure
Step into my office
Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave
So you got your kids listening to Opera
You still singing in the church on the weekends
- Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg
They've been there a while
The   is looking Oleg
Okay
You work in a vodka factory understand that
(to Emil) And what kind of work do you do
am butcher
You're a butcher
What do you use pig intestines for
You stuff sausage in it
And what do you do with the bones
Dog food
Emil looks at Oleg
Blaming his stupid responses at Passport Control for their detainment
Are you married
No
Are you proposing
through a thousand
face plunges towards us
Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink full of ice
He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot eyes
Presents a small black ring box to the mirror
Will you marry me
Wanna get married
What are you doin' Saturday
Leon enters
Eddie turns
(') 'm gonna propose
When
Tomorrow
At lunch
You ready
Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes
Turns
The thrill of the hunt
love it
- Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop action
Each stands with an old suitcase
(in Russian) Look
Times Square
Just like in the movies
(in Czech) Don't speak Russian
(in Russian) Why
Why do  always have to speak to you in Czech
(in Czech) Because  don't like your ugly language
heard enough of it in school
Now speak Czech or English
And don't fool around anymore
You almost got us thrown out
Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it
This is who they came to see
Emil hails a
Oleg is staring inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor videocamera's pointed out in the street
Look
New videocameras
Color viewfinder
Image stabilization
Solarization
Night vision
We have no money
Come on
Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this
Emil slides into the cab
Where you wanna go, buddy
Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope
Points to the return address on it and passes it through the slot to the Cabbie
Here
Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg
Then, Oleg hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his coat
He flings both suitcases in the trunk,  it shut and jumps in the back seat
He opens his jacket - pulling out the  he just stole
(') Go
Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil
- Eddie's car pulls up
Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out
So what's unique
Not what
Who
Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed - covered in blood
(') He's from Antigua
His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on
they were late for a party
Stabbed her with a beer bottle
That's unique
Yeah
And he still went to the party
Leon moves to a  - gives him a twenty
Top floor
Back room
Yeah
make big cases, they make the news and  look good
But the problem with becoming a star is downtown
They shoot at stars
Now be quiet
Shhh
As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads
Waves them off
They hurry away
(') hope this prick doesn't run
My knees are killing me
Stay behind me
You're worried for my safety
'm touched
Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend the fire escape
(') Ready
Keep them out of my way
Okay
You ready
Yeah, yeah
Jesus
Eddie closes in
(into his cell phone) , '
Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley
Where he lands dropping his gun
Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up
What's your rush
Going to a party
Why you chasin' me, man
don't know
You always come outta your house that way
It's not my house, man
don't live here
Well, sounds like burglary to me
Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie
know you man
An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene
Disgorges a mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust
(to Eddie) Any chance we can do that again
Again
didn't wanna do it the first time
- The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone
Oleg gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope into his jacket, then steps up to the old building
He looks back at Oleg - who's  him
Turn that off
Get the bags
Why should  carry your bag
am not a dog
For five years  paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if  say so
(challenging) Unless you refuse, Oleg
Oleg looks at Emil
Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil, he fears him
He picks up both bags
Emil searches the occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building
(') There
5RW
Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW
clicks and Emil pushes it open
'   -  - The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the stairs
Oleg cradling his camera
Emil notices a crack pipe on the floor and picks it up
Smells the bowl
What
Smell like chemicals
for smoking drugs
Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving down the dirty hallway to a corner door
'   -  - He
approach
The door is opened by  - a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls
He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway
Oleg films him
Emil
Surprise
Surprise
Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to , his comely wife
'  - Emil pushes his way inside
Oleg follows
Milos wears plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex
Tamina has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace, bracelet and big pearl earrings
The room is furnished with kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas
The only anomaly is a
(The following is in Czech and subtitled in English
) Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding
Did you hurt her
You know me
never hurt anybody
Where's the money
Hello, Tamina
Oleg is looking Tamina over
Milos - though scared - barks at Oleg
Take your eyes off her, Oleg
(to Emil) Look
It wasn't my fault you two were caught
(of Oleg) It's his fault
Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number
wasn't going to wait
Milos
Get my money
Oleg videotapes the scene
All we see behind it is a '  and her wet hair - she obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped around her
(nervously) We spent it
Ha
Ha
Look at the way we live
'm a plumber
You think 'd be working if  had money
Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her throat
(') Emil
Put down the knife
Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified
(') Emil
'll help you
Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm him by talking softly
(') can get you a job
job
Yes, the money is good
As a plumber
It's easy to learn
job
As a plumber
You think come to America to work
We started over, you can too
(furious) You spent all the money while  was in prison
Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets
Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily it toward Milos' chest
Oleg videotapes it
Then lowers the camera - shocked that Emil killed Milos
Blood sprays Tamina's face
She tries to run but Oleg grabs her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the floor
He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at Emil who  Tamina - absolutely enraged
flees
Emil hears  in the bedroom - a window opening
Emil kicks the bedroom door open
Sees the window leading to the fire escape
He dashes to it
Sees four flights down - the , wearing a summer dress
Barefoot
Her hair still wet
She looks up
She is beautiful and terrified
She runs down the alley
(') She saw
Emil hurries toward the bathroom
She just got out of the shower
Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair
Emil grabs the purse
Finds a
He opens the cover, stares at her photo and name
(') Daphne Hanlova
There's one stamp in the passport - from the
when she arrived - June 16, 1998
Underneath is written - 6 Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all blank pages
(') Six month visa
Still here two years later
They'll deport her if she goes to Police
Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the floor
He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans and bottles aside
What are you looking for
Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies
'm going to make a bohemian barbecue
Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into darkness
- face comes from the darkness
It's an athletically handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us
He's in a tie and jacket in Central Park at
He is  ()
sensitive man of rugged honesty
He runs down the hill in a hurry
steps in his path
Got any spare change
How 'bout a spare twenty
Look,  don't have time for you, get out of my way
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money
The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm behind his back
With his other hand, Jordy whips out a 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind the mugger's head
Jordy displays his shield
Okay, you're under arrest
Now you happy
Fire Department
Firemen don't carry guns
Oh yeah
Guess again
Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and credit cards
(') Nice - how many people you ripped off tonight
Get up
As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his  goes off
(') You couldn't listen to me, could you
Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree
Cuffs him so his face is pressed up against the bark
(') 'll send a cop back for you
Hey
'mon, you can't leave me like this
Some freak'll come by and stab me
Jordy jogs off across the park
(') Wait
Come back
'  - from three battalions
Radios
There's a crowd growing
Jordy pushes his way through
The top floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been reduced to smoking ruins
The trees are covered in debris and soot
Jordy moves to  - Battalion Chief
Lieutenant - take up your line and relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top floor
Hey, Louie, were you first due
Yeah,  radioed you guys right away 'cause you got two roasts on the top floor but you don't hafta investigate cause homicide is up there
Homicide
Who let them up
didn't make it a crime scene yet
Hey, it's Eddie Flemming
(
) Yo, Jordy
- an overweight arson investigator with a quick with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a turnout coat
(') Where you been, man
We got a celebrity
heard
Who the hell let them up there
don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph
You see anything in the crowd
Anybody suspicious
Naw - 'm sure the suspect's not here
Oh yeah, why
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now
'  - The roof is gone
The sky is exposed
It's charred ruins, smoked beams and watery muck
Eddie and Leon are standing by what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's charred bodies
Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar, listening to Leon
So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried
What do you think, Eddie
Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can
don't know
We got the experts here
Show them what you found -  hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help
Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the celebrity
Nah, not at all
Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin
My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie
Could you put out the cigar
Part of the job is picking up scents
Oh, sure
Eddie puts his cigar out
Carefully slides it into a cigar holder and pockets it to finish later
Well,  found - check it out - crack pipe
Looks like they got careless
Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs
Korfin shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe
(') Mind not shining that light in my eyes
Sorry, bro
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine
It gives us somethin' to do
No, we don't mind
You mind Leon
No
Go ahead
Thanks
Appreciate it
Jordy throws a look at Korfin
Homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals' investigative skills
Eddie rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and living room
Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes
Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got good patterns - about thirty minutes old
Jordy moves to one of the corpses
He pulls on a white rubber glove
Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth
The glove comes out white
Mouth's clean, too
Clean
Don't blow your nose
Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose
(') The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out
Let it run
But you knew that, right
Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief
Jordy turns back to the corpses on the bed
Eddie - in the other room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up
That's what it looks like to me
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other
You got to hand it to them
(realizes he's wrong - blows it off) Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight
Leon watches Jordy, quietly
With a pair of tweezers, Jordy pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the heads
Korfin supplies the paint can
Jordy drops the cloth inside
(') What was that
Evidence
Of a homicide
That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom
(') You know what that is, right
No, what is it
Why don't you explain it, Bobby
(to a fireman joking a wall) Hey Camello
You mind punching a hole in the floor
No problem
(to Eddie and Leon) Excuse me, gentlemen
You might wanna back up a little more
Don't wanna get your pants wet
Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt set
Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon
As Camello hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the bodies and Korfin explains: They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed
To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident
Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for something
What's he looking for
timer
Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up - on the other end is a timer
Korfin takes the timer from Jordy and moves to Eddie
Here you go
big double homicide
'   - As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a   is arriving
Jumps out
Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car
They open the trunk
Take off their muddy boots throwing them in
You see Eddie's face when  gave him the timer
Wish  had a picture of it
He knew all along
What
That's why he was so quiet
He was testing us
Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer inside
, young and attractive, pushes her microphone at Eddie
She's smart, aggressive and respected by her peers
Detective, does it look like a murder
We don't know that yet
It's much too early
There's a lot to be done
How many victims are up there
There are two bodies found at this point
Can we go up to the crime scene
You know you can't do that
'mon
Is it drug related
We don't know
When  have more 'll let you know
Nicolette signals for her camera man, , to zoom in on Eddie's hand
She barrels on
Detective
what's that you're holding in your hand
Evidence
Mike pans up to Eddie's face
Other reporters arrive, hurling questions which Eddie easily answers
Cameras flash as we    Korfin and Jordy
Jordy is about to get in the car as he notices, back behind some construction - She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress
She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy
He only catches a glimpse of her
He starts toward her -- knifes through the crowd - but Daphne is gone
What
There was a woman -  think she wanted to talk to us
She looked scared
Oh shit
Oh no
- Korfin's car  to a stop
Jordy leaps out
Suddenly, Jordy stops
the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is now
You motherfuckin' bastard
She stripped me
It was a bag lady
She touched me all over, it was disgusting
Jordy unlocks the handcuffs
'm sorry
'm really sorry
Korfin delivers a blanket
Jordy covers him
(') You okay
dog pissed on me
'm gonna sue you for this
You violated my civil rights
Your civil rights
You tried to rob me
could arrest you right now
You're lucky you're walking away from this
Now get outta here
Jordy gives him a push
The Mugger wraps the blanket around himself cursing - hurrying away
8TH  - Exhausted  who have worked all night loiter outside a sleazy hotel
up to a blinking hotel sign
- The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into the room
Emil is at the window pulling the blind down trying to shut out the blinking light
He pulls it down twice and it pops back up both times
The third time he angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely
He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow behind his back
is on
Roseanne has been talking to a
(
) So you slept with your son's wife
What's that all about
(
) take full responsibility for sleepin' with my daughter in law
had low self esteem,  thought  had to compete with him
Emil reaches for his dictionary
(mutters) Self-esteem
Self-esteem
He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self esteem
(
) Losin' my job and everything, caused my behavioral disorder
(turns to his son) Forgive me, Kirk
Let me hug you
The audience boos
Roseanne mediates
Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's  screen - rewinding Milos' murder
We see it now for the first time - as he rewinds it
Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka between his legs
Emil, looks up from his dictionary
He's wearing Milos' Rolex
Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet
Emil looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera
(Czech) Turn that fucking thing off
(Czech) 'm not filming
'm watching Milos die
It's just like a move but realer
Emil grabs the videocamera
(Czech) Don't break it
Don't break it
Speak English
(English) You said speak Czech
How you erase this
'll do it
Don't hurt my camera
Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka bottle in order to catch the camera
Oleg, holding the camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away
Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet
Stupid, Milos
didn't want to kill him
(noticing) What's this
Emil found the last card in the wallet
It's pink with a picture of a busty globe
Printed in the middle is - - and a number
(') Worldly escorts
Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages - finding the meaning of worldly
He gets up and dials the number
soft,   answers
Soft music in the background
Hi
Hello
Are you looking for companionship
Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil
Whore
'm homesick
You have Eastern European girl
Czech girl
Matter of fact,  have a lovely Czech girl
take her
Send her
91 - Korfin's car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is returning
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him
Yeah
Maybe you can be his stand-in
91 - The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from the high of fighting a fire
Korfin and Jordy walk toward the  room
The  is on in the background
We can see Nicolette interviewing Eddie
He holds up the paint can
(
) What the hell is that
You gave Eddie Flemming the evidence
They turn
- the head of the arson squad - comes over
Duffy's tough, Irish and very political
(pointing to the ) Who did cause and origin
Who do you think, Chief
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it
They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs
Don't you guys understand
It's all about image
The better we look the more money  get to pay you guys overtime
Yeah, right
What was that, Korfin
said, yeah, you're right, Chief
As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media
You do that, wiseguy
Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does
They all head upstairs
- The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter
There are posters of pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls
- a Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk
Hey guys,  got your torch
He just gave a full confession
scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia, turns
He is , a pyromaniac in his 40's with a freshly scratched cross etched in his forehead
He craves attention
It's my fire
Screw homicide
'll tell you guys everything
Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin
They sit across from each other
Duffy keeps going to his office, not even bothering to stop
What's that on your forehead, Max
That's a nice attention getter
Yeah, 'm religious
'm not an Atheist like you
Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not
How did you start the fire this time
used an accelerant
Yeah
What kind
(to Jordy) Hey, by the way, 'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you
Max
(continuing) Yeah, and with your old man dying last year you - what's it
Just you and the dog now
Max
Does it feel bad -  mean the new guy your ex-wife's seeing -  hear he's a big shot downtown
Jordy pops out of his seat
That's it
You're outta here
Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle
That's it
'm suing
Get in line
Korfin takes over - throwing him out
Jordy turns to Garcia who is laughing
What's so funny
How does he know so much about me
Who tells him my life story
He hangs around downstairs
The guys talk to him
He's a joke
He's no joke
One day he's gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big
Okay
Okay
We'll ban him from the station
-   - As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen, accompanied by a catchy  , Robert Hawkins introduces America's highest rated 'news magazine' show
Good evening, 'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story
Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store
But now, Mr
Geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim
According to Mr
Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist
Hard to believe
watch
(
) Louder
and  over to Emil, sitting on the hotel bed watching the
He looks at us
(') Louder
Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the volume
The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew
He's sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt
showing of his artwork is displayed in the background
Patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact
One of the paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties
These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor
Your doctor
Yes
My psychiatrist didn't insist that stay on my medication
so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but 'm not morally responsible
My psychiatrist knew what was capable of
How could  know
'm not a doctor
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
Look, 'm a victim here, too
was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now 'll never graduate
My life has been permanently disrupted
Permanently disrupted
Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money
Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist
Look, 'm in here
You call this a career move
And isn't there a movie in the works about you
We're in negotiations, that's correct
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
That doesn't apply to me because 'm not a criminal
'm not a criminal wasn't convicted
Emil leans forward - listening
Fascinated
love America
No one is responsible for what they do
There's a  on the door
Our   swings over to it
Then  back to Emil
Emil looks at us
(') Get in the bathroom
(
) Whatever we do - we fuck her, right
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up
Emil turns off the
Our  backs into the bathroom, closing the door but leaving it open a crack
Emil looks down at his shoe
The   down to the kitchen knife sticking out of Emil's
Emil's hands pull his pants cuff over it
up to Emil as he moves to the door and opens it
It's not Daphne and she's not world class
Hi, 'm Honey
Where's Czech girl
Baby, 'm anybody you want me to be
'm a little schoolgirl, 'm mommy, 'm a Czech girl
She enters
Closes the door behind her
(') Now  like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure
Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser
ordered a Czech girl
Daphne, you know her
Oleg  in for a   of Honey
During the rest of the scene Oleg films her
Honey begins to undress
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment
don't meet the other girls
Aren't you gonna get undressed
Where is escort service
That's confidential
Could you put the money on the dresser
like to talk to the person who runs the service
Can you give me address
Look
Do we have a problem here
There's no reason to have a problem
'm gonna make you feel real good
You wanna Czech girl
After 'm done with you, you won't miss her
Now why don't you pay me
She starts to unfasten Emil's belt
(stopping her) Listen to me
don't want sex
Just give me the address and then you go
(suddenly hard as nails) Look, man,  don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time
Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and  her against the door,  the blade against her throat - suddenly furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina
Give me the address
Alright, alright - don't hurt me
Please, it's in my book, in my purse
Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out with a can of mace,  Emil's face
Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame
He back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking the door but Emil's   it shut
Emil turns blindly, rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door
Honey darts toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into Oleg who is
Horrified, she turns around as Emil  her in the face so hard she topples backwards, tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on her
Like a panther out for the kill, Emil
Oleg films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping
As Emil's hand comes   - then  ,
Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around her face
Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges : 91 -    - , a sketch of her face
(
) Her lips are fuller than that
You can see 'em a mile away
Food containers are scattered all over the place
The female looks at Jordy
Stacks of failed sketches sit beside her
What about her cheek bones
Her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes were huge
Big, blue eyes and when saw her, she looked scared
Like she was looking to get away
But she was absolutely beautiful
The composite artist looks at Jordy
(') gotta good look at her
Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the landlord of the 7th Street brownstone
Garcia is also on the phone
The other investigators are gone
Working late into the night
Everybody's exhausted
It's almost dawn
-- From Czechoslovakia
And how long have they been livin' in your building
(writes 4  on his pad) Alright, 'll be in touch when we know somethin'
(to Jordy) Milos and Tamina Karlova
They were quiet and kept to themselves
Landlord don't know who your girl is
How long they been livin' here
You hear that question, Garcia
Yeah,  got Immigration on the phone - they've been here illegally
Well, they're definitely permanent residents now
got the owner of the plumbing company Milos worked for
Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go see him in the morning
You go home
'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene
Aren't you tired
If  go home  won't be able to fall asleep anyway
Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn't a bad likeness and heads for the door
Korfin falls in behind him
As they pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address
(of the picture) She keepin' you up
Like to meet her, huh
She'd make you forget your ex wife
Cure your insomnia
'  - picking up Jordy as he enters what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment
The roof has been burned off
He moves into the next room, trying to see through the darkness - looking through the muck and char
Okay to smoke
Jordy turns, surprised
Eddie sits on a singed chair
He pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton soup' container, smoking a cigar
On the arm of the armchair is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the crime scene and the burned bodies
It's your crime scene now
You can do what you want
Watch the news
Nah,  musta missed it
Well, just so you know
gave you guys the credit
Well, just so you know,  don't care about that stuff
Nah, why should you
don't even watch
Good
Good
Commendable
Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back
Did you get a report from the
Sure
But  would like to ask you something
You got a problem with me
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too
(then) What about the report
You were right, they were both dead before the fire
The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine
That's usually an indicator of something personal
Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne
Hands it to Eddie
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here
Pretty
(acts as if he didn't notice) Hmmmm
Maybe you don't care about that either
(beat) Prettiest suspect 've had in awhile
Who says she's a suspect
Jordy tries to take the sketch back
Eddie holds on
What would you call her
Look, 'm not even sure she has anything to do with this
saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead
Maybe she saw something
Maybe she was visiting somebody here
Who knows
Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were
Obviously they weren't having sex
As you pointed out
So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that
Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message
Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe
It could be to humiliate them
Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell
Eastern Europe
Like what
Romania
Hungary
Or Czechoslovakia
The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years
These are very intense people and they take things personally
Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it
Yeah
Where
You sure it was a knife
Uh-huh
Really
Okay
(to Jordy) We've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue
stabbing
Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian
Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch
'll come with you
There wasn't a fire
There'll be nothing for you to do
can watch you, Eddie
Maybe 'll learn something
This isn't homicide school
My parents are from Poland
can help with the Eastern European angle
You're Polish
My folks are
Stay here
-   - Video  of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and picks up a copy of
Eddie's photo is on the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires
Underneath his picture the caption reads, "
'
"  The videocamera widens out revealing Emil standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the front page
The videocamera turns around - until focusing on Oleg himself
This is second day in America
First day was very exciting
Full of thrills and chills
Over there, is co-star of my new movie, Emil
He turns the camera around -
(to vendor) Who is he
New York's finest
This is his case
The  - picks up People
Stephen Geller is on the cover
(') This all you want
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights
(People) In here, says he wants a million
Million
The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview
And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her
It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country
Look, you want magazine or not
Yes
Both
And these
Oleg picks up  ,  and  magazine
Emil pays for everything
(to Oleg) Get a taxi
Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases and hails a taxi
As Emil collects his change he sees an old waiting at the crosswalk
The light's blinking (') Let me help
Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side
Thank you, son
Emil watches her walk on
- The hotel room is a hive of activity
is dusting the dresser for prints
Another officer is stripping the bed and putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag
As Eddie enters the crime scene, a   is standing in the doorway taking pictures
Where is she
Takin' a bath
Any
Still unknown but we're running prints
Kid over there caught the case
Jordy enters
Leon steps in his way
(') Sorry
only
It's okay
Eddie walks over to a young detective
, only 26, is excited to meet Eddie
Tommy Cullen
Heard a lot about you
Nice to meet you
Here's what we got
girl in there, figure her to be a prostitute, looks like she was fighting for her life
She's got defense wounds on her hands
Right this way - in the bathroom
After you
Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom
There's blood splattered all over the walls and the floor
Honey's topless body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain
, an Irish medical examiner (
), is examining the body
Room was registered to a Francis Capra
Capra
That's not Czech or Russian
Who said he sounded Russian
The clerk
Check the switchboard, see what phone calls were made from this room
'll do it
Tommy heads out
Eddie takes out his cigar holder
Slides out what's left of his cigar
Re-lights it
Looks down at Honey's body in the bathtub
Gil's dusting the tub for prints
Clothes were off in the other room
Tub is dry except for the blood
Any of you guys take a piss lately
Gil looks confused
Eddie points to the toilet
Seat is up
(') Do the seat for me
Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it
Eddie stands in the bathroom - studying the scene
Holding the unlit cigar
Looking around at the blood splattered walls
(') Only one guys checked in
Yeah
'mere
You wanna go to homicide school
Here - make yourself useful
Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall
(') Our killer
our killer's standing here slashing at her
She's fightin' him
The blood is splattering this way
It's on this wall
(pointing to the right of Jordy) And there's some specks over here
(to the left of Jordy) There's nothing here because someone was standing right here
Someone big
And he's got blood on him
Lots of blood
He wouldn't walk out of here like that
(turning to Murphy) Murphy, what kind of knife you think we're talking about here
Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the blood-splattered wall
If you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks aren't deep but they're kinda wide
not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife
What if the tip was broken off
Could be
Then we should find it here somewhere
think we've already found it
Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young detective, returns
There was only one call from this room last night
dialed it
It's an escort service
Did you identify yourself
Hey, 'm new but 'm not stupid
Call communications and get an address on that number
Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service address on it
(') Good work
-  - Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie
You goin' to the escort service
You got any better ideas
Mind if  ride along with you
This has nothing to do with your fire
But what if it does
You might need my help
As Eddie exits the hotel, a  approaches
Hey, Eddie, can  get your autograph for my son
- Jordy catches up
Eddie finishes signing the autograph using the man's back
'll let you know what happens
This is ridiculous
'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over
Tell you what - 'll flip you a coin
If you win you can come with me
If you don't win, you don't come
'll call it
tails
Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy
Okay
'll call it
Heads
Jordy flips the coin and it's heads
(') Heads
See, you lost twice
(beat) Okay
Get in
Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car
Before Jordy can get in, Eddie starts to pull away
Jordy stands on the sidewalk - dejected
Eddie stops the car again and this time lets Jordy get in
: - Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose's door
Eddie knocks and flips a coin to Jordy
Oh here
souvenir
Jordy takes the quarter
Not understanding what Eddie means
He looks at the quarter
Two heads
Better than one
Eddie suckered him with the coin toss
Jordy reacts
Eddie laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth
Knocks again
We hear (
) Who's there
Police
We'd like to ask you a few questions
(
) have nothin' to say
If you wanna contact my attorney
(commands) Homicide, Miss Hearn
It's Detective Eddie Flemming
Open up
Rose reacts
Immediately ,  and opens the door
You
've seen you on
Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy
(') 'mon in
'mon in
'  - They enter
Just a minute
Shit
And  don't have a camera
Hold on a second
Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation in Afrikaner
We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door
Eddie looks around - taking in the place
are on phones
Two girls take orders for customers
The other two work the phone sex lines
Rose hangs up the phone - turns to Eddie and Jordy: (') What's wrong
We don't have her
yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel
Oh my -d
Honey
Honey's dead
Do you remember the man who called
Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie
Yeah
He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but  sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed
Poor girl
Do you have any Czech girls working for you
No
Did you tell him you did
enters
Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner
(Afrikaner) Boy, she's so popular all the sudden
What are you saying
Daphne
Another guy came in asking me about her, too
Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it
This her
Yeah
Sort of
tried to recruit her, gave her my card
She said she'd think about it but  never heard from her
(Afrikaner) Beautiful eyes
Who came by looking for her
He said he was her cousin
told him where she works
They were just here
Describe him
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes
Second guy with him was
shorter, with a wrestler's build
And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me
He had a videocamera
Where is she
Quickly
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison
'  - As Eddie speeds through the street,
'  - Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with astonishing dexterity
This man can drive
Eddie picks up his phone - dials
Jordy is on his cell phone as well
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison
Hair salon
Ludwig's
(overlapping) 'm on my way with Eddie
Ludwig's
63rd and Madison
The suspects might be there already
Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects
Eddie picks up a beer he was holding between his legs - finishes it
You thirsty
'm on duty
(drinking) So am
Alright, 'll go inside and you cover the back
Of course
Hey
always wanted to be a cop when was a kid
dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze
' at the bad guy
What'd you dream about
wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid
Then  guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we
If we pull up to a burning building 'll gladly let you go first
Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right
'  - We're in a moving video  of Ludwig's, the hair salon - it's big and spacious
The lens finds
(
) Daphne Handlova
Daphne
In the back
Probably shampooing a customer's hair
Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye
, the owner, is with her
Why are you messing with your hair color again
You're going to kill your hair
You won't look good with black hair
want to do it, alright
Well, then do it after work customer's waiting
He leaves, a customer approaches
She smiles at him - turns on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her
She backs up
suddenly moves to the emergency door
There's a garden out there
Daphne runs toward the alley
Oleg follows her - still videotaping
As she rounds the corner she bumps into
Emil
He pulls out his kitchen knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with the broken tip against her throat
have a temper
She looks at him, not understanding
Oleg films the scene
(') When  lose it,  lose control didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole from me
Cheated me
When  went to prison, they beat me
still didn't tell he was my partner
loved Milos like a brother
The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic softness to it
He wants to reconcile his behavior to her
(') (in English) 'm not a killer
The back door opens
He shoves the knife in his pocket as Ludwig peers around the alleyway
What he sees is Emil leaning close to Daphne, kissing her
Daphne, will you be coming back to work
In a minute, Ludwig
Ludwig leaves
Smart girl
'm glad you're not a whore
But washing hair
This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you
They should be washing your hair
Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out , sticks it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it
(') don't want to kill you
But if you talk,  will
(whispers) thought you'd want these
He taps her hand
he turns and goes out the rear exit
Oleg follows
Jordy arrives
Daphne
She says nothing
(') 'm a fire marshal
You remember me from the other night
You are Daphne, right
She says nothing
Eddie arrives
Daphne turns
Recognizing Eddie
You don't have to be afraid
We're here to protect you
Come with me
We want to talk to you
You speak English alright
Eddie looks at Jordy
Takes Daphne by the arm
'  - As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in her hand
He reaches for her hand
Opens it
It's a brushed gold necklace
Did he give you these
Was he just here
Eddie searches the streets
Notices Oleg and Emil on the far corner
Oleg is videotaping him
Leon and Tommy pull up
Korfin behind
They all pop out
Eddie grabs Leon - squeezes his arm - quietly
(') The other side of the street
The guy with the videocamera
(back to Jordy) Don't look - put her in the car
(to Leon) Stay this side
(back to Tommy) Stay with her
They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the attention of Oleg and Emil
- of the scene from across the corner
(Czech) Put the fuckin' camera down
Let's go
Emil starts to flee
- What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie, Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing Emil
Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of breath
Split up
Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other
Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side
They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around, missing him
Emil seems to have disappeared
Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe
As he rounds the corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face
Leon crashes into a table, dropping his gun
Emil scoops up the gun and - Leon
the detective to a pulp
People are running from the scene
Emil takes Leon's wallet
He is distracted by
Oleg is  the scene
Emil, look
Oleg swivels with the videocamera
Korfin is running toward them - pushing through the crowd
Emil
Korfin is blown backwards
(') Perfect
Cut
Print
Eddie arrives
Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with blood
Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street, shot in the side
Jordy cradles his partner
Are you hit
No
'm okay
(to Korfin) Bobby, Bobby
Where're you hit
It hurts
Aw, Jesus
Lay down
Stay down, Bobby
Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street
Cars screech out of the way
Eddie crouches, taking aim at Emil, who is almost two blocks away
It's an impossible shot, out of range
But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one
Two blocks away, Emil topples
Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie, astonished he made the shot
Emil scrambles to his feet
Runs
Eddie holsters his weapon
Pulls out a handkerchief
Dabs Leon's wounds
He got my gun
Motherfucker was filming the whole time
know
Relax
Take it easy
Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers
: Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in an   and in b
g
, an   attends to Leon's bloody face
Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with her cameraman
Detective - can you tell us what happened here
can't talk right now
We have some things to take care of
Jordy moves off, he doesn't want to get pulled in front of Nicolette
Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant, maybe twenty feet away
Tommy stands next to her
This is where Eddie and Jordy are headed
understand, but  noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you
Is this somehow related to the fire department
really can't give out any information right now at this point
Okay
But  do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured
Is that correct
He was hurt, but not seriously
He'll be fine
Do you have the suspect in custody
Um
now is not a good time, okay
Detective Jackson's hurt
He's fine
've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously
(to cameraman) Alright, cut, cut, cut
Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his shoulder
(') (to Eddie) Eddie, are you okay
Yeah
Now's not a good time
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
Okay
Eddie walks into the restaurant
Throws a look back at her, then enters
- Jordy talks to Daphne
told your partner,  can't help didn't see anything
'mon, start at the beginning
You know these people
Tamina was a friend of mine
My shower was broken, she let me use theirs
Go on
She says nothing
(') Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out
Better if it comes from you
If  tell you, will you arrest me
Arrest you for what
Why would we arrest you
She still hesitates
(') What are you hiding
Why are you afraid She just saw two of her friends killed
They probably threatened her
Is that all there is
She looks at Eddie
(') Are you here illegally
Don't worry about that
We'll talk to Immigration
They won't deport you
No, no, don't talk to Immigration
She clams up
Why not
Something back home
Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits
Eddie sits across from her
Jordy crouches down next to her
my little sister and  shared a flat - came home one night and a man was raping her
His gun was on the chair
He came at me and  shot him
(optimistic) Alright
That's a justifiable homicide
Yes, but he was a cop
cop
(beat) 'm from a small town in Slovakia
Like the South here
The Police is right, a civilian is wrong
So  fled
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here
Tell us the truth
is that the truth
You're a cop - you'll never believe me
(to Eddie) Can  talk to you
Eddie steps away with Jordy
Keeping his eyes on Daphne
She tries to listen
She's fucked
Even if that story is true
Raw deal
Eddie tilts his head
Measures Jordy
(') Look - let me talk to her
Any leads get, they're all yours
Just let me have a first crack at her
You wanna talk to her alone
Yeah
What would your girlfriend think of that
don't have a girlfriend
My point exactly
'm serious here
So am
'mon
You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity
She sees me differently
You're her Savior
Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building
You know what 'm saying here
Eddie looks at his watch
Thinks it over
Measures Jordy
Okay, tell you what, 'll give you a head start
You take her to the station house
Don't let her out of your sight
She's the only warm body we got left
Hey
'm a professional
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs
He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door
- Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of pink flesh taken out of his ankle
Emil grabs some toilet paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle
He grits teeth in pain
The lights go out
Then Oleg adjusts the fluorescent light above the sink
Gotta light the scene better
Now it's more moody
like a scene from Shut up
Does it hurt
Emil lifts his foot out of the sink
This is nothing
Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back
Oh, shit
hate looking at that
Don't want to film this
We don't see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his expression, it's horrible
'  - Daphne rides in the backseat
Jordy's watching her in the rearview
Now  become custody of police department
If you cooperate with the  - maybe they'll help you with your situation
will if they don't send me back
They won't until this is over
She looks away
Out the window
Jordy sees emotion filling her eyes
She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up
Are you married
Divorced
Do you live alone
(beat) 've been in these clothes since
the killings
Could we stop at your place
could take a shower
before  go into custody
Jordy looks at her
Can't quite tell if she's trying to manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before all the shit starts
can't take you to my place
Somewhere else
Jordy looks at her
Staring right at us
want to talk to you about something serious
He holds up the diamond engagement ring
(') want to live the rest of my life with you
don't know you've been married before and 've never been married, but do love you, and
Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the proposal
He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff
Leon's blood
Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka tonic
She's here
Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual
He hands Eddie the towel
Eddie wipes off his face and hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie
Paulie helps Eddie on with his coat
Eddie takes some Visine out of his coat pocket
Drops a few in each eye
straightens himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the drink
Eddie sets the glass down and starts out
Paulie hands him a Binaca
Eddie gives himself a squirt as he exits
Paulie follows
'  - It's lunchtime
it's crowded
Eddie takes a seat at a table
He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under the table
Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind
Gives him a kiss on the cheek
Hey, honey
Hey
She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits down across the table
There's a long pause - they just look at each other
What is your problem
Why'd you snap at me
just wanted a statement
can't
can't answer you just because you want me to answer you
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues
You could give me something
Oh, 'm sorry
Did  embarrass you, sweetheart
Oh
Stop it
Maybe  should just, ya know
turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out
Alright, alright, Eddie
Don't patronize me
'm not
Yes you are
'm not just some reporter
don't just stick a microphone in your face
You could give me something
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence
That was
That was good
You were holding the evidence
You were merciless
You didn't give a shit if you got me or not
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that
Huh
You're ruthless
You're not so bad yourself
They look at each other
(') 'mere
They kiss
(') Look at this
You have blood on your shirt
Whose is it
Could be Leon's
Jesus
And last week you came over with blood on your shoes
What am  going to do with you
Eddie takes her hand
You know,  been thinkin'
these shoes might look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet
She looks at him
(') You know, Nicky, 've been married twice before
My first wife was a professional woman, didn't have time for children
My second wife
never wanted to go home to her
Nicolette's phone rings
Eddie stops - looks at the ringing phone
What are you doing
What are you saying
Nicolette's phone keeps ringing
Eddie stares at it
(') Eddie
Nicolette's phone keeps ringing
(') Don't worry about the damn phone won't answer it
Answer the phone
No
Tell me what you want to say
Answer it
Okay
Okay
Hold that thought just for a second
They only call me when it's an emergency
Just hold that thought
(into the phone) Can you call back
(
) We need you here in twenty minutes
Get in a cab
What're you talking about
(
) Katie
We don't know where she is
We can't find her
You gotta anchor the 5:00
This is your shot
Come now
What
Oh
Okay
Yeah
The line disconnects
She collapses the phone
Turns to Eddie
(') Oh my -d, they want me to anchor
They want me to anchor tonight
That's good
Yeah
Well, that's great
Okay
That is great
But  can't go now, we're in the middle of something here
No
Go ahead
You're gonna be great
No
No, listen to me here
want to know what you're talking about
You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and
'll tell you tonight
Let's do it tonight
As soon as you get back we'll talk
We'll talk
Promise
promise
We'll talk
You'll be great
You'll be fine
Go ahead, just imagine that, uh
Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me
Yeah
'll do that
As long as you're not patronizing me
Patronizing you
Nay,  love you
love you
They kiss
(') Okay, til tonight
Tonight
You promise
Yeah
promise
Okay
And you know what, 'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours
How's that
Would that be a good thing
Yeah, yeah
Good thing
Okay
See you later
Good luck
Thank you
Don't be late
She walks out
91 - Jordy unlocks the door
Enters with Daphne
The fire station is empty
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires
So
the station is empty
Yeah
This way
He gestures toward the stairs
- Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room
Her eyes never leaving Jordy's
You considered becoming a prostitute
Yes,  considered it
Did you ever turn tricks before
No
What about back home
No
Daphne stops
Looks at him
Stands very close
(') came here
had no money
knew no one
couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work
They approached me -  could've made a lot of money
considered it, but
it's not who  am
They pay me below the table at Ludwig's
So you were never a prostitute
What are you asking me
'm just trying to find out who you are
She looks up into his eyes
Searching
Thinking he's hinting
Can you let me go
She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to kiss her
Jordy is tempted but
remembers Eddie's warning and backs up slightly
Showers are this way
Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even closer
You could shower with me
Jordy is locked in her eyes
Almost giving in
Then breaks away
Gestures towards the showers
Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen
She heads to the showers
Jordy follows her into the bathroom
The walls are lined with shower stalls
'll uh, 'll get you a towel
He leaves her there
Alone
She quickly moves to the window
Opens it
Looks down
It's a two-story drop to the street
gets a towel from the locker room
His beeper goes off
He checks the number but decides not to return the call
We follow him back into the bathroom
The shower is on but he notices the window
It's open
(') Shit
He rushes over
He looks out
No sign of her
He turns - looks back at the shower
It's on but he can't see through the curtain
Can't tell if she's there
He walks over - quickly - fearing that she's left
He pulls the curtain aside
She's crouched in the corner shower stall
Holding herself
She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears
(') Are you alright
Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower
'm not a whore
'm not a whore
know
You don't know
'm sorry
was desperate
That's not me
shot a cop
Can you imagine what they'll do to me when  got to prison
They're not gonna send you right back
'm sorry
didn't mean to
'm glad
Actually 'm glad it's over
All this time
Hiding
Never being able to look anyone in the eyes
Always afraid that someone would find out who  was
Never trusting anyone
He covers her with the towel, pulling her up
You can trust me
She embraces him
Trusting him
He stands there for a moment
Then awkwardly holds her
Comforting her
- on a steak
Male hands cut a piece
Another male hand sets down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin
The hands abandon the steak and rip open the bottle
The  pulls back to include the  screen of Oleg's videocamera
He is taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his teeth
Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed over in pain
He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews them up
Wincing in pain
Emil washes them down with a beer
Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the "People" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller
Emil laughs
Shaking his head at the article as the videocamera tilts back up to his face
What is it
The video of Milos and Tamina -  told you to erase it
did
And the whore's murder
You didn't erase that either, did you
Don't lie, won't be angry
Why not
Put the camera down, Oleg
Oleg closes the  screen and puts the camera down
Emil removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks up Eddie Flemming's name
What is that
What does it look like
It's an address book
Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book
Let me get a shot of it
Sit down
This way
Hold it this way
Good
Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down
(') Why won't you be angry at me for keeping my movie
Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps away
Oleg follows
- It's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's desk
Looking at his watch
Growing more and more aggravated as every second ticks by
Jordy enters escorting Daphne
Sees Duffy and tires to go past him
Duffy turns and sees Jordy and Daphne
Hey
Warsaw
Jordy stops and comes back
Sitting Daphne down on a bench
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here
came to see how the investigation was going
(looks at Daphne) called and you're not here
wait up at the station and you don't even show up
beep you - you don't return my call
Where the hell have you been
Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training
We stopped there
so she could get cleaned up
What do you mean, 'cleaned up
' let her take a shower
shower
Did you take one, too
No
Nothing happened
Oh really
That's nice
You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot
Are you out of your fucking mind
Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates
(
) told him to take her there
Jordy and Duffy turn
Eddie walks out
Eddie turns - Tommy - the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward Hotel - is coming out of the back office
(') Tommy, get her outta here
Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct
This way, ma'am
There was too much press hangin' around there
didn't want her face on the news
So  told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down
Oh
It was my decision, not his
Well, 'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then 'd like to be included in decisions
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference
How about that
The case is all yours
Oh yeah
Alright
(to Jordy) 'm ready to be briefed
(to Duffy) Excuse us
(to Eddie) Yeah, sure
(to Jordy) Beep me when you're ready for the press conference
Will do, Chief
Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk - toward the back and to his office
(') Eddie,
Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy
Wait
-  '  - handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee
Eddie enters with Jordy
Guys
give me a few minutes
They empty out
Look, Eddie, 'm tellin' you -  didn't touch her
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't
including me
took her there for a shower and that's it
Just a shower
Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look
Yeah, just her in the shower
Nothing happened
Look, 'm sure you probably think 'm a fool and  fucked up, but
No,  don't think you were a fool, just think you were stupid about it mean, to say the least, you outta know better
You don't know her well enough
She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over
You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference
You're dead
told you, you know,  thought  was doing the right thing, you know,  think she's innocent
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not
Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional
But,  mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody
mean, you shoulda heard her there
Tellin' her whole story
believed her
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer
Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer
That's how you help her
But you can't get involved in her like that
You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case
And lemme give you another piece of advice
Maybe you don't watch  but 'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television
And when you get out there, they know your face
And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that  get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job
And  get more done because of it
Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief
Why'd you stand up for me like that
You know,  don't know
like you
You remind me of a puppy  used to have
He pissed on the rug all the time, but still kept him
Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out
He sticks it in his mouth
match is lit
He looks up
Jordy holds the match
Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs
The homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look
'  - Eddie walks in - carrying flowers
He closes and locks the door behind him
He grabs the phone
Dials
It's Flemming
anything turn up
Did they check the hospitals
Airports
Yeah,  hit him
fuckin' hit him
We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything
These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia
He looks at the flowers
Decides to put the case behind him for a moment
(') 'll call you later
He  up
Arranges the flowers in a vase
So they look perfect
Sets them on the coffee table
Fills out a card, writes, "Nicky,  love you
Will you marry me
"  He sticks the card in the flowers - turns the lights down low
Puts a romantic Sinatra song on the stereo
Moves to the liquor cabinet
Pours himself a drink
He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the flowers
There's a knock at the door
(') Coming
Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door
But the hallway is empty
(') Nicky
No answer
Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in his hand
Walks toward the elevator
Doesn't notice the shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment
Eddie turns
No sign of anyone
(') Nicky
He walks back toward his apartment
Turns and locks the door
jumps out of the shadows  him on the head with a gun
Eddie tumbles to the floor
as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up
Emil is sitting in front of him
On the coffee table alongside him are the flowers in a vase
They've ransacked the place
Emil has Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money
He's smoking one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand
is the diamond engagement ring and card
Oleg, 60 -style, is positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie
He moves to the corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate Eddie's face
So
who's Nicky
What do you want
Your opinion
(leaning forward) You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie
And write books
(sarcastic) What's your accomplishment
kill someone famous
Then do it, asshole
Good - be tough to the end
Actor who plays you will want to die like hero
Eddie looks at the videocamera
Emil answers Eddie's look
(') So tabloids don't have to do re enactments
They going to have real movie this time
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck
Emil turns to Oleg
Turn it off
Oleg obeys
Emil turns to Eddie
(') No
We are insane
Who else but crazy men would film their murders
(gestures to Eddie) So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital
But what good is money there
Because once in hospital  say  not crazy
Just pretended to be acquitted
We see psychiatrists
They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called
(Eddie says nothing) Oh -  got it
Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice
We come out free, rich and famous
Good idea
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit
How fuckin' stupid are you
Smarter than Americans
You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long
Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me
(laughs) So
Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette
Maybe you can propose to her now
Eddie says nothing
Just stares at Emil
Emil puffs on Eddie's cigar
(') Okay
He has nothing to say
(signaling Oleg) Start the camera
Cut
Emil looks at Oleg
(') This is my project
say 'action
' am the director
You are the talent
You wait for me to say 'action
' Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, "See what  have to put up with
"  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera
(') And
action
Oleg  as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver
Eddie suddenly  at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away, backing out of Eddie's reach
Bad last moment -  cut that out
Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's left temple
Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm
Standing and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over into the desk
Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor
Oleg still grips the videocamera
Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall
Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as Emil is limping for it
Eddie knocks Emil out of the way with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly
Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him from the wall
Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa
Falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving Oleg on the sofa
Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun
Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun
Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera
Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp
Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach
Emil steps back, revealing the knife is   ' Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair - holding the gun
Eddie can't believe he got stabbed
Blood swells around his stomach
He can't be dying
This can't be happening
He looks at Emil
The pain is terrible
Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a close up
Emil looks at Eddie
(') Die
Die
Emil looks around
Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie off, suffocating him
We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you feel is the motion
We are travelling very fast
Finally, in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame
We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a tiny pixel on a  screen
further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news
It's an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and dignitaries
In the upper right hand corner, superimposed over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his  and in his  uniform
We see Oleg's reflection on the set with the videocamera
He is filming the
We hear the audio from Eddie's funeral
(
) Detective Flemming was one of the most decorated  detectives in the history of New York
He made several thousand arrests during his career, including the famed Stephen Geller case
Beloved by the community in which he served
His partner eulogized him
Leon is at the mic
(
) Eddie was my mentor, my best friend and my partner
he taught me the meaning of the word 'cop
'  He was a man in every sense of the word
'll miss him
(choking on tears) Sleep well, brother
Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace
"  Oleg  from the and focuses it on a lightbulb
Hands enter the frame - carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray
long hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid
Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb
Again, the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a table
next to a revealing
Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this
'  - It's packed with  drinking
Prosecutors
lawyers
many who were at the funeral, including Leon
All wear the black ribbon on their badges
There's a quality of an Irish wake - boisterous, guys cursing
many cops in uniform
buffet has been laid out
Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon
He greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon
Awful
what an awful day
He was New York City
Hawkins notices a young man by the window
Teary-eyed
It's Tommy
Hawkins nods to him
never got to tell him how much admired him
know, son,  know
We all loved him
Hawkins moves on
greeting others
He notices at the end of the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette
He moves to her
Pulls up a stool alongside her
She turns, looks at him
Just stares at him for a long beat
She is bombed
Definitely drunk
She's had many
She turns to Hawkins
You know
you know he was gonna propose to me
The crime guys found a card he'd written out to me
And a ring box
these fuckers that killed him - have my ring
They have my diamond engagement ring
Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion
know
What do you mean you know
He told you he was gonna propose to me
Well, he
(overriding) want to hear everything he said
'm trying to tell you
Alright
Go ahead
That morning
He was talking to me and Leon about marriage
Oh my -d
We were having lunch here
He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but  got a call to anchor - and walked out on him
walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him
Nicolette is crying now
She angrily wipes away a tear
(') 'd never had a great relationship before
'd never made great choices with men
And he wasn't easy to get to know
He was older, my parents told me was nuts to get involved with him
But he was so great to me
Always encouraging, telling me  could do anything
(beat) He was the one
You know, 'd give up everything - everything - for just a little more time
would've spent fifteen minutes with him if that's all knew  had
She's lost it
Hawkins consoles her
Nicolette shrugs him off - turns back to her drink
Downs the rest of it woman arrives, , Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow
Robert
What are you doing here
(holding a cellular) You've got a call
can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see 'm busy
can't talk business
Hang up
Have a drink
(to Paulie) Get her a whiskey
Trust me, you'll want to take this call
Robert steps off the stool
Takes the phone
Hello
Who is this
(listens) How do  know this is you
Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder
Backs away from the bar
Now out of hearing distance, he looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice
(') Where
We  Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie theater
Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws glances into the theater
Come to 45 Broadway
Don't bring the Police
Come alone or you'll be in my next film
(low) Look asshole
've been threatened by better than you
No
'm the best that's ever threatened you
'll meet you on one condition -  get exclusivity and you surrender to me
We'll talk about that
Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank
Three hundred thousand dollars
What
It doesn't work that way
(incensed) If you don't want my film - 'll call another show
And they will show it
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Come alone
Bring cash
And we'll talk about surrendering
The line goes dead
Hawkins disconnects
Hands the phone back to Maggie
She's looking at him
Excited
Hawkins looks at Nicolette
His mind whirls
91 -  - Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table
Korfin's arm is in a sling, his side bandaged
Duffy and Jordy enter in their dress uniforms
Korfin walks over to them
How was it
(numb) Not good
Jordy's quiet
Dazed
Nobody can believe Eddie's gone
(nods to Daphne) Did the
videotape her deposition
Yeah
He finished awhile ago
(to Korfin) Alright
Swing by her apartment
Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street
You got that
Yeah
Jordy looks at her
Duffy sees them hold each other's look
Chief - mind if  take her
Okay
But not water sports
Duffy walks out
Jordy leads Daphne out of the station
Korfin follows
is talking to Camello who points as Jordy walks by
The man chases after Jordy
Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw
Yeah
(shoving papers in Jordy's hand) Consider yourself served
Jordy opens the papers
Korfin puts Daphne in the car
Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder
Zwangendaba
Is suing you, the department and the city of New York for 10 million
Who is Zwangendaba
Jordy remembers
and gets more depressed
The mugger
'   - It's an old brownstone - in poor condition
Jordy pulls up
Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering her to the door
He is edgy
Jumpy
Looking around
Are you alright
still can't believe Eddie's gone
'm sorry
He looks at her
Nods
They walk up to the stairs as the front door opens
exits, shocked
Jordy pulls Daphne out of the way
(') (in Czech to the man) Hello
How are you
'   -  - Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs
bouquet of flowers are outside Daphne's apartment
What's this
She takes the card
Jordy looks over her shoulder
Daphne reads: "Good luck with all your troubles
'm here if you need me
Ludwig
" (') Is he your boyfriend
Ludwig
He's gay - are you jealous
If  was your boyfriend,  might be
If you were my boyfriend, 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away
They're staring in each other's eyes
The sexual tension strong
good Immigration lawyer could stall the process
Eddie recommended one
No matter what happens
'm glad  met you
'm glad  met you
They hold each other's eyes
then suddenly they kiss
Urgently
Passionately
Somebody is coming up the stairs
They part quickly
tenant enters his apartment down the hall
Jordy clears his throat
(') Let's get your stuff
He opens the door
Peers inside - checking it out
Turns to her
Gestures that it's okay to enter
'  - It's very small
Almost no furniture
The bare minimum
The apartment is a hole
She looks at Jordy
Both thinking the same thought
Another kiss
You better get packed
Right
She holds his look
Do you have coffee
In the kitchen
'll make some for us
'll get my clothes
She heads down the hall
Jordy enters the small kitchen
He flips on the kitchen light and the   - Jordy
(') Jordy
No
Get back
Jordy's more surprised than shaken
It's a fire - he knows the drill
He pushes her into the living room
Then notices a   hanging on the wall
Grabs it
Aims it at the  spreading in the kitchen
He  as Daphne That's not mine
The fire extinguisher
Flames leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher because it's filled with gasoline
The handle
Jordy '
Flames engulf the extinguisher and '
He flings the extinguisher -
Closes the door
Jordy takes off his jacket
Stuffs it under the bottom of the door
Blocking the smoke
He hurries into the living room
Knowing it's moments before the extinguisher will explode
Jordy pulls out his cellular
Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a chair through the window
Don't
It'll suck the flames toward us
Too late
She  the window
There's an  in the kitchen
Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along the ceiling
Jordy yells into the phone: (') This is Jordan Warsaw
We got a 1075, make it quick, we're trapped
8th Avenue and 44th Street
He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom
It's locked
Jordy kicks it open
Grabs the comforter off the bed
Shoves that under the door jam
He pulls Daphne into the bathroom
Shuts the door
Runs his severely burned hand under the cold water
Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens
She notices someone has nailed the window shut
And on top of one nail
is Eddie's gold shield
Oh my -d
Oh my -d
Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield
(') They were here
This freaks her out
They were in her home
She starts to panic
Calm down
Get a hold of yourself
Get down
He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub
In it is a virtual bomb
(') Oh Jesus
Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline
(') What are you doing
Pouring it out
She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain
The is raging outside the bathroom
The bathroom door is beginning to smoke and burn
They are trapped
Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the wall to the ceiling
He throws his feet against the wall for leverage
Pulls with all his might to break it loose
It's creaking - but he's having a hard time with it
(') Oh shit
Jordy looks over
The gasoline she's pouring out - is not going down the drain
It's stopped up
As soon as the fire gets in the bathroom, everything will explode
Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might
Daphne comes over - helps him
Both of them trying to break it off
Suddenly it snaps and water  into the room
They point the pipe toward the door, soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door
Trying to stop the fire from coming in
He and Daphne are drenched
And trapped
Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe
Starts  the wall behind them
The wall to the adjacent apartment
Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire
down the street as   arrive
is  them from the opposite rooftop
Tenants from Daphne's building are fleeing down the fire escape
Emil stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited
He turns the camera on himself
This is great film
You can see fire right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire Marshal is here
Everything is so messy
Everything is so crazy right here
Look at this fire
We made it
90% of people who die in fire die from eating smoke
So most likely they all die from eating smoke
The   to Emil
(') And this is the man who started the fire
Say something to your fans, Emil
Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens
' Filled with smoke
You can barely see Jordy or Daphne
Jordy  a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom in the apartment next door
The smoke has a place to escape
There's a 7-year old  in there
Standing in the bathroom
Terrified
Get back
Get out of the bathroom
Run
7- The hallway is on fire
It's okay
'm a fireman
'm going to help you
Get back
Now
Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom door catches fire
It's seconds before the whole room will blow up
Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it
- Fire engines have arrived
The street is filled with gawkers
Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne with the other
Carefully guarding his bandaged hand fireman grabs the kid
Another grabs Daphne
Garcia and Korfin run to Jordy
Jordy
What the hell happened
Are you alright, man
Lemme see the hand
Where's Daphne
Daphne
He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes through the crowd
Isn't she a beauty
She's my fire, look at that loom-up on her
Jordy turns - it's Max
The attention pyromaniac who Jordy threw out of his office
As a news crew arrives, Max turns to the cameras
did this
did this
Take my picture
'm Max
Max Gornick
Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away
Get outta here
What the hell happened
They were inside
They booby trapped her apartment
Korfin scans the crowd
Looking for Emil and Oleg
In the b
g
, Duffy is
What the hell are you talking about
They're gonna do what
Jordy and Korfin turn
The Chief has a phone to his ear and is freaked
12  - ' as he enters the  station
His clothes burnt and still wet
The lobby's full of
Tommy and Leon, still in his funeral suit,  above them all at Maggie the producer and her , who are standing behind the desk
Where is he
Where is Hawkins
He's not on the premises
want the tape
Go get it and bring it here this minute
Any request for the video must be directed to "Top Story's" attorney - Bruce Cutler
'll be happy to give you his number
Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands
Tommy pushes past the security guard to follow Leon
They continue toward Maggie, pushing her further back into the office
She tries to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open
Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on , 'll get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it'll come outta your mouth
want your shield number
(
) Viewer discretion advised
(pointing at the ) You want the tape
There it is
Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a  set which is mounted in the lobby
The "Top Story" logo flashes on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk
What we are about to broadcast is very graphic footage
Everyone is riveted
But Jordy notices outside
a "Top Story"   is waiting in the alley
Robert Hawkins jumps from a doorway and into the van
Jordy backs out
- a video  of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is popped
The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the table
He nods at the waiter who leaves
Emil raises the glass - looking into the lens
America
Who says you can't be success in America
arrived with nothing, knowing nobody - now look -  am a success story
The videocamera is lowered
Oleg turns it off
Asks suspiciously
You are success story
am success story
Why do you say  and not we
Oleg, don't be paranoid
You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you
gave you half of what they gave me
Look - here we are
Emil gestures toward the big television set
We are in Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling
Robert Hawkins is introducing his show
(
) Good evening
Welcome to "Top Story"
Tonight,  present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television
And  do so with a heavy heart
You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming
It would be only normal to ask, why
Why are we showing something so journalist,  must show it democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom
Eddie Flemming was my friend
cried when watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward
Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you
One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children
The restaurant
Emil checks his watch
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me
The one who got caught in the bathroom
(beat) George Michael
Emil laughs
Oleg doesn't
'm serious
Shut up
Look
Emil points towards the
"Top Story" is continuing
The scene cuts to Emil's video footage
Eddie is handcuffed to the chair
The light illuminating his face
(
) This is my project
say 'action
' am the director
You are the talent
You wait for me to say 'action
' (beat) And 'action
' Bad last moment -  cut it out
Emil looks at Oleg - furious
(') told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape
Be quiet
Watch
Oleg watches the big-screen  as Emil raises the pistol to Eddie's temple
Eddie pushes him over the desk
Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto the floor
Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall
Eddie and Emil both go for the gun
Eddie knocks him out of the way
Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly
Leaves him in a ball on the floor
Oleg comes at Eddie and he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa
The blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more light
Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach
Oleg kneels down for a -
Die
Die
- Hawkins' van drives across Times Square
Jordy's car following
We
Eddie's murder is being broadcast on the  in Times Square
People stare up - stunned
- The dinner patrons are watching
Shocked
Emil glares at Oleg
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director
Because  am the director
Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now
Your idea
thought it was my idea
Oleg tenses
Emil laughs
(') Aren't you just the cameraman
Oleg doesn't laugh
'm serious
this - this is a great American film
Full of violence and sex
And  want my credit
Credit
Yes
Before we hand in the next video - put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul
Yes
But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is -  don't share credit
Oleg is pissed
(') You got that
No,  don't get that
You think you are a director
You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit
And  hate you
fucking hate you
Emil slaps Oleg across the face
Oleg stands up
Emil suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the trigger, Oleg  Emil in the arm
Emil squeezes off a shot through the crowded restaurant
Patrons  - Oleg runs through the restaurant, escaping
It's chaos
Hawkins arrives with a crew and with  , a confident, tough criminal attorney
Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin - pressing it to his wound
(') Oh, hello
Cutler accesses the situation
(') Are you my attorney
(extends his hand to Cutler) 'm Emil
'm insane
'm not your lawyer until  see the money
Here
have your money
Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler
Cutler opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins
Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware aside
Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside, freaking
He's lost the most important thing in his life
(') Oh no
No
Shit
(follows Emil - reaching out to him) Emil
Take it easy
Stay with me
Sit down
What do you need
What are you looking for
He has the camera
He took the movie
Jordy comes in, gun raised
Don't move
Don't move
Get your hands up
Drop it
Emil puts his hands in the air
Immediately drops the gun
give up
Jordy is disappointed
He didn't want to take Emil alive
Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head
This man is unarmed, officer
He's surrendered
Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down
(') What are you hitting him for
Turn that camera off
Jordy handcuffs him
Emil turns to the camera for sympathy, appearing more hurt than he is
No
Keep filming
Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in that moment why he's surrendering
Jordy yanks Emil up - dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still favoring his ankle
(to Emil) Don't say anything
Where are we going
'm coming with you
Yes
Yes, come with me
(to Jordy) 'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel
'm coming with him
The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything
Cutler stays close to Emil
Making sure he's in the video footage
Turn that camera off
- As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving
Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door to his car
Leon grabs Emil
'll take him
No way
He's mine
(holding on to Emil, squeezing his arm hard) We're takin' him
Don't argue
He's my collar
Well, he killed my partner
He's yours but  take him in
'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but 'm walkin' him in
Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on  taking Emil into custody
Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes
'll follow you
Tommy, you ride with him
Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes
(') You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are goin' down
'll be there with a smile when they put you down
Cutler hurries to Emil's side
Don't say a word
Don't respond to his taunting
(to Leon) He's represented by counsel
You want to speak to someone - you speak to me
Out of the way, counselor
Tommy shoves Cutler aside
Don't you put your hands on me, Detective
Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door
Leon turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything
And you, you'll pay for what you did
(low) This footage will work in your favor
When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him
Leon looks at him
This man used to be his friend
You outta be ashamed
Ashamed of yourself
If  didn't put it on somebody else would
was his friend
Don't give me that fucking shit
The cameras are rolling
Don't get into it on
(yells to other cop cars) Alright, let's get going
Leon and the other cops rush to their cars
Jordy is already behind the wheel
As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger seat, Jordy takes off
The cameras film him driving away
'  - Jordy takes a left turn, racing away
Running all the lights
What are you doin'
You're gonna lose everybody
Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side Highway
The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left lane - having lost the police
(') Where are you goin'
This ain't the way to the station
Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror
- Jordy pulls off on 130th Street
They are way uptown in the middle of nowhere
The car drives down a dark street
Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are no people around
- The car slows down
Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's going on
Jordy stops at a dead end
Pulls open the back door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the deserted tunnel
Jordy
Listen to me
You can't do this
This isn't the way to do things
Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall
Were you a fireman
That how you knew how to rig the apartment
My father was
He gave me many lessons about fire
Now it's my friend
Tommy, take a walk
What are you gonna do
Don't you get it
He knew he was gonna get caught
That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off
Don't stoop to his level
Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy
Take the car
Get outta here, Tommy
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood
(erupting) ' ,
Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy's car
Climbs behind the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in the darkness
Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol
The one Emil took from Eddie
Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets left
Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in Emil's belt
He drags Emil away from the wall, into the center of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and throws them aside
Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles around to face him
(') Get your hands up
Get your hands up
Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the same place he put Emil's
(') You wanna be a real American
Go for your gun
Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he's not going for the gun
(') Pull the gun
You want to be famous
Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and make more money
Emil watches Jordy
a slow grin spreads across his face
You can't kill me
You're not a cop
Just fireman with a gun
bet you never shot anybody in your life
You'll be my first
Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between Emil's eyes
'mon
Pull the trigger
Do it
Oh, look, you're sweating
You don't have the balls
Get down on your knees
Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech fill the air
Police cars come flying down the street
(') Where's your partner
The Sheraton
On Broadway
Room 210
Go get Oleg
He'll kill you
Leon runs up
Tommy's relieved to see Jordy didn't kill Emil
Gimme your gun, Jordy
We all want him dead but you can't do it this way
Emil is still smiling
Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the face
Knocking him to the floor
He jumps in his car and speeds away
- 2ND   - room service  wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg's room
Jordy follows behind him - gun aimed at his back
Do you really need me
Keep your mouth shut
Don't mess this up
They reach the room
Jordy flattens himself against the wall
The waiter
' Who's there
(nervous) -room service
, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking out at the waiter
Come in
Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing the hooker back out of the room
Jordy moves to the bedroom door
Peers through the crack
Oleg sits on the edge of the bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes
He's hooked up his videocamera to the  set and is showing them his footage of the fire
Look at that
See that shot
Seamless
No cuts
(excited) And look
Look at that transition
That's filmmaking
Isn't it great
Jordy  in the door - gun raised
Don't move
Oleg grabs the videocamera
Has on hooker in a head lock and picks up the other one
He rushes at Jordy - using one of the hookers for protection
(') Drop the girl
Drop her
Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into the living room and over the back of the sofa
Oleg rushes out into the Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down the stairwell
- Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway
He runs through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside
Jordy chases him, gun in hand
Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic, cars braking to a stop
One  into another
Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg
People gawk
Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his underwear
Oleg runs, knocking people aside
He's holding the camera in his hand
It's on
turns as Oleg runs right into him
Knocking him down
Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into: - Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the   at the door
Hey, come back here
The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy counter
Jordy rushes in the door
Where is he
Where'd he go
Middle door
Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle door - and enters the theater through the far door
- Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle
It's a night scene, the theater is dark
Jordy tries to see faces
He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle
' Kill him
Kill the bastard
Jordy spins toward the voice - it's a
Others start for blood
Shoot him
Jordy ducks
Another
Jordy realizes the shots are coming from the screen
Look
Over here
Jordy turns
Oleg stands up and  at him - trying to film Jordy's death with a videocamera
Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders and heads, bounding for the screen
Everybody down
Stay
Jordy  as the screen villain blasts away
Some in the audience don't realize the real thing is happening
Oleg leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it
Jordy runs down the aisle
Oleg  at Jordy
Jordy back
People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a clear shot
Oleg  again, wounding a moviegoer
Jordy raises up as the theater lights go on
and Oleg is gone
Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has disappeared
(') Shit
are heard from outside
of cops are heard as they enter
is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie theater
(
) and the wild chase through Times Square ended with the suspect, Oleg Razgul, escaping
The fire department has identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw
The channel is changed
is reporting the same story
(
) In a related matter, Mr
Slovak's attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for handling sensational cases - claims his client is unfit to stand trial
-  - Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell
Watching through the bars
She is in the fire department's holding cell in Brooklyn
(
) In fact, Cutler claimed Mr
Slovak was not the alleged mastermind behind the murders
According to Cutler, Mr
Slovak was being directed by his partner, who threatened to kill him if he didn't follow Mr
Razgul's orders
Cutler told reporters today that Mr
Razgul did in fact stab his client
The scene   Cutler's press conference
My client, Mr
Slovak, is a victim
What's happened is not his fault
Emil was under the influence of his partner
At the trial, you'll see that my client will be vindicated
-    - The   from the  set
We are now in an interview room, a guard is posted outside the room
Emil sits at a small table - with Cutler
Emil is dressed in Bellevue clothes
He's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged
Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler
brought you some letters
It's really fan mail
Women mostly
One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check
Another wants a check
You bring the cigarettes
Oh, sure
Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in Emil's mouth and lights it for him
Emil has never smoked before
(') How're they treating you, alright (Emil is nonresponsive) want to get the cuffs off
but there's a little bit of a problem
Things out there are very negative right now for us
We gotta change that around
Perception is very, very important
Perception is reality know you're not fuckin' crazy
But it's important that  get that message out
Cause that's our only defense in this case
Emil leans forward
Cutler retrieves the cigarette from between his lips
(') want you to focus on three things: fear
He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth
(') delusions and paranoia
was all of these
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently
No question about that
What about Oleg
Disappeared
They're looking everywhere
Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia
No, he is here
Shit
Don't worry about him
Think about yourself
What about my movie rights
Book rights
Look,  haven't really focused on that kind of thing
What's your cut
How much
would say
half
Half is fair
(laughs) No
No way
But it's
Thirty-percent
No more
Or  call another lawyer
This is the biggest case of your life
Don't try to negotiate
Thirty percent
Say yes or no
This is not about money, Emil
need your trust in me
What else do you need
need to know about your background need to know about your upbringing
Why you're here
(indicating cigarette) Give me another one, please
Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth
Lights it
Tell me about yourself
What you did as a young boy
what your parents were like
My father always degraded me
Killed my self-esteem
And my mother was blind
Your mother was blind
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me
She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me
Back in the Czech Republic
Yeah, yeah
bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind
And my father blamed me for her blindness
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness
Yeah, he hated me from day when  was born
Put it out
Can you put the cigarette out
Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes it
(') That's what he did to me
He put cigarettes out on me
Your father put cigarettes out on you
Out on my back when  was a small boy
Can  see your back
Emil rises
Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up Cutler recoils - horrified
(') Oh, Jesus
'm abused
Don't you think
don't think it's abuse,  think it's torture
91 - '  - Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk
Jordy stands across the table from his Chief
Behind Jordy we can see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening
Duffy has a subpoena in his hand
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image
This is going to be our Rodney King
What was  supposed to do
The guy tried to mug me
was gonna send a cop back -  just forgot
Forgot
You handcuffed a civilian to a tree
Chief -  know  screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine
End my career
How are you going to fight this
Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight
You'd have the good to weight against the bad
It's unfortunate that  have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing  can do
Gimme your shield
But Chief
Over this
There's nothing to talk about
Get a good lawyer
You're suspended until your trial
Jordy sighs
Dying inside
He surrenders his shield
Drops his handcuffs, his pager and his gun
Duffy picks up the gun - looks at it
(') (pats Jordy's shoulder) know you got backup at home
Drop it off
Jordy sighs and exits
&   - Jordy is talking to  , a senior special agent
In another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old (to Jordy) Look, what don't you understand
We've got a good relationship with the Czech's and the State Department doesn't want to cause an incident
But the
needs her as an eyewitness
They've got her testimony on videotape
And even if they do take her to court immediately after she'll be extradited
The Czechs want her back
She shot a cop
mean, Christ, man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic
How would you feel if the Czechs wouldn't give them back to us
Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office
Lowers his voice
(') And just between us
was married to a redhead
They're a jinx
Redheads are like cross-eyed priests
Stay away from both
Jordy gives him a look
(') You want to see her - go ahead
Jordy enters the other office
Sits next to Daphne
The assistant
Attorneys leave
We're gonna fight the extradition
Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers
Forget about me
You have enough problems of your own
Do you really want me to forget about you
don't want to drag you down with me
Daphne,
Daphne touches her finger to his lips
Shhhh
She leans in and kisses him
Then looks into his eyes, trying to find a smile
- It's weeks later
Nicolette is looking worn, tired, frazzled
She's trying to go through her stand up
But she's unraveling
Not recovered from the loss of Eddie
and today with his partner who he blamed for the crimes still at large, Emil Slovak will appear in court
His lawyer will argue that he is mentally unfit to stand trial
Eyewitness News has also learned that later this month, Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing in court
He will be arraigned on charges of violating the civil rights of

Shit
Let's start again
5-4-3-2-1
She starts over
'  - Jordy's on the couch
drink in his hand, watching  with his dog,
Jordy's eyes are glazed
He's drunk, his eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were
without his job or Daphne
His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort
As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger seeps through her broadcast
(
) Mr
Zwangendaba claims to be a direct descendent of the African King from whom he takes his name
Jordy's face is flashed on screen
The phone
Jordy picks up
Hello
(listens) No comment
He hangs up
The phone
(') Hello
(listens) No
Jordy hangs up
Changes the channel
He stops as Robert Hawkins' face fills the screen
He is standing across from someone - in a park - interviewing him
(
) He robbed you
The   to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a suit and tie
Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut
He stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the tree
He's appearing on "Top Story"
(
) That's right,  encountered him right here
was just askin' for change an' he whips out his big gun an' pushes me up against that tree, whereupon he takes my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin' me there all exposed
The phone  again
Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off the table and throws it through the window: as the channel is changed
is on
Behind him is a picture of Emil
Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie
The reporter stands in front of the jail
and  has learned that Mr
Slovak won't have to worry about how he is going to pay for his defense
He has received movie offers and been in conversations with numerous publishers concerning the rights to his life story
Oleg is at a bar watching
Poisoned with envy
'  - Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser
We see the  overturned in the b
g
His back up gun is on it
He stares at it
Dark thoughts dancing in his head
- Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses
Looking inside the park where a   surrounds a
Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to Rykers Island
Jordy pulls his
38 out of his ankle holster and sticks it in his pocket
to $42
00
The   looks in the rearview mirror
can't believe this guy got off
Unbelievable
Jordy takes out money
All he's got is fifty bucks and he crams it into the slot
Whatever's leftover, keep
Jordy exits the cab
The anger rising inside his body is coming to a boiling point
He walks into the park
Leon is sitting on a bench
Just sitting there
Also filled with rage and frustration
Jordy meets his eyes
Leon gets up and walks away
Disgusted by it all
Jordy's right hand grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on
Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters
All are waiting for Emil
: and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and frazzled, waits Nicolette
Still grieving her loss, she looks over at Hawkins and his crew
She shoots him a disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off
He checks his watch - anxious - looks at his cameraman
He said he'd be here
Pick him up as he comes through the crowd
Do you hear me
For Chrissakes don't miss this
Cutler's car behind it
Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from the van
Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the The swarm follows - firing questions at Cutler
He answers the barrage of questions with: my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness
This is a victory for the mentally ill
Jordy walks alongside the moving mass
His eyes focused on Emil - his hand in his pocket
We notice in the crowd Max, the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac
What's he doing here
Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket
weird gleam in his eye
We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other cops
Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass
She watches Emil with quiet rage
Cutler continues: (') before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, want to say one last word to you all
As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders
My client and  hope he is brought to justice in the near future
They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch obsessively
Where the hell is he
Goddamn it
Jordy glares at Emil
Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating
Smiles
He won
He beat the system
Jordy suddenly erupts
You think this is funny
What the hell are you laughing at
Emil stares down Jordy
Jordy grips the gun inside the jacket
(to a nearby escort) Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions
blocks Jordy from Emil
This is it
This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing
You may not like it marshal, but that's the law
And what about the other victims
What about their families
He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing
We let this scumbag walk
Jordy moves past the officer
Emil breaks away from Cutler
Gets in Jordy's face
Laughs quietly
Be careful
can kill you
'm insane
Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler
scuffle breaks out as the cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to: as it approaches Hawkins from behind
hand dips into frame tapping Hawkins on the shoulder
Hawkins turns - sees who he's been waiting for
His face lights up
thought you wouldn't show up
Where is it
Where is the tape
' In disguise - sunglasses and a hat
Holding his videocamera
It's all in here
All in here
has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly: Wait a minute, Bruce
We've got some interesting evidence, something you should look at
Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks
His crew is taping as he continues introducing his broadcast: (') have exclusive rights to the videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane
Hard to believe
watch
Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his videocamera up in the air
( ) He knew exactly what he was doing - all of this was planned
It's all here in my movie
Emil is not insane
Look
Look
Oleg  his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie: ( ) so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital
(points to Oleg) Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him
The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of reporters separate them
We hear the staccato calls from the press corps
Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage
Jordy notices and starts moving towards her
Before the in charge of the detail can react, the rage which killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil
He yells at Oleg
Traitor
No
You are the traitor
You are murderer
am director
Action
Oleg pulls his gun
Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as: Oleg
Cutler is  and goes down
Hawkins swings his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin
Oleg  off another  - hitting the escorting Emil
Emil grabs the down officer's gun
He swivels - rapid fires at Oleg
Oleg topples
People are screaming
It's
Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him
He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at her head
Drop the gun
'
'll kill her
Back off
Everyone back away from me
We hear Jordy's voice above Emil
Let her go
Let her fucking go
The captain is screaming at all his men
No one shoot
Lower your weapons
Do not fire
No officer will fire his weapon unless  say so
(to Emil) Let the woman go
Cops reluctantly lower their weapons
But Jordy is still aiming his gun at Emil
He is the only one who hasn't lowered his gun
The captain is yelling at him
(') Holster your weapons
Back away
That is an order
No officers will fire
Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at Emil
Tell him to put his gun down
Let her go
Let her go
If he doesn't lower his gun 'll fucking kill her
Jordy doesn't lower his gun
Emil tries to back away
The reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping their lenses pointed at the scene
This is great film
Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised
Let her go
Shoot
Shoot him
Shut up
Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling: No on shoot
No one shoot
No officer will follow
No officer will shoot
Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy
Shoot
Shoot
Shoot him
Shut up
Everyone is screaming at once
It's mass chaos
The captain is trying to keep everyone calm
Cops following along with their weapons lowered
All except Jordy - his gun still pointed at Emil
Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting
He's pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack
Trying to get the best coverage
(') 'll surrender
'll surrender if he lowers his gun
He's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away towards the police boat
Don't
Don't let him surrender
Shoot him
Jordy won't take his gun off him
Let her go
Let her go
The captain is yelling at Jordy
Lower your weapon
told you - lower your weapon
Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil
He can't
His heart pounding
Adrenaline pumping
He suddenly lowers his weapon
Turns away
The captain visibly relaxes
Emil laughs
Jordy suddenly turns back
Quickly raises his weapon
Emil takes a shot in the leg
Nicolette ducks under the handcuffs and scurries away
Emil looks at Jordy - surprised he shot him
Jordy
Emil is hit in the shoulder
Jordy marches forward,    in Emil's chest
Abdomen
Head
Gun fire echoes in the humid air as Emil stumbles back
Does a funny dance and drops to the ground
Dead
The captain yells
(') told you not to shoot
No officers should shoot
Jordy quietly answers: 'm not a cop
'm a fire marshal
He's still alive
Hawkins looks down at Oleg
He is sprawled on the ground
His videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie
' as it  from the Statue of Liberty and  to Oleg
He looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps: film
by Oleg Razgul
And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop
Hawkins jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain
(') How was that
Oleg's head rolls to one side
Now dead
Nicolette runs over to Jordy
Composing herself
Coming together
Glad Emil is dead
Jordy starts to walk away
Wait a minute
Where are you going
Learn from Eddie
Talk to the court of public opinion
Take the credit, you need it
She turns him around
Straightens his tie
Starts to push the hair out of his face but he stops her hand
No thanks
Jordy puts something in her hand
She looks down
It's '
The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom
She looks up at him
Her cameraman rolling
The lens pointed at Jordy
Jordy looks at Nicolette
Meets her eyes
He doesn't want to make a statement
He still doesn't want the fame
He did learn from Eddie
Eddie was killed because he was a celebrity
Jordy wants no part of it
Cut
Her cameraman lowers his leans
Jordy smiles
She nods
Jordy turns and walks away
(') Get a shot of him leaving
Then pan to me
Jordy disappears into the sea of people
The camera back to Nicolette
(') Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you saw it
The    from Nicolette's face and the video is now on: We    and
Nicolette finishing her stand up: (') New York City has a new hero, Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw
hope that Fire Marshal Warsaw's heroic actions this afternoon will help with his other legal problems
WB11 has also learned that the fire Marshal has retained an immigration lawyer to help Daphne Handlova with her case
We wish her well
This is Nicolette Karas, live at Battery Park, WB11 New York
Good night
