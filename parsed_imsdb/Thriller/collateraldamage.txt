It's a tough job requiring strength, patience and determination

The channel surfer slides down the fire pole
He's followed by the man who was upstairs snoring

An engine and ladder company are on-scene attacking the fire with hoses
Neighbors gawk
Gordy's engine company arrives
Gordy hits the ground, moves to a battalion chief
The chief's terse orders are drowned out by the  of the , fire and men
Gordy moves back to his company, who have already hooked the engine up to water
Top story's fully involved
We're supporting inside
Two lines up the stairs
He points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, , a veteran firefighter of Irish descent
Junior and Mike -- He points to the chess player,  , another veteran, Mediterranean descent, and then to the rookie, , a New York melting pot mutt
-- Sal and Ronnie
The chauffeur,  , German-Irish, stays with the engine as Gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two- man hose teams into

Rats head past in the opposite direction, deserting the burning building

On goes the water
Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants, using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and Mike, indicates "up

Sees something and yells a warning -- Stairs're screwed
Hug the wall

He has fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway above
He's pinned under a large section of heavy debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages around him
To Junior and Mike -- Knock it back
They turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the trapped firefighter
Gordy tries lifting the debris, can't budge it
He starts chopping at it with the axe
Chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again
Gordy hacks off a large piece of debris
He levers his axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter
Mike moves to help
Gordy heaves up on the axe
The debris lifts
He heaves harder
It lifts more, until
Mike slides the firefighter out
Gordy yanks his axe free
The debris collapses

Between him and the door is the gaping hole in the floor
It's too big to jump
He starts running
He's gonna jump it
Gordy reaches the edge of the hole
Leaps with all he's got
At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first
Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and

He hits the other side running
Drives a shoulder into the door at the end of the hall

It's an inferno
He looks up
Knocks his axe on the ceiling
Hears desperate  back
Gordy climbs a table
Starts whacking upward with the axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead
Gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but he's not doing it fast enough
He won't beat the fire

-                                         12 Gordy calls down to his men
Give me the hose
This place is gone
It could flashover any second
Give me the goddamn hose
Beat
Mike and Junior pass the hose up

13 Gordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the ceiling
Turns it on full jet
Gordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure stream bites into old, decayed plaster
Bit by bit the ceiling falls away
Gordy's almost through to the room above, when
Falling debris severs the hose
Gordy's lost pressure
He hasn't broken through
The building's coming down
He's gotta get outta there
Gordy's not going anywhere
Picks up the axe
Attacks the hole again furiously, until finally

a terrified Latino family gaping down at him, their room ablaze around them

Speaks to them in Spanglish -- It's okay
Esta bien, esta bien
Come with me
Con mio

Gordy's done it already
No fever

She leans down and kisses him
There's passion in it

It's the second child he's held in the last few hours
This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid: what a father wants for his child
We see the deep affection Gordy has for his son
He holds Matt tightly, skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head

neighborhood gangbanger and his crew match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the fence, clearly trying to intimidate him

Calls -- Luis
Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off

Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris
Then struggles to his hands and knees
Anne
He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a large shard of glass embedded in his leg

They're helping with shoe-leather

Me and Mike are here

They shouldn't have been there
It's not your fault

Mike has walked up, lays a comforting hand on Gordy
No
You don't need to see 'em that way, Gordo

Get those goddamn people outta here
Phipps, approaching with Dray, addresses the same cop
Put that tape out fifty more feet
The cop begins moving the camera crew back

Mike nods
To Gordy -- Mr
Pitt, if you can you tell me
What'd you see

Mike puts a restraining hand on Gordy
This guy didn't do the bombing, Gordo
He's just trying to get the people who did

Gordy eases up
Then, after a moment, defeated -- didn't see anything except the explosion

Phipps sees that's all he's gonna get
know this is hard
'm sorry had to bother you

Chalk outlines are all that remain of his family

We were hoping they'd keep him here, and he wouldn't have to go home right away, but they're cutting him loose
Want me to stay at home with him
Rookie's taking the first shift
'm just getting the schedule at the firehouse rearranged now
Mike goes back to the phone, and Sal crosses to Gordy
He puts a hand on Gordy's shoulder, grips it firmly
Hey
Got here as fast as  could
Gordy sees him, but says nothing
know it sucks
It really sucks
Gordy can't go there

Sal releases his grip
How's the leg
Cut's deep, but no major vessels were severed
He's got a load 'o silk holding it all together
Junior, who stepped off to talk to a cop, now comes back
Just came over the police radio

His hat is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his tinted glasses
As the cop faces more toward the camera, the expert freeze-frames

Did you see a cell phone when you ran into him
No
How much time passed between then and the explosion

) In an e-mail to the New York Times, a Marxist extremist known only as 'The Wolf,' states that the bombing was, quote, 'not an act of terror but an act of war, aimed at stopping your
murderers and their fascist puppets from committing further acts of repression against the people of Colombia,' unquote
Two Colombian officials and an American military officer died in last Thursday's blast
Also killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a New York City firefighter, and their only child, four-year-old Matt
The President has vowed that the United States will avenge what he called 'this monstrous act of barbarism and cowardice'
Intelligence sources say the identity and whereabouts of The Wolf remain a mystery
They believe he has worked closely with radical elements in Latin America for more than twenty years and have linked him to numerous terrorist bombings, including the 1983 downing of a Peruvian airliner, which killed forty-two people, eleven of them Americans
The head of the Latin America Indigenous People's Committee, a group known to be sympathetic to the radicals in Colombia, talked to News Six in Queens

Gordy takes pictures, etc
, off a wall in his home
He pins up photos of Anne and Matt at the top of the wall
Beneath them he pins up a large map of Colombia
(
) The government's been fighting different Marxists factions for over thirty-five years
For most of that time, it was winning
71                                          71 2
At the New York Public Library, Gordy uses microfilm files and computer access to the web to search out information on Colombia and The Wolf
(
) Suddenly the guerrillas began chopping 'em up
High-tech weapons and equipment, well- trained troops, aggressive hit- and-run tactics, all financed by extortion, kidnapping and collecting taxes from dope growers
It's big money, and they put it to use

72                                                             72 3
Gordy pins up various Colombia-related articles and pictures on the wall, including the surveillance camera still of The Wolf from the front page of The New York Post
(
) The government got scared
In 1998, to jump start peace talks, it gave a coalition of guerrilla groups temporary control over much of southern Colombia
The first communist stronghold on an American continent
73                                                             73 4
Gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone
(
) But there've been few talks and no peace
And the Colombian military can't get near the guerrilla zone, especially around the town of Caguan, where the kicks ass and takes no prisoners
74                                                             74 5
Gordy circles and labels the -controlled area
(
) And that's where we come in
Supposedly, to help eliminate narcos operating in the guerrilla zone
But some well-informed people think that's just an excuse to hit the guerrillas themselves, since they're wrapped around the drug trade
We're there, we're involved
If we stay, the only real question is which Vietnam War we're gonna have
The one some feel we could've won or the one we lost
75                                                             75 6

Gordy watches them approach, wondering who they are and what they're going to do

The men run up
One man covers Gordy, while Ever and the other man rifle his pack and toss his pockets
They take his passport, wallet, and an  -shirt
And then they're gone

Feels the bloody lump on his head
It hurts, but it's not serious
He searches his pockets and backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing
Gordy stands
Looks around
He's alone
He's in the jungle
He keeps heading south

-   -                             93 Gordy trudges on
The thick jungle's hot and humid, full of   and shadowy animal movements
Gordy's going uphill, when he rounds a bend in the trail, and
He meets a man coming the other way
Alarm gives way to the realization that the man is followed by a number of people, including women and children
As they pass Gordy, it's apparent they're refugees from their haunted expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions
Gordy addresses the passing people
Indicates where he's standing

No one replies
Then a small   comes up and gets his attention
She runs back up the trail a short distance and stops
She draws a line in the dirt

She jumps backward over the line

She does it again
Panama
Colombia
She smiles
At the sound of a sharp , however, she runs back quickly, passing Gordy and rejoining her family
Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo lighter, says something to her
Whereupon the little girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him
Beat
Gordy takes them
Gracias
The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the refugees disappear around the bend
Then turns back uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in the dirt
Looks down at it
Crossing over means he walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people to flee for their lives, and
Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he now steps over the line and advances into Colombia

He lowers his pants just enough to expose his injured thigh
bandage covers the wound made by the glass shard
Gordy unwraps the bandage, revealing
wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of Anne and Matt
long, livid scar marks the wound
Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and photo inside the bandage

He looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus, unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his bearings
The dream lingers, depressing him

Some have the wrong papers
Some have none
The man puts a finger to his lips, hushing Gordy
They've come abreast of the checkpoint, which can be seen in the distance through the trees
Colombian soldiers have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection
The chiva's   loudly
When suddenly
107                                                          107 We see figures moving in the forest between the group and the checkpoint
And then
The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of being directed at the soldiers at the checkpoint
In the same instant, an  takes out a Colombian Army humvee in a bright, fiery

The guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and
Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes of a fierce young woman
In a heartbeat
The woman jumps back to her feet, and   joins her comrades laying down a suppressing  at the   soldiers
Spent cartridges rain down around Gordy, as   the -47 chops loudly over his head
And    then

The Man in the Yankees hat hauls Gordy up, yells -- Vaya
The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers, who are giving chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them
Everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and begins to run
And
Soldiers do notice them and begin to

He and others keep running

Gordy slows, but the Man in Yankees Cap won't let him stop to help

His trouble is over

Gordy and the others reach the near bank, where the path drops into the water to reappear on the opposite bank
The Man in the Yankees Cap is in the lead
He plunges into the fast water up to his waist
Gordy and the rest splash in behind, struggling to cross against the swift current
The Man in the Yankees Cap reaches the far bank
Takes two steps, and

An   looks, sees the blast-hole

Gordy realizes the old man's saying "land mine
"   To the young woman -- No
Gordy moves to catch her
Just manages to stop her as she reaches the far bank
Gordy points to where the land mine detonated
Mina
Mina
Beat
Slowly, the terrified young woman responds to the strong, calm tone of command in Gordy's voice and the unpanicked, reassuring look on his face
Gordy brings her back to the group, which fights to stand in the rushing river
He indicates for them to hold hands for stability
Motions for them to stay

The is now -
He crosses to the water's edge on the far bank
Pulls the Zippo from his pack and leans over
Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and rock immediately in front of him
Scratches lightly at the ground with the machete, searching for mines
Finds nothing in that spot
And steps onto it
Searching the ground and scratching at it with the machete before each step, Gordy inches toward the Man in the Yankees Cap
Three steps from the river
() 47
115   :                                                     115 He finds a small, round anti-personnel mine the size of a hockey puck
He inches past it
Moves past another
And another
To the writhing Man in the Yankees Cap -- Don't move
Don't move
116                                                          116 Finally, Gordy reaches him
One of the man's legs is missing below the knee
He's bleeding from various other wounds as well
Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area for more mines
Then kneels in a footprint
You'll be okay
You'll be okay
He takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet around his thigh
By way of distracting him -- Guerrilla bastards
No
Military
To stop guerrillas
Beat
Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees
117                                                          117 has left the group and emerged from the river in a different place to avoid the mines
Gordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground
The kid's about to hit it
Gordy shouts -- No
Alto
The young man hears the alarm in Gordy's voice and stops
But not before he plants his next step, and
The trip wire bows against his shin, and
Gordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and
Nothing happens
The young man just stands there, frozen in position, his leg still bowing the line

117   :                                                    117 Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to the young man
He follows the trip wire to where a Coca- Cola can hangs from a nearby tree
On closer inspection, Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade
There's no pin in the grenade
The can keeps the grenade's arming spoon in place
The trip wire's designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to explode at chest level
And the can's almost off
Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire
Then carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade
118       -                              118 When Gordy returns, the man's dead

He traces a road from the town
The road runs south through the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the capital
121                                                      121 is looking over Gordy's shoulder

One man holds a Xerox of Gordy's passport photo
The other bites into an empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down the front of his shirt
His partner finds it funny
He doesn't
And while their attention's occupied
Gordy hurries by, oblivious to the federales' presence, and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away
123
-                                                 123 The ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's packed
Gordy picks his way through
The only other gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme hat that says "Deerborn
" The geek,  , looks like a talker, and Gordy tries to avoid eye contact
He's too late
Hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man
No, that's okay -- But Armstrong's already throwing a bag off the bench

Armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat
And now his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone -- If you don't have one of these, you don't want to be up there, Gordy
Beat
Gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped deck, leaning against his father
Gordy reaches over and taps the boy
The boy looks over
Shrinks away at the sight of the large gringo
The father notices and looks at Gordy, who stands, indicates his seat
Por favor
The father's also apprehensive, doesn't move
Con mucho gusto
Finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy boy on his lap
Nods his thanks at Gordy, who then gazes down at the son
kid about Matt's age
Armstrong recognizes the look of a caring dad
Got kids, eh

He stops
Leads the other man back a few steps
Looks into the foliage along the trail
Something doesn't seem right
He extends his -47
Prods a hump of greenery with the rifle butt, and in a flash
The greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing face-paint and full-body military camouflage gear and pointing twin cocked-and-locked -15 assault rifles at the heads of the startled guerrillas

Maybe we could travel together into Caguan
You could show me around

The dock street is a culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders, of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts
There's a definite air of menace
Federales are looking for someone
Gordy follows Armstrong's look to two plain-clothes federales, one fat and one thin, standing near the dock watching the boat pull up
When Gordy glances back, Armstrong is gone

Senor Pitt
Gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale backing him up
You'll have to come with us
Why
Come with us, please
He clamps a hand on Gordy's arm
Gordy shakes it off and starts running
Almost immediately, he's tackled to the ground by the thin federale
Two more federales join in
Gordy's not gonna go down easy, though
Even as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable challenge
He's strong, and he's committed all the way
He's not getting kicked out of this country again
It's not a clean or artful fight
There's no karate
It's four men trying to tackle a bull, and
The bull gets away

and Gordy's gone

He holds his breath

Then the  pass on,  down the roof
And Gordy can breathe again

noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels
Everyone's packing a gun
new Dodge City, where death squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's

Gringo music for a gringo bar
The place is busy, with plenty of local "hostesses" for the men
Even Armstrong, standing half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad women
He's got a spoon hanging off his nose
So does one of the girls
Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the other
Gordy slips into the bar
Spots Armstrong through the crowd
Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when
The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly, revealing she's wearing the cap
It's on backwards, but now Gordy can see the "Deerborn" logo clearly
Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap
It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice
Starts toward the girl, when
Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door
The thin federale sees him at the same time
Begins moving in on him
Gordy moves faster toward the girl
And
The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab, and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics
The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy
Gordy's almost to the hat

never met a nose  couldn't hang a spoon on
Gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap
Glances back, sees the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back, when
strong hand stops him
The hand belongs to the Fat Federale
And now the thin federale's there, too, wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it
People in the bar fall silent
Everyone but Armstrong, who's finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose
Yahtzee
And now Armstong also realizes something's up
Turns and sees Gordy
Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat Federale addresses Gordy -- Come along, Mr
Pitt
Whereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy -- Police catch you trying to steal my hat, you asshole
He staggers toward Gordy
Grabs the hat
Fucking hat thief
Armstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but
Instead of hitting Gordy, Armstrong accidentally-on- purpose clocks the fat detective
Then hisses into Gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk -- Get outta here -- But then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts surprise the Armstrong neural network
Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when
The Fat Federale  him with another  , just behind the ear
And Gordy gets to know the floor, too

-  -                                    145 The jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough
They're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant
Gordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales
The Fat Federale has Armstrong's hat
He looks it over, wondering why Gordy wanted it
Then decides he could give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong
Clangs the cell door shut and locks it
Leaves shaking his head
Gringos
Armstrong's still unsteady on his feet and sits down on the metal bunk
That stun gun wasn't cool
Armstrong looks down at himself
Haven't peed my pants in a real long time
(beat) You shouldn't have helped me
Yeah, well,  guess all these assholes down here are just starting on my nerves
Gordy's silent
It's over
He's come up short
He's going home
So what the hell did you do to land us in here
And don't jerk me around, eh
Beat
Gordy sits
The Wolf killed my wife and son in New York

'm sorry, man
And what, you came down here to even things out
Gordy just looks at him
Did you even have a plan
Yeah
Go to Caguan, find The Wolf and kill him
Armstrong just shakes his head

Federales lead in two men -- the two guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged infiltrators
The federales are armed with batons and stun guns, taking no chances
It's clear the rebels weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both are cut and bruised
The tougher-looking of the two has taken a real beating
This beaten man is jammed face- first against the bars of Gordy's cell
He makes eye contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and put into a cell
Then the beaten man is shoved into the cell
solid, brick wall separates them from Gordy and Armstrong
Armstrong's seen the patches on their uniforms
To Gordy, sotto -- Beat
Armstrong sees the look on Gordy's face
By way of a warning -- If you can't kill them, don't even talk to them
The  are  in the other cell
One of them

The door opens
Soldiers enter with some federales
Gordy watches the soldiers move past his cell
Rocha is with them
And then
Brandt appears at the bars, looks in at Gordy
Enjoy your trip
Gordy stands, approaches
We asked you to leave it to us
And you guys still haven't got him
It's not over yet
The guys next door are in The Wolf's elite bodyguard unit
Where he goes, they go
We're gonna ask questions
And we're gonna get answers
And you're staying right here till our bomber's dead
Brandt goes
Moments later, a   is heard on the other side of the brick wall, waking Armstrong with a start

Gordy picks up the metal bunk and slams it against a wall
Slams it again
Breaks the metal apart
Then levers a long side rail in the cell door
He heaves
Heaves again
The fire's licking at him, but Gordy's undeterred
He heaves again, and
This time, the door gives
Gordy picks up Armstrong's cap, then picks up Armstrong, who's starting to come around
Puts Armstrong over his shoulders in a fireman's carry
Don't breathe
(weakly) You're not running through the fire, eh
Close your mouth
Because running through the fire is just what Gordy's gonna do

Gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying Armstrong
They're singed and smoking, but they're alive
Gordy drops Armstrong, pats himself and Armstrong down, knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and hair, when
Gordy's eyes meet Brandt's
The two men hold the look for a moment
If Brandt could speak, he'd be yelling at Gordy to stop, not to go on
And Gordy knows it
But Gordy's not stopping
Picks up Armstrong again and moves off toward the waterfront

-                                  171 There's less chaos here
The fires are in the distance

Sets him down
'll find a boat to take us upriver

Armstrong stops him
No
told you
The pass is only good for one person
And you're too dangerous to travel with

Gordy reaches over and takes Armstrong's cap
He looks inside
There's no pass
It hasn't been there since we landed
Gordy's at a loss
He tosses the cap back
Just looks at Armstrong

Armstrong sighs
Aw, hell
was through with this place anyway
He takes off a boot
Shakes out some money and the pass
He hands the pass to Gordy

He'll meet you in Caguan and take you to the plantation

Gordy reaches into a pocket and pulls out the photo of Anne and Matt
He looks at it for a few moments
Then pockets it again

Two souped-up bass boats filled with heavily-armed guerrillas move to intercept it
The Boatman slows, puts the panga in neutral and keeps his hands in sight
One boat of guerrillas pulls alongside
The other sheers off and stops a short distance away, ready to open fire
Gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass
One of them takes it
Reads
Looks Gordy over
Then starts to rip the pass in half, when
He stops
Grins
It's a big joke
He hands back the pass, searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on

Felix doesn't look the least bit happy

But now we have to see the
Supervisor for Caguan
It's a prospect that seems to concern Felix almost as much as Gordy
Off which, as they get into the Toyota

'  -                               177 The   for Caguan may be a Marxist, but the clean, well-ordered office is nicely appointed, with a big-screen Sony and leather furniture
The 's photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an  patch and holding an -47
brass nameplate reading "Supervisor" rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself -- a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his position
He's not in cammies now -- his uniform now consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat Rolex
Felix is a subordinate here
He and Gordy stand across the desk as the Supervisor examines Gordy's travel pass
Gordy's nervous about what could appear on the  in the b
g
, but tries not to show it
Your passport was stolen
In Mompos
Mompos is a shithole
Not like Caguan
Why didn't Armstrong come
He was arrested in Ecuador
He got drunk and fooled around with a police officer's wife
The Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face for signs he's lying
Gordy's expression stays the same
Felix respectfully interjects
It's almost a plea
(in Spanish) We need to fix the equipment
We have delivery deadlines to meet

Felix resumes his former tone of command
The Supervisor made you my responsibility
You don't go anywhere without me, you understand
No problemo
Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive, looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf, searching the face of every man
He doesn't see The Wolf, but what he does see surprises him
The Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos
It's a third- world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here the streets are calm and orderly
It's quiet, almost eerie, as people go about their business

He and Gordy get out
Felix begins leading Gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds
The problem's with the diesel generators
The sons-of-bitches keep breaking down

We can fix anything, but these keep dying on us
You'll start now
'll have tools brought to you

Let's hope you have his skill
Felix walks over to a guerrilla with an -47 and speaks to him
Then goes
Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him

Well

These generators cost a fortune
Then treat them that way

Gordy registers the look and the connection to the bar

clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper, and
Gordy realizes his picture is on the paper
He smears grease from his hands over it

-                                              191 Gordy finishes loading the parts into the Land Cruiser
Let's get moving
'm thirsty
How about you
Want to get something to drink
Felix pauses
We see the look of desire again
Gordy's definitely struck a chord
But Felix quickly stifles it
We have to get back

need a drink
nice cold beer
How about it
saw a bar in town
Felix really wants to, but still hesitates
With the spare parts, 'll have the generators running in two hours
We have time for a couple beers

Finally -- Okay
Just a beer
Maybe two

Felix has, anyway
He's drunk
He's also in love with a waitress on his lap, a cute gordita named
He pats her
This is mine
This is the reason come here
right, Berta
Me amas
(playing along) Si, amor
Somebody whistles for a drink, and Berta goes
She's hot, isn't she
Yeah
Long beat
Gordy makes the play he's been contemplating
Armstrong said to watch my butt around here
guess the fucking Americans come down and shoot everyone all the time
Especially now, since the bomb in New York

Who did it
Felix is just loose enough
The Wolf, and they'll never catch him
Ever see him
Once
Where
(beat; eyes Gordy) If you know too much around here, it can get you killed
Gordy's gotten all he'll get from Felix
He feigns nonchalance, smiles
Tell me what doesn't get you killed around here
Gordy takes a swig of beer
When
Gordy sees the Beaten Man from the jail in Mompos
The man has just walked in with another guerrilla
Gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross the room
At the bar, the bartender puts out two crates of beer
The guerrillas take the beer and head out
No money's changed hands
When they're gone, to Felix -- We'd better get back, huh
(checks his watch) Shit
It's late

-                                                  193 The two guerrillas are just driving away in a big- wheeled, high ground-clearance Suburban as Gordy and Felix emerge

You're too drunk

We'll have lobster and drink lots of wine
'll get her drunk
We'll drive home
'll carry her inside
'll kiss her
And then, 'll screw her in my bed
The Suburban pulls up next to a house
There are armed guerrilla guards outside
And when  am done screwing her, she'll never want to look at another man again
Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start carrying the beer inside
And a moment later
Felix comes around with a start
What the fuck are you doing
He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy
Hey, easy
What's the problem
() 75
195   :                                                      195 You're going the wrong goddamn way

Looks different in the dark
Turn around
Gordy turns the car around
Felix keeps the gun on him
You drive where  say
Or the Supervisor will have us both shot
Gordy drives back
They approach the Suburban and the house once more
This time it's on Felix' side
Felix gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and
Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the other way: a large propane tank next to the house
196
-   -                          196 The work in the sheds continues
Heat lamps dry down the long tables of coke

He has two sentries now
One wears a combat vest, and as Gordy works, his eyes go to the grenades hanging on the vest's front
199
-   -                        199 The sun's over the yardarm now, blazing hot, and Gordy's still working under the watchful eyes of the guards
Nearby, a group of guerrillas is playing soccer, when

The man in the combat vest responds
The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining the skins
Puts down his , strips off his combat vest and shirt, and runs in
Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades
With the other guard still watching him closely, however, there's nothing Gordy can do
200     -                                             200 The soccer game rages back and forth
Suddenly, an open man gets the ball
Breaks toward the goal
Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the goalie
He cheers the action loudly, whereupon
Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and
Gordy grabs a grenade
Almost gets it into a tool box, when
The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and
Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping into the tool box by picking up a large wrench
But the grenade's still visible as now
Felix comes around the corner
He's sleepy and hungover
And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress
It's afternoon
Yesterday, you said it would only take two more hours
Gordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade
have this one ready to go
Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the It , but won't catch
Felix just looks at him
Gordy makes an adjustment, and
This time,   the

What about the other one

Shit
Fine
Let's go
Gordy grabs the tool box
Why're you bringing the tool box
The old part's in there
need to match it, and it's all greasy
Felix buys it and heads off
As Gordy follows him

Gordy notices Felix doesn't even glance at it
Berta working today
Ha
Puta
We see that, whatever this means, it's an unexpected complication for Gordy

Felix starts driving
Gordy's down to final straws
We can't stop for one beer
There's beer at the plantation
(thinking fast) There's no Berta at the plantation
like drinking beer around pretty girls, not a bunch of guys with automatic rifles
To hell with Berta
What happened
Last night you were in love with her
There's a beat
Felix glances at Gordy
Decides it's safe to confide
had a dream
fed her lobster, got her drunk, and she rejected me for another man
(off Gordy's look) Dreams tell the future
That wasn't a dream, that was the alcohol talking
You saying two men can't go have a beer and look at women's breasts because of pink elephants
Nothing makes any sense down here

Gordy doesn't blink an eye
Go ahead and shoot me, and you fix the goddamn generator
Part's in the back

Felix, thinking it all over

Felix is pretty wasted
Berta's in his lap again
In Spanish -- You know 'm your man, baby
Someone whistles for a drink
Berta starts to stand
Gordy slips her twenty  dollars to stay
She does
have to piss
Gordy crosses, exits into the bano

-                             209 Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box
He slides it just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked over the waistband
He finds some wire
Then searches for something else
Finds a piece of string and checks its length
From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's too short
Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets
Nothing
He checks the glove box
No long string there, either
But he does find two rubber bands
Gordy studies them a moment, thinking
Tests their elasticity
Then pulls out the Zippo and thumbs it
The lighter still works
As Gordy pockets everything and walks off
210
-   -                               210 Gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone coming
He's re-tracing the route he took the night before, when he followed the Beaten Man's Suburban

211   ""                                                         211 He passes the "Cine" in the storefront
movie's beginning to play on the supervisor's big-screen
The place is packed
No one sees Gordy, who moves on
212                                                             212 continues to make his way through Caguan, when
He rounds a corner, and there's a four-man  patrol, two in a truck and two out
Gordy turns, starts heading back, when
One of the  calls to him
Alto
Gordy stops
The two standing men walk toward him
The other two men get out of the truck to provide backup
One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up
Gordy carefully produces the travel pass
The guerrilla looks it over
In butchered Spanish -- Yo trabajo con Felix
Felix -- (indicates) -- la cantina
Con Berta
The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy guerrilla waves them on
The woman and boy hustle by, glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as they pass
They hurry on toward the nearby "Cine
" Gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start walking to the truck
213
-                                                213 The guerrilla patrol has taken Gordy to Felix, still sitting with Berta in his lap
Are you trying to get us both killed
went for a walk
figured you wanted to be alone with Berta
() 81
213   :                                                  213 (to the guerrillas; in Spanish) 'll make sure he's on a shorter leash
The patrol leader looks at Felix hard
Then nods
The guerrillas go
Felix dumps Berta onto her feet, stands
Felix looks at Gordy, shakes his head
Shit

-                                    214 Gordy and Felix get in
You're working all night, Beckmann
That generator gets fixed, and you're out of my hair in the morning
Felix jams the car in drive
Gordy looks down, sees the spoon of the grenade exposed
As he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon

Gordy stands
He stares hopefully at the
Then pushes the starter, and
The heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten
Gordy turns to Felix
That make you happy
No response
Where's my money
You'll get it in the morning

-  -                               216 Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights
The room's a mess
All kinds of rubbish
There's a washtub sink
There's a cot
This where Armstrong stays
This is where you stay
boat will take you down river at seven
Felix closes the door
We hear a
Gordy moves to the door and tries it
It's definitely locked
Through a small window, he can see the lights in the sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime  sentries patrolling the grounds

Gordy turns back
Readjusts the grenade digging into his belly, then hooks it back inside his pants
He turns off the light
Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door
another small window, he can see it's dark in this direction
Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room
We see some rubber tubing
We see some rope
Gordy finally finds a piece of sharp metal
He moves to the wall with the window
With the  covering the noise, Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe

218 Gordy is making slow progress through the wall, when he hears the  arrive
He moves to the window by the door and looks out
Sees the Suburban
Four guerrillas are getting out, including the Beaten Man
Felix meets them
The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix
Felix indicates Gordy's room
As the Beaten Man continues to question Felix
Gordy realizes he's fucked
He can't get through the wall fast enough
His eyes go to water dripping from a pipe leading to the washtub sink
He moves to it
Finds the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap
Cranks shut the master valve on the pipe
Wraps his hands around the pipe and pulls
Nothing
Jams his feet against the wall for leverage and pulls harder
And this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink
He finds the rubber hose
Fits an end over the pipe

Then cranks on the master valve
High-pressure water streams from the hose
Gordy sneaks a peek out the window
The Beaten Man's still questioning Felix
The sound of the hose water is being covered by the
Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole he's made in the wall
He aims the stream at the hole
Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even harder
And watches the jet begin eating away at the old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement
219
219 The Beaten Man finishes with Felix
Felix begins leading the guerrillas toward the storeroom
220
220 Gordy's made progress, but hasn't broken through yet
And he won't, not in enough time
Under his breath -- Come on, baby
come on, baby
And just then
221
221 --, one of the  Gordy repaired suffers a spectacularly loud internal breakdown
The heat lights dim in a row of sheds
Felix and the guerrillas stop to see what's happening
At which point, the generator now into

Just in time
And we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as
The water jet breaks through
The hole's still small
Gordy begins to widen it
84
223
223 Felix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume their march toward the storeroom
They reach the storeroom
Water's pouring out under the door
Felix unlocks the door and opens it to find
224
224 Gordy's gone
The Beaten Man signals two men to go out the hole
To the other man -- (in Spanish) Organize the others
Find him
The man goes
Outside, we hear him  orders to the guerrillas guarding the plantation
The Beaten Man turns to Felix
Felix is terrified
In a pleading tone -- (in Spanish) He can't be far
You'll catch -- The Beaten Man  Felix in the head
Then exits
Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water still streaming across the floor
225
-                                 225 The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man
They can't find Gordy
To the men guarding the plantation -- (in Spanish) Keep looking
He signals his men to come with him
They get into the Suburban
Whereupon we
226                                                    226 Gordy's hanging onto the chassis
With the large tires and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to get his legs over the rear axle
He's just finishing rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other, to support Gordy's back
He hears the  , grabs the transfer case, and
85

The rear    madly, inches from Gordy's face
And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy- duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's legs

The dirt and the dust are choking
Even for a short distance, it's going to be a long, dangerous ride

Even with the rope supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands
vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade
It starts to slip free
Gordy can't stop it without letting go
The grenade falls, and
Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it
Barely
The spoon just hanging on the end of his fingertips
Gordy can't use his other hand to get it
He needs the hand to hold onto the car
The grenade begins to slip
He's going to lose it
And just as it falls
Gordy does the only thing left
He slips a finger through the loops of the grenade pin
Just barely snags the grenade before it drops to the road
And then
Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach, where he gets a better grip
Jams the grenade back
Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm

Slides out on the side away from the house
Hides behind a large wheel
The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut trees
Gordy watches the guards
When the guards aren't looking, he runs to the nearest tree
The sounds of the '  covers his footsteps
233                                                             233 Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't looking, when he reaches one tree, and
234                                                          234 coconut hits the ground next to him, and
One of the guards comes to investigate
The guard gets closer
Gordy inches around the tree
He can't get away without being seen
He nudges the coconut with his toe
Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to roll away, and
The guard picks it up
Never sees Gordy in the shadow of the tree, pressed against the trunk
The guard shows the coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back
235                                                             235 sneaks to another tree
Then reaches the house
He moves to a window
Peers into a room
No one's there
But we hear the sound of
Gordy creeps along the wall
Looks into another room, and
236                                                            236 is a group of  guerrillas, including the Beaten Man, packing suitcases, etc
Leaving in a hurry

Except for the Beaten Man, no face is familiar
man with his   us stands, and there's nothing familiar about him, either
When
238                                                      238 Directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room
He's also in  guerrilla camo

64th Street

It's the same face
243                                                     243 He's found The Wolf, when
Suddenly, a guard appears, and
Gordy freezes
Eases into the shadows
His dirty face and clothes blend in just enough
The guard moves past

He takes out the grenade
Puts the rubber bands around it, spoon and all
Grips the grenade in his hand, holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin
And then
Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring- loaded spoon
If they'll do it
if the spoon goes now, Gordy's going up in the blast
Gordy continues to relax his grip
The rubber bands stretch
Stretch more
Keep stretching until they're barely holding the spoon
but they're holding it
Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank
Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton
Holds the cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his fingers
And

Gordy squeezes out as much as he can onto them
Then Gordy gets the hell out of there
He finds cover
Ducks down
And waits
245    -                                               245 The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands

He looks in the direction of the sound, and
Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching on the road
She's singing a gentle song in Spanish
Gordy's eyes flash with alarm
He glances at the house
247    -                                               247 The lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands, which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and stretch from the pressure of the spoon

No
Stop
Alto
The Woman and Boy look over in alarm, see Gordy running toward them and yelling
Get back
253    -                                                  253 The rubber bands are about to break

Screams toward the house -- Claudio

Pulls them down
Covers them protectively with his body, when

Dust fills the air

Gets to his hands and knees
Sees the Woman and Boy are safe, when
vicious kick in the ribs lifts Gordy off the ground, rolling him away from the Woman and child
You bastard
The Wolf's alive and unhurt
Angrily punts Gordy again
You think you can kill The Wolf
boot in the face this time
You think you can kill The Wolf
piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordy's pockets and fluttered to the ground nearby
The woman picks it up, and we see
It's the photo of Anne and Matt
The woman stares at the photo a moment, as
Gordy absorbs another blow
He tries to stand
You killed my wife and son -- Whack
The Wolf slams the butt of an -47 against Gordy's skull
Gordy drops hard
The Wolf reverses the Points it at Gordy's head, about to pull the trigger, when
The Woman lays a hand on The Wolf's arm
Claudio
The Wolf doesn't take his eyes off Gordy
The Woman squeezes his arm
Implores him -- Claudio

Meets her eyes a moment
Sees the photo in her hand
Glances up into her eyes again
They hold the look
whole conversation exchanged without words
Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying in a pile on the ground
Beat
To Gordy -- You were just saved by your guardian angel
262
-                                   262 Dark and dank
Excavated clay walls and floor
Heavy door
bare overhead bulb provides some light
Gordy lies on a metal bed frame
One of his legs is chained to the bed
He's in pain from being kicked -- but the physical aches are nothing compared to the anguish he feels for having failed
The door's unlocked and opens
Daylight streams in from above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards
He moves to the middle of the room
Looks at Gordy
One of the men in the jail with you in Mompos is dying
He was burned in your explosion
Gordy just looks at him
The Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and frees his leg from the chain
You want to kill me
Come and kill me
The bodyguards are smiling
Gordy hesitates, then springs for The Wolf, and
The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking karate combination
The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and brutally effective
Even still, Gordy springs back right away
and The Wolf drops him again
You Americans think you have all the answers
And really, you're so naive
() 92
262   :                                                       262 Gordy comes up swinging
Gordy's a barroom fighter
If he can touch you, you're in trouble
He never gets close
vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives him to the floor
The Wolf stands over him
You see one peasant with a gun, and you never ask why he has to have it
You just run to give your billions to the nearest soldiers, no matter how merciless or corrupt they are
The last kick really hurt Gordy
He's slow rising
That's why 'm teaching America a lesson
that's why there'll be more bombs
and more families like yours will pay the price
The Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline onto fire
Gordy explodes off the ground
The suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard
Gordy drives him backward
Slams him against a wall
Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen
All his weight behind the punches
Trying to break ribs and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when
bodyguard slams the butt of an  into Gordy's kidneys
Gordy takes the blow standing
The guard delivers a second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in agony
Beat
The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to his midsection
And then
He makes Gordy pay for the punches
Lands blow after blow on Gordy's face
Beats the living shit out of him
and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor
263                                                               263 we hear a gentle  sound

265
-                                       265 Gordy's still in a deep fog from the beating, barely there at all
Who are you
My name is Selena
His wife
Yes

The sea shells clack
Gordy loses consciousness again, and everything goes

It's a new day
He's better

-                                         268 Gordy slowly sits up
Beat
Why feed me
Why not just kill me
Are you so anxious to die
Gordy doesn't have an answer
Beat
He tastes the meal

Selena watches him a moment, troubled by something
The men in jail with you in Mompos
They say you talked to a man from the
'm not one of them
'm here for my own reasons
Selena watches him another moment
Decides he's telling the truth
She reaches into a skirt pocket, then extends her hand toward Gordy
He looks up
She's holding the photo of Anne and Matt
Beat
Gordy takes the photo
Looks at his wife and son
Selena sits next to him
Another beat
Then, off the photo
Claudio used to be a teacher was a medical aid worker
We met in Guatemala, in an Indian village called Guamaunco
We were married there
Sophia, our daughter was born there
Claudio was kind and loving, and we were happy
We were there four years when the civil war broke out
The guerrillas were all around us, but left us alone
Then they made an attack on the army nearby
The next night, soldiers came to our village
They were led by American 'advisors'
They accused us of helping the rebels
Our women were raped
Our men were tortured
Our homes were burned
We crawled out into the fields, but they threw grenades, and Sophia
Selena hesitates, choking back her emotions
my baby girl was hit by shrapnel
she bled to death in Claudio's arms
She looks into Gordy's eyes
The look says she understands and shares Gordy's pain because she's suffered her own painful loss
She looks away again

When that war ended, we moved to the next war, and the next
Each fight has only deepened his hatred
And poisoned his soul
(beat) He's unable to love anything anymore
Why are you still here
Because  know he was a good man, who's been consumed by rage because of what he lost
Just like you
'm not like him
Not yet
He kills innocent people

Selena suddenly stands, uncomfortable, not wanting to discuss it
She goes to the door and knocks Gordy, as the door opens, and Selena exits

The storm's gonna be real bad for at least twelve hours
Here's the data
He hands a paper to Brandt
Cops a puff off Brandt's cigarette while Brandt reads
Air ops says it's too heavy for the Blackhawks
Also, Sat-Intel is saying the clouds're too thick, and we're blind

Yeah
The creeks are rivers around Caguan
Unless The Wolf's a fish, he's not moving
And there's fresh coffee
Only good thing down here
Put everyone on red till tomorrow night

but she's not there for the tray
Moves past it to Gordy's leg and, to Gordy's surprise, begins unlocking the shackle
We're going with you
When Gordy's free -- How do we get out
She hands Gordy a length of pipe secreted in her dress
The guard is the only one close
When we're past him, we can slip into the jungle

We see a block of reddish Semtex plastic explosive and a chemical fuse
Everybody out
Clear this floor
Now

358 Institute personnel evacuate offices

-  -             359 Selena and the agents cross the street toward the safe house
Claudio  the  toward them
Selena hears the
Sees Claudio coming
Uses the front edge of her hand to strike the female agent hard in the throat
The agent falls to her knees trying to suck air through a crushed windpipe
Selena whip-kicks the other agent to the ground
Claudio brakes hard next to Selena, who takes the female agent's pistol and spare magazines as

Claudio   with a  , hitting two agents and scattering Gordy, Phipps and the rest
Selena the two escort people dead, then  away at the other people pouring out of the institute as she straddles the Ducati behind Claudio, and the powerful off down the street
Gordy jumps to his feet and runs after them

Debris showers the street
363                                                           363 keeps moving
364                                        364 runs one way in the direction the Ducati's headed
Far down the block, the bike turns right onto another one-way street
365                                                           365 spots an alley on his right and turns into it
366
366 Gordy's now moving parallel to Claudio and Selena, sprinting hard toward another one-way street, which crosses the alley ahead
He doesn't know if he'll intercept the bike, but it's his only shot
367
367 Claudio  the  down the second street, parallel to Gordy's alley
He and Selena reach an intersection with the one-way street
right turn will complete the "" and take them back toward Gordy
Straight ahead, the street they're on is one-way in the opposite direction
Claudio hangs right and cranks on the speed
123
368
368 Gordy's almost to the next street
He can hear the of the  growing closer
When
truck stops ahead of him and blocks the alley
Gordy veers into a walkway between buildings
369
369 parked   car suddenly pulls out in front of the speeding Ducati
Claudio can't swerve around it
the The car's driver, frightened and flustered by the near   collision, is slow moving out of the way
370
-                                       370 Gordy bursts through a gate
Sees back steps leading to the open door of a second-story over a garage and charges the steps
371
371 The driver of the car finally backs up
Claudio aims the through a narrow gap and  on
372
372 Gordy blows into the second story of the garage, a converted old-time carriage barn
He's in the old hayloft
On the opposite side of the loft, a double door built for loading in hay is open above the street
Gordy sprints for the opening, and
373
373 The Ducati tears around traffic, when
Gordy leaps out of the hayloft, launches himself off a parked car as the   past, and
He just manages to grab Selena and yank her off the bike
Selena's arms are wrapped around Claudio -- when Gordy rips her out of the saddle, Claudio goes, too
The three of them tumble to the ground as the speeding Ducati spins, flips and disintegrates
124
374                                                           374 in leathers and a helmet
He takes the fall better than Selena
Gets to his feet
Looks for the guns they dropped
Before Claudio can get to a gun, Gordy's on him
They grapple
Gordy pounds Claudio hard
Once
Twice
When
375                                                            375 side-kicks Gordy
He sags
She front-kicks a heel into his spine and between his shoulder blades
Gordy lets go of Claudio and drops
Selena's relentless, kicks Gordy repeatedly as
376                                                           376 gets the pistol

Aims the gun two-handed at Gordy's head, and

The first   the back of Claudio's helmet
The second  punches through and exits his visor in a bright red mist of blood
378                                                            378 bolts

380                                                              380 a  at Selena, but he doesn't have a clear shot and misses
381                                                            381 sees a walkway between houses and turns in
382     -                                          382 Gordy turns in behind her
125
383
383 Selena has ten yards on Gordy, but he's closing
She knows she can't outrun him in a straight line
Jukes through a gate into
384
-                             384 shovel lies in the grass
Selena scoops it up and in one motion, spins back toward the gate, launches it blade-first with all her strength, timing it perfectly, as Gordy runs through the gate, and
385                                                            385 just barely evades the sharp shovel edge headed for his face
It doesn't hurt him, but it stops him, and Selena breaks toward an open door of the house
386
-                                 386 Selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a playroom
Gordy's right behind her
387                                                           387 mounts a stairwell
girl's descending
Selena grabs a pigtail and flings her down the stairs, and
388                                                            388 gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from falling all the way to the bottom
He sits the uninjured girl down and continues on
389                                                           389 runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a renovation
Without stopping, she tears through the plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the rest of the house
She topples what she can into Gordy's way
Throws nails down behind her
Grabs a circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him and shattering a large wall mirror
Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield -- this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway
126
390                                                           390 leads into the dining room
Selena runs in
Gordy's right on her heels
Selena pulls down dining room chairs in front of Gordy
He vaults one but trips over the second and falls
391                                                            391 blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all the noise
Both women tumble
Selena gets right back on her feet
She breaks out a window with the crowbar and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the dining room
392                                                           392 thru                                                                 thru 394                                                                  394 395
-                                   395 The window Selena slipped through easily is small for Gordy
He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious seconds
Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the fire escape steps
The fire escape ends at a top floor window
Selena out the  with the crowbar and goes in
396
-                                 396 Selena's in a teenager's bedroom
The teenager's got headphones on, oblivious to everything
Selena darts through a bathroom into a second bedroom
396A                                                            396A enters the first bedroom behind her
397                                                             397 and holding a digging tool stands on a stairwell landing, alarmed and confused by the chaos she hears in her house
She had started down the stairs but now has turned back at the sound of the on the top floor
Calls
What's going on
127
398                                                            398 runs into the hallway at the top of the stairs, above the woman
Who are you
What are you doing in here
399                                                            399 sees an open rooftop door at the top of a flight of stairs and charges upward without answering
400   '                                                        400 in the hallway a second later
Meets the Woman In Gardening Clothes, who's now come up the stairs
She screams
Swipes at him with the digging tool, making three deep scratches in his face
Gordy doesn't stop
401                                                           401 402
- /                       402 This is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop flower bed
Selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs to the next town house roof
Gordy hits the roof behind her
403                                                            403 As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of town houses, we see her warrior determination and discipline
She's thinking ahead and she never hesitates
Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally well-trained and determined firefighter
And he's not far back
One tumble, and he'll catch her
Selena strains harder
404                                                            404 vaults a gap
Moments later, Gordy vaults it
405                                                            405 finally runs out of roof
She looks down
fire escape ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard of a small foreign embassy
Still holding the crowbar, Selena takes the ladder down
128
405A                                                     405A Gordy reaches the ladder
Selena's ahead of him by a floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time
Gordy doesn't fuck with the rungs
Just swings over the edge of the roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands, squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets gravity take over
406
-                                       406 The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony running around the inside wall of the courtyard
Twin staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where, across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate opens onto the street
Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena
He grabs her
Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm
Gordy has to let go
Selena heads for the stairs leading to the ground
407    '                                                       407 got one chance to intercept Selena
The balcony's too high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either
Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a living
Gordy runs down the balcony
Gains speed
Jumps
Launches off the balcony railing
And hurtles himself at the trunk of a medium-sized tree
He hits the trunk
Hangs on
And slides to the ground
And now
408                                                      408 He's between Selena and the only way out
And there's no way she's getting past him
But that's not what Selena's thinking
She attacks with the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of the vicious onslaught
He finds a nearby garbage can
It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the crowbar
The   into the can over and over, the sound   in the small courtyard
Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit
It's a feint
She swings under the can and hits a leg
It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his feet, still holding the can
Selena goes for his head
() 129
408   :                                                       408 Gordy raises the can
Thwock
Thwock
The can's all dents
There's garbage everywhere
She feints high and then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee
Gordy stumbles badly this time
Selena breaks for the gate
Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can across the slate pavers, and
The can takes Selena's legs out from under her
She falls hard
Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to run, when
Gordy hits her like a linebacker
Slams Selena against a brick wall
Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm around her thin neck
Selena squirms hard, kicks backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free
But she's not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have to kill him before he'd let go
Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around Selena's neck
Uses his weight to force the smaller woman down onto her knees
Presses her harder, till she's sitting back on her legs
Selena can't drop out of the hold, and her legs are immobilized
All she can do is scratch
But Gordy's oblivious
They're alone in the courtyard
Body to body
Head to head
He's pumped with fury and hatred
He tightens the chokehold
Hisses in her ear -- You killed them
(beat; with contempt) One woman, one boy -- they mean nothing next to the thousands who've been slain
Gordy hears it
It only drives him to a deeper fury
They were my family
Gordy's blind with rage
Chokes her neck hard
Summoning all the power in him, first to shut off her air and blood, and then to continue squeezing, relishing her every dying moment, until he's snuffed out the life of the person who took Anne and Matt from him
And
() 130
408   :    (2)                                                   408 He can't
it's all he's wanted since he saw Anne and Matt die, but now he can't do it
He's a firefighter
He saves lives
If he kills Selena, Gordy crosses into her world, into Brandt's world, into the brutal nightmare destroying Colombia and all the places like it, and becomes part of that sadness and death
And
Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe
Selena gasps for air
The impulse to murder has left Gordy
There's a new resolve
The killing ends here
Beat
Selena pants
It will never end
409                                                               409 Under which an    emerges from the building
He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man holding a smaller woman in a chokehold
Draws his gun
Let her go
Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun
Selena screams
Please help me
Let her go
No
You don't understand
He's trying to kill me
Let her go, or you're dead
He's going to shoot
Gordy has no choice
As he lets Selena go and stands -- Hold us both till the police get here
131
410                                                       410 It's too late
Selena stomps a heel into the Guard's knee, crushing it, then twists the gun from his hands
She points it at him and pulls the trigger, and
In his agitation, the guard never took the safety off
Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety
411                                                       41 In the same moment, Gordy grabs the crowbar from the ground
412                                                             412 flicks off the safety and points the gun again
413                                                              413 hurls the crowbar with all his might, and
414                                                           414 The  , just as the crowbar hits Selena, spoiling her aim
The bullet creases the guard's arm
Selena recovers
And the next
415                                                       415 Isn't hers
It's from Phipps'
It takes Selena in the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way through her body
She's dead on her feet
Her body crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large pool that quickly spreads over the slate
416                                                        416 move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol
He walks to Gordy
The two men share a long, silent look
It's over
Gordy looks again at Selena's body in its pool of blood
Then turns and goes
417   '                                                        417 entering the courtyard as Gordy walks out
Brandt's seen Selena
He's smiling
() 132
417   :                                                     417 We got the bitch
Gordy hits him
One of the jackhammer blows he slammed into Claudio in the bunker
hard fist deep in the gut that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his knees
Beat
Gordy's voice is cold and hard -- You're no better than she is
And Gordy goes
418
-  -                                  418 Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker
He's wearing civvies
He stops cranking, spoons out a huge dollop into a bowl
419
-                                       419 Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro, who's playing in the front seat of the pumper
Mauro tastes it
Thumbs up
Gordy smiles
Mike and the other men on Gordy's old shift are watching
To Gordy -- It'll be good to get you back
Gordy turns to them
Looks into the faces of these men, the people closest to him in the world
Beat
Then -- It's good to be home
Gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son he'll never see again
But Gordy's gonna be alright
Mauro's gonna be with him
There'll be fires to put out and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem see each and every day
As we  ,  and  from the old brick edifice from which the big red truck will come, bringing help
