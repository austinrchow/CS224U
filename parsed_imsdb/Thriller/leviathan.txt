"Leviathan", shooting draft, revised by Jeb Stuart Screenplay by David Webb Peoples and Jeb Stuart Revised Draft September 8, 1987 sunny and placid then slowly Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life
school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison
Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows
The school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before
Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us
Cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated
Five thousand feet, ten thousand
Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents
Then suddenly from
Burritos
Enchiladas
(hispanic voice) Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff
(female) can't wait for fresh vegetables
Several voices suddenly break into argument
"vegetables
" "shit," "burgers"
Suddenly another voice rises above the others
' / Okay, cut the chatter
You're not out of here, yet
Who's the hook
Seven
You got a hook on container 22
pause, then more voices
' / (redneck drawl) The man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit
' / Watch your mouth, Sixpack
Hello, Shack, Seven, here
ain't the hook, over
light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an --fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall
It is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name,  across the front breastplate
As it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, Then a woman's voice
' (woman's voice) Six to Shack
'm the hook
/ littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment  sits at the monitor controls
He is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks
He'll be a hell of a good- looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened
From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way
' / Okay, Six, let's wrap this container and call it a day
Above him a bank of monitor screens
Each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet
Beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled
With a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the ), its picture we see on the monitor
It is moving
'   The inside of her helmet is a grid of gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure
She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm
The move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters
First, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool
Next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position
Sixpack's voice comes over the radio
' Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something
We're all waiting on you, honey
(under control) Keep your pants on Sixpack
promise you'll be inside before "Mr
Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on
other men's voices laughing
They like Willie and cheer her on
"Tell him, Willie," "Atta girl," etc
Willie  in her last tool and turns
Expertly she hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute-- --which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in by a winch
' Six to Shack
Hook's on
Ready to winch
Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and dumpsters squatting in the gloom
winch begins grinding and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks
It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with several others to complete a set
We hear '
/ Ok, that's it
Come on in
More motor suited  appear, their helmet lights glaring
Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights: , ,
As they approach the  , where an elevator will transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc
formal sign towers over the entrance
It says:
6
He moves behind the others
Suddenly he freezes in his tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the glare of his helmet beam   the a hideous looking It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm
Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick movement, snares it
The latch opens and the writhing sea spider is shoved inside
From the pocket the diver's suit until we see the name  on the breastplate
He looks around to see if anyone has noticed then continues on toward the shack
(  ) They walk together to the Shack
Latino , , comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an exaggerated accent
When it's time to relax
One thing stands clear
As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated by age and rank
He is the shack boss, management
He listens as a    joins in off-key
' (
) Mil-ler's tastes too good to hurry through
As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair in front of a bank of equipment monitors
The vital signs of each miner and his equipment are registered on this console
The chair in front of them sits conspicuously empty
This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand written sign under the console which states: ' Inside his helmet we see the grid of  gauges monitoring vital signs
beer after beer
Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom corner inside DeJesus' helmet
The words to the song freeze in his mouth
His voice becomes edged with panic
(cont'd) Oh, shit
/ (to DeJesus) Hey, Hazy, 'm not that bad, man
(rising terror) Jonesy
'm losing compression
'm going to blow my suit, man
Beck
Doc
Help me
Beck grabs his microphone
He tries to remain calm but there is a definite tremble in his voice
Give me a readout, DeJesus
( ) (gripped with panic) Ahhhh
The other divers move quickly to DeJesus
( ) DeJesus
readout
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help
() (anything but calm) Stay calm
Calm
Where's Doc
Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost
(trying to keep control) The internal monitors read normal
, Where's Doc
() He's not at his station
(panicked) Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive me of my-- ' (making a decision) Get him into the Shack
DeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion
"15, 14, 13
"  DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the last few yards to the
/ - sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life
We see the same countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges
10, 9, 8
He is forced into the , the underwater elevator room is eerily lit
His readout continues inside his helmet
5, 4, 3
DeJesus screams
DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room
Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens
He hits it again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by the    of the elevator
It's moving
Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock
/ DeJESUS'  dripping wet
It stands inside the Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water
, for a moment they remain closed, then suddenly they flutter
He's alive
- The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess features neatly stenciled letters that say:  " "
The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board obviously changes daily
Right now, it's a "3"
,  and a Coke can rolls out of a compact big, sandy-haired man, , takes the soft drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  , Black, athletic, 30's;  , 50's, a career miner with a mouthful of gum;  , 35, attractive, hardened woman, she has seen more of the world than any of them;  , twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist
, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still shaken from his experience
The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight
'm telling you, it's the suits
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them
It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened
And just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh
Sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a huge belch
(cont'd) That would have been you, DeJesus
DeJesus keeps his head down
(cont'd) Yeah
was standing next to a guy who blew a suit once in the Indian Ocean
little tiny hole in the fucking toe of his suit ocean came in and the pressure crammed his whole fucking body up into his helmet
They just buried his helmet
(coldly) know all about implosion, man
Yeah,  bet you do
(laughs) bet you were imploding in your pants
(laughs then imitates a hysterical DeJesus) Jonesy
Doc
Help me
Help me
DeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat - Beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks
Knock it off, Sixpack
know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart
Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as    we see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters
Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away
Shit
He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking father
Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute Manager , etc
line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining
He opens his door to leave when stops him cold
The entire Shack seems shifting, like a giant waking from a nap
The  stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold
All eyes go to the ceiling and walls
Fuck the suits man
this place is going to kill us first
Just as suddenly as it began the    and in its place   an intermittent  in the air system
Only Cobb seems undisturbed by this sound
(listening) There it is again
(sitting down again) Two more days
tell myself 'you can make it two more days--' What's the weather like up top
Clear for pickup
Let's hope it holds
Cobb looks up disgustingly
Then what
Huh
(to everyone) Then what
You folks think going up top's the answer to all your problems
Well, it ain't
Give us a break, Cobb
break
You folks don't need a break, you need psychiatrists
'Know what you'd be doing if you were up there, right now
(a boorish leer) Eating pussy and drinking brew
Eating pussy my ass
What about lines at the bank:  What about getting stuck in traffic
(grinning) Wherever  can find it
Everyone laughs but Cobb,   he's serious
Bullshit
'll tell you what you'd be doing
You'd be watching news on that's so fucking bad it makes you nauseous
So you go out and get in your car to get some fresh air and after you've been driving for five minutes you realize the air's so damn dirty you don't dare breath it
That's what you've got to look forward to
Beck approaches the Mess and as he nears it we hear Cobb ranting inside
' (
) And if you're lucky enough to make it back home to your house that looks the fucking same as everyone else's, you'll find your wife's just as fat as she was when you left and the only reason your kids ain't strung out on the drugs they were using when you left is that they've found some new drugs which fuck 'em up even more
You people just don't appreciate how good you've got down here
hesitates at the door to the Mess, as though screwing up his courage, then takes a deep breath and enters as we Everyone looks up as Beck enters and the room goes quiet
Beck notices Doc's empty chair
Doc eat already
The good doctor hasn't showed yet
Looks are exchanged
Sixpack smirks knowingly
(to DeJesus) How do you feel, DeJesus
(obviously embarrassed to be singled out) Okay
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner
Yeah, since he was busy earlier when you needed him
He cracks up and Beck turns on him
Cut it, Sixpack
Sixpack shuts up, but Beck notices the others feel the seriousness of Doc's absence during the emergency
(cont'd) Leave the Doc to me
'm going to talk to him
(sarcastically, under his breath to Bowman) 'Makes me feel better already
Beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about something else
He clears his throat
've been looking at the duty roster
at the shack hours outstanding
Uh, oh
see where this is going
(ignoring Jones) all of you owe time and thought tonight would be a good time to--- (erupting) No way, Mister Beck
No fucking way We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift
It's a contract violation
Whooo
Right on, Cobb
Let's hear it for our shop Steward
Hear that Becky, er, Mr
Beck
Company got to abide by the rules
'
know all about the contract
The point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow
or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day
It's up to you
This leaves the group momentarily speechless
Even DeJesus comes out of his stupor
You giving us a day off
Beck nods
Cobb eyes him suspiciously
What about our quota
You're only twenty-five tons off quota
Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day
(he looks at the group) It's just a day off
You don't have to take it,  just thought it might help
The others look around for agreement but Jones doesn't need anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind
Count me in
Bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree
Buoyed, Beck moves ahead, businesslike
Cobb, Jones,  want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system
(to Bowman and Sixpack) Bowman and Sixpack
living quarters
(disgustedly) Shit
Williams
get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics
(to group) Any other suit problems she should know about
Sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses
(to Willie) My pocket
Check my pocket, will ya, honey
(annoyed) Your pocket
The latch is screwed up
Or the hinge
(disgusted) Right
- He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds himself walking with Willie
Beck is obviously uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together
She smiles, friendly, at ease
You did good
(a little surprised) What
Today
with DeJesus
That was smart thinking to get him inside
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit
Still
you did the right thing
She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny, but honest compliment
He savors it
- The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy bilgewater
The door slides open, Willie enters, and switches on a bank of fluorescent lights
The room is spooky even with the lights
The giant machine suits, we saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters
Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked, laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the control switch and hits the  button
motor moves one of the suits along the track toward Willie
As it turns the corner toward us we see it says:
'  - Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting on a fresh shirt
man in his 50's, he must have once been quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed
must have dozed off
Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad Whiskey
He picks it up
(cont'd) Snakebite medicine
Never pack my bag without it
Beck doesn't smile
He puts the bottle back down and Doc watches him in the mirror
Are you planning on working tomorrow
Well, 'll be on the golf course in the morning
Then, if  don't have any babies to deliver-- (cutting him off) We almost had an accident today
DeJesus' suit
The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck
You got something to say to me, son
Beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he falters
think it's important to have the second officer on deck
Doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt
'll keep it to nine holes in the morning
- Small but functional
The bunks can be closed-off with a privacy door
Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an otherwise sterile environment
Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary maps;  Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which proclaims:  "   ,  '
" DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for; Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he is instead of somewhere else
Inside Jones' bunk is an indoor basketball goal
Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a sponge and pail
Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on Bowman's chest
Christ
what a pair
(sharply) What was that
What'd you say
said, "What a pair" the boy wonder Shack Boss and his drunken doctor buddy make
(innocently) Why
What did ya think  said
"" - Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big plate on the floor with a power wrench
Overhead a huge plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization system
The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack
Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the --dark and wet
Without the plate the  in the air system is much louder and sinister
Listen to it for Christsake
Ah, it's just old, like me
You don't see the Doc opening me up every time  get a new creak in my joints
say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it
But, 'long as we're here
He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones
Jones seems in no hurry to accompany him
(cont'd) You gonna sit there on your butt or give me a hand
Jones reluctantly starts down after him
'  - Beck in his quarters
He seems to be talking to himself but as we move around him we see he is talking to a video monitor
On screen we see , 30's, a slick bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp
whose face is all we see on the video monitor
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium
(taking notes) Sounds like a good week, Beck
In fact
put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night
Beck stops
Martin notices his concern
(cont'd) You're good executive timber, Beck
lot of management trainees wash out when they have to go under for their first tour
But you've done well
(smiles, relieved) Thank you, Martin
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are
'Know what  mean
He stares hard at Beck, but doesn't wait for an answer
(cont'd) The one thing 've learned in this company is you can't have enough friends
It's the only way to survive
/    - The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's Rocky Mountain High
DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he works on the intercom system
He finishes, closing a metal box which says:
- She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic computer and is going through the computerized checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of possible problems
(to herself) Probably a short
Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical Short
(cont'd) Good guess, Williams
She types in a "help" command and the computer screen displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most Electrical Engineers baffled
Willie hardly bats an eye
(cont'd) Piece of cake
She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt
With two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces the panel
Finished, Willie presses the control switch and the suits begin to move along the track
new suit rounds the corner toward us
It says
- The walls are dark and moist
Water drips from the pipes
The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans over and hands Cobb another tool
Crouched in the humming machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones
Okay, watch this
- The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound in the gloomy  as the huge suit labeled  stops directly in front of Willie
She reaches up to open the pocket latch when she stops
listening - Jones looks incredulously at Cobb
He can't believe that's all it took
Cobb starts gathering up the tools
So that's all you do
Shhhh
don't tell no one
(winks) Job security
- In the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket in the waist of Sixpack's suit
Some water drips out
She pushes the spring a second time
The pocket opens
Nothing
(miffed) Nothing wrong with this
onto the workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie
She backs away and it drops into the water at her feet
Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead
' (
) (over intercom) Fuck you, Sixpack
You think you're funny
You're not funny
He hesitates then presses the  button on the intercom
This is Beck
Is there a problem, Williams
Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her as Beck's words come over the
Ignoring Beck she watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings the soldering iron down into the water with a skewering it
She presses the intercom button and lifts the skewered sea spider out of the water
(to Beck) little problem, sir
but 've got a handle on it now
: - sits at a portable computer terminal and watches stock prices scroll across the screen
Every so often she freezes a stock and types the command:
The screen immediately changes to a financial report of the company in question as if prepared by a broker
In a matter of seconds Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company
Across the room from her, Willie exercises with dumbbells while she studies an astronaut training manual
She looks up at Bowman
Made your million, yet
(studying the screen) Not yet
How's TransOcean doing
This causes Bowman to turn and look at Willie
You got money in this tub
signed-up for the stock option
Bowman shakes her head and goes back to the computer and types in TransOcean Corp
He lies on his bunk under a sunlamp, but wears a -shirt and long pants
DeJesus does a jigsaw puzzle of a snow covered Swiss mountain scene
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East
, okay
--they speak 54 different dialects
Fifty-four
Who cares
do, man
That's a beautiful place
When  get out of here 'm going there
Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire-- He looks up and sees Cobb's sunbathing attire and laughs
Hey, Cobb
Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man
You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach
(sharply) This is what  wear at the beach, goddamnit
- The report appears on screen with a capsulized history of the TransOcean company, its philosophy and growth plans and most current financial report
final column called "insider tips" says: (reading) "Major development in South Indian Ocean set for fall of 2010
" (to Willie) That sounds interesting, but they're too tied to their holdings
Remember a year ago when they lost that tanker
The bottom fell out of their stock and lost a bloody fortune
That's when  decided to diversify
Willie looks at Bowman a moment, then keeps exercising
You take your money, too seriously, Bo
(sharply) You're damn right  do
Five years down here and 'll pull in more than 15 topside
'm not down here for the fun, 'll tell you that
' (
) "Fun
"  Somebody talking fun
They look up to see Sixpack at the door to the Mess wearing only a robe
With a leer he stares at Willie exercising
(cont'd) (saccharine sweet) Hey, Willie, honey
Sorry about that little incident tonight
Everyone's been so tight lately,  thought a little humor'd loosen us all up, you know
Willie doesn't bite, she looks hard at Sixpack
Get out of here, Sixpack
Sixpack smirks
He waves a copy of Penthouse opened to the Pet of the Month and sings cheerfully
(leaving) got a date with an angel
, ,
coke can tumbles noisily from the Coke machine
Jones retrieves two cans of Coke and comes out of the Galley with a snack
He stops in front of Bowman and the computer
Hey, Bo
when're you going to be off that thing
want to find out tonight's  scores and check the weather
(not taking her eyes off the screen, answers him) The weather's good,  already checked, but 'll be off in a minute
(to Jones) Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the
Jameson
Jameson
Who're you trying to con
They grin at each other--a standing joke and Jones leaves
Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of Coke across the room to DeJesus
Hey, Hazy
We got a day off tomorrow, Kemosabi
Let's get shit-faced
catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp
(cont'd) How about you, brother Cobb
Little Wild Turkey
Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head
No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker, from way back
Ain't that right Cobbie
Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes
Cobb turns and watches them
This is obviously a nightly ritual
You guys are crazy
What the hell you play that stupid game for
(acting drunk) What game, Cobb
'm on my way to Nirvana
You're on your way somewhere all right
the looney bin
(laughing) 'm on the way to the looney bin
Hey, man, 'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes
'  - The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position representing mad desire
Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the photo
Oh, Darlin'
come sit on my face
He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and
The is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead
Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming
He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams in more pain
The whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily "sober up" to stare
That bitch
Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider
He points angrily at his bleeding foot
Jones and DeJesus move up to watch
(moving into room) Bitch
Look what you did
(imitating Sixpack) Sorry, darling
Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up
you know
Everyone laughs, but Sixpack
He has revenge in his eyes
He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward Willie
You think you're so funny
Wait till you taste this
As he pushes the dead creature into her face ' behind him makes him freeze
' (
) That's enough
Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway
Look at my foot, sir
This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk
(cold as ice) How do you know it was Williams
(trapped) Huh
uh
uh
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow-- (protesting) Bullshit
What
She
He
(cutting them off) At ease
You both have a half day
Anymore shit and its a full one
/  - Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes "2" in place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words "Days Till Pickup
" Jones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of cereal and holds his head in mock misery
Oooooh
Damn
Not so loud
Turn down the music
What music
There ain't no music
DeJesus enters holding his head and sits on the other side of Cobb
Oooooh
Cobb looks from one man to the other, realizing what they're doing
You know it's really crazy to pretend to be drunk, but it's fucking insane to pretend to have a hangover
(to Jones and DeJesus) Your "hangovers" made you miss the Sixpack Good Morning Show
(imitating Sixpack) "No goddamn boy is going to make me go out on a down day
" (grinning) Yeah
How'd the kid hold up
(pleased) Pretty good
He sent them out videotaping outcrop
- whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the end of Willie's mechanical suit arm
Like a drill its diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core sample
It's a sinister hand-attachment, something Captain Hook would have loved
Above her the  maneuvers into position for a better view
- Beck is in the control station, staring at the video monitors--the image from the
Willie removes a slender instrument, like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump motion, ,
activates an explosive charge
She puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off
Charge set
' () Charge set
Backing off
(to the ) 'mon Rover let's get out of here
Like a good dog, the  follows her to a safe position
-- ,
Willie holds out the sample to the  so Beck can see inside
/   ' He stares at the image on the screen
need more light on that, Four
(to Beck) Roger
(to Sixpack) More light, Sixpack
There is no answer
Willie turns around
Her helmet lamp eerily illuminating the darkness around her
Sixpack is nowhere to be seen
(cont'd) Sixpack
She turns in the other direction and suddenly blinding lights are turned on
Boo
Sixpack laughs
His lights now on, he stands right behind her
You shit
' What's going on, Four
What's happening
We're fine, Shack
His lights malfunctioned for a minute
How's this
She again holds out her hand to the
Beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start the tape, then after five seconds releases the button
That's great
Now let's move 35 degrees southwest
(to Sixpack) You screw around like that again and-- What's wrong, did you miss me
Hardly
Don't worry, darlin, 'm
Suddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides
Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio goes dead
What's wrong
What happened
She has stopped in her tracks
All around her is blackness
Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness
Sixpack
Sixpack
Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet
The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers
'  brings Willie back
' () Willie
What's going on
He's gone
think he's fallen
'm going down after him
Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike
That's it Jonesy
Sweat it out, man
Got to get the poison out of our blood
Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight, suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in
Sixpack is lost
- Bowman, Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room where they are joined by Cobb
Weren't they tied
They're supposed to be tied
They all enter the Beck is at the console with Doc in his chair
How far away is she
Two hundred meters
'  silences them
' () Four to Shack
nearing the bottom
Look at this
They all stare at the monitor
The screen is filled with huge waving tubers
My God, look at the size of those tubers
Nine, ten feet high
If he had his blinkers on-- It wouldn't make any difference in there
He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him
She moves through the dense waving forest of giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves slowly
Sixpack
Why can't we pick up his signal
(a joke) Maybe he got eaten
(dryly) What would be dumb enough to eat Sixpack
She moves aside the last of the tubers and freezes at the sight in front of her
' () Four to Shack
you picking this up
All eyes suddenly go to the monitor
huge dark maw fills the screen
Affirmative
Widening picture
The image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a huge gash in the side of a sunken ship
(cont'd) (to ) Tighten the picture on the upper righthand corner
:  The picture zooms in on the corner and Willie's added light suddenly brings the letter "" into focus
Beck presses the red record button and pans the  slowly across the bulkhead of the ship
The next letter is an ""
Then suddenly a Cyrillic letter appears, then others
What the
Russian
' () 'm going inside
What's your air reading
' Twenty minutes
Twenty minutes
Who had tank duty
Who else
Sixpack
The man is unbelievable
say, leave him in there
(dryly) What about his suit
That's a million five the company's got to replace
They'll make somebody go get it
(to Willie) Willie, we're giving you five minutes
after that we're coming in
' Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of her mask
She moves along steadily down darkened corridors
She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges--a cloud of sludge rises off the bottom
The room looks empty
Sixpack
Answer me
She throws open another door
It also looks empty, then a grotesque  slams into her helmet
Willie bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light into the room
:  The ship's infirmary
Broken glass, stainless steel
the light does strange things, reflecting, sparkling
( ) The infirmary
' () Three minutes
Her helmet-mounted camera pans the room one more time, then as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white in the corner--  -
Willie doesn't see it
He stares at the monitor screen
Did he see something or were his eyes playing tricks
He looks across the console and sees the videotape is recording
She moves to the end of the hall
It ends with two doors
' () One minute
Willie hesitates at the junction and   the door on her left,     --'
His mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the ship's huge safe
(laughing) 'm rich, honey
Rich
- The door to the Russian ship's safe stands open
Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a chisel
While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case with Beck
It's all mine if 'm on report
Otherwise you gotta take me off report before you look at any more
Ain't that right, Cobbie
You're on your own, Sixpack, you fucked up everybody's day off
DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box and dumps the contents on the workbench
several wallets, wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring
Bowman who stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory
Personal effects
(considering a watch) Timex
She picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and tosses it to Cobb
(cont'd) Here's something for you, Cobbie
(checking a wallet) Russian money
Don't look like much
Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the table
Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman in a bathing suit
Bowman looks at it
(grinning to Sixpack) Yeah, 'd say you can retire with all this loot
Shut up
Everyone chuckles
More papers and a small, book-shaped object wrapped in plastic
Jones unwraps it
It's a video tape
He looks at the label
What is it
(reading) "Debbie Does Dallas"
(looks up and grins) Hell, it's in Russian
can't read it
May  see it
Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it
(cont'd) It's a log of some sort
Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it out--Papers, more cheap watches
He notices something silver, the size of a paperback book, under a stack of papers
Discreetly he covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off the table out of sight
Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught by DeJesus
He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor bottle
Vodka
What assholes, they lock booze in the safe
Probably confiscated
No booze on board, same as us
Doc turns the bottle around in DeJesus' hand so he can read the label
(eyeing the bottle) Stolichnaya
Everyone looks at Doc
You read Russian
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili
standard pre-med background
Cobb stares at him a second then: Bullshit
(grins) and a Russian grandmother
Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman
want all this stuff impounded in the supply safe
He lifts the bottle of Stolie out of DeJesus' hands
(cont'd) except this
it goes in my safe
disappointed crew watches Beck leave with the bottle
Doc stops him
(to Beck, holding up the videotape) You mind if  take a look at this
(leaving) Be my guest
- The gloomy corridor outside the Infirmary
It is empty, silent
Suddenly the door to the Infirmary opens slightly and Bowman peeks out
Seeing the corridor is empty she slips out with a a manila folder
- Bowman hands the envelope to DeJesus, who's grinning delightedly
You got 'em
Sixpack and Jones are there too
Sixpack scowls
What good's the kid's med records anyway
Watch and learn, amigo
- We see a thin, bearded man in his late fifties, a '  talking to the camera in Russian
The tape is of poor quality and water spotted
' (
) (translating) Another party last night
More Vodka
The infirmary is filled as it is
confiscate what can, but  know the Government Observers have more
Suddenly, the captain hears a noise off-screen and goes to the camera and turns it off
The tape goes blank
He stops the tape and presses another button on the console
'  of the huge hole in the hull of the ship appears on another screen
(cont'd) See that gash
The way the edges protrude inward is like from a torpedo explosion
It couldn't have come from within
Like an accident
He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and has also been watching the tape
Beck looks at Doc and shrugs
What do you want me to say
That it all sounds mysterious
These observers were doing something
test
think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes
What mistakes
(he shakes his head wearily) Look,  think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check
He gets up and goes to the door
Doc watches him
did
They have no record of the wreck
(beat) The Marshal Goloviev is now on a tour in the Baltic Sea
Beck stops
This is a mystery
/ '  - Fingers fiddle with the combination
He pulls on the handle
The safe doesn't budge
(whisper) It's not the phone number
We pull back to see that DeJesus is alone in Beck's darkened quarters, he talks to the
Suddenly we hear ' over the intercom
' (on intercom) Okay, try the social security number
DeJesus puts his fingers back, on the safe dial
Okay, give it to me
(reading off of Beck's forms) Two
twelve
ninety-six
(scoffingly) You guys are so full of shit
Who's going to use their birthday
(over intercom) (suddenly sitting up) Like  said, that bottle's mine
- Beck at the door and Doc
want your permission to check that vodka
Beck looks at him
It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc, with the vodka, but he's diplomatic
This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc
If there's something strange with the vodka it's safe till we get back
Standing watch for DeJesus
Suddenly the door to the Control room opens and Beck walks out
Cobb grabs a walkie-talkie
Beck's coming
' / He hears Cobb and freezes
He looks around--the cramped quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places
They react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the
/ Beck stops outside his door and sees Cobb
Something wrong, Cobb
(struggling) Uh
Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir
What's wrong with it
(thinking fast) 'd really have to show it to you
(beat) All right
Cobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up the videotape
(cont'd) Just let me put this in my safe
Before Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters and steps inside
'     no sign of DeJesus
Cobb follows into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus
In the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus pressing against the wall
Cobb suddenly starts to sweat bullets
Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka
We see Cobb's reaction
Beck turns
Something wrong
Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out, he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives him a thumbs up
- Five specimen cups filled with vodka
Bowman takes hers and looks at it questioningly
Cobb watches the door for signs of the officers
Cute, DeJesus
Specimen cups
Aw, loosen up, Bowman
(he looks over and notices Willie) Hey, Willie,  got one served up for you
Willie shakes her head
No, thanks
've got my blood tests in three days
That's all you do is exercise
You got to learn to live a little
After my astronaut training physical, then 'll tie one on
Forget space cadet, 'll drink hers
Hey what happens it he goes back and finds the bottle missing
He won't
He holds up a plastic  bag filled with clear liquid
(cont'd) poured the vodka in here
Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Bowman, and Sixpack grin and clink glasses, then knock back their vodka
Afterwards we get their reactions
:  Looks concerned
:  Shakes her head, something's wrong
:  Can't get the taste off his tongue
:  Seems totally satisfied
:  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it, suddenly spits the vodka out
Shit
It's water
Beck switched it
Can you beat that
The sonof- abitch doesn't trust us
Willie grins at her co-workers and Beck's move and jogs out into the corridor
Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot glass away and leaves
That little turd
If ever get the chance 'll fix his ass
The others put down their glasses disappointedly except Bowman
She watches Sixpack
'   He closes his privacy door and hesitates as if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull
Suddenly
The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open
Startled he turns startled to see--
Didn't  ever tell you vodka was my favorite drink
She holds out her glass
Sixpack looks around the Dorm, it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot
"" She is jogging through the corridors
Suddenly there is a
Willie stops and looks through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor
The dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim light
The  ends and she jogs on to the Swamp
As she passes the door she notices the light and stops
Beck stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside
He sees her
That was a loud one wasn't it
After a month of it you'd think 'd be used to it
She moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock, stopping under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her lean body easily doing the exercises
(watching her) How's astronaut training
Why
You going to give me hard time like the others
No
'm just being friendly
(beat) Good
It's going good
Beck tries to concentrate on his inventory, but continues to watch Willie's sexy, athletic body
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here
need electrical field experience on my resume
Everything helps
(she watches him) Why are you here
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line
Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something
Has it helped
Beck shrugs
guess there's not a lot of adventure in the Control Room
Beck looks up and they lock eyes
You think  should hang around more with the crew
Well,  always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it
(beat) How did you know they'd get into the vodka
Beck looks up from his clipboard and smiles
guess  figured if  was in their shoes that's what  would've done
(smiles) Maybe you're more one of us than you think
sir
/  - The chalk shrieks across the blackboard, making a "1" over the words "Days Till Pickup
" Jones looks up from his cereal at Bowman, the culprit with the chalk
Puuleeeeze
- DeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the mess
He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and bangs on it
Hey, Sixpack
Rise and shine amigo
There is no answer
Carefully he opens the door and is surprised to find it empty
- Sixpack's eye
We pull back to see it is being examined by Doc who frowns
Let's see your tongue
Sixpack obliges as Beck enters
What's wrong
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and  ought to know
Well, it ain't
It feels a thousand times worse
Where
dunno
just feel
wrong
Take off your shirt
Sixpack pulls off his shirt
Doc frowns in surprise
:  '   There are strange black areas, each of them an inch in diameter
(cont'd) (concerned) How long
how long have you had these
(surprised, scared) Shit, Doc
didn't know had them
Doc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored
It's a different texture
Beck watches as Doc touches a spot and Sixpack screams in agony
Doc and Beck lock eyes
'  - on Beck's video monitor
He is drinking a cup of coffee
as long as you know it's not in your contract
know that
Well, suit yourself, then
its your decision
(he chuckles) Ha ha
a little joke
suit yourself
Beck interrupts impatiently
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow
(looking at a report, then up at Beck) Beautiful
- The crew members climb into their suits
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there
You just can't do it
(angrily) He's tanking on us
No
he's really sick
heard him last night
The company will take that into consideration
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month
(convinced) 'Cocksucker's tanking on us
Suddenly all eyes go to the door, Beck enters
(to DeJesus) No, he's really sick
He won't be going out today
The crew increases its bitching
There goes our quota
Thirty days, right down the toilet
Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit
DeJesus and Jones share a look
Bowman and Willie watch him carefully
As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is quiet, they can't believe their eyes
Awkwardly, Beck tries to get into his suit
Cobb breaks the silence
Excuse me, sir
Is this a contract violation, Mr
Cobb
No sir
just wanted to know if you needed a hand
Beck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and Willie
She nods slightly
Beck turns back to Cobb
(beat) Thanks
- Doc and Sixpack
Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is stored in a refrigerated unit
The plastic bags of blood are labeled with the various crew members' names
Sixpack watches him from the examination table
He is shivering violently and scared
(he's losing it) Please, Doc
'm cold
hurt
We see a change in Doc's demeanor
He is suddenly needed and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to the challenge
'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at under the microscope
Afterwards 'll give you a sedative
Skillfully Doc takes a skin sample
Sixpack screams
An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity
We see it literally spreading before our eyes
He leans back from the microscope
There is awe on his face for the first time since first year medical studies--and there is fear of the unknown
He looks over his shoulder at Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the table
Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the actions and a crispness to the voices
People doing work that is moving sharply
Pride in what they're doing
Okay, number 23's full
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one
Yes sir
Hook's on 24
Let's have her
The Container transporters fill with compressed air and lift the container as the miners guide it to the track
/  - Doc is at the console of his computer
As words appear on the screen, obviously in response to his query
"
would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin
" Doc shakes his head disgustedly
(to himself) No kidding
" virus of unknown origin
"  Come on and tell me something  don't know
like what's going on
More words come up
"
no idea
" (cont'd) (typing, angrily) Then take a guess, goddamnit
He finishes typing and waits for an answer
The cursor flashes the word ""
Then an answer comes up
"Genetic Alteration
"  The words send a chill down Doc's spine
- The mood is happy
Like a high school football locker room after a winning game
DeJesus climbs out of his suit and slaps Beck on the shoulder
Good work out there, Mr
Becky
Beck, obviously pleased, looks at the others
Jones sums up the feelings of the entire group
Thank you, sir
Beck's grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing red light over the intercom
- Beck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad
Dead
This morning you said he had some skin disorder
He did
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours
Doc looks at Beck wearily and hands him a mask
Here
Put this on
You examine him
'm not a doctor
For this
you don't need to be
Beck hesitates, then puts on the mask
As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the sheets
Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the sight
The black splotches have nearly all grown together
His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed
Most dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become flared and elongated
Though not bleeding, the open veins are visible
Doc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip
Beck enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet
The mask is because you think it might be
catching
don't know
've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses
(impatiently) And
And they didn't believe the symptoms  described
(beat) Why Sixpack
It could be a million things, something in the air, food
(he looks up and locks eyes with Beck) But he went on that ship and so did Williams
(beat) want to examine the crew
(still in shock) Yeah
right
He starts to the door and Doc watches him
've reported the death to the company
- The mess is quiet
All eyes are down
Sixpack's absence is noticeable
"Routine," my ass
Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down
especially when we're getting picked up the next day
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine precaution " Must be bad
Even sick Sixpack never missed a meal
It's this fucking air system
Ain't the food or the air system, he's just sick
Everybody gets sick every now and then
It's all part of being human
Bowman suddenly becomes pale
Well,  must be human because 'm sure as hell sick
She gets up from the table and dashes for the toilet
- /() Pale skin, fishbelly white with white hairs, seen closely
' (
) guess 'm kinda
outta shape
(a pause, no answer) This skin condition
what is it
Like herpes, or measles, or what
' (
) It's difficult to describe
Doc is scrutinizing Cobb's flabby body closely
They're alone in the shower room
Stainless steel, and mirrors
Doc stops and checks a place on Cobb more closely
(watching, nervous) Christ, it'd be a hell of a thing if  went back to the roof with some kind of herpes thing
My wife wouldn't understand that at all
Doc peers closely, satisfies himself that it's nothing
You seem all right
(relieved) She wouldn't understand
She'd think  was down here fucking my head off
/   Black skin, seen very close, the pores appearing like craters
We're looking at Jones' naked body
rippling muscles
(grumbling) This whole thing's unnecessary, Doc
Only "skin problem"  got is white people
(beat, suspiciously) How come you're wearing those gloves
/   - Firm, lovely breasts, smooth skin
' (
) This disease
do you know what causes it
Doc turns Willie around and examines her firm naked buttocks
Not yet
You got any ideas
(suddenly) You don't think it was from going on that ship do you
That's a possibility
But if it was that simple why haven't the symptoms begun on you
Doc turns away to let her dress
You mean 'm okay
You're fine
/ DeJesus' body is being examined
tan skin, wiry muscles seen very close
As we move along the skin, it seems every moment as if the next instant will reveal a dread blemish
' (
) What do you mean, "a skin problem"
your skin changes
DeJesus, naked, with his back to us
Doc examines him
It blackens
becomes scaly
(joking) You mean like a fish
DeJesus chuckles, but something about the thought stops Doc
(almost to himself) Yes
like a fish
(smiles) was just joking, Doc
- Beck sits in his chair reading the :  The chapter he's on says:
The face of Martin stares back at us
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body
However, the company doesn't want you to do that
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you
'm not anxious to find out, either
Beck, trust me
If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup
We could be there in a few hours
Do it
(beat) Unfortunately
We can't
He picks up a sheet of computer paper
(cont'd) There is a typhoon about 600 miles off the coast of Baja
It's not coming your way but the Company doesn't want to lose you folks or an emergency ship should it veer your way
What're you saying
That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow
It shouldn't be a long delay
But it's a delay
How long
day
Two days
Twelve hours, no big deal
We should know something first thing in the morning
Don't worry
- Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of toilet stalls
She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a toothbrush from the pocket of her robe
Bo
Doc says you're next
Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls
(cont'd) Bo
You okay
- Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary
She is weak from nausea
They help her onto the examination table and look around for Doc
Jones sees a light on in the Sick Room
- Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room
The door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the body totally
Jones smiles
(whispers) Hey, Sixpack
Hey, my man
How you feeling
There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body
Hey, man, we made quota to- day
No thanks to you, you dog, but we made it
Beck helped us
We just dropped Bowman off
hope what you've got ain't catching
He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack when suddenly the body stirs
Sixpack's foot moves slightly under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep
Jones stops
(cont'd) Oh, man, sorry
you go back to sleep
- Jones returns to the examination room
Bowman is now undressed and under the blankets on the examination table
Who were you talking to
Sixpack
How is he
Sleeping
No sign of Doc, though
'll check the control room
You look in the shower room
They leave Bowman  on the examination table and head back to the main corridor
As they leave    the door to the sick room behind Bowman
Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain
Carefully she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to throw up
At the sink in the infirmary
She rinses her face in the sink and pulls back her hair, suddenly she stops and brings her hands in front of her face
Huge clumps of hair have come out in her hands
And then she sees her hands themselves
Scaly
Oh, God
what's going on
She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room
Slowly she goes to the door and enters
Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack
(panicked) Sixpack
what's going on
No answer
She pulls back the sheet and gasps
- (panicky) You have to call them back
Explain that this is an emergency
Jones enters
Excuse me, sir
Bowman's sick
She's downstairs in the infirmary
(concerned) The infirmary
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick
We're simply concerned about her
proximity to
(to Jones) Sixpack's dead
Jones looks from one officer to the other then grins
Bullshit
was just talking to him
saw him move
What
- Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the Infirmary with Jones
He opens the door and freezes
:  The examination table where Jones left her is empty
The room deserted
(pointing to examination table) left her here
comes up behind them, then turns
He hears to a down the ring corridor
He turns from the others and moves slowly toward the noise
Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the Bowman
There is no answer and he moves toward the shower
Bowman
It's Doc
'm here to help you
The water continues to run
No answer
Carefully, Doc opens the shower door
:  Bowman
Dead
Her wrists have been cut and blood swirls down the drain
Doc sadly squats down beside her
The death effects him greatly
He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm, turning it supine
There, running the length of the arm, the black scales
Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the examination table in the infirmary
Through the Sick Room door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack
Doc covers Bowman with a sheet as - The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess
Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze
can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms
And it killed Bo
No
she killed herself
the news hits her hard
We're getting out of here just in time
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup
There's a typhoon in our sector
We're going to be delayed twelve hours
Typhoon
Twelve hours
At least we get time and a half
That's in the contract
Fuck double pay, man want out of here
Their argument is suddenly cut short by a  from the corridor
The crew stops their grumbling and listens
moment later we hear another
Beck looks at Jones
(motions for Jones to come with him) Jones
(to the others) Stay here
Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the sound is coming from
Outside the door they hear it once more
Carefully he enters the Infirmary and   the examination table is empty
Beck goes to the Sick room and stops in the doorway
Jones moves behind him and his eyes suddenly widen
:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous conglomeration on the the table
It is quickly pulled shut, running the length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside
"" - Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the zippered bodybag
Now, well over three hundred pounds, the bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to transport
'mon, Cobb
you're slacking
(angrily) ain't, goddamnit
It's Jones
Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off
Shut up, all of you
Mr
Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of--- Fuck the contract, man
The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by the Lift Lock
Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package
"  Like dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus
The bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even harder for everyone to get a handhold
(cont'd) 'mon
Lift
The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face
Hey
feel something
It's moving
He's alive
feel it, too
Someone's trying to get out
Cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for the zipper
Cobb, what're you doing
But he ain't dead
He ain't dead
Cobb
Stop
But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag
Beck tries to stop him when suddenly,
a through the zipper and flails like a pressurized firehose
It beats wildly for several second, then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm
While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a dagger
It bit me
It bit me
While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage, Doc rushes to the Lift Lock
DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag into the Lift Lock
Push Hazy
The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its occupant
Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just as the bag suddenly  in several places
tear next to Jones' head revealing the head of , her vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face
Oh, Jesus Christ
ain't never gonna sleep again
Suddenly a   sounds behind them
Beck looks back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated underwater chain saw
He's clearly intending to cut the Creature with the whirring blade
No
It bit me
It's Sixpack
'm going to kill it
DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock
The bag suddenly splits and a scaly arm protrudes
It reaches out grabbing DeJesus
Beck pulls him free and yells
Close the Lock
Now
Doc hits the lever
The elevator doesn't move
scaly leg rips out of the body bag
(cont'd) Hit it again
Doc hits the elevator switch again, harder
The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying rises from the Lock
The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door, disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water
(cont'd) Flush it
Doc flips a switch and the      drown out the  in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory muscle which slip silently and undetected under the workbench
second later the elevator returns empty, silent, bloodstained
Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock
The exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of the Shack lights
into the darkness
Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew
Willie, Jones, DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers
Splattered in blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together by having simply survived
Jones holds up Willie
DeJesus leans against the bulkhead
In the far corner Cobb sobs quietly
- Clouds of steam
Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her skin
Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her head against the wall of the shower stall
- Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk
After some digging which produces five month's supply of pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor
Beck picks it up
think we just found our problem
- Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand
Jones, and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for a run
There is a feeling of anger among them
Serves his ass right to get it
Motherfucker brings that shit onboard
hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed
He knew better than that
Willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all coldly
You guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka
It could have been you
She gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor
along the ship's corridor that Willie walked looking for Sixpack
Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack on the Russian ship
On the monitor screen we see Willie's of the infirmary
The light dances off the broken glass as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the light moves out into the corridor
Hold it
Rewind it
Beck rewinds it
we see the scene again
Light dancing off the cabinets
As the light starts to turn-- Stop it
Beck pauses the tape
We see nothing
Doc is confused
Back it up slowly
Beck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at the screen
Suddenly he sees it
There
We see it
Caught in the turn of the camera, now frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains of a man
Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man
Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than normal
But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that especially catches our attention
- as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles
He takes a piece of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and places it perfectly into position on the puzzle
Jones watches him amazed
You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man
Think about that
Sixty-four square miles
He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits it into place as Jones watches
It's blowing Jones' mind
How'd you do that
What
That
've done this one before
You hungry
'm hungry
He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in amazement
Hungry
After what we just went through  may never eat again
She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp
The Shack and Willie looks down through the grating passing below her feet
It is dark down there
Her feet pound off the metal grating
We watch Willie from below as she jogs past to the dark, still water of the bilge
Suddenly something stirs in the water--a ripple like a trout in a stream
- Using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions of the skull on the videotape, Doc enters these measurements as they are read off to him by Beck
As each of the measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins to appear on the computer screen, followed by a name: They found this
No
think they isolated him in genetic engineering
Homo aquaticus
Was there such a thing
Danakil man
one of our ancestors
Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia
Not exactly a big ocean country
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water
Most homo sapiens didn't make it
Danakil man
adapted running
She jogs past the machine room
Looking in, the machines seem alive, pulsing, the beating heart of the Shack
There is something else though
We feel something in there watching her
On Doc
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds
But what about those scales
or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life
Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer
(pointing to screen) Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship
Why isn't he out swimming around
Doc looks up at the image on the screen
The huge skull stares back hauntingly
(beat) He obviously lacked something in his environment
- He sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage
He turns on an overhead reading light and looks again
Suddenly a voice startles him
' Turned black yet
At first startled, Cobb recovers and answers sharply
That ain't funny
Relax, Cobb
If it was going to turn, it would have done its trick by now
That's easy for you to say
You ain't the one that got bit
Jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on Cobb's bunk
He picks it up and we see a photo of Cobb's family
Don't tell me you're getting soft on us, Cobbie
You're the fellow who always said-- Cobb snatches the photo back from Jones and glares at him with the same old, hard "Cobb look
" Nothing's changed, goddamnit
Jones leaves, and Cobb waits till he is gone then looks back at his photo
His look changes, softening
Absently he scratches his bandage
Willie enters and checks her running time on her watch
She bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly
are watching her from above
For a moment she is quiet as if listening for a noise somewhere in the Swamp
She looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the Workbench
- DeJesus looking for food
In the gloom of fluorescent lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a snack
He notices that the floor's wet near the sink
He frowns and hears a  , like something shifting slightly
He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles, pails, rags
All he can see are shadows
He looks more closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when ,
, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him
Man, everybody is jumpy
What are you doing
Not fully recovered from the start, DeJesus rubs his bruised head
Getting some food
Under there
DeJesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the sink
Look
Water
Probably the plumbing
You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what
DeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at Jones
No, 'll be right there
He looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the galley
Something is missing
(to himself) Mustard
Need mustard
He opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty
(muttering to himself) Sixpack
He throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside
,   , ' , ' -- --
DeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and causing an avalanche of pots and pans
(in pain) Ahhh
Jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when he hears
Hey, Hazy
what're you doing now
cooking
There is no answer and Jones looks up
(cont'd) (concerned) Hazy
He goes to the door and looks in
His eyes widen at the sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing hunk of muscle
(cont'd) Holy shit
Help me, Jonesy
Oh, God, help me
It's getting inside me,  can feel it
He keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his friend
Hazy, please
'm going to get you some help, man
just don't touch me
Jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to the Galley
He closes it, rushing through into the Mess to the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb
What's going on
It's Hazy
It's got him
Stay here and don't let him out
'm going to get the Doc
Jones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door
Cobb watches him go
As the noise in the Mess intensifies, we hear banging on the door, then DeJesus' anguished cries
Help me
Help me
Cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm
- Jones meets Beck and Doc leaving the control room
It's got Hazy
What has
One of those chunks of Sixpack
Like a big leech, with those teeth
We've got to get him to the infirmary
What are you going to do to him
'm going to try to remove it
've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door
- Deserted
There is no sign of Cobb and the door to the mess stands open
The mess is empty
Beck is the first one down the ladder followed by Jones
Cobb
Hazy
Oh, shit
He's gone
Cobb returns with a mining tool
You let him get away
ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself
That thing happens to be my friend
Shut up, both of you
We've got to find it
Beck suddenly looks around noticing something
(cont'd) Where's Willie
Oh, God, she's out there
Jones
come with me
Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms
""  - Jones and Beck move down the spooky corridor toward the Swamp
Overhead, water moves through the desalinization conduit
Jones eyes it warily
They enter the quiet Swamp
The suits hang silently like sleeping monsters
Beck steps into the equipment room
Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him
Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly
He reaches the end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw Willie doing chin-ups
He looks down and sees her headband floating in the bilgewater
Willie
Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him
Yeah
The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie drops from the bar laughing
(grinning) What on earth's the matter with you
ought to smack your face
Willie picks up the strain in Jones' voice, her smile fades
What's wrong
DeJesus
It's got him
- Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly
Beck pulls a portable laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits and attaches a portable power unit to the back
Turning it on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon
Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated container transporters
Beck notices and then looks up at Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier
thought they were your friends
Were, Doss were Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from him
You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place down
Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of the Acetylene tanks
He lights the end of it and a long blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp
Jones grins
- Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary
Doc goes into his office
He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the infirmary
What he sees upsets him
- Jones working the intercom
(to intercom) Jones to Doc
Doc
Cobb
He looks back to Beck, concerned
(cont'd) (to Beck) Think it got 'em
No, it's not going through
The intercom's busted
thought DeJesus fixed that
(beat, realizing) He did
- Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to the storage counter across the room--where the blood is stored
what disturbed him
the door to the refrigeration unit is ajar
Doc opens the door to the cabinet
The plastic bags are now empty
Each one has been drained
- Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security
There is a sinister feel to the place
Each step only reveals a little bit of space ahead of him
Suddenly he stops
In front of him across the hall a cabinet which says:   , is torn open
It is where DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before
The door is shattered
Carefully, Cobb opens the door and the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire system has been disabled
Cobb carefully examines the damage -  slams into the cabinet door trapping and sending his weapon to the floor
Cobb turns directly into -
It's sharp teeth shine in the light, poised to strike
Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the tentacle to attack
Then suddenly an   echoes in the corridor
opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone
Doc is holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he has seen the devil itself
What happened
(absently) It
almost got you
What was it
Doc shakes his head dumbly
He is in total shock
The remaining group is assembled around the table
Jones watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers
He listens
(excitedly) saw it
It's big
Big
Bigger than DeJesus
How
It's had a meal
He holds out the empty blood bags
change has come over Doc since Bowman's death
The experience has slightly deadened him
It needs blood
Fucking great
You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us
It would explain the suction- like appendages
Like a leech
That's why there's a dead one on the ship
It ran out of blood
What dead one on the ship
He looks from Doc to Beck
(cont'd) (sharply) Someone want to let the rank and file in on your little secret
Doc looks at Beck, then Jones
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration
No fuckin' lie
It has many traits of deep sea marine life
regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy
(more to Beck) but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality
(panicky) What
What
Beck locks eyes with Doc
(to Doc) That it acquires intelligence from its victims
Intelligence may not be the right word
Fuck semantics, Doc
You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman
(tiredly) don't know
'm guessing
(losing it) say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon
No, thank you
'll take my chance down here
Willie looks at Beck
What can we do
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other
And how're we going to do that
Beck checks his flamethrower and looks at Jones
- He flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it a half-pint of blood in a bag, held by Doc
He secures it and hands it back to Beck
Be careful with it
Don't worry,  don't want to give up any more
He looks over at Jones who watches the door
Jones looks back and nods
The coast is clear
- The door to the Mess opens and Beck slips into the shadows of the hall
second later Jones follows
In the dim light they begin moving toward the Lower "" corridor to the Swamp
- Cobb, Doc and Willie alone in the Mess
Cobb scratches his bandage
Doc notices
Still bothering you
Itches like hell
Take it off and let me have a look
Cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash
'   Pink and healing
Looks good to me
'll re-bandage it, though
He looks at Willie
(cont'd) Willie, would you clean it for me
'm going to the infirmary for supplies
He turns and Willie stops him with a firm grip
You can't go out there alone
'm the Doctor
have to do what's best for this crew
(he pulls away) need my bag
- The door opens and carefully Doc steps out into the corridor
He looks toward the Infirmary then starts up the ladder to the Upper Level instead
a grisly sight
the drops coming from the plasma bag of Beck's blood
Beck stops the drip and moves on into the darkness of the corridor
Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of the Control room
His face lit by the computer monitor
He types furiously
"Emergency Escape Bubbles
ready for activation
" pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to the  command and presses it
- Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut
He smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor
The tired look now gone from his eyes
He seems revitalized
There, good as new
Just keep your paws off of it
(to Willie) Do you have the new bandage ready
She nods
Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his arm to let Willie put the new bandage on
As Cobb's arm comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his shirt
Willie stops just before applying the bandage
The movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the cloth
Cobb whitens
breaks out in a sweat
Willie backs off
Doc
Doc
She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist
It's razor sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with vacuum-like suction
No
But it is too late
Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's gash --  ' "" huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck
scaly tentacle suddenly whips across the floor
The '
The outline of Beck lying "hurt" fifty feet away
It starts down the corridor toward it's prey--Beck
little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones waits in the shadows
Suddenly Beck hears something
(whispers) hear something
Don't fire until we're both in the Swamp
Jones moves a little farther back
(cont'd) Don't let him see you
Don't worry
As the Creature approaches   Beck stand up like a wounded animal
He begins dragging his "injured" leg behind him as he retreats toward the Swamp '
- She bursts out the door to the  and heads toward Corridor "
" Beck moves through the door to the Swamp and positions himself by the door
He looks back and   Jones for the first time, flamethrower poised, ready to fire
'mon baby c'mon
It moves steadily toward the door, moving right to the doorway
Carefully it moves a dark, horrible hand-like appendage inside the doorframe
poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing
' (
) Beck
Jones
She turns the corner and freezes
There, less than ten feet away is the Creature
tentacle whips excitedly like a tail
Oh God
starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand, trapping it vise-like in the door
Run Willie
Run
The Creature throws back its head and  in pain as the heavy door severs its appendage
As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move
Well done
Just like momma makes 'em
Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty
Willie and the creature are gone
She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner path toward Corridor ""
In a full run now, every panel and instrument looks even more sinister--where is Cobb/Doc --- ' As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump suddenly sprout a new appendage
Like a starfish it grows another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost
She turns down Corridor ""
overhead in the water conduit causes her to look up , ----
He pulls her between him and Beck in the shadows
(whispered) Where's Cobb and Doc
(recovering) Cobb's cut
It was in him
It got Doc
Oh man, that's just great
'mon
Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie
It is empty
Lock the door
Jones rolls the large vault-like door closed and locks them
Beck goes to the console and checks the instruments
Suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his tracks
red light blinks ominously on the console
Shit
He sent them all
The escape bubbles
She and Jones stop in front of Doc's console
(gravely) Look at this
Beck looks at Doc's computer screen
' :  "
hope that our sacrifice will mean that the human race will never know this awful mutation
" What is it
The good doctor signed our death warrant
Jones readies his weapon but just as suddenly, the
Beck, Willie and Jones all nervously exchange looks
Well, at least we're safe inside here
For how long
Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a message
"
---" '
Thank goodness, you're still alive
(yells nervously at the screen) Hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us
You hear me, motherfucker
Right now Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them
Please relax, Mr
Jones
Every- thing is under control
Naturally, when we received Dr
Warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you
Jones lets out a breath
Willie stares straight at the screen
When are you coming for us
(smiles nervously) Well, that's the bad news
The typhoon did turn your way
(he looks at weather printout) Right now it is on a course-- Just answer the question, man
When are you coming
(beat) Hopefully in the next 48 hours
Forty-eight hours
realize you must have gone through hell-- Gone
Man, we're still here
(firmly) can't change the weather
Try to get some rest
'll keep you posted
He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck, Jones and Willie goes blank
He's right
Why don't you get some rest
'll stand the first watch
- Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across his stomach
Near him Willie lies still, eyes open
She watches Beck across the room, standing at the window
He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the blank computer screen
"Request weather summaries January 14-21
"  The cursor blinks back ominously then races across the screen
" " (to himself) Martin, you asshole
Suddenly he hears a voice behind him
They know, don't they
(quietly) Yeah
think they're just deciding what to do with us
Maybe they already have
She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring earlier
:  Stock prices
Willie types in a series of commands
What are you doing
Seeing how my stock's doing
:  The words TransOcean Corp
The capsulized report comes up on screen:  "TransOcean Corp
took a bath on world markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was revealed to investors
The Board of Directors
" (impatiently) Where
She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the words
:  "
accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast Sector of Pacific Zone 10
Seven dead
All bodies missing
"  Their names follow
as her name comes up she shivers
can't believe they'd just leave us
voice behind them causes them to turn
Welcome to the union, boss
We're all expendable
He is now awake
He sits up against the air vent
Suddenly, Beck listens, the room is deathly silent
He looks over to the air vent
Jones is listening also
What is it
The air's stopped
Suddenly a   sounds hysterically
blue light on the console blinks on and off
It says "
"  Beck turns to the instruments
We're on backup air
How much time does that give us
Less than an hour
It's ruptured an air duct
Can't we fix it
There're twenty miles of pipe in the bilge, they could have tapped-in anywhere
'
The
Jones and Beck home in on the tell-tale noise
(almost to himself) Cobb
Job security
He locks eyes with Beck
They're drawing us out
He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie watches
You can't go out there, that's what they want
Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower
We don't have much choice
without air, the internal pressure will fall and-- Crunch
Implosion
Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it
Her action stops both men and she catches their looks
You don't think 'm sitting in here, do you
"" - Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor
As they move we suddenly hear a new sound, , The sides of the shack tremble slightly
(low) The shack
She's wondering what's happening
We're losing air faster than  thought
(to Jones) Which way
Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "
" "" The  of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the flooring
The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down into the darkness
Willie stands guard with the flame- thrower
He peers into the darkness below
He wasn't a big fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared shitless
'll go first
Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs down into the dark bilge
Jones waits till he's at the bottom, then starts down behind him
Willie looks back
Don't spend all day down there
Don't fuckin' worry, ain't
From somewhere in the darkness we hear the and the
As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light into the eerie underground area
Pipes run overhead and on the walls
broken electrical conduit sparks over their heads
The floor is ankle deep in greasy water
They start toward the noise
Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall)
Her eyes move from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering long enough to distract her
Sweat runs down her face and we hear another tremor in the Shack
(to herself, calming herself) Okay, Williams
let's hear a tune
(beat, quietly at first) "Off we go
into the wild blue yonder
" causes her to pause
She catches her breath and starts again
(cont'd) "
flying high into the sky
" She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the wire mesh of the other wall)
Was it something moving
He moves around a corner we recognize from before with Jones' and Cobb's repair
Beck floods the area with light and the break in the line is visible
The pipe has been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable
What's worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the water
Jesus Christ
Can you fix it
No way
Think
Can we stop it
Block it up
Shut down the line somewhere
Think
am thinking, man
You think  want to die
am thinking
-- Suddenly his eyes widen
Beck sees this and turns
In his light /
It's leech-like appendage whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail
Before it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a blast of flame from his flamethrower
The and disappears
As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes out sending the bilge into greater darkness
hit it
But  can't see it
Can you see it
(standing) No
Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a thought
The Swamp
There's an over- ride switch in the Swamp
They start for the ladder when
out of the darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones' arm
The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's thigh
(screams) Ahhh
Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the tentacle
The unseen Creature's  echoes through the Bilge
Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the ladder
Hurry
Get out
Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor fifteen feet away, moving closer
ten
eight
then suddenly   thrusts between the rungs of the ladder at them
Beck ducks and leaps to the side
He is less than six feet from the Creature
In the dim light it wickedly bare its teeth
Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and spot the exposed power cable
The Creature steps forward directly under the hole in the floor
It is about to lunge when a voice from above distracts it
' (
) Hey, you
The Creature looks up and sees: , , watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives him the moment of distraction he needs
He leaps out of the bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken power cable from the wall
Jones
Get your feet out of the water
Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's feet
The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it instantly rigid
second later it crashes forward into the water
Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs out, followed by Beck
, As they emerge Willie helps them
'mon, the Swamp
They start for the Swamp down Corridor "" when an enormous shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink and the floor to open beneath Beck
The jolt knocks him back into the bilge
Only grabbing onto the pipes just above the water stops him from falling back in
stops and looks back over the missing grating
Beck
Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt only widens the gap
Beck yells to be heard over the din of the collapsing Shack
Go on
No
That's an order
Fuck your orders
He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts his hand down into the darkness
Beck lets go of one hand, then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm
In one Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge
Together they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor "" behind them
They have to go around the other way
and a    warns:  "Five minutes until implosion
" : , , ,
She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the firm ground
, ,
reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn into the Swamp Annex
Willie hits the door opener '
The pressure has bent the door frame
It's jammed
Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand held spreader--like a "Jaws of Life"--from the wall
He turns back to the Swamp when a His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature
Its gill-like slits flare
Its mouth opens and we see a flash of its razor sharp teeth
Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a knife for Beck's face
At the last instant Beck move his head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh
The mesh loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a mining drill from the tools on the wall
As the appendage starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the Creature's tentacle and breaks free
Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door open
Where the hell've you been
got hung up
Try this
Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made
With Jones' help the two men force open the door and all three rush inside the
Beck closes the door behind them
:  "Five minutes to implosion
"  And we feel it happening: throws open the control panel and grabs the red handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half way
It is jammed by the pressure
It won't go
Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not enough
:  "Four minutes
" He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her suit hangs
The suits
Get in them
Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't
The suits
Are you crazy
How're we going to get to the surface
Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing Like this
He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they begin pulling the equipment out
(cont'd) Get them in the Lock
Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like Container transporters to the lock
She climbs into her suit and activates her generator
Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around the perimeter of her helmet
"Three minutes
to
implosion
" Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the elevator and Beck holds out the   Jones tried to arm himself with earlier
He takes the tool from Beck and sticks it in the vest of his wet suit
Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the Lock
Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track to the Lock
Your suit, Becky
Just get in yours
Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his suit
Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving along the track toward the Lock
suit turns the corner from the storage room followed by one labeled
Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder
He moves along the suit rack when suddenly ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off the appendage
Another tentacle jabs for Beck
(screams) Look out
But it is too late
It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and sends him to the floor
Beck looks up at the Lock in time to see Jones seal himself into his suit
/ 'm in
(to the others) Go
/ No
Beck looks at the others one last time
Go, now
That's an order
Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the elevator sends them down without Beck
stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he swings at the Creature driving it back
As Beck gets the upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck freezes
There attached to the back of the Creature's head is the grotesque face of DeJesus
DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink
He's still alive
His lips tremble in agony
Kill me
Kill me
Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature
As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock elevator as it returns--  --The others have made it out
His suit continues down the track and stops in the Lock
He still has to make it, if he can just get there
:  "One minute to implosion
" Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit
His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the generator
'
His vital signs light up around the perimeter of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck out of the elevator
Instinctively, Beck swings his motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the elevator button
'
No
He hits again, still nothing
"Nineteen, eighteen
"  Her voice begins to quiver
, '
Beck pounds it one last time and
, - parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward the surface
heavy-suited crew member flashes past us
Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the darkness after the first
'   We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his helmet
The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as he moves closer to the surface
'   She tilts her head upwards
She snaps off her light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her
At first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then we see it again--a glimmer of light
() Light
Beck,  see light
He follows her look
Light is coming fast, brightening as they rise
The  numbers inside their helmets click off
"125, 100, 75
" () Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit
' () Roger
'   Her numbers count down "
70, 60, 50, 40
" () Ejecting
She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and
The plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle
Her hand gropes for it
The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons
No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface
, Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull the tab on the life jacket around her neck
Suddenly a She looks up at Beck
We made it
Where's Jones
Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell
At the crest    in the trough below, face down
Beck breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach Jones
Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water and inflates his life jacket
Is he okay
Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket
For a moment
Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint against the sunlight
Beck turns back to Willie and as he and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up
" (cont'd) (jubilant) The sun
The sun
Jones looks at Beck and grins
What happened to that typhoon
- ,    cling to each other as they search the horizon
Are you sure you saw something
How many times  got to tell you
saw a ship
Well, why haven't they answered our flares
We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one
pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark water
The light fades, Willie looks at Jones
Are you okay, Jonesy
(weakly) Tip top, Willie
tip top
(testing him) Who's the best power forward in the
Jameson
(tired, but with fight) Jameson
Who are you trying to con
They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something
'll be damned
Look
flare
As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just fading against the sky
It saw us
Answer them and quit kicking me
'm not touching you
Beck fires another flare into the sky
As the flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the first time sees the
No
no, no, no
The  tighten the circle as the flare fades
'  - watches the flare fade through his binoculars and speaks to someone
thought you said you'd combed this area
He lowers his binoculars standing on the bridge
He also lowers his binoculars and smiles coolly as he lies
We did
Many times
(looks at Martin then to a Lieutenant) Initiate rescue
We hold on Martin's face as from rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks off toward the fading flare
- Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together
Suddenly Willie feels another bump
(panicky) It hit me
Where are they
can't see them
Suddenly he is bumped by a shark
Willie sees one only two feet away
They are surrounded
Suddenly Jones stare to taunt the sharks aggressively
All right
've had enough of this shit
You want meat, motherfucker
Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat
He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop him
(cont'd) (taunting sharks) What's wrong you snout-nosed bastards
My meat too tough for you
Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear
Willie and Beck watch stunned
Even Jones is surprised
(cont'd) (to Willie and Beck) Whoa
Did you see those fools run
They know whose boss
He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time a gash across his forearm
As Jones crows triumphantly, / Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something is happening
hear the
, ,
The blades of the helicopter sound out over the waves
It's lights are visible
Willie and Beck wave frantically as Jones drifts closer to them
'   His wet suit is now completely split open and hovers over the group below and lands on the water
Its blades beat the surface into waves
The hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the ring
He  the fastener and suddenly they both lock eyes
Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety
Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm
Jonesy
Give me your hand
reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the harness
The Winch operator throws it back across the water where grabs the harness
'mon, Jones
Jones reaches out his hand
He is almost there / , Jonesy, No
Get out of here, Becky
The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under
Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears
Numbed he clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly,   a boiling of water where Jones disappeared
bubbles rising
and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs to the surface several feet away from Beck
Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again
It turns and focuses on Beck
Beck keeps going for the life vest as the Creature starts for him
The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the Creature bears down on Beck
Is he in the harness
'    Beck reaches it
His fingers wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones' vest pocket
The Creature is right on top of him
, , Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body in a death grip
It's horrible mouth starts to open
'mon, motherfucker open up
The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp
The rescue cable is taut
The helicopter is taking off
' /
Beck rises suddenly out of the water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him until
the Seismic device explodes in the Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean surface
The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it
The winch operator pulls him in
- Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of the ship
He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked , then looks up as the Captain approaches and shakes his hand
Mr
Beck,  understand you passed your physical with flying colors
And Ms
Williams
(worried) don't know yet, she's still in there
Well, you'll be glad to know you have a friend onboard
Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them
(excitedly) Beck
told them you'd make it
No one back at TransOcean believed me, but never gave up on you once
(smiling) So, how are you feeling
Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across the deck
Better
lot better
Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears with a new outfit on
Smiles at Beck
'm fine
Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a approaches with a tray of   , , ,
The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie
The Captain notices
thought we might have some wonderful seafood
But, if there's something else you'd rather have
Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at the Captain and smiles
How about a burger and fries
She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the deck with the Captain
the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the distance and riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping beneath the waves and descending again into the cold depths
