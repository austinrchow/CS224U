Two of my people were killed
Silence
No more questions
The disheveled man () coughs
Marco pointedly ignores him
The Medal of Honor is the highest award to which any soldier can aspire
From the jungles of Iwo Jima to the desert of Kuwait, what these brave men 've talked about today did will never be forgotten
Since 1917, only 827 medals have been given to a total of more than 30 million Americans in arms
Only three have been awarded in the last 40 years
Who knows
Maybe someday one of you fine boys will earn one yourself in defense of this great nation
, thin, bearded, stands up: Major Marco, on behalf of Troops 484 and 488 -- just like to thank you, for coming to talk to us, about the Medal of Honor, and your interesting experiences in the Armed Services
8/18/03   10
Thanks for listening
My family has claimed the Army as a trade ever since a young gunnery officer who grew up with Hernando De Soto left Spain for a look at the upper Mississippi
(beat) My life is in service to my country
You ever wish it'd been you
Excuse me
Won the medal
Been the hero
Something causes Marco to hesitate
Then, as if he'd rehearsed it: No, 'm just proud to have been there
He sits down

Marco turns, stares blankly into the eyes of the bedraggled- looking man, who half-salutes
It's Al Melvin, Sir
Corporal Melvin
From your unit

Marco stares hard
Melvin looks like a homeless guy, his clothes rumpled, his fingernails stained and broken, his eyes wild with fatigue and paranoia
Melvin
Jesus -- how are you -- (intense) have these dreams, Major
Dreams

And then  don't
Well, we had a pretty rough time over there, Al, it was hairy, and -- it was a long time ago, now
Memories shift
Do you have dreams, sir
Everybody has dreams, Corporal -- Not these
Beat
Marco stares at him
No  don't
Melvin's face falls, disappointed
Fumbling in his clothes, he finds a  , dog-eared, and fat with newspaper clippings -- tries to press it into Marco's hands
It's bad, sir
It's making me crazy write it down, every night, after  wake up,  try to get it all -- it doesn't always go together -- all of what  can remember, and -- (gentle) -- Al, you know, maybe you should be going to the  and talking to a doctor, mean if these dreams are really -- -- 've been to doctors

Both men go down to collect them -- 'm so stuck, sir

And Shaw, he -- 8/18/03   12
Well, that's -- it's over and done
We've got to move on -- -- Marco rocks back on his heels as he stares down at a whose face is covered with intricate designs -- Marco stares curiously, as if he recognizes her -- can't get my hand around it
thought maybe, if you had the dreams
(shaken) You need money --
No
No sir
Self-conscious (people are staring) Melvin shoves the notebook back inside his jacket
-- here -- Marco already digging for a crumpled twenty
Melvin waves it off, backing away, suddenly pissed
don't need your money
Okay
Okay
Well, look, Al,  gotta -- Go
-- run, yeah
But
(awkward) It was great seeing you
And good luck to you
Melvin just scowls sadly at Marco
Flash of glass, a door opens and closes, and Marco is gone

-                                     38 Marco is motionless in his car, head resting against the steering wheel
He straightens up, with a thousand-yard stare
His hands are trembling
Slowly, he grips the steering wheel
tighter and tighter
until the trembling stops

Which he swallows dry
-- the American people are looking for a new agenda -- but because this party remains deeply divided on so many issues, the choice of a vice presidential nominee may be the key unifying factor for the delegates of this convention in much the way Johnson helped Kennedy in 1960

on his door -- it opens, and Secret Service removes his key while
, pretty and ageless, sweeps in -- closing the door on her aide () -- Raymond
Darling, what were you going to do, make me stand out there like room service
-- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone -- she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a little too long, and never stops talking: asked downstairs and Miss Freeman, your 'wrangler' -- helpful Ms
Freeman -- said you were up here practicing your speech
Honestly,  don't understand why you insist upon isolating yourself, people adore you, Raymond, they crave your company and yet here you are, holed up, as if you were some kind of emotionally challenged individual like your father instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw, a handsome, intelligent, people-loving war hero with a great deal to offer to his party and his country
No
No what
Baby,  haven't even asked you a question
Your hair is too flat
And that tie
The tie is wrong
8/18/03    16
No to the question you're going to ask
No to all the questions you pretend to want to ask -- (the tie) Something a little less busy
-- and no you may not engage in your usual back-door political thuggery to shovel me onto the presidential ticket
Oh
You're not interested
thought you were
Did  miss my cue
Of course 'm interested --  wouldn't be here if  wasn't -- but not if it means attacking the reputation of a statesman like Thomas Jordan, which 'm sure was your plan
Let democracy run its course, mother
Let the people decide
Now Ellie stares at him, mouth agape
What
'm sorry, for a second there  thought it was your father speaking -- that dreaded Shaw blood rising -- and the stink of defeat made me nauseous
Mother -- And excuse me, when have  ever attacked the honorable Mr
Jordan, despite the shameful way his daughter misled you that summer at the shore
Mother, you chased her away -- If that's how you want to remember it
-- you ruined everything
8/18/03   17
Honey, you're oversimplifying things somewhat -- but, yes, okay --  promise, promise  will stay out of it
You have my word
Raymond stares at her
After all, you're young and you have plenty of party conventions ahead of you in which to discover, as your father did, that democracy is an elusive and imperfect science, and the meek do not happily inherit the earth, but simply get eaten by the alpha dogs, chewed up, digested and deposited on the carefully mown parkways of American politics
Raymond rolls his eyes
She ruffles his hair again, heads into the bedroom
(
) One day, you will, 'm sure, tearfully memorialize me in your acceptance speech
Don't you have a different tie in here

Raymond smooths his hair back down

Ellie shakes her head fondly, and begins to move away as -- 47       ,   -             47 with Ellie and Gillespie and his two aides, and a posse of three other -  through a hallway crowded with   , ,     members and a complete in red-white-and-blue sequined leotards, as: Bluffing
That was the inference
Raymond's speech echoes incoherently through the corridor
They should be down on their fat white knees thanking me for saving this party from committing political seppuku
8/18/03     19
You gave them every opportunity to do the right thing, Senator
(glances at him) No
gave them one opportunity
And that was unusually generous of me
She pushes through a door, and into -- 48
-                        48 Raymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a dozen  and   with "Arthur For President" buttons grimly watch Ellie breeze in
Party Chairman   anticipates her: The decision is final, Senator
Tom Jordan is on the ticket
We don't need your blessing, but we'd like it
(smiling:) Before we get started, 'm dying to know: which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a Sound Bite from Nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers off our busses is unconstitutional
All the research indicates that an Arthur- Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American public and -- 'Sits quite well' translates into how many votes
Your son is largely unknown outside of New York
His public service, his Congressional record, while commendable, is -- My son is a war hero
(cheerful) Governor Arthur has agreed to consider Raymond for a cabinet post
cold silence
Ellie stands -- 8/18/03    20
We didn't come here to have a discussion
Senator --                          (to her posse) Did we come here to have a discussion
Ellie, you don't have the votes to block this, or even push the nomination to a second ballot
(ignores him) Even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad, Arthur is still unelectable without help
(cold, hard logic:) Consider
The Governor is a corn-belt candidate who -- scratch and sniff -- looks and smells alot like the kind of liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was, but without, thank God, the helmet
(beat) Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the Northeast, plus his home ground, and California
We're still dead in the South, and Southwest, where they win by landslides
The mid-central is a toss- up
Tom Jordan actually becomes a liability in Florida because of his Castro-appeasement profile, and in the Carolinas, where he fumbles the military vote over his "terrorism isn't a war it's a social disease" nonsense
The room is surreally silent
Ellie spins and moves like a televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful
You know this
Your own polls and surveys back me up

Ellie stares at them

America is facing the greatest test of its history, gentlemen
Not just from terrorist organizations both outside and within our borders, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the only way to protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we get around to them
Am  the only one in this room paying attention to the  reports
We are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on our own soil, while our policies remain shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders who insist that human beings are essentially Good
and that Power is something shameful, and Evil
(then) Make no mistake, the people of this great country are frightened
They know what's coming
They can feel it
And we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar, or arm them, with a young, vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in the desert, in the dark, when American lives hung in the balance

Villalobos, a car crash
Atkins committed suicide
Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11, body never recovered
Wilson 'm still trying to track down
Garret and Howard trade looks
Sir,  know  can't ask you to talk to Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin, it's a phone call, a quick q&a -- look at his notebooks, hear what he's been dreaming -- and either he will support the credibility of what 'm saying, or he won't
And 'll shut up
And what is it you are saying, exactly, Major
That you misrepresented -- falsified -- what happened In Kuwait
About the Medal of Honor
In effect, committed perjury
If you just talk to Melvin -- (ignores) -- No, no, 'm sorry -- you're saying an entire squad of

He's entered some kind of portable, surreal operating theater, filled with monitoring device and computers
a one-way video-conference camera is aimed at a big examination chair in one corner, surrounded by
racks and more techno-medical equipment
The man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital timer and turns to face Raymond
It's
Hello Raymond
Do you remember me
No sir
Brilliant
(to his group) We have twenty minutes for our little check up from the neck up

My God
'm sorry to hear that
When did it
(listens) Yeah,  know

Wilson -- can you tell me if Nathan was ever -- preoccupied -- with his experience in Kuwait
Did he ever mention dreams or nightmares

No,  understand

No decay, no slippage
Everything appears to be in flawless working condition

Yes

Describe it

Smiling
(French accent) Is this seat taken

An empty seat opposite him
Laurent was a dream
Marco looks around, self-conscious, and -- -  ' staring back at him
Not enough to tell much more than she's pretty
Marco looks away, out the window
Then back
She's gone
Another dream

Marco jumps -- looks
The pretty woman is sitting down opposite him, folding and pushing aside a newspaper with the headline: $100
8/18/03    50
Below the fold:
This is Delaware
know
But, Maryland, it's a beautiful state anyway
He's staring at her, trying to figure out -- Paper or plastic
What
From the grocery store
You were wondering where, we, you know -- and right at the check-out stand, "paper or plastic," that's me
see you all the time
Bennett Marco
Checks from the First National Bank, and you always put your spare change into the March of Dimes thing
(beat) Romance novels, instant noodles, No-Doz and tomatoes

You headed to New York City
Yeah
Business
No
Guy  knew

Eugenie
'Scuse me

Yeah
Crazy French pronunciation and all
It's pretty
Thanks
guess your friends call you Jenny
Not yet they haven't, thank God
But you can call me Jenny
What do your friends call you
Rosie
My full name is Eugenie Rose

When  asked you your name, you said it was Eugenie
Yeah
Well
Maybe 'cause  was feeling fragile
At the time

Their eyes lock
Marco blinks -- FB94   :

Bullet hole in his forehead and a small, lost smile

Slight look of puzzlement, because -- -- is on his feet, rattled, moving out to the aisle -- Excuse me

-                                  95 -- Marco catches himself, hands against the bulkhead wall near the bathroom
Another  squeezes past him, headed in the opposite direction
Marco tries the bathroom door

The big man goes
sinks down next to him
Calm
Deftly plucking the pills from the floor
My mother would tell you to wash these
Marco looks up at her blankly
She takes the vial, caps it, gives it back
didn't mean to upset you
It's not you, it's me
'm not -- my head -- (gestures uselessly) -- nothing's
(stares at her) wish  smoked
It's way overrated
They stare at each other
Then: Rosie, 'm gonna go in here, wash my face, take my pill, and get myself together
Marco ducks into the bathroom and shuts the door

'  -                                       96 Marco cups water in his hands and smears it on his face, wiping it away with a paper towel
He comes up looking in the mirror, avoiding his own gaze as -- : and a man comes partway in -- now it's Dr
Noyle
Marco pivots -- no Noyle
The door is shut, locked
He's all alone
Losing his mind
97
-                                       97 Lost in thought
Faint smile

Are you okay, sir
Ben
Yeah
Jesus
You've been in here twenty minutes
thought you'd fallen off
Marco stares at Rosie
Twenty minutes
The train to a halt -- 100

Momentarily lost
Rosie is behind him, a moment later with her bag, and -- 'm gonna get a cab, you want me to drop you somewhere

Your friend gonna meet you here
No

like to say it the old way -- can you remember the number, or should  write it on your chest with a sharpie
(small smile) 'll remember

You're sweating

Marco feels his shirt -- soaked
Long beat
She reaches out and feels his forehead
No fever
Sizing him up
Listen
You got a place to go and get freshened up

It's incredibly cramped, everything in one room, window facing a brick wall, lots of play posters
-- It's my cousin's apartment
She's in Cleveland with the road company of 'Mamma Mia
' There's
a view of the park
if you go out on the fire escape and kinda
tilt your head
Marco puts down the suitcases and waits in the middle of the room while Rosie takes off her coat, turns on some lights
'm nervous
'm sorry
yak when get nervous
8/18/03   55
Me,  get quiet
Another awkward beat
She stands there
Studying him
You okay
Dreams, 've been having these -- Catches himself
That's just how Melvin said it
Is that what happened on the train
Sort of
Beat
could be dreaming you
What if you are
You'd be the best dream 've had in a long time, Rosie
Beat
Rosie smiles at him
If that's a line, Ben Marco, it kinda worked

He    feels around   on his back where the door on the train whacked   him -- feels   something on his shoulder -- a bump --     around   as he twists, contorts, can't see it, but   feels it and   -- FB102                                                         FB102 ' (distant) Ben

) ( loudly) Ben, what's going on -- are you okay --
Marco finds a razor blade -- twisting it clumsily in his fingers to reach the slight bump on his back he can only barely see in the mirror -- 105    -  -                                  105 -- Rosie's  ,

Blood blossoms
again, oblivious to pain
as Ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of appears, like a grain of rice
It slides out into Ben's bloody fingers
107   Rosie's  against the door, trying to force it open
107 108                                                                108 puts his trembling hand under the faucet, grips the thing between two fingers, turns on the water -- 8/18/03   57
109     -                                                109 breaks in -- sees the  smeared down Marco's back -- Oh Jesus
-- and the razor in his hand -- she pushes him away -- -- loses his grip on the oblong thing before he can even get a good look at it, and it goes into the sink -- Oh no
-- and down the drain -- Marco twists the faucet off, and - where he puts both hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap and struggles to get them loose -- succeeding finally, water spewing everywhere -- -- the trap falls to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy hairballs and pipe corrosion and water
but not the thing he wants
It's -- -- Gone
Shit
-- rests his head on the cool tile, eyes far away
Defeated
Rosie crouches next to him
little scared
She blots the blood from his back with the towel, and then presses her ice pack against it
Tell me you saw that
Rosie just stares at him
(hollow) You didn't
You didn't see it
See what
Marco closes his eyes
Proof

Of what
My sanity

It's not
Delp has known Marco too long, and too well, not to take him seriously
dozen years ago, the Army did this tiny implantable
thing -- you could imbed it under the skin, then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information, blood-type,
Pentagon ordered up half a million, and stuck about five thousand experimentally into high-risk soldiers and infantry
But the scanners proved skittish and field hospitals hated 'em, so the whole deal got eighty-sixed and forgotten
The Army never put one in me
That you know of, man
That you know of
(then) How'd you find me
(
) looked under Mad Scientists in the yellow pages -- there was a full page ad
Ha ha
Marco stares down into a big pit
Among the racks of equipment are two primate-sized stainless-steel beds with restraints and
trees waiting
You seriously believe somebody's messed with your mother board
What are you studying here, Delp
Fear
For the Agency
Nah,  cut me loose in '97 during the Macedonian debacle
Now  got this little grant from Wal-Mart

Wal-Mart
Fear
Marco looks at the monkeys
Doesn't want to know any more
He shifts his gaze back to Delp
Studies him
Then: Look, Delp
My experiences during the war, in Kuwait
feel dreamlike to me
And my dreams
About what happened
Feel as real as you and me, here, right now
Delp just waits
It's like
feel like somewhere along the line, 've been
brainwashed
Or something
You know
All scrambled up
We've all been brainwashed, Marco
Religion, advertising, television
Politics
We accept what's normal because we're told it's normal and we crave normalcy
Hell, look at the Germans under Hitler
Disco, in the seventies
(beat) And if you're really worried about somebody imbedding electric probes and computer chips in your brain to make you do things -- it's horseshit, man
Turns out Pavlov had it right from the getgo
Dogs and all
little  and sleep deprivation will do the trick for a fraction of the price
Ask the Uzbeks
And you would remember it
What about my dreams
(shrugs) What if all this is the fucking dream and you're still back in Kuwait
You're not helping me

You're not helping yourself
Reality is consensual, man
You just gotta prove it up
Or play it out

don't keep up with Al Melvin
He found me
Why did you ask me about Kuwait
(pleasantly:) didn't
asked you about your dreams
At the fundraiser -- why did you say you needed to talk to me

Shaw, excuse me -- they want to know if you'll do an interview with Larry King at six
No
(to Marco) What do you want from me, Captain
Major
Forty minutes of your time
No to the interview, or no to six

No

It's more complicated than that
Marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of Melvin's notebooks -- People just don't have the same dreams accidentally -- (holds out the notebook) -- Melvin made drawings, he wrote down what he dreamed, this is one of his notebooks -- it's all in here

Anderson and Mirella -- the staffers in the office -- are all staring at Marco the same way the Boy Scouts once stared at Melvin
don't have dreams, Captain
(then, gently:) Maybe you should
see somebody -- talk to somebody who specializes in this kind of thing -- 've been to doctors
which is exactly what Melvin said to him
Okay
Okay, 'm sorry

desk covered with papers and enough take-out Chinese food for ten people, and Raymond sits behind it, nursing a glass of wine, and pointedly ignoring Melvin's notebook, while: kill Mavole
It's a dream -- No
-- could mean something else
No
-- could be 'm just supposed to think you did
--  killed the enemy

So it was okay
And, anyway,  remember what we did in Kuwait, remember it perfectly
But now that you mention it,  don't remember doing it exactly
Maybe you didn't
What a thought
Now he picks up the dream book
Marco watches
Raymond flips through the pages for a moment, dismissively
Then stops at something Melvin has drawn
Frowns
Raises his eyebrows
Closes it, sets it down: Life is so bizarre, isn't it
This absurd campaign, the sordid world of politics, my whole public life and persona -- sometimes, occasionally, for an instant, the fog clears and  look and think, what am  doing

Posing and grinning like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands with total strangers who must be blind if () 8/18/03    66
(') they can't see what  am, at the core
What my mother has made me
Raymond looks steadily at Marco
who nods, interested: Prentiss
Ferociously, a Prentiss -- but not a Shaw, God forbid --  was molded by cold hard hands, every detail of my existence preordained
Can you even imagine, Ben, how it would feel never to have a say in what your life would be
was twenty years old before had a friend -- no, worse, a girlfriend -- well, almost -- but, yes, a friend, or thought so -- outside my mother's circle of approved encounters -- and it didn't -- she wouldn't -- precipitating my one act of rebellion, storming off and enlisting -- (grimaces) -- in the Army
Which, ironically, only served ultimately to pad my gilded Prentiss resume
You know: "fluent in five languages, Phi Beta Kappa, Congressional Medal of Honor, blah blah blah
" (beat) And after the war  came back to her
And the family legacy
This
Mother calls it, "fulfilling my Manifest Prentiss Destiny
" Why did you come back, Raymond
What happened

Seeming startled, Raymond's reverie is broken
His eyes harden as he refocuses on Marco
Weren't you listening
Mother happened

've always despised it

How can you not remember saving the unit

You said you don't remember doing it
Ha ha, don't mix me up, 'm tired, and -- Fine
It's like this
It's as if  know what will happen, Ben, but  never get to the part where  feel that it actually did happen
But  think that's probably perfectly normal
Did you ever talk to anybody about this little discrepancy
What
No
Who would  ask
My old Army "buddies," who love and adore me for saving their pathetically unimportant -- present company excluded -- asses
No
You ask Army Intelligence
(getting excited) Look, we can go together, tomorrow
You tell them what you just told me, everything you do remember, what you don't "exactly" remember, about Kuwait, let 'em run some tests on you -- 'm sure the press would have a field day with that
Raymond
They put an implant in me found it yesterday
Maybe they put one in you
(horrified) Nobody's put anything in me
8/18/03   68
Great
Let's prove it
We can go get an x-ray -- we can check it right now -- Marco moves toward him, Raymond backs away -- want to be supportive of you, Ben, do, but -- Just check your back, Raymond -- -- this can wait until after the election
What are you afraid of
See if there's a bump
You should leave
This is not, this is not -- -- just check -- (without checking) There's nothing there
Marco  at Raymond -- they fall, together, over the desk, onto the floor -- Chinese food scattering
Somebody was in your head, with big steel- toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and a chainsaw, and they went to town
Neurons got wasted, circuits rewired, brain cells obliterated -- at the door: (

You don't -- you can't  what they did to you -- and you're worried about some lame-ass reporters

Marco     on '  -- sinks his teeth in -- -- Raymond shakes him off, and  slams into the wall
The office door  open -- Anderson and other agents  Marco -- there's blood smeared on Marco's mouth, his jaws are clenched -- (disbelief) He bit him
(at Raymond) Sir, did he bite you
No
-- shoved to the floor -- twisted -- handcuffed -- blood  across the carpet -- his eyes wild with adrenaline and fear -- -- his hand goes to his back -- his eyes  with Marco's for an instant -- then Marco is hustled out the door
Sir -- Horrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside
Mute with shock, Raymond pulls his hand away from his back
Hides the blood

It's complicated --  don't know
It's just complicated and  don't want to talk about it,  want to get back to the campaign and focus on -- You don't actually believe his story
No
But he does
And he's a fine soldier and
my friend
And if his slim hold on sanity requires that tolerate his delusions until he can get help, 'll do it
It doesn't diminish me
And 'm not afraid of him
This is why voters love you
Your humanity and everything

delivers Ellie her meal: a thick steak stuffed with viscous grey -- off Raymond's disgust: Carpetbag steak
Stuffed
With oysters
She starts to cut meat into child-like, bite-sized pieces and put them on a side plate, for Raymond
The steak part is mostly for you
Doesn't it look yummy
My God
In the world's literature of food could there possibly be a more vulgar dish
And eating it is an absolute sexual experience
Try some
Promise me that you'll help him
Ellie stops, sighs, puts her fork down and reaches for the oversized-satchel that doubles as her briefcase and purse
Oh, Raymond, how much do you really know about your friend

But he wasn't there
Across from him are three impatient   (, and )

Goldring pushes a tiny digital tape recorder closer to Marco: Talk about what
Marco hesitates -- looks to Lt
Col
Howard, who sits grimly, off the one side, with Col
Garret
Dreams
lone woman,   , sits in a distant corner on a folding chair
She's implacable, staring intently at Marco
Ramirez holds up the notebook -- a page of crazy drawings and text
Yeah, there are hundreds more of those in his apartment
Did your people check out his place --
Colonel Garret kindly showed us the file on you, Marco, you're the shit: Special Forces
Rangers

wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin about some unanswered questions involving our reconnaissance mission in Kuwait, back in '91 -- (talks over him) And he wasn't there, so, what -- you thought it'd be okay to break in and wait for him

Exchanges a glance with the female agent

Will you explain to them that  know this game
Oh right

Isn't that an oxymoron
Yeah

What's your obsession with Raymond Shaw
Man of his dreams
Listen, you might want to advise your to check for an implant in Corporal Melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy of the scapula, left side
if he's not looking for it, he won't find it
Implant
The Feds just stare at him
Like he's nuts
didn't have anything to do with Corporal Melvin's death
Yeah, well, that's your opinion, but judging from your file here, apparently you don't know your shit from your oatmeal, my friend -- Marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at Jonas -- Lt
Col
Howard and the other agents step between the two men -- pull them apart -- (re: Jonas) Get this man out of here

Repeated buzzwords like: "mentally unstable," "obsessed with Raymond Shaw," "delusional," "borderline functional," "acute stress disorder
" Isn't it disgraceful the way troubled individuals are allowed to simply walk around with the rest of us until something horrible happens
Another failure of the HMOs

Garret comes in, with Agent Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal effects, and: Goodbye

He's free to go

Hello Raymond
Raymond smiles -- it's terrifying -- the fragile, forced, frigid smile of a man in pain
Hello Senator
How's Jocie
Jordan picks up a picture of Noyle and smoothes it onto the desk for Raymond to see, as: Can we please not go down that road
Do you recognize this man
No
His name is Atticus Noyle
He is a South African physician, neuropsychiatric scientist and mercenary -- someone our trained for covert mind warfare against the Soviets in Aghanistan -- someone who has sold technology to and done research for terrorist groups, and rogue states
Major Marco claims that this man -- -- brainwashed you -- -- In his dreams
Sir, Ben Marco is sick
