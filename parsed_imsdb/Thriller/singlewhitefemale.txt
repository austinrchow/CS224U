Screenplay by Don Roos Adapted from the novel Seeks Same by John Lutz On a black screen, the words (without capital letters in front of the words) : columbia pictures presents and then : a film by barbet schroeder - We don't know if it's day or night
We see a little girl, aged around eight, putting lipstick on her lips
She is wearing earrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand
She moves forward and we see another girl about the same age
The first girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl
Both girl are smiling
More credits, still without capital letters
The camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl
The two girls appear to be twins
The first girl takes a powder puff and puts powder on the second girl's cheeks
The two girls look at themselves in the mirror
The camera gives the impression to be located behind the mirror
The first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl
The title of the film appears on the black screen
The camera moves and we see, appearing on the right-hand side of the screen : - This building is actually Allison's building, but we don't know it yet
Credits resume on the screen
The camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows
The building itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls
The camera moves backward, giving us a full view of the building
As the camera comes back forward, we hear two voices speaking, one male, one female
They are the voices of Allison Allie Jones and her fiance Sam Rawson
(voice over) So how many kids do we want
(voice over) dunno
What's the statistical norm
(voice over) You and your statistics
Allison laughs (voice over) One point two
(voice over) Okay, then  want two point two
Fade to : '  - '  - Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, partly dressed
Sam is holding Allison next to him
They are both about thirty years old
Allison has short red hair, and Sam has brown wavy hair
Behind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the balcony
The light is very dim in the room, lit only by the street lights and a couple of candles
We hear Allison finishing her last voice over sentence
And  want them to look like you
Poor kids
End of credits
So, if  got to be able to drag you away from computer tomorrow, 'll buy you that ring
Sure
So, is this gonna be a real wedding
She moves a bit away from him, and takes a piece of grapes in a plate lying on the floor
As opposed to a fake one
You know what  mean, Sam
You've already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people
That was the fake one
This is the real one
You can have any kind of wedding you want
Underwater
In and out of a steam room in the wild
Horseback
Allison goes back into Sam's arms
Naked skydiving
Naked skydiving
It's
It's going to have to be a small one, you know
've not been in New York long enough to know very many people
Except me
Oh, you're invited
They laugh
And my friend Graham upstairs
It won't be long before you know half the people in New York
People like you, you know
but  found you first
You're the only friend  need
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
They start kissing very tenderly
Fade to two seconds of black screen
And then we see Sam and Allison asleep in the bed
They are naked but covered with the sheet
The phone rings
Allison wakes up and picks up the phone handset
Hello
Hold on a second
She bends down to take the telephone set
Sam, it's your ex-wife
She gives the receiver to Sam
Still half-asleep, Sam takes the phone
What
It's Lisa
Sam puts the receiver to his ear
We hear vaguely Lisa's voice, but not precisely enough to understand the words
Yeah
No
Because
'm hanging up now
He puts the handset back on the telephone set, which Allison had put on the bed
'm sorry
She shouldn't call here
It's where you live
She's entitled
The phone rings again
Allison moves up to pick up the phone
Don't
don't answer it
The phone keeps on ringing
Then the answering machine starts with Hi, it's Allison Jones
but the rest of the message is covered by Sam and Allison's conversation
Why does she do this
Talk to her now
You're already up
'll get that
We hear the beep at the end of Allison's message
'  -   - Allison is walking naked in the hall
' Hello, Sam
Oh, damn
Would you pick up the phone, please
Hello
Please, don't do this to me
(voice over) Lisa
' Sam, 've been sitting here since you left this afternoon
Allison is standing up in the dark, not moving
We hear Sam's voice, partly from the bedroom, and partly from the answering machine, which gives the voice a sort of echo effect
(voice over) Yeah
Lisa
Can we talk about this tomorrow
' You can't come over here and sleep with me, and then
Close-up on Allison's face in the dark
She looks very shocked by what she hears
(voice over and yelling) Allie, Allie,  don't know how you shut that thing off
' You said you were going to call
Allison shuts the machine off
'  - '  - Close-up on Sam's face
He picks up the phone and puts the handset to his ear
We hear Lisa's voice saying : Hello, Sam Huh-huh
'  -   - Allison grabs a night-robe and presses it on her naked body
(voice over) Okay
goodbye
'  - '  - Sam is seated on the bed
He puts the phone back on the set
'  -   - take it back
She's not entitled
'  - '  - Close-up on the ancient-looking ventilation system in the bedroom
The air vent is protected by a very decorative wrought iron grill, as can be found in old New-York buildings
(voice over) didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie
swear to God
(voice over) Oh, well,  fell a lot better knowing you can talk now
'  - '  - Close-up on the same air vent in Graham's apartment
We can hear the conversation going on in Allison's bedroom, with a slight echo effect in the sound, which makes some words incomprehensible, but still well enough to get the general idea of the conversation
(voice over from the air vent) She's very depressed,
It's the anniversary of our divorce
She heard we were getting married
She has been drinking
Slowly the camera moves from the air vent to Graham's bed
Graham Knox is about thirty years old, and we shall learn later that he is gay
He is lying in his bed, perhaps naked, but we see only his chest, the rest of his body being covered by the sheets
He was apparently awaken by the voices in the ventilation system and is half-raised on his elbow and listening to the conversation
(voice over from the air vent) don't want to hear this
(voice over from the air vent) feel bad for her
'm moving on feeling guilty
It won't happen again
(voice over from the air vent) (a few words incomprehensible) am supposed to trust you now
Graham is listening with a worried look on his face
Fade out to two second of black screen, during which we keep on hearing the conversation through the ventilation system, but without understanding the words
And then : '  -    '  - Allison rings the bell of Graham's apartment
It says 1203 on the door
'  -  - corridor with a lot of books on shelves going all the way up to the ceiling
Graham walks along the corridor, zipping his pants
He is bare-chested
It's 4 a
m
(voice over through the door) It's me, Graham
Graham opens the door
Allison is just wearing a night-robe, and her face is full of tears
Allie
'm sorry
Sam left
told him to
And
And  can't be alone tonight
so  came up here
'  -    '  - Graham takes Allison by the hand and brings her inside his apartment
Thanks
Graham closes the door behind Allison
'  -   - nice room with pictures on the wall
Allison is sleeping in a large bed
Through the shutter-less window, we can see the other buildings
Graham, dressed in a black -shirt and kaki short pants, enters the room and sits on the bed
He takes Allison's leg through the bedcover
Allison stands up with a start
Allie,  let you sleep
What time is it
About ten
Oh, my God Allison jumps from the bed in a hurry
've got a meeting
It's really important
Graham, still seated on the bed, watches her leave the room
-    - Allison walks quite rapidly on the sidewalk
She comes to a shop and looks through the window
She combs her hair with her hand
- nice restaurant in New-York
Paintings on the walls
Soft music
waitress is talking on the phone
Allison enters the restaurant and crosses the room to a table, where a man, who was sitting alone, stands up when she comes to him
The man is Mitchell Myerson, Allison's appointment
Hi
Hi
'm sorry, 'm a little late
They shake hands
No, no, it's worth the wait
Thank you
They sit down
The man takes his glass
So
little later
They have finished their meal
Allison has put her laptop computer on the table and is typing on the keyboard
On the screen of the computer, we see models of woman's dresses changing color and appearance each time Allison presses a key
You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an expensive designing concept
This is Allison Jones' software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has
Who do  get to run it
stay to be the person to speak
That's included in the quote
Ah
The quote
That's the one thing  haven't seen
Best for last
She gives him a printed paper
think you'll find that's reasonable
as a ballpark
Here's where  was thinking of playing
He takes a pen out of his pocket and start writing on the document Allison gave him
Then he hands back the document to her
She reads it and seems surprised
It makes sense for you
You see, after our last meeting, made some phone calls
to your former partner, for one
No,  wouldn't rely much on what she says
It was not a friendly split
And  did all the work
And
she took all the credit and she didn't like me telling her so
Well,  was more interested in the settlement you made
You walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled apartment
Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your client list
could improve that if you're as good as you say you are
He points to what he wrote on the document Allison is still holding
But that is the only way to prove it
Well,  could go for something
The waiter puts the bill in a small tray on the table
No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself
That's my final offer
Now, of course, if you would like to think about it
Allison takes the bill from the tray, and tears the tab off the bill
'll get this
You'll see it on my first expense report
look forward to it
They shake hands
'  -   - The front door opens and Allison gets in and closes the door
She drops her keys and her handbag on a shelf near the door
She goes to the answering machine, and presses a key
No messages
The machine beeps
'  - '  - Allison starts tearing the sheets off the bed
Her movements are very nervous
And, eventually, she drops on the sheet-less mattress and starts crying
'  -   - We hear the first words of Graham's sentence on the previous image of Allison crying on her bed
Allison and Graham are working on their respective laundry on a table
We see washing machines working in the background
What is this
song cue
You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You
It's just living alone, you know
thought about buying those books like Cooking for One
It's just too depressing
There are worse things than being on your own, you know
Maybe it's all a sign  should go home
Come on
You came here for a reason
Sam has nothing to do with that
No guy does
You think 'd let some guy interfere with my acting career
Assuming  had a career
or a guy to interfere with it
You'll find someone again
Maybe  will
Why not
But the point is, if  don't don't
know that
can do it on my own
Absolutely
'll just get a room-mate
You could always call him, Allie
Not if  have a room-mate
An Apple Computer Screen (certainly Mac  7 or even Mac  6, since the film was made in 1991/1992)
The window is titled Comlink Fax
On the window itself we can read : W70S - When we first see the computer screen, only is written
We hear the clicks of the computer keys as the rest of the ad is written
The computer screen fades into a newspaper clip after   is written
We see a newspaper clip, where Allison's ad has been highlighted with a felt-pen red rectangle
It says : seeks female to share apartment in west 70s
Non-smoker professional preferred
555-9814 Around this ad are other ads, all about apartment renting or sharing
(voice over) The managers couldn't really know you want to live there
'  - The previous voice over sentence ends on a close-up of the folded newspaper with a red felt-pen lying on the newspaper
The camera moves up from the desk, on which the newspaper is lying, to Allison's face, who is speaking over the telephone
Around her, we see other desks with people working
Oh, yes, that's a promise
Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't come on the lease
'  -  - young butch woman, wearing a leather jacket and a black and white bandana around her head, bangs her fist on the walls of the kitchen
She enters the kitchen, where Allison is sitting at a table
Behind Allison, a nice white stove
The butch girl is carrying a motorcycle helmet in her left hand
In the credits, the butch girl is called Mannish Applicant Nice
you could really open 'em up
can't wait to get in here
Are you proper with tools
'  -   - young very pretty woman, dressed in a short brown dress, moves around the room and then looks at Allison with a seducing eye
Allison, who is holding some papers in her hand, looks at the departing applicant with an amused eye
Later in the same room
Another applicant is walking around the room
She's wearing large glasses, and never stops talking
While she is walking, we hear a camera clicking and we see a camera flashlight across the room
'm an incest survivor, you know
haven't remembered the instance yet, but  know it's there somewhere
just have the sense that  survived something
All my therapists think so
She goes out the room in the hall
Allison is shaking her head behind her back
Oh God, a kitchen
hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning, anything feminine
mean, it's probably my mother's fault
While the applicant is going into another room, Allison is writing something on a pad she is holding in her left hand
Underneath the pad is a Polaroid camera, certainly the one we saw the flashlight coming from
'  -   - nice clear room, with a comfortable vintage-looking couch
young woman is standing in the middle of the room, wearing a white blouse and brown large pants, looking very discreet
too perfect
think this could work
And if you feel the same, please give me a call
Allison takes her picture with her Polaroid camera
Later
Close-up on the pile of application forms
On the top of the pile, the one concerning the woman we just saw, with her picture stapled in the left top corner of the form
Allison is sitting on the couch, looking through the files
She has the file of the last woman in her hand
She stands up and walks to the kitchen
'  -  - Allison picks up the phone and dials the number of the last applicant, whose form is still in her hand
Then she sees Sam's picture on the fridge door
She puts the form on the top of the fridge
Close-up of Sam's picture
Allison takes the picture off the fridge door and starts dialing again
' Hello, Sam Rawson
Hello
Allison puts the phone back on its hook on the wall
She sits down on the floor crying, and still holding Sam's picture
She crumples the picture into a small tight ball
We see a pair of foot underneath a long light-grey dress walking in the hall
Allison is still crying
The woman knocks on the kitchen wall
Allison stands up with a start
Oh
Hi
We get a full view of the unknown visitor
It's Hedra Carlson
She is wearing a black hat on her long light brown hair
She is carrying a large bag held by a strap across her chest
She looks very sweet and nice
Hi
The front door was kind of open
Are you Allison Jones
Yes
'm Allie
Oh, 'm Hedra Carlson
We spoke on the phone this morning
She looks at Allison's face, where we still can see she's been crying
Are you sure you're okay
You know what
'm not
Would it be all right if you came back tomorrow
Hedra starts taking her arm, and then moves away inside the kitchen
Why don't you just
sit down
No, 'm fine
'll make you some tea
just
don't think  had lunch, that's all
Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange noise
It's only this one
The one in the bathroom works
Here
She comes to the sink, and takes a wrench lying by the sink
use a wrench
She squeezes the water faucet with the wrench
Hedra puts her bag on the floor
Allison keeps on trying to open the faucet with her wrench, but the faucet breaks off and showers both girls
Hedra bends down to shut the main water tap under the sink
The girls are both all wet
Oh
Wow
Wow
'm so sorry
'  -   - Close-up on Hedra's dress and Allison's jacket drying on hangers near the open window
(voice over) If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli
Hedra gives some papers to Allison, seated on the sofa
Hedra is wearing a red -shirt and black pants, certainly borrowed from Allison
Oh, yes
Allison looks at the papers
Hedra
that's unusual
got terrible nicknames growing up, which 'm not telling you
Not Hedy
Like Hedy Lamarr
That's exotic
Well,  wasn't that exotic in grade school
as opposed to now, right
While Allison is reading the documents Hedra gave her, Hedra feels the clothes hanging by the window
They're dry
She picks them up, gets them off the hangers, and gives her jacket to Allison Here
Thanks
Sam's crumpled picture falls on the floor from a fold in the jacket
Hedra picks it up Oh
You can just toss that
was just cleaning up
He's the reason why 'm looking for a new room-mate
Oh
She sits down on the sofa next to Allison
Do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things up
As
do not want to move in and catch you being bound again, and then have things change
It would just be awkward
Well, nothing going to change it, except for
maybe that my faucets will work
When can you move in
No, really
She looks very moved by what Allison just said
She takes Allison's hand
Congratulations
Thank you
'  -  - Allison and Hedra are walking along a corridor in the basement
Allison is wearing a black sleeveless -shirt and beige pants
Hedra is wearing a red dress with white small dots
Allison is carrying two suitcases and Hedra a very large box
They all must be empty, the way the girls are carrying them
've got one friend
Graham
He lives just upstairs
friend
Oh, not like that : he's gay
So, anyway, it's not a real friendly building, but, at least, there's no problem with privacy
'Cause,  mean, you just close your door
Yeah
No problem
'll leave you alone, you know
mean, whatever's good for you
They've come to a row of stocking rooms, all protected by partition and doors covered with chicken wire
They look like cages, and that's exactly what the tenants call them
The two girls drop their parcels on the floor
Allison takes a key out of her pocket to open the padlock of her own private cage
Anyway
Wow
Hedra crosses the corridor
On the opposite side from the row of cages, a door that says : Incinerator Room and stuck on it, a sign that says Use prohibited by law
By this door, a pile of junks, probably left by a tenant
Hedra picks up an old rusty metal lamp
Hey, look, Allie, this could be good, huh
few moments later
Allison has resumed her tour of the basement, walking along the corridors
Hedra is carrying the metal lamp she found
They pass by the Laundry Room, where we've seen Allison earlier chatting with Graham
Inside, a lady is working with her laundry on a table
Laundry room
Another corridor
don't go in there at night
It's a bit creepy
It's okay in the day, but, still, lock yourself in
Hedra looks at a key she is holding
This one
No, that's mail key
They've come to the elevator
An old machinery, enclosed in a chicken wire cage, is working with a loud noise
Allison presses the switch of the elevator This is creepy
Oh, it's not bad, it's just kind of old
The elevator door slides into the wall, and the two girls get in the cabin
Allison wants to close the inner door of the cabin, but it does not want to slide back into closed position
Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this screwdriver
She takes a screwdriver hanging on a chain in the cabin
With it, she works on the door lock, and succeeds in moving it
While she rolls the inner telescopic door shut, she discovers that another tenant has come into the cabin behind their back
He doesn't look very friendly, with his bow-tie and his small mustache
He is holding a newspaper
Excuse me
When the inner door is completely shut, the outer door slides automatically into shut position
'  -   - The elevator is moving up
Which floor
Eleven The tenant presses a button on the switchboard by the door
Fourteen, please
The tenant presses another button
Hedra plays with her keys and smiles to Allison
'  -   - Allison and Hedra move a table out of the room
The table is covered with various objets, and has apparently been used as a desk
When they try to squeeze the table through the door, they upset everything that is on the table down on the floor
They scream and laugh
'  -  - Allison turns the water faucet on, and it seems to be working perfectly
Okay
Hedra is kneeling by the sink, looking at the cupboard underneath the sink
She stands up with an oval metal dish
Look what  found
'  -   - Hedra is kneeling on the floor, cleaning the dish she has found in the kitchen
It shines so well that she can look at herself in it as if it was a mirror
Close up on the dish
Beside Hedra's face, we see Allison's face coming to join her
'  -   - Hedra, just wearing her underwear, is talking on the phone
'm not sure
Hold on, 'll check
Sitting on the floor, Allison is painting the old lamp Hedra has found in the basement
An electric fan is working next to her
Hedra puts the dress she is holding on the receiver, and whispers
Allie, it's Sam
Allison shakes her head No
-   - Nice weather
Busy street, with shops and people
Allison and Hedra are walking, eating ice cream cones
Allison is very elegantly dressed
Hedra is more simply dressed and is still wearing her old black hat
Where do you guys learn to dress like that
mean, it's just so New York
think you look very comfortable
Yeah,  never know what looks good
-    - Hedra comes out of a dressing room, wearing a very elegant red jacket
Oh
think that looks nice Yes
But  found this
She gives her a red dress on a hanger, which she was holding out of our view
Oh
think you'd look great with that
Okay Hedra takes the dress and looks at it
-    - We see only Allison's feet and legs
She is sitting on a chair trying on some high-heel shoes
We see Hedra's feet coming toward her
She is also wearing high-heel shoes
Hey
What do you think
think you should take them
Allison takes off the shoes she was trying on
Oh God, you like them
We now see both girls' faces
Hedra is taking off the shoes she was wearing
Well,  think they go great with that dress
You take them She gives her shoes to Allison
Well
'll just borrow them when  want to
'  - full view of Allison's building in the New-York night
Actually, it's not full night yet, because there is still some dark blue light in the sky
'  - '  - The room is all dark, lit only by the street light coming from the window
Allison walks into the room with a lampshade in her hand
She puts the lampshade on the lamp by the bed
Then she switches the lamp on
Apparently it is the lamp Hedra found in the basement, cleaned and painted
Allison looks at the books on the night-table
She then moves across the room, puts her handbag on the bed, and takes a medicine bottle from a small table
She puts it back and takes a perfume bottle
She takes the plug off and sniffs the bottle
With the plug, she puts a bit of perfume on her neck
She puts the plug back on the bottle and the bottle back on the table
She then takes a pair of earring from the table
She holds them on her ears and looks at the effect in a mirror
In the mirror, we see Hedra entering the room behind Allison
Allison turns quickly around
Hedra is wearing a light night-robe and her hair is wet God
didn't know you were home
was
Lying on the bed, there are a shoebox with a rubber band around it, a key on a keyring, and a piece of paper
Apparently, Allison has not noticed them
Quickly, Hedra throw the bath-towel, she is holding, on those items, for Allison not to notice them
was
was
God, 'm sorry
You haven't even been here two weeks and 'm already in your room
(ironically) was just about to go through your drawers
Hedra laughs
Allison puts the earrings, she was still holding, back on the table
That smells nice on you
Oh,  hope you don't mind
just
always wanted to try that
Oh God, no
anything you want
you want
She takes her night-robe off
Allison seems embarrassed to see her naked
She turns her eyes away from her
Go ahead
Share and share alike
Well
don't really know about that
'm an only child
Do you have
a big family
Hedra puts her nightdress on
Hu-uh
There's just me
She sits on her bed
am
Well,  was supposed to be a twin, but she was stillborn
Oh, that's so sad
grew up like a part of me was missing
She turns around sees the new lampshade
Allie
God
She stands up to have a better look at the lampshade
It's beautiful
Thank you
What do  owe you
She walks toward the little table
Oh
nothing
It's just a little housewarming
It's like that
Hedra picks up the earrings from the table, and gives them to Allison Oh no no
Shhh
She puts the earrings on Allison's ears
They look beautiful on you
But  can't take these
It's housewarming
Allison looks at herself in the mirror
Thanks, they're great
The phone rings
Excuse me
She goes out of the room
While going out, she bumps into Hedra
Oops
'  -   - Allison picks up the phone
Hello
It's Sam
We only hear a few words of what he says
(voice over on the phone) Talk to me
No, Sam
(voice over on the phone) Why not
Why not
No, it's not a good time
'  - '  - Hedra takes the shoebox from her bed, goes to a closet inserted in the wall of the bedroom, and puts the shoebox on the top shelf of the closet
(voice over from the corridor) 'm not ready to see you
You're just going on something that's over
'  -   - Allison is still on the phone
No, there's nothing to talk about anyway
Sam, there's somebody here right now
We see Hedra's face peeking through the door of her bedroom
All right
Okay
Bye
She puts the phone down
Hedra is still peeking behind her bedroom door
Why don't we order some Chinese
Allison remains two seconds motionless with her hand on the telephone, and then smiles and shakes her head Yes
'  -   - Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra kneeling by the bathtub, and apparently washing something in the bathtub
The phone rings
Hedra rushes out of the bathroom
She is wearing a orange -shirt, a very large red boxer-short and white slippers
Hi, this is Allison Jones
Please leave a message
Thank you
beep
While listening to the machine, Hedra picks up a box on the telephone table, takes a sweet out of the box, eats it, and puts the box back on the table ' Allie, are you   there
Allie, pick up
Allie, listen
Please, please   call me back
This is torture for me
know you need me as   much as  need you
love you
'll do anything for you for us to get back together, just call me
click, meaning the end of the call
Hedra presses a button on the answering machine, to erase Sam's message
We hear some yapping coming from the bathroom
Hedra turns her head toward the bathroom
Buddy
'  -  - Close-up shot of Hedra, kneeling by the bathtub and holding a big puppy in her arms
She is rinsing it with mugs of water taken from the bath
Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy
You're going to cheer her up, are you
Hmm
You're going to cheer her up
So she'll let you stay
While rinsing the puppy, she hugs and kisses it
She hears the front door opening and turns her head around
She says Shhh
to the puppy, and whispers some other incomprehensible words to it, then puts it back in the bathtub
Close-up of a paper lying near the sink over Hedra's key-ring
The paper is a bill from a shop called Pet Express, in New-York
It was paid in cash, and the date is 8/16
It reads : , 6  , $ 350,- $ 29,75 $ 379,75 Hedra's hand crumples the bill and puts it in the waste-basket underneath the other items already in the basket
'  -   - Allison enters the apartment
She is wearing a silver-colored raincoat
Yoo-hoo
She closes the front door
Through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra going from the waste-basket to the bathtub
She takes a towel and wraps it around the puppy, still in the tub
Allison puts her keys on the shelf by the door, puts her handbag on the floor, and presses a button on the answering machine beep and then : No messages
Behind Allison, we see Hedra coming out the bathroom carrying the puppy wrapped in the towel
Allison turns around, sees Hedra with the puppy and stops in her tracks
She doesn't seem very happy, almost angry in fact
know  shouldn't have, but they were just giving him away
in the market
But they said  could bring him back to-morrow
Well,  hope they meant it
Hedra sits down on the floor
Well
his name's Buddy
had a dog named Buddy when was little
She gives a kiss to the puppy
She then looks up at Allison's face, which doesn't seem very friendly
Tomorrow, okay
promise
Allison walks away taking off her raincoat
'  - '  - We hear the puppy yapping
Hedra is sitting on her bed in the dark
She stands up and peeks through the ajar opening of the door
'  -   - Close-up at Hedra's peeking through the ajar opening of the door
The puppy is still yapping
The door of Allison's bedroom opens and Allison comes out
She is wearing a light pink nightdress
She slowly opens the kitchen door, bends down and picks up the puppy
Oh
Come on
'  -  - Reverse angle shot of Allison picking up the puppy
She then goes away, presumably to her bedroom, with the puppy in her arms
Okay
Come on
Shhh
Through the open kitchen door, we see, across the corridor, Hedra's bedroom door closing itself
'  -   - Hedra, wearing pajama-looking pants and a sleeveless loose shirt, comes in the room, carrying a tray
There is a mug on the tray, in which Hedra is pouring honey from a plastic bottle
She comes to a table, where Allison is working on two computers
The puppy is sitting on Allison's laps
Hedra stirs the mug with a teaspoon, and puts the tray on the table
You're working so hard
Close-up on the screens of the computers
They show women dresses designs

(voice over) He will, you're the best
'  - '  - Hedra and Allison are lying on Allison's bed, with the puppy between them
Hedra is wearing a pink -shirt and red short pants
The  is on and we hear its sound faintly, without really understanding the words
God, Hedy, thanks
never would've got it done without you
Hedra is playing with a portable battery-powered fan
She puts it down to play with the puppy
love helping
She tries to move the puppy, who wants to move the other way
Wait
Wait
Allison takes her Polaroid camera to take a shot of the three of them
Oh yeah
Family portrait
Ready
Yeah
Allison takes the snapshot
Later in the night
There is a black and white movie on the
lived a few weeks while you loved me
Goodbye, David
The camera moves away from the , and we see Allison and Hedra asleep on Allison's bed, with the puppy between them
Hedra moves slightly in her sleep
- -   - Allison and Graham are walking on the sidewalk of the street, Graham pushing his bicycle
He has a canvas bag strapped over his shoulder
Graham's first sentence is actually heard in voice over the previous sequence
Ready to kill her yet
Who, Hedy
Hm-mm
No, no, it's a lot of fun having a girlfriend again

You were starting to look like a Kennedy wife
'  -   - They enter the lobby
We can see that Allison is carrying some shopping bags

She needed a lot of help moving in
Plus, 've been working like crazy
promised 'm not avoiding you
They enter the elevator
Two ladies are coming out
Allison has to use the screwdriver to close the inner door of the cabin
Oh, 've got you cornered now

'  -   - The cabin is moving up
Will you cat sit again

He takes a keyring out of his pocket
Hey, 've made you a set
You know which one to try
And ignore the litter box this time,  do
She laughs
It's so cruel
We'll be fine
You know,  think  saw her the other day, your room-mate
You were leaving the building
Then  thought it was you
Your backpack
This jacket
chased her down
But it was someone else
Someone very nervous
Oh
That's Hedy
really freaked her out about people knowing she's living in the building
would've had you down to meet her
but she's shy
The elevator stops
Well
The outer door opens
Allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags
She opens the inner door and takes the keys Graham is giving her
Friday
That'll be great

She drops her keys on the little shelf by the door
She sees Hedra in the doorway of the living room
Her hair is in a bun
Hey,  thought you'd be at work
No
Don't tell me we have the same belt
Hedra looks down at her belt
She seems embarrassed by something
Well
Yeah
Sorry
Listen,  have to talk to you
You have to see these
Look, cookies for dogs
Oh, they're great

They're so great
Can  just talk to you for a second
Buddy
Sam enters from the living room with the puppy in his arms
tried to let you know
Sam puts the puppy on the floor
What are you doing here
Hedy
But no, don't blame Hedy
It's not her fault, okay
Hedra goes out of the hall into the living room
kind of forced my way in here
had to see you
Hedra comes back in the hall
've got to get out of here now
Unless you need me
She looks back and forth to Allison and Sam, and gets just a No head-shake as an answer from Allison
Okay
Hedra goes out of the apartment and closes the door behind her
Why can't you just leave me alone
Allison takes her shopping bags and goes into the kitchen
You've got to talk to me, baby
You just can't pretend don't exist
'  -  - Allison puts her bags down on a table
Easier that way, Okay
Is that so hard to try to make it easier on me
But people screw up
People do something wrong
And  was wrong,  admit it
And you just
You cut me off
You don't take my calls
You don't answer my letters
Wait a minute
You lied to me
If she hadn't called, would have found out
think that's really scary, okay
Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away
Okay
You know,  know that there is something that you just can put back together
was hoping that this wasn't one of them
Well,  guess it is
And
didn't get any letter
So, wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it
just didn't get it
Well,  sent it with the keys
Well,  didn't get those, either
What did it say
Forget the letter
love you
can't exist without you

You have to give me a second chance
She goes into his arms
He hugs her
She start crying
You really hurt me, Sam
Shhh
'  - Close-up on Allison's kitchen window
We see Allison and Sam hugging each other
'  -    '  - Hedra is standing by the window, with a knee on the heater
She seems very pensive
An old lady comes out of the elevator, and looks at Hedra
Hedra turns her head toward the lady
She picks up her bag, which was sitting on the heater beside her, and moves away from the window
She goes to the elevator and presses the call button
- - We are across the street from the Rizzoli bookshop, the shop where Hedra is working
- Hedra, dressed exactly like she was in the previous sequence, is dialing a number on the telephone on the wall
lady comes to her
Excuse me, can you tell me where the biography section is
Oh, yes, towards the front, against the wall
Okay
The lady moves away from Hedra
We hear Allison's answering machine talking in the telephone
'   (voice over) Hi, this is Allison Jones
Please leave a message
Thank you
beep
Hi, Allie, it's me
'm just calling to see if you're okay
'  -   - Close up shot on the answering machine
Then the camera moves away from the telephone table and, in the living room, we see Sam and Allison, standing in a close embrace and kissing each other
Some pieces of clothing are already on the floor, and we see Allison's foot stroking the back of Sam's leg
(voice over on the answering machine) Call me at work
Yeah
Okay
My number's on the fridge
Okay, bye
- Hedra puts the phone back on its hook
She seems very nervous
-   - The Atherton Hotel is evidently a quite luxurious hotel
Sam and Allison are walking on the sidewalk towards us and the entrance of the hotel
Say
Next month, that would give her enough time
don't know
Just got herself on hands
Haste wouldn't do
'm sure she'll understand
They enter the hotel
-  - Sam and Allison cross the lobby, hand in hand
An old hotel clerk looks at them from behind his counter
Good evening, Mister Rawson

She is eating ice-cream from a large plastic pot
On the floor beside her, the puppy is playing with a tennis shoes
Hedra looks down at it and kicks it away with one of her feet
Hey
It's not for you
The puppy goes away yapping
Hedra has a mean look on her face
(voice over from the  set) Would you like it to go on for always
(voice over from the  set) How does anything go on for always
(voice over from the  set) Well, one likes to think some things do
Hedra keeps on eating her ice-cream, looking absently at the , with the same mean look on her face

Hedra, her eyes closed, is humming some music
'  - Full view of the building
'  -   - Yellow Cab is parked in front of the entrance
On the sidewalk, Sam and Allison are hugging and kissing
Allison moves away from Sam and into the building
Sam goes back into the cab
'  -   - The front door opens
Allison comes in and closes the door behind her
She locks the door and puts the security chain on
She puts her keys on the shelf by the door, and looks through her mail
She stops near Hedra's bedroom closed door, because she notices there is still some light in the room
She then goes to the telephone table to look at the answering machine
Still looking through her mail, she enters her bedroom
'  - '  - Without switching the lights on, Allison puts her mail on a chest of drawers
Where the hell have you been
Allison gasps at that somber voice in the dark
Hedra switches the bed-light on
She is sitting on Allison's bed, with her legs covered by the sheet, and the puppy on her laps
She is wearing her night-dress, with a pink sweater on her shoulders
God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room
've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from you
'm worried sick
Buddy was crying
thought  might as well come in here, so it calm down
Sorry,  guess  just didn't think
No, you didn't
There's such a thing as a phone, you know
This is New York
Things happen
Okay, okay, 'm sorry
It was thoughtless, really
You're making me feel like 'm sixteen years old here
She goes to the bed where Hedra is stroking absently the puppy
She kneels down at the bedside
Hey, are you okay
Yeah
Yeah
Just
forget it
So,  guess you've patched things up with Sam, huh
Yeah
Yeah,  made him suffer
Hedra looks down at Allison hand stroking the puppy
Is that an engagement ring
Allison stands up
Right
Hedra sighs, and moves the sheet away to get out of the bed
Beautiful ring
Thanks
Hedra walks away from the bed
She gives a last look at Allison's ring
Really great
She walks to the door
'm sure you'll be very happy
you'll be very happy and 'll be alone
No, no, wait a little
You'll find someone, Hedy
mean, God, if  can
Hedra is standing in the doorway and points to the mirror
Why don't you look in the mirror
Huh
Look
She comes back into the bedroom
She forces Allison to look at both of them in the mirror
Look
You're in a different league
know that
You have this great personality
You have this great style
You're running your own business
You're always going to find someone
You'd have to be stupid to think that you wouldn't
She puts her head in her hand
Well,  guess you
you and Sam want to be together
So
have to move out, right
No
Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while know you just spent a lot on furniture
Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great
You promised me this wouldn't happen
Exactly what
Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on
Look, 'll talk to Sam
Well
Well, maybe we'll move,  don't know
Maybe, we'll find some place like this, or
don't know
But, we'll see, we'll figure something out
Okay
-   - Fontana Fashions is Mitchell Myerson's company
Close-up on some feminine hands typing on an Apple computer keyboard
We see various windows, showing models of female dress, opening and closing on the screen
(voice over) They tell me they're nervous
(voice over) Of course, they're nervous
They're salesmen
They want to be sold
We see the whole room
It is a very big room with large white columns supporting the ceiling, and large bay windows
Girls are working in the background
Some are trying a new dress on a model girl
Mitchell's assistant is typing on the computer, with Allison standing near her
Her name is Barbara, and she is a woman with brown hair and a sleek bob haircut
Mitchell is standing a couple of feet away
Let's set up a demo, to show them something
Something special, something different, you know
Maybe at night, you know
Open bar, open minds
That's  night
Mitchell walks to the desk next to Barbara's one, where he starts flipping the cards of a Rolodex
'll set it up, 'll set it up
Maybe
'll call you tonight after  check on some things
Great
He takes a card from the Rolodex

Knox
What's this Knox
Oh no, that's Graham Knox
He is my upstair neighbor
That was just for last night
Oh, he's the first one
Well, 've got to admit, 'm very impressed
Well, maybe you start spreading the word
You know,  can see 'm not going to be able to afford you any more
He puts his hand on Allison's shoulder and walks away
Allison smiles and then looks at what Barbara is doing
Great
Press enter
That's it
'  - Low angle shot of Allison's building
'  - '  - In the dark, we see the shadow of Allison moving up and down on top of Sam
She is slightly moaning
Fade out
Later
Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, naked and half- covered by the sheet
Allison's head is resting on Sam's chest
You thirsty
No
She starts moving out of the bed
'll be right back, okay
She stands up and puts a light night-gown on
She walks out of the room
'  -  - Allison is filling a tooth glass from the tap of the sink
Suddenly we hear voices
Allison seems surprised
We don't understand the words, but we recognize Sam's voice, and then Hedra's light laugh
Allison slowly walks out, carrying her glass
'  -   - Hedra is standing at the door of Allison's bedroom
She is holding a glass containing an orange liquid
She is wearing a night gown and she is holding a book in her other hand

He is drinking from a can

Allison walks behind Hedra
She is holding her tooth glass, and with her other hand, she keeps her night gown well closed
Hedra turns her head towards her
Oh, hi
(voice over from the bed) Allie, do you want a sip
Allison shows her own glass in her hand without answering
Hedra looks at Sam and then at Allison
She seems slightly embarrassed
Oh well
Well  think 'll turn in
Goodnight, Allie
She kisses Allison's cheek
Goodnight, Sam
She walks away toward her bedroom
Sam turns himself around in the bed to lie on his back
Before closing the door, Allison switches the lights off

Allison is asleep, lying on her side
She is still wearing her night-gown
Her hand is moving on the sheet, and apparently does not find what it was looking for, because Allison suddenly sits up on the bed
We see Sam sleeping and lying on his back, half-covered by the sheet
Allison looks at him and sighs
We hear some strange noises
Allison gets up and off the bed
We see her naked feet walking past the puppy's basket

She stops, bends down and picks it up
She walks slowly to Hedra's door, which is partly opened

We see Allison's shoulder moving slowly up and down, just as she was really asleep
Hedra remains a few seconds looking at Allison, then starts walking back towards the door
Close-up shot on Allison's face
Her eyes are closed, but, when she hears the door closing, she opens them again
'  -   - Sam is fixing a broken piece of wrought iron on the balustrade on the balcony
He is screwing a sleeve clamp to fix the broken piece on the main body of the balustrade
(voice over) They're ready
Right, just a minute
Hedra is coming out of the kitchen with a frying pan
She is just wearing her night gown
She is stirring some scrambled eggs in the pan
They'll get cold
She eats a piece of crispy bacon out of the pan
All right, all right

She hears voices coming out of the kitchen
(voice over) No, no, Rawson is a Norse name
Allison opens the kitchen door
'  -  - Sam and Hedra are eating breakfast seated on either side of the small kitchen table
The puppy is eating something off the floor
(finishing the sentence he was saying in voice over while Allison was opening the door) Well, isn't this a thoroughly uninteresting conversation
He looks up at Allison entering the room Hey
Hi
We going
She walks to the sink, and picks up an orange
Sam gives her a kiss on the cheek
She turns her head and doesn't respond to the kiss
Hedra comes toward them with a plate in her hand
She gives the plate to Allison
Scrambled or fried
Allison doesn't take the plate and shows her the orange
She seems quite upset
(whispering) This is fine
She gets out of the kitchen
Sam turns his head towards Hedra and then follows Allison
Hedra walks a couple of steps towards the open door and listen to the conversation going on in the living room (voice over) Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent
You know, if you don't want to do this apartment thing today, it can wait till  get back
'  -   - Hedra is standing in the doorway leading to the kitchen, with the plate still in her hand

Nightmares
Okay
Sam gives her a very tender kiss, which she gives him back
Reverse angle shot on Hedra looking very angry
She goes back into the kitchen and puts her plate down
She then walks into the living room, looking very casual
You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot
She gives a light tap on Sam's back when she walks behind him
She takes a food plate off Allison's desk, and starts walking away towards the kitchen with the plate
You don't have to do that, Hedy
You're doing enough already
Oh,  don't mind
It's clean when you can't tell 'm here
She enters the kitchen to put the plate down
She then comes back into the living room
Oh
Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys can trust me with dinner
Do you know when you'll be back
Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight
So  think we'll be eating out
Really
Well, that's great
Well, good luck
We can see, by her expression, that Hedra is not very happy about what she just heard, but she keeps a smiling face
Sam and Allison walks out of the room
Hedra wrinkles the front of her night gown with her nervous hands
She walks slowly toward the hall
'  -   - Sam and Allison are going out of the apartment
Goodbye

- large room in a typical old New-York apartment
Large windows going almost to the ceiling
Through the windows we see roofs with water tanks on them
The room is empty, save for a ladder and a few tools
The real estate agent is standing with some papers in his hand
Sam and Allison are coming towards him from the other side of the room
But this is half the size for twice the price from your apartment
It's easier this way, believe me
And this could be nice
They walk away toward the exit of the apartment
The agent remains standing on the same spot
Can you imagine going from The Victoria to this
-    '  - busy street in New York, with small shops with goods for sale on counters on the sidewalk
Sam and Allison are walking down the street
Do you think we can smoke her out
This is such a mess

Allison opens it
'  -   - Allison rushes into the apartment, followed by Sam
(yelling) Hedy
She runs past the kitchen door
We see Hedra sitting at the kitchen table
She stands up when she sees Allison
'  -   - Allison stops in front of the window
The window is open and the broken piece of wrought iron, on which Sam was working earlier in the morning, is missing, leaving a gap in the balustrade, a gap wide enough for a puppy dog to go through
(screaming and crying) He's dead
Buddy's dead
Sam climbs on the balcony
Close up on the gap in the balustrade
What
Hedra seems genuinely surprised
She still has the earphones of her Walkman around her neck
(crying) You left the window open
How could you do that
But  thought we could leave it open
know you fixed it this morning
Sam is still on the balcony, looking at the balustrade
thought  did
It's me
interrupted you when  called you in for breakfast
And Allie, it's my fault
She starts crying
Allison rushes out the room
Allie
(voice over) Allie
Sam runs out of the room after Allison
Allie
Hedra walks to the balcony and slowly slides the window down
Fade out
'  - '  - Allison is lying in her bed with the sheet up to her neck

Then he stands up
We hear him leaving the room and closing the door
Allison turns her head with her eyes still closes
'  -  - Hedra is sitting on the floor in the dark, leaning on the wall
She is sorting things and putting them in a box in front of her
Hearing the musical noise of a plastic toy, we understand she is putting the puppy's stuff away
Sam comes out of Allison's room and, walking in the hall in front of the kitchen open door, stops and looks at her
Thanks, that pill helped
Are you still going on that trip tomorrow
Well, she wants me to
If 'd just let you finish your work this morning
We can hear repressed tears in her voice
Then she starts crying for real
Listen, if she blames anybody, she blames me, huh
Sam kneels down
Shh
Sam takes her in his arms where she goes on crying
He slowly stands up, still holding her in his arms
He leads her to her room
'  -   - Outside Hedra's room
Sam is in the doorway
Hedra moves slightly away from him and then hugs him even stronger
Gently, he pushes her away from him
They almost kiss on the mouth, but Sam takes her arms off his neck and goes out of her room, where she stays
He closes the door behind him, and she holds his hand on the doorknob
Then she moves her hand away and the door closes
We hear her sobbing behind the closed door
'  - '  - Allison is asleep on her bed, dressed with a short black slip and black panty hoses
The phone rings
Allison wakes up slowly, and, with her eyes still closed, feels around on the night table to find the phone
She eventually picks it up
Hello
Hi, Mitch
She raises her head
What
She looks at the clock
God
know
'm
No, 'm just
'm just running a little late
She picks up the pill bottle on the night table and looks at it
didn't forget
dunno
Just hold them till five, okay
Thanks
She puts the phone down
She gets up and goes into the dressing room
She starts looking for a dress
She rapidly goes out
'  -   - Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Allison looking for a dress
She then goes out of the bathroom, crosses the hall and open a closet, in which more clothes are hanging
She picks up three hangers with clothes on them
'  - '  - She enters her bedroom, carrying the hangers
She throws one of them on the bed, and goes, with the two other ones, back into the dressing room
She picks up a hanger with a light brown jacket, and compares it with the one on the hanger she brought from the closet in the hall
They are exactly the same
Then she picks up a red dress, and compares it with the one she brought from the closet in the hall
They're both the same
She looks a bit worried by what she just discovered
-   - Close-up on an Apple Computer screen, showing dress models
The file is called Fontana Fashions
(voice over) You were terrific
We see Mitchell, very smartly dressed, with a white Roman-collar shirt and a black jacket
He is holding a glass of Champagne
but you know that, don't you
large section of the main hall of Fontana Fashions Office has been transformed into a reception room
Dresses are hanging on racks
On a round table with a white tablecloth, many half-empty glasses of Champagne, two silver bucket with Champagne bottles in them, plates of petit fours, and a lot of flowers
Mitchell and Allison are both standing in front of a large screen, set on a hight stand, and showing the Fontana Fashions computer files
Allison, wearing a very smart black short sleeveless dress, puts a video cassette back in its box
Thank you
Mitchell goes to the table, puts his glass down, and fill another glass with Champagne
And here,  thought all the guys would resist you
As if anyone ever could
He gives the glass to Allison, who doesn't take it
Oh no, here, 've got to go
'm just cleaning a bit
Hold it
Hold it
Not so fast
Now everybody under me knows more than  do
hate that
Well
Block up some time for me next week
Then
it's just a little late tonight
Mitchell kneels down on the floor
Oh, please, please, just a taste
He puts the glass on the top of his head Something simple
Right now
He gives the glass to Allison, who takes it
Okay
Something simple
She walks to a table with an Apple computer on it, puts her glass on the table, and sits down
Mitchell comes behind her, drinking his glass, which he then puts on the table
He bends down behind Allison, who starts typing on the keyboard
All right
You know, this is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff, but it does come in handy
Close-up on the computer screen
The Fontana Fashions file is on
We see the outline of a model, then a small window appears on the model
It says Are you sure you want to quit
and below two choices, Cancel or
Allison chooses
Fontana Fashions file disappears, replaced by another window that says Search by vendor, and in the bottom of the window, Enter Vendor Name:, with an empty box underneath
(voice over) Huh-huh
Back to Allison typing
Mitchell's head is just behind hers
Okay
Enter the vendor's name
Oh
Vendor
He bends over Allison to type on the keyboard, encircling her with his right arm
-o-n-e-s

Allison seems a bit embarrassed by this close physical contact
Very good

Back to Allison and Mitchell looking at the screen Ho-ho
According to this, we should have paid you last Friday
That's all right
Barbara will handle that
Not till  give her the word
Allison turns to him, and seems not to like his strange smile
Well,  hope you're satisfied with what 've done
So far
He walks away from her and goes to the Champagne table
But this is it
mean, there ain't much more
Just maybe a little fine tuning, that's it
have some free time now, if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues
Using a napkin, he is drying a bottle of Champagne he just got out of its bucket
was thinking that maybe  want to keep you all to myself
He throws the napkin on the floor, and comes back toward Allison with the bottle of Champagne
He puts the bottom of the bottle on Allison's bare shoulders
She shivers
Top her
What are you doing
He puts his other hand on her shoulder
Then he puts the bottle on the table, and starts massaging her shoulders
That's just that you're so tight
Mitch, please, don't
That's enough
He grabs her from behind and squeezes her in his arms
Mitch
Hey, look
He kisses her neck
've been a good boy, haven't
And you've been a good girl
We have nothing to prove any more
He keeps on kissing her neck, and puts his hand inside her dress to reach her breast
Allison seems to be on the verge of tears
This is your last chance to play before you're an old married lady
Let me turn around, okay
She has a strange smile on her lips
That's better
That's better
He stands up
Just a second
second
While she slowly turns around on her swivel seat, he starts unzipping his pants, and lets them fall on his ankles, showing his white trunks
Allison, still   seated, is now facing him, her face at the level of his crotch
He   takes her head to guide it toward his private parts
Allison   looks up at him and then, with both fists and all her might, she   hits him very hard between his legs
He screams
She jumps from her seat and runs out of the room
He falls on the floor, holding his private parts with both hands
Fucking bitch
'  -   - Close-up on Allison, still in her black dress, and holding a glass of wine
(voice over) Here
Take this
We see Hedra's hand giving some pills to Allison
She then replaces the glass of wine by a glass of water
can't believe  didn't see it coming
It's just so humiliating
(voice over) You're too nice, that's the problem
Men are pigs
don't care how nice they seem
You always fall for that
But what  did
It was like something inside taking over
It was scary
We see Hedra standing near the mantlepiece
She is wearing an orange -shirt and a red skirt
No, Allie, don't turn this around
You're the victim
He should pay for this
She kneels on the floor in front of Allison
He'll pay
set up all my programs, so they have to eventually
Hedra laughs
What
'm not talking about getting paid, 'm talking about getting even
You don't understand
It's the contacts more than the money
When  just took the job for the word of mouth and now that's gone
It's just like he's put me back to square one
Only if you let him
But you won't let him, will you
What can  do
Oh, Allie
She opens Allison's purse and takes her address-book
Of course, Sam's away
didn't want to say anything
How he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died
She walks to the telephone table in the hall, flipping the pages of the address-book
Especially when it was his fault
Since the bedroom door is wide open, we can see Hedra in the hall
She picks up the phone and starts dialing
Hello
May  speak with your husband, please
Who are you calling
She gets up from the sofa on which she was sitting
Yes,  know it's late
Tell him it's Allison Jones, he'll take the call
Allison has come to the telephone table
Who are you talking
Hedra shushes Allison with her finger
Listen, you pathetic shit
Do you want to hold on to your business
No, you listen to me this time, asshole
If you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is fucked, too
You got that
It won't just be you
She puts the phone down, and starts laughing
Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p
j
's right now
Gee, Hedy,  hope you never get mad at me
'  - High-angle shot of the building, taken from the roof of the building across the street
We see Allison and Hedra coming out of the building
From this height, they look like a couple of ants
(voice over) Hedy, we really have to talk
(voice over) Allie, please,  have a surprise for you
(voice over) Hedy
'   - Allison and Hedra are walking on the sidewalk
They stop in front of the shop of John Dellar's Hair Salon
Oh, Hedy, 'm not really up for this today
What
She puts her hand on Allison's neck
No, no, no, this is going to be fun
It'll make you feel better, promise
Okay
And 'm paying
Go
She takes Allison by the hand and drags her to the door of the shop
Let's go
Allison tries to resist Hedra
Oh, Hedy
It'll be fine, come on
They enter the shop
- Allison is seated in front of a large mirror
An attendant is taking the protection garment off her shoulders
Thank you
She smiles
She seems happy and puts her hands through her hair
Suddenly she stops, and the smile disappears from her mouth
She looks up in the mirror at someone descending the stairs from the upper level of the shop
She makes the swivel chair turn around to have a better look at the staircase
Close-up on Hedra going down the stair
Her hairdo is so much like Allison's one that she almost looks like a twin sister of Allison
Back to Allison's thunderstruck face
You've got to be kidding
- Allison and Hedra are walking in a busy street
If Hedra was not a bit shorter than Allison, one could think they were twins
Allison seems angry
You just should've asked first
Well,  wanted it to be a surprise
They stop at a newspaper stand
Can  have the Consumer Market, please
Sure
The attendant picks up a magazine from a rack and Allison picks up some other magazines at random
This feels so good on my neck
didn't think you'd mind
Allison is paying the attendant
Thank you
please
Hedra seems to be worried by Allison's very cold reaction to her surprise
She seems even a bit sad
'  - '  - Allison is looking at the dresses hanging in the closet
(voice over) 'm going to take a shower
Allison walks out of her room into the hall
'  -   - Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra turing the water faucet on in the shower cubicle, then taking her belt off
She closes the door of the bathroom
Allison stealthily runs into Hedra's bedroom
'  - '  - Allison enters the room, and looks around
She walks to the closet and starts looking through Hedra's clothes
Suddenly, she notices the shoebox on the shelf above the clothes
Close up on the shoebox and then on Allison's hand picking it up
Allison opens the shoebox
She sits down on the bed, and starts looking through the content of the box
She takes several papers out of the box and looks more closely at them
Close-up on the documents Allison is looking through
Several photographs, and then a black and white photograph of two twin girls with a puppy between them
The twin girls are the one we saw at the very beginning of the film
Allison looks very attentively at the picture
She puts the documents she is holding into the lid of the box and starts looking at the rest of the documents
Close-up on an envelope that reads : 441 , Allison seems surprised by the name on the envelope
Ellen Besch
She looks through all the other envelopes
On another envelope, a computer-generated label has been glued on the original Ellen Besch address
It reads : 72810 c/o 845
93RD 10024 She puts the envelopes back into the box, and picks up other documents
They are newspapers clippings
Close-up on the clipping Allison is holding
There is a picture of two young twin girls, and above, a title that reads : -- And underneath : Services were held Friday at Hope Lutheran Church for nine-year old, Judy Besch, of Mapic Drive, who drowned Tuesday at a family picnic
Circumstances surrounding her death remain unclear
eulogy was delivered by Dr
William Starr, the family's doctor for many years
Among the She puts the clippings back into the box and picks up another envelope
Close-up on the envelope, which reads : 768
74TH
#1103 ,  10017 (voice over) Sam
We see Allison's hand looking inside the already opened envelope and taking a key-ring out
'  -  - Close-up on Hedra's hand turning the water faucet off
'  - '  - Allison is reading the letter which was with the keys
Close-up shot on the letter
It was written on a Hotel Atherton stationery
The close-up is too close for us to be able to read all the words, but we still can read : , , , ,   ' '      , '
, ' Allison reads the letter very attentively
Suddenly she hears some noise coming from the bathroom and turns her head towards the noise
'  -   - The bathroom door is opening slowly '  - '  - Allison puts the letter back in the envelope, the envelope back into the box
She then puts everything back into the box, closes the box and puts it back on the shelf
'  -   - Allison comes out of her bedroom, picks up her handbag and starts unlocking the safety chains and locks on the front door, while, through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra, wearing a long white shirt, taking care of her hair in front of the mirror
Do you want me to fix you something before  go
Oh, no, thanks
'm just going up and visit Graham
Okay
Okay
love myself like this
Have fun
Allison opens the door and goes out
Yeah
Allison closes the door behind her
'  -  - Close up on the mirror
We see Hedra still fixing her hair love myself like this
'  -    '  - Allison rings the doorbell of Graham's apartment
Getting no answer she knocks on the door
Getting no answer again, she walks away from the door
'  -   - Allison is going down the stairs
She opens a service door, and, hidden by this door, watches Hedra waiting for the elevator
Allison rushes back to the staircase
High-angle shot of the whole staircase, with Allison running down
-    '  - This is the street outside Allison's building, probably seen from the entrance of the building, or very near it
Hedra, coming from behind the camera, crosses the sidewalk, towards the street
Taxi
She raises her hand to stop a taxi cab
Allison, also coming from behind the camera, hides behind the corner of a wall to watch Hedra
Hey
yellow cab stops and Hedra climbs in it
As soon as the cab is gone, Allison rushes from her hiding spot and runs to the street, with her hand raised
Taxi
- We are inside Allison's cab
In front of us, through the windshield, we see the back of Hedra's cab driving in the heavy traffic of New York
(voice over) Don't lose her
Reverse angle shot on Allison seated in the back of the cab
Allison bends slightly to speak to the driver
It's very important
She has something of mine
- -    - Compared to Allison's neighborhood, this is a very quiet district
Almost no one in the streets
No shops
Hedra's cab has just stopped in front of a grim building with a fire escape
Hedra walks out just as Allison's cab stops at the corner of the street
Allison walks out of her cab
Both cabs drive away, and Allison starts following Hedra from a distance
Medium shot of Allison following Hedra
Hedra reaches her destination, another grim building, and goes down a stairway, starting from the street and going down to the basement of the building
strong man with a ponytail and glasses is guarding the entrance
But he lets Allison go down the steps
Other people follow Allison
- Allison goes down the last steps to the basement, which actually is a sort of night club
We hear some religious-sounding music with drum rhythms
The place is quite dark, but flashes of light enable us to see that all the customers are very smartly dressed, men wearing elegant suits and neckties, and women wearing elegant dresses
They seem to be watching some sort of a show
young woman, wearing a black sleeveless dress and long black leather gloves, notices Allison and comes towards her
Do you want to play
No, thanks
Allison walks away, followed by the young woman
She passes near a cage, inside which we see a middle-aged man
The man gets his hand through the bars of the cage, and strokes Allison's cheek
Allison jumps, rubs her cheek and moves away from the cage
Behind Allison's back, we see the young woman, who was following her, coming to the cage and speaking to the man inside
From where she is, Allison can see what's going on at the bar, without actually be seen by the people seated on high stools along the bar
Reverse angle shot on the bar itself, and more precisely, on Hedra, seated on a stool, with a man, seated on another stool, stroking her cheek
Come on, Jim
The bartender, a bald bare-chested young man, turns toward Hedra
Allie
Hearing her name, Allison starts and looks at the bartender (voice over) Hey, Allie
Regular or diet
Hedra turns towards the bartender
Diet
flash of light enable us to have a better view of Hedra's companion, the man she called Jim
He looks a bit like Sam
Something's different
Hedra smiles
Yes
Yes
Allison is staring at the couple (voice over) Yeah, you look like my sister's boyfriend
Jim laughs
'  -  - We hear the first sentence said by Graham in voice over the previous sequence
Jesus, Allie, what is it
Graham is opening his front door to Allie, who enters the apartment, but stays near the open front door
God, you've got to help me, Graham
You've got to tell me what to do
'  -   - Hedra opens the front door and enters the apartment
Allie
She closes the door and locks it
'm home
She drops her keys on the shelf near the door and crosses the hall
The camera moves into the living room
'  -   - Through the open door to the kitchen, we see Hedra crossing the kitchen to go into the living room
Allie
She seems slightly drunk and doesn't control her movements very well
Before entering the living room, she takes a blue bag in the kitchen (maybe something to eat) and drops it on a table
But, being a bit nervous, she actually drops the bag on a small bowl containing various objects, and the bowl falls on the floor and breaks into pieces
Allie
Hedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the debris
God
The bowl has fallen near the air vent
It is exactly the same as the one which, earlier in the film, had enabled Graham to hear Sam and Allison's conversation
Hedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl
We hear a faint voice
Hedra raises her head, trying to find out where this faint voice comes from
First, we don't understand the words the faint voice is saying, then it becomes clearer
It's Allison's voice speaking to Graham in his apartment
(voice over from the air vent) It's like looking at myself
And she lies
found a shoebox in her room
Hedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent, and she moves closer to it
(voice over from the air vent) Nothing she told me is true
The twin that she said died at birth
It was in an accident when she was nine
Hedra moves a brass knob on the air vent, to open it wider and to have a better understanding of the words
'  -   - Graham and Allison are sitting on a couch
Graham has a glass in his hand, and Allison a cup
And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me
have to do something
Graham gets up from the couch
Get rid of her
'  -   - Hedra is still kneeling on the floor, with her ear close to the air vent, listening to the conversation between Allison and Graham
(voice over from the air vent) Call the police if you have to
If she steals thing you have to get her out of the place
We hear steps
Hedra looks up at the ceiling, and then slowly stands up
'  -   - Graham is pouring something we don't see in a glass
You're right
'll tell her tonight
Allison gets up from the couch, with her cup in her hand
can't just throw her out on the street
mean, she obviously needs help
She is a lunatic, Allie
She's got to go
Do it tonight
'  -  - Close-up on the front door
The door slowly opens and a hand covered by a black glove comes through the opening of the door
We hear the conversation going on between Graham and Allison
(voice over) It's just that  feel responsible for her somehow
'm the only one she has
Someone like her parent
'  -   - Back to Graham and Allison
Allie, either she's gone by Saturday, or  go to the police, okay
Allison laughs
That was very impressive
can be butch when  have to
got it from my mother
'  -  - The room is very dark and only lit by the street lights through the window
shadow moving in the dark
We hear the conversation coming from the living room
(voice over) Look, if you worry about her, 've got a friend who's a shrink
Maybe he can help her
The shadow moves away from the dark corner where she was hiding : it is Hedra, who starts walking cautiously in the room
(voice over) Oh God
Maybe after  talk to her, she just leaves
(voice over) Do you want to sleep here tonight
(voice over) Oh, don't tempt me
No,  just needed to talk it out
'  -   - Allison and Graham are both standing in the middle of the room
Thanks
She walks to a table to pick up her purse
'  -  - Sensing that Allison is going to leave, Hedra walks back into a dark corner to hide herself
(voice over) She's not going to chase me out of my own place
(voice over) When's Sam coming back
'  -   - Graham is carrying his cat in his arms
Oh, tomorrow
Allison picks up her purse and they start walking towards the front door
'  -  - They walk along the corridor, Graham still with his cat in his arms
That's good
Yeah
Oh, this is a little embarrassing, but since we're letting our hair down
Those old air vents between our apartments carry sound
It's a weird acoustic thing
They've stopped walking
Oh
What do you hear
He does not answer but he makes a face and then laughs, which is a good answer to Allison's question
She puts her head down in her hand, feeling a bit embarrassed
Oh, no
Oh no
'm
'm sorry
Big deal
am sorry
should've mentioned it sooner
'm so sorry
You're sure you want to go down there
Yeah
She's my problem
'll handle it
She starts walking again towards the front door
Graham follows her
Allison opens the door
Thank you for the tea
'll see you tomorrow
Okay
Allison goes out and Graham closes the door behind her, and then locks it
'  -   - High angle shot of the staircase
Allison is walking down the stairs
'  -   - The apartment is all dark
The front door opens and Allison walks in, and closes the door behind her
Hedy
She puts her keys on the shelf by the door
Hedy
She walks around the hall, looking in all the rooms
Hedy
We hear a little noise, and we see Allison turning her head
Close up on a mirror-covered door opening slowly
At that very moment, we, the spectators, do think we are still in Allison's apartment
But actually, we are in : '  -  - The door opens slowly with a light squeaking noise
We hear Graham's voice talking on the telephone in the next room
(voice over) This is serious, it's a lot more serious than  thought
No,  know you can't diagnose over the phone
The camera moves away from the door, then looks into the living- room, where Graham is sitting in the dark, only lit by the street lights coming through the window, and talking in the telephone
don't know
don't even know what hyper-vigilant is
No, 've never met the woman
She could be infantile or paranoid, whatever
don't know
'  - '  - Close-up on the air-vent
We see Allison's hands sticking pieces of large adhesive tape on the air-vent
We hear the faint voice of Graham still talking on the telephone, but we don't understand the words
Larger shot of Allison sitting on her bed and sticking the pieces of tape on the air-vent
'  -   - Graham is still talking on the phone
tell you what, let me go downstairs
If  call you from there, will you talk to my friend
She can tell you better than  can
Right, okay
We hear some noise in the background, and Graham turns his head towards the noise
Quick reverse angle shot on the corridor seen from the living-room door
It looks empty and quiet
Back to Graham on the phone
Thanks
So
so, all right
so, so you might hear from us
Love to Jack
And you're not charging me for this
He puts the telephone down on his set on the table, turns his head again in the direction where he heard the strange noise, and gets up
He thinks it may be the cat and calls her with a soft gentle voice
Carmen
He gets out of the room into the corridor
'  -  - Graham makes little noises with his lips to attract the cat
He suddenly hears the wooden floor squeak behind him
He turns his head
We see Hedra coming out of a room and walking towards the front door
Since we see only the back of her head, she can easily be mistaken for Allison
Allie
She doesn't turn her head and just wave her hand
Goodnight
She has almost reached the front door, when Graham realizes that something is queer about the girl's attitude
Hedy
She turns around
She seems very panicky suddenly
She starts fumbling with the locks of the door, and drops the safety bar on the floor
'm sorry
Wait
hey, wait, it's okay
Take it easy
Take it
We just want to get you some help
Hedra is kneeling down, fumbling with the fallen safety bar
No, Please
Please
didn't do anything wrong
Graham is walking slowly towards her
Okay, take it easy
'm sorry,  didn't do anything
No problem
Hedra suddenly stands up with the safety bar held firmly in both hands
She strikes Graham first in the stomach, then, as he doubles up with pain, she strikes him again on the shoulder
Graham falls on the floor, and she gives him a final blow on the head, leaving him unconscious on the floor
'  -   - Allison is standing by the desk, talking on the telephone and holding the telephone set with her other hand
We hear a beep
Hello, Mr
Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison Jones
think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter
Ellen
'm not sure, really
She's
She's been under a lot of stress lately
And
Well
Huh
Huh
God really, really would not get into this on the answering machine
Could you please give me a call
Or her
'm sure you have the phone number
It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4
'  -   - The front door opens, and Hedra comes in
(voice over, still talking on the telephone) 'll really appreciate, 'll really
Don't say  called
'  -   - Allison, still on the phone, turns her head towards the front hall
Oh, thank you
She puts the phone down
'  -   - Hedra closes the front door and walks slowly across the hall (voice over) Hedy
Hedra enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her
'  -   - Allison is standing near the window, apparently not knowing exactly what to do next
'  -  - Hedra is sitting naked under the shower
She is playing with a jewel ring and humming softly some musical tune
We hear several knocks on the door
Hedra doesn't react at all
(voice over) Hedy
Hedra answers without moving her head
What
Apparently, Hedra has not spoken loud enough above the noise of the shower, because Allison knocks again on the door
(voice over) Hedy, are you all right
can't hear you
She has spoken with a very soft voice, and apparently Allison hasn't heard her, because she opens the door, and walks slowly towards the shower It's okay, it's just  was starting to worry
You've been in here so long
'm making some tea
Do you want some tea
Camomile
Hedra turns slowly her head towards Allison and smiles
Yeah
that'd be great
She turns the shower off, and stands up
She picks up a towel
Allison turns her head, apparently feeling embarrassed to see her naked
Close up on the basin, full of water, and where Hedra's clothes are soaking
The water is red with what looks like blood
(voice over) 'm not feeling really well
Hedra, wrapped in a large bath towel, has noticed that Allison has been looking at the blood in the basin
Mine always comes when 'm wearing something nice
She walks slowly across the bathroom
When she passes near the basin, she notices that a small part of her clothes are not inside the basin, and she moves it back inside
'  -   - Still wrapped into the bath towel, Hedra walks slowly out of the bathroom, followed by Allison
Are you crampy
Sometimes tea helps
Something warm
We could talk
Hedra has reached her room's door, and she turns around
About what
Hedra walks into her room followed by Allison
About Sam and  wanting this place for ourselves
'  - '  - Hedra has not switched the light on in the room
The room is just lit by the street light coming through the window
It's just crazy keeping two places like this
Hedra sits on the bed
She is wearing a night shirt and a large sweater over the night shirt
( - This could be considered as a continuity goof
Apparently, Hedra has been able to change from the bath towel to the night shirt and sweater in less than a second
) Well
Well,
thought you wanted a long engagement so you could make sure you can trust him again
Well, frankly,  think that's my business
'm sorry, but it is
Hedra cracks her knuckles
Huh-huh
It's me, isn't it
'll change, Allie
can change
No, that's not it at all
You've been a good room-mate
It's just
This is the man 'm going to marry
want us to start our lives together
Well
He will cheat on you again, that's a promise
And when he does, don't come running to me, okay
Cause
've had it with you
You're so fucking weak
Suddenly, she has a very menacing face
Allison, still standing up, looks down at her with a very hard stare
Hedra, seeing that stare, calms down and laughs
'm sorry
'm so sorry
The phone rings, but Allison, who is still looking down at Hedra with her very hard stare, doesn't move
Hedra turns her head in the direction of the phone
Allie
Hedra now has a very sweet look on her face
She gets up and out of the room
'  -   - Hedra picks up the phone from the little table in the hall
Hello
Allison enters the room from Hedra's bedroom
Is it Sam
We hear a male voice over the phone
We quickly understand it's Hedra's father
'  (voice over on the telephone) Ellen, is that you
Talk to me, or your mother
Honey, we miss you
We want you to come home
(with a deep menacing voice) Don't call here again
'  (voice over on the telephone) Ellen, listen
We'll stop sending the cheques if you don't come
promise, no doctors this time
Just come
Hedra puts the telephone down
She doesn't move for a couple of seconds, then looks at Allison, trying to look more casual than she actually is
She has a little nervous laugh
Obscene phone call
New York
The phone rings again
Hedra picks up the receiver and slams it on the table
Then she presses on a button on the telephone set to cut off the communication
Find someone else, jerk
Allison walks to the telephone table
'm expecting a call from Sam
He might be coming in tonight
Just for a little while, okay
Sam will call back if it's busy
Hedra hugs Allison
'm sorry, Allie
She moves away from Allison, looking falsely casual
It's no big deal
'll find some other place
You know, just
don't want you making a mistake
understand
Hey, we'll still be friends
We'll keep in touch
Sure
Allison walks away to her room
Hedra picks up the telephone set from the little table, without putting the receiver back on its hook
We hear several short beeps coming from the telephone
With one nervous movement, Hedra tears the cord off the wall socket
Then she walks slowly into her room
'  - '  - little later
Hedra is lying in her bed, writing something in a notebook
She is humming a song
Her other hand is resting on the telephone set on the bed
The phone rings
Hedra picks it up immediately, not to let it ring more than once
(whispering) Hello
(voice over on the phone) Allie
No, it's Hedy
-   - Sam is lying on the bed, still dressed in his suit and necktie
He is talking on the telephone
(voice over on the phone) Where are you
Where are you
Oh
just got in from the airport
Is she asleep
(voice over on the phone) Yeah
'  - '  - Hedra gives a quick look at the clock on the night table
It's after two
Do you want me to wake her
(voice over on the phone) No, tell her to surprise me
-   - (voice over on the phone) Okay
Okay
(voice over on the phone) Okay, 'll tell her
Goodnight, honey
'  - '  - Goodnight, Sam
Sleep well
She slowly puts the phone down and plays a little with it
-   - Close up on a pair of female legs and feet with stiletto heels shoes
The heels clicks on the sidewalk, and we see the figure of a woman walking away from us, and towards the entrance of the hotel
No one else is in the streets at this time of the night
The woman is wearing a grey raincoat
The woman enters the hotel
-   - Sam is sleeping, covered by the sheet up to his waist, and apparently naked underneath
The door opens slowly
The woman in the grey raincoat enters the room
We have already guessed she is Hedra
She closes the door and puts the key on the night table
She remains motionless for a couple of seconds, looking at Sam, then she slowly starts to take the raincoat off
She is completely naked under the raincoat
She slides under the sheet of the bed, close to Sam
Sam moans in his sleep
He turns slowly towards Hedra, who starts kissing him on the chest
(sleepy voice) Allie, Allie
what are you doing
Hedra goes down Sam's body, still kissing him
When she gets between his legs, even if the room is very dark, we understand she is performing oral sex on him
Sam moans with pleasure
Oh
Oh
Jesus
Oh
Gee
Suddenly, Sam realizes that something may be wrong
He gives an anxious look at Hedra
Allie
Hedra raises her head from Sam's private parts
No, not Allie
She resumes what she was doing
Sam would like to push her away, but he is so close to his climax that he can't do it
He has his orgasm, with Hedra not moving away from between his legs
She only raises her head when she is sure it is over
She gives him a light kiss on the pubis and smiles
Then she moves up in the bed, her head finally resting near Sam's one
Sam is breathing very hard
Hedra strokes him on the chest, and kisses his cheek
Then she gets up and off the bed, and puts her raincoat back on
She picks up a half-full glass on a table and drinks from it, what looks like beer
Then she eats something from a plate on the same table
Sam breathes normally again and moves slowly on the bed
He lies on his side, facing away from Hedra
Hey
With the glass still in her hand, she walks to the bed Hey, sleepy guy
She puts the glass on the night table, and kneels on the bed
She start stroking Sam's shoulder
knew it
Knew what
told her
Guys like you don't change
You can't be faithful
And now she'll know
While talking, she keeps on stroking his face
Sam doesn't react to her caress
She'll know what
He switches on the light on the night-table
He then turn around to face her
That you came up here and pretended to be her
My God, what is this hair
What is this supposed to mean
You're in her clothes
You're wearing her perfume
For Christ- sake
He jumps out of the bed, and starts putting his clothes on
Hedra remains seated on the bed, drinking her glass
You knew it was me
Come on
You knew and you didn't care
Well,  think she should know that
You think she's going to thank you for that news, do you
Well,  don't expect you to understand her friendship
She puts her glass on the night table, and gathers her shoes to put them back on her feet
She can't
she can't stand you, for Christ-sake
That's not true
Oh, bullshit
Huh-huh
She shakes her head no
You're too needy
You're always cleaning
You're constantly in her face
She needs me
Who was there for her when her boss almost raped her
What
Could you care of her
You were off on a business trip or screwing someone
She never said a word to me about that
After his pants, Sam has put his shirt back on
Hedra gets up from the bed where she was still sitting
That's right, she told me
She sits back on the bed
So
don't try and make me think that we're not close
We lean on each other and we
we protect each other
We're best friends
You're nuts, you know that
Yes
think you're out of your skull, that's right
Yeah, well, sticks and stones
He comes near the bed and bends down to pick up something
Hedra rushes on him
Sam
He pushes her away from him
Don't touch me
She sits back on the bed
'm sorry
'm sorry
Look,  know you want to save face won't tell her, okay
Just
Just pick up the phone and call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or something
And  won't say a word, okay
Yeah
Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart, because 'm going to tell her myself
He walks to the night-table and picks up the telephone
She throws one of her shoes towards him
The shoe hits the wall just above his head
(yelling) No
He rushes towards her, ready to hit her
Fucking bitch
But, before he reaches her, she strikes him very hard in the face with her other shoe
The stiletto heel of the shoe enters his left eye, and, behind the eye, certainly enters his skull and his brain, because, instantly after the blow, Sam falls heavily on his back on the floor, where he remains motionless and unconscious
With her bare foot, Hedra touches his cheek
(softly) Hey
Hey
-  - Close up on Hedra's feet walking on the rug
She's wearing both of her stiletto heels shoes
Hedra goes down some steps and reaches the hotel reception desk
The same hotel clerk, that we saw earlier in the film, when Sam and Allison came together into the hotel, is talking on the phone
He is talking in a soft voice, so we can't understand exactly what he's saying
But, when Hedra walks in front of his desk, he puts his hand on the receiver microphone, and says, in a louder voice : Goodnight, Miss Jones
Without turning her head, Hedra waves her hand
Goodnight
'  - '  - Close up on the clock on the night table : it says 06:22
Allison slowly wakes up to some noise in the apartment
'  -   - Allison comes out of her bedroom, wearing a long sleeveless pink night shirt
She seems to be naked underneath
She walks around the room, looking in every room which door is open
Hedy
Hedy
She eventually finds her in the living room, vigorously cleaning the mantlepiece
Hedra is wearing a long plain gray dress and red rubber gloves
Allison remains at the door of the room
Hedy
Hedra looks up at Allison, but doesn't stop her cleaning
Oh, hi
hope  didn't wake you
got an early start
No, Hedy,  didn't mean for you to move out today
Hedra looks around the room
Oh, there,  think that's it
She goes out of the room into the hall
hope you don't mind
'm storing some of my stuff in the cage downstairs
She resumes her vigorous cleaning in the hall, starting with the small shelf by the front door
That way,  won't have to bother
You see what  mean
You know
mean
Allison has come near Hedra
Sure, that's fine
Look, 'm really sorry it didn't work out
Hedra has stacked her stuff near the front door
She picks them up : a red suitcase, a cardboard box and a large paper bag
She has taken her rubber gloves off and keeps them in one hand
Well, 'd better get this stuff out of here
Allison walks to the door
'll help
She opens the door
We can have breakfast when you get back
Hedra walks out of the apartment
Allison closes the door, but remains behind it, lost in her thoughts
'  -  - Hedra is rapidly walking along a corridor, carrying her stuff
'  -   - Close up on the open red suitcase
Inside, all the clothes that makes Hedra look like Allison
Hedra takes the clothes out of the suitcase and puts them into the open incinerator
Then she sprays some lighter fluid over the clothes
Close up on Hedra's hands striking a match on the side of a matchbox
She throws the match into the incinerator, and long flames immediately start on the clothes
'  -  - Allison is fixing breakfast
She has cut some fruits into small pieces and she puts them in the bowl of the blender
We hear some music from the  in the background
Allison walks to a cupboard on the wall to pick up a spices jar
The door leading to the living room is open, and the  is on
Allison gives a quick look at the , on her way back from the cupboard to the kitchen working bench
Allison puts a bit of spices from the jar into the blender, closes the lid and starts the blender
(voice over from the  set) And now, Morning News-break
The rest of the words of the  reporter are lost, covered by the noise from the blender
But the voice of a female reporter, being slightly louder, can be heard over the blender noise (voice over from the  set) Police found the body of a man brutally murdered early this morning
Allison shuts the blender off, and walks to the open door to watch '  -   - Close up on the  screen, showing the reporter, standing, with her microphone in hand, near the entrance of the Atherton Hotel
(voice over from the  set) Identification of the victim, a white male of around 30 years of age is pending notification of next of kin
Reverse angle shot of Allison, standing in the doorway and peeling a banana

Reverse angle shot on the
(voice over from the  set) he heard the sound of a struggle emanating from room 612
Reverse angle shot on Allison
(voice over from the  set) around four o'clock this morning
Allison suddenly realizes that the room number is Sam's one
She rushes to the telephone set on the wall near the refrigerator
'  -  - Allison dials very nervously a number on the phone
(voice over from the phone) Atherton Hotel
Sam Rawson's room, please, room 6-12
(voice over on the phone) 'm sorry, there's been an accident
think you should speak to the police
She doesn't even wait for the end of the sentence, and drops the phone, letting the receiver hang on its cord
She rushes out of the kitchen
'  -   - Hedra is leaving the room, carrying her stuff
Behind her, the incinerator door is wide open, and we see a bright fire inside
'  -  - Across the corridor from the incinerator room, Hedra reaches Allison's private cage
She drops her stuff and opens the padlock
'  -  - Allison is bending over the toilet bowl and vomiting
'  -  - In the cage, Hedra takes a boot out of the cardboard box
Then she takes a sock out of the boot, and delicately, takes a black hand gun out of the boot
She puts the gun in the paper back, above some clothes
'  -  - Allison is still vomiting in the toilet bowl
She slowly raises her head from the toilet bowl, trying to catch her breath
She sees Hedra's pair of stiletto heel shoes
Underneath one of the heels, there are some traces of blood on the tile floor of the bathroom
Kneeling on the floor, Allison takes the shoe to look at it more closely
Then she screams and throws it away, knocking the other shoe down on the floor
She is still kneeling on the floor, crying, when the door opens and Hedra enters the room
Allison raises her head to look at Hedra
Allie
Hedra sees the stiletto heel shoe behind the toilet bowl, where it has been knocked away
What are you doing down there
Allison remains kneeling on the floor, just supporting herself on her arms
Oh
just suddenly felt sick
It was the funniest thing
hope 'm not pregnant
Hedra walks towards Allison to help her stand up
Let me help you
Allison stands up
Oh, that's all right, 'm fine
'll get some water
Hedra walks to the basin, but wraps her hand in the bottom of her dress before touching the water tap
Allison walks out of the room
Wait
Allison stops at the door, and turns around toward Hedra
Close-up on the mirror above the basin, showing Hedra and Allison standing next to each other
Drink some
Allison takes the tooth glass and drinks
Hedra strokes her shoulder
Okay
Allison puts the glass down and shakes her head Yes
Hedra strokes the back of her head
Feeling better
Yeah
can go out for a while
feel much better now
'  -   - Allison walks out of the bathroom, followed by Hedra
thought you said breakfast
Allison has reached the front door, and she starts unlocking the door
Oh, it's in the blender
've got to go out
Hedra looks at Allison thin sleeveless night shirt and smiles
Dressed like that
'm out
'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham
He called while you were out
Hedra looks at Allison with a very strange expression on her face
She can see the tears on Allison's face
Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear more than that
Maybe you're right
She walks away to her room
Hedra puts her hand on her face
Oh
'  - '  - Allison enters her room coming from the hall
(voice over from the hall) Leave the door open so we can talk
Allison grabs a pair of pants and puts them on
Hedra enters slowly in the room, carrying the large paper bag where she has put the gun
Allison takes her night shirt off
She is now naked from the waist up
But she grabs a sweater and puts it on
You know why  think you're sick
While talking, Hedra slowly slides her hand into the paper bag, takes a pair of black gloves out of the bag and puts the bag down on the floor
You're upset about Sam
Slowly, Hedra puts the black gloves on her hands
You know Sam's dead, don't you
Allison turns around to face Hedra
Yeah, we don't have much time
She picks up the bag and walks to a chest of drawers
She puts the bag on the floor and opens the top drawer
(crying) You didn't
you didn't do it, Hedy, did you
Hedra is taking white pantie and bra from the drawer (crying) You couldn't have him
She falls down, sitting on the floor and crying
Why
Why
Allie, he came in my mouth
Then he tried to beat the shit out of me because  wanted to tell you
She slams the drawer shut, and opens another one
You know, it was an accident
But he deserved it
She claps her hands
Okay, come on
The police will be here soon
Allison doesn't move and remains seated on the floor
But
but you shouldn't run
That'll only make it worse know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy
Hedra laughs
know
was you
She points her gloved finger to Allison, and then looks at herself in the mirror
Who is this Hedy anyway
She turns around, and walks away from the mirror towards Allison
No one's seen her
She's not on the lease
There's not even a fingerprint of hers here
've been cleaning like crazy
You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away
Hedy, it'll never work
Besides
people have seen you
We just can't tell
We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and they'll explain it to the police, or something
Hedra, who is now very upset, knocks everything, that was on top of the chest of drawer, with a long sweeping movement, down on the floor
No
She bends down and takes the gun out of the paper bag
Why are you making me do this
She snaps a cartridge into the chamber of the gun
We're friends, Allie
You could be in a lot of trouble without me
But 'm not going to leave you
She walks to Allison and kneels on the floor besides her, pointing the gun to her head That wouldn't be right
won't leave you
Okay, let's go
Up
Up
Up
She slaps her face
'  -    '  - Hedra leads Allison along the hall
She is carrying her paper bag in one hand and the gun in the other hand
She still has her gloves on
Allison is carrying a small plastic case
Go
Go-go-go
They reach the elevator and Allison is ready to press the call button, but Hedra moves her away towards the staircase
No-no, up to Graham's
Come on
No-no, he's already involved
'  -   - They climb the stairs
Hedra is pushing Allison with her gun
'  -    '  - They reach Graham's front door
Allison rings the bell, waits a couple of seconds and turns around
Nobody's home
Hedra takes some keys out of her bag and gives them to Allison with the gloved hand that is still holding the gun
Use these
Come on, come on, hurry up
Go
Allison takes the keys and unlocks the door
He must be sleeping
We were up late last night
Hedra seems very nervous
While Allison is unlocking the door, she keeps looking around her and pressing Allison's back with her gun
Allison opens the door, and enters the apartment, followed by Hedra
Graham
He can't hear you
Hedra closes the door behind them
'  - Low angle shot of the building, taken from street level
'  -  - (voice over) Wait till you see me
Hedra comes out of the bathroom, with a dark towel on her head
The cat crosses the corridor and enters the bathroom
Hedra puts her towel down : her hair, instead of being red like Allison's, is now dark brown
Your color was beautiful, but  can't go around looking like you any more, can
She smiles
'  -   - Hedra enters the living-room
Okay now, Allie, don't laugh
She walks in front of the window, and makes a couple of dance steps
Ta-dah
Reverse angle shot on Allison, tied up in an armchair with duct tape
Each one of Allison's arms is tied on each armrest of the armchair
Her legs are tied on the legs of the armchair, and her chest is tied on the back of the armchair
There is also a piece of tape across her face to keep her mouth shut
Hedra laughs and turns the  set on
The screen shows a documentary about African fauna
Hedra turns the volume slightly up
How's that
Good
She puts the remote control on the armrest of the armchair, within easy reach of Allison's right hand
Allison doesn't move at all
22 and 24 are the movie channels
've got to cash a pay cheque
So 'll only be gone an hour
know how you hate to be alone
Okay
Are you good and comfortable
All right
She walks away from the armchair, takes the towel off her neck and down on the back of a chair
She takes her purse
So, well
When  get back, we'll do your hair, too
Okay
Be good
Bye
She gets out of the room
Allison moves for the first time : she turns her head around, then looks back at the  screen
Reverse angle shot
On the  screen, close up of a lion yawning
Reverse angle shot
Allison looks at the remote control on the armrest
Close up on the remote control
Almost at the top of the remote control, we see the two volume control buttons : up and down
And under those buttons, we see the two channel control buttons
Close up on Allison's face looking at the remote control
Close up on Allison's right hand moving the remote control on the armrest, to get the volume control buttons within reach of her forefinger
She presses the up button
On the  screen, we see the volume bar graph going up on the picture of a crocodile
And the volume of the music goes up too
Allison looks at the remote control again
Close up on Allison's forefinger pressing one of the channel control buttons
On the screen, we see a different channel : a comic movie couple is having dinner in a restaurant and the waiter pours the water bucket on the man
Another channel
woman is sleeping
telephone rings
Reverse angle shot on Allison pressing the channel control buttons
We hear a male voice for a couple of second, then Allison changes the channel again
The  screen seen from behind Allison's hand dialing on the remote control
There is a cartoon on the screen
Then another channel showing the concert of a rock music band
Close up on Allison's face looking at the screen and then at the remote control in her hand
Reverse angle shot on the  set
The volume bar graph is going up again until it reaches the end of the graph
The volume of the sound of the rock music is very high
'  -    '  - We hear the rock music very loudly in the empty hall
The front door of apartment 1206 opens slowly
man with glasses on his nose peeks into the hall
He seems very annoyed by the noise
-  - Close up on the hand of Hedra writing Ellen Besch on the back of a cheque on the cashier's counter
In front of her, we see the hands of the cashier girl on the other side of the glass partition
(voice over) What's the part this time
Larger view of the bank office hall
Hedra is standing in front of the cashier's desk
We see the cashier girl through the partition glass
Behind Hedra, a man is waiting for his turn, reading a newspaper
Excuse me
Through the opening at the bottom of the partition, she gives her cheque to the girl
Closer shot
Now we are on the cashier's side of the partition, and we see Hedra's face through the glass
You're an actress, right
You're never the same person twice
Reverse angle shot
We are now on Hedra's side of the partition, and we see the cashier girl through the glass : she is a blonde girl about the same age as Hedra
She puts her finger on her own hair
like it
just thought the other was more you
Reverse angle shot
Cashier's side
Well, maybe next time 'll try blonde
Reverse angle shot
Hedra's side
The cashier girl smiles
Really
'm flattered
Thanks
male bank clerk, sitting at a desk behind the cashier girl, stands up and walks to the partition glass
Miss Besch
Yes
man's been calling here
Says he's your father
Reverse angle shot
Cashier's side
Hedra seems worried by what the man is saying
(voice over) Might even come to New York if you don't call him
Hedra runs away from the counter
(voice over) Miss Besch
'  -   - On the  set, the rock band is still playing with the sound volume very loud
Reverse angle shot on Allison, trying to free herself from the armchair where she is tied up
But the duct tape is strong enough and her jerky movements don't bring any result
'  -    '  - Outside Graham's apartment
We hear the loud rock music very clearly
The building manager is standing by the door, with the neighbor from apartment 1206 behind him
The neighbor has his glasses hanging around his neck on a string
The building manager rings the bell
Then he bangs on the door with his fist
Hey
'  -   - Allison turns her head towards the front door and try to speak through the tape stuck on her mouth
Mmmm
She starts moving again to free herself from the armchair, but she doesn't succeed
The bell rings again
Allison turns her heard towards the front door
- - Hedra is walking very fast on the sidewalk
She passes a fruit shop and bumps into a pedestrian girl, but doesn't stop to apologize
Jerk
Hedra keeps on walking very fast
She seems worried
'  -    '  - The manager has a key ring with many keys in his hand
He is sorting them trying to find the right key to the apartment
'  -   - Hedra is crossing the lobby, walking very fast
She reaches the elevator and presses the call button
'  -   - On the  screen, a video clip with loud rock music behind
Reverse angle shot on Allison, still trying to free herself from the armchair
'  -    '  - Close up on the manager's hand putting the key in the keyhole
'  -   - Allison hears the key moving in the keyhole and turns her head towards the front door
Close up on the video clip : a man is running, apparently chased by men armed with spears
'  -    '  - Hedra just came out of the elevator and is closing the inner door of the cabin
She turns the corner of the hall and suddenly sees the manager and the neighbor near Graham's door
She runs towards them and yells
Oh
The apartment door is wide open, but, when they see Hedra, the two men don't enter the apartment
The neighbor goes back into his own apartment, but the manager remains just outside the apartment
You live here
Hedra closes the door to talk to the manager, but she doesn't lock it
No, no, 'm just watching the place for the week-end like that
It's on a timer
Huh
Huh
'm sorry
have to register a complaint
Please, 'll turn it off
will
She enters the apartment and closes the door shut behind her
'  -   - Allison turns her head towards the front door
Hedra enters the room, walking very fast
She drops her purse on a chair and walks to the  set
She switches it off
Then she walks slowly towards Allison, with a quite menacing face
She gives Allison a very hard slap in the face
She kneels down in front of her, and shakes her shoulders a couple of times
Then she stops but remains kneeling on the floor, while she's talking to her
How could you do that
Everything 've done, 've done for you
Don't you understand that
People you hated,  hated
She stands up
People like you don't care
She knocks a large metal vase down on the floor
Just like that stupid girl in Tampa
She called my parents, too
Told them all my secrets
She comes behind Allison and pulls her hair to tilt her head back
You want to put me away, huh
She releases Allison's hair
can't
can't keep making excuses for you, Allie can't
can't
can't
can't
can't
She walks out of the room
She is crying
Oh God
Oh God
Ohhh
We hear her crying in the next room
Allison turns her head slightly towards her
Close up on Allison's face
We hear Hedra screaming and breaking things
Allison seems terrified
Hedra comes back into the room
She has a big knife with a serrated blade in her hand
Close up on Allison's face
She seems more and more terrified
She starts moaning under her tape gag
Hedra is now just behind Allison
She puts the tip of the blade on Allison's throat, then the full length of the blade
What
What
She tears the tape off Allison's mouth
Please
No
Hedra's face is now very close to Allison's one
Allison raises her head and kisses Hedra on the mouth
Close up on the serrated blade of the knife on Allison's throat
The blade is ready to tear the skin, but doesn't move further
Slowly, Allison moves her mouth away from Hedra's one
(whispering) Don't make me leave you, Ellen
Hedra slowly raises up
She has a strange look on her face
She seems not to understand the situation anymore
Close-up on Allison's head and throat
We can see the slightly bloody marks left by the serrated blade
Allison looks at Hedra moving away from her with an anxious face
Hedra kneels down in front of Allison
She bends down to rest her face on Allison's lap, and starts crying
Allison moves her hand as far as she can and strokes Hedra's hair
Shhh
It's okay
It's okay
Close-up on a wallet on the floor, close to Allison's foot
Allison is trying to reach it with her foot, but she can't because of her leg still being taped on the armchair
(voice over) We've got to get out of here now
She eventually succeeds in kicking the wallet away from the armchair
And she keeps on stroking Hedra's hair, still crying on her lap
- Large overview of the city
There is still daylight, but we can tell, by the color of the sky, that we are getting closer to the night
-   - In the forefront, Mitchell's assistant, Barbara, is typing on the keyboard of a computer
Behind her, we see rows of dresses on hangers
Suddenly, the woman stares at the screen
We hear strange clicking and beeping noises coming from the computer
Jesus
She stands up, with horror in her face, and yells
Mitch
- '  - The room is much smaller, and quite dark
blonde woman is sitting on an armchair in front of a desk
Mitchell is standing behind her
Mitchell is slightly rocking the armchair and the blonde woman's eyes are closed
What
He doesn't stop rocking the armchair
(voice over from the main hall) Get in here
What
He reluctantly leaves the armchair and walks out of the room
-   - Mitchell crosses the hall What is it
What
The computer is still making strange beeping noises
On the screen, pictures of dresses appear and then disappear immediately
Look
Close up on the screen
data chart titled Fontana Fashions has appeared
The extreme left column is labelled Expenses, and underneath, a list of all the expenses (Lease - Telephone - Payroll - Liabilities
and son on)
The other columns on the right are labelled Jan to Apr, and underneath lists of numbers corresponding to the various monthly expenses
But, the data chart has hardly appeared on the screen that the columns of numbers start erasing themselves one by one, starting with January
It's erasing
Then, when all the numbers have been erased, a window appears on the screen with
written in red letters in it
Another data chart appears on the screen : the expenses from May to August
And, on this chart, the columns of numbers also start to erase themselves
Mitchell looks severely at Barbara
She raises her hands
didn't do anything
Suddenly, Mitchell seems to remember something
Shit
He runs away toward his office
The blonde woman is standing in the doorway of the office
Mitchell brutally pushes her away
- '  - Mitchell types something on the keyboard of his computer
We hear the computer beeping
Close-up on the computer screen
data chart titled Production line, and underneath Fontana Fashions Production Line
Underneath, four columns of numbers labelled Order, Sam, Scheduled and Completed
All the numbers in these columns are erasing themselves
And then appears the window with

(voice over) On mine, too
Then another rectangular window appears on the screen
On the left of the window, the drawing of a bomb with a lighted wick sticking out of it
On the rest of the window, the following text : The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is now past due
Please contact Allison Jones at 212-555-9814 within 24 Hours of the rest of your data will be irretrievably lost
Mitchell bends down to have a better look at the screen
Close up on the screen, while Mitchell reads out loud : (voice over) The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is past due
Please contact Allison Jones
Medium shot of Mitchell reading what's written on the screen

" Mitchell jumps up
Bitch
'  -   - Allison is seated behind Graham's desk
She unplugs the cord from the telephone set and plugs it in the back of a small portable computer
Shot on floor level
We see the bottom of the desk chair and Allison's legs, around which there is still some duct tape
Hedra is kneeling on the floor near the desk
She has a telephone cord in her hand
(voice over) Should  just plug this in the phone jack
(voice over) Huh-huh
Hedra gets up and looks at what Allison is doing with the computer
Great
Can you make reservations on this
Hm-m
And you can pay by credit card
Close up on Hedra's face who looks intensely at Allison, not believing completely that Allison is not trying to fool her
, right
Yeah
She walks away

Above her name, a logo that reads Concept Software
Under Allison's name, the title Software Designer, and underneath 768 West 74th Street, Suite 1103, New York, and underneath (212) 555-9814
On the top of the card, written with a pencil 555-8796
(voice over) No answer at the first number
Mitchell's forefinger points at the penciled number on the card
(voice over) What about this number
Mitchell is standing near Barbara's desk
She has the telephone receiver to her ear, trying to reach someone to help them
Mitchell brings the next desk telephone to him by pulling it by its cord
He start dialing on the telephone
We hear the engaged tone
Busy
He throws the receiver on the desk
He starts walking away, then turns to Barbara
You turn them off
(yelling) Turn them all off
Barbara remains calm, with the telephone receiver still at her ear
Mitchell runs out of the room, and Barbara puts the telephone down
'  -   - Close up on the computer screen
The window is titled Compuserve
Underneath it reads Flight Reservation
And underneath Browse Flights by Fares
Underneath : Departure City:
Next to it a box, where we see the letters  being typed
Underneath Destination City:
Next to it, another box, where we see the letters  being typed
Another window appears, titled Flight Information, and giving all the details of the different flights between New-York and Los Angeles
Allison is sitting at the desk typing on the computer, and Hedra is standing next to her
Things are going to be different in
, Allie
You'll see
First class
Is it worth it
Well, we can use one of Graham's cards
think  saw his wallet in the living room
Oh
Me too
Okay, 'll go and see
She gets out of the room
Close up on the computer screen
It switches from Flight Information to Main Menu, and then to Chat-Mail Menu
Close up on Allison's face focused on her typing on the computer
Close up on the computer screen
It reads  Simulator, and underneath Chat Mode Initiated, and underneath User: Don193
Underneath, we see the following words being typed : (voice over from the living room) can't find it
Allison is typing very fast
She knows she doesn't have much time
know  saw it somewhere
Maybe it's in the kitchen
Close up on the computer screen
The following words have been added : '  768
74TH ,
Back on Allison sitting at the desk and typing
Slowly and silently, Hedra enters the room
Close up on Hedra's angry face
She bends down Allison at the desk seen from behind
Suddenly we hear the noise of a plug being pulled off from its socket
The computer screen becomes all black and Allison turns quickly around
Hedra is pointing her gun at her
No
No
No
No
'  -   - Close up shot on the window above the elevator door
We see the elevator coming down
The camera follows the elevator down to floor level
Mitchell is waiting in front of the elevator door
The elevator outer door opens
Hedra is inside
She keeps the inner door shut
Going down
The outer door closes in front of a bewildered Mitchell
'  -  - Hedra opens the door of Allison's private cage, and enters the cage
She tries to open a suitcase, but doesn't succeed
She slaps nervously the suitcase
She then finds another suitcase, which is open
She tries to fit herself inside the suitcase, and more or less succeeds
She seems very nervous
She gets out of the suitcase, closes it and carries it out of the cage
'  -   - Close up on the numbers above the door
They go from 9 to 10, and then to 11
Hedra is watching the numbers
The elevator stops
The outer door opens
Mitchell is there, waiting for the elevator
He opens the inner door and comes in the cabin
The outer door closes automatically and the elevator cabin starts moving up again He looks at the control panel, where the 12th floor is lighted
Then he looks at Hedra, who looks back at him with a rather unwelcoming face
The elevator stops and Mitchell goes out first
'  -    '  - Through the windows, we can see that night has come
Mitchell goes out of the elevator, followed by Hedra pulling her suitcase behind her
Hedra goes directly to Graham's apartment
Mitchell first goes in the opposite direction, and then comes back towards Hedra
Oh
Excuse me, miss, is this 1203
Is Graham Knox at home
Hedra is now in front of Graham's door and puts the key in the keyhole
Mitchell has caught up with her, and is standing behind her
No, he's on a cruise
Actually, 'm looking for a woman Allison Jones
Do you know her
Hedra suddenly stops unlocking the door
Who are you
Mitchell Myerson
Hedra turns around to face Mitchell
She did a job for me
Oh
There's no one named Jones on this floor
Yeah,  know that
was just down at her apartment
But did contact her here once
Well, 'm the only one here and  never met her
So
You'll excuse me
She bends down to pick up the suitcase
Oh, sorry
Mitchell bends down to help her
He picks up the suitcase and looks at it
This is hers
You do know her
We hear a muffled scream coming from inside the apartment
Hedra opens the door to get inside as fast as possible, but Mitchell catches her and throws her aside
More muffled screams coming from the apartment
Mitchell rushes into the apartment, and closes the door shut behind him
Hedra rushes to the door, but too late
'  -   - Mitchell rushes into the room, stops and looks down
Allison is lying on the carpet, completely tied up in duct tape, looking like a human salami
She is gagged by another piece of tape
When she sees Mitchell, she starts wriggling and screaming through her gag
(voice over) What the fuck is going on here
He kneels down and tears the tape off her mouth
Be careful, she's crazy
Hedra enters the room, pointing her gun towards Mitchell
Get off of her
Mitchell, still kneeling down across Allison's body, turns around
What
Hedra walks towards him, still pointing her gun with both hands in front of her
You think she wants you touching her, huh
said get off her
Okay, okay
'm
'm getting up
Okay
He gets up very slowly with his hands raised at his shoulders level
And suddenly, he grabs the gun and throws Hedra across the room
She falls on a round table, which breaks under her weight
She remains motionless on the floor
Allison looks anxiously at the scene, but, from her lying position on the carpet, doesn't see everything
Mitchell puts the gun inside his belt and kneels down to untie Allison
Where is she
Don't worry about her,  took care of her
Hedra suddenly comes behind him, and strikes him very hard on the head with a statuette
He falls down on the floor
Hedra rushes to him and picks up the gun from his belt
She takes a cushion from the back of an armchair, puts the cushion on Mitchell's face and presses the barrel of the gun on the cushion
Allison screams
'  -  - Graham is lying in the empty bathtub, with his cat sleeping on his right shoulder
There are a few traces of blood on the side of the bathtub
We hear the muffled sound of a gun shot
Then a scream from Allison and another gunshot
The camera moves closer to Graham's face
He has a large bloody bump on his forehead
There is a slight move of his head, then a slight blink of his eyelids
'  -   - Close up on Hedra's hands taking some pills out of a medicine bottle
don't want to try to be loved any more
And you know
The camera moves up to Hedra's face
don't want to be scared any more
Or to kill any more don't want to kill any more
don't want to be alone any more
don't want to be anything any more
don't need a reason to kill myself,  need a reason not to and there isn't one
Hedra turns her head towards Allison sitting at the desk in front of the computer
The camera moves away to a larger shot, and we see that the gun is stuck in the hollow of Hedra's left elbow
You don't want to say anything special to anyone
Allison shakes her head no
Okay, Allison Jones, go on
Close up on the computer screen
We see the words Hedra just dictated :  don't want to try to be loved
and so on up to there isn't one
The words Allison Jones are being typed
Back to Hedra pointing her gun to Allison
She takes Allison's hand and presses it on the screen of the computer
Now they'll know it was you
No one who knows me will believe that  wrote that
was never that scared
Well
not like that
Of course it's you
never met anyone so scared of being alone
And  saved you from that, but you don't care
She brings a glass of water to Allison, who takes it
Did you know that identical twins are never really identical
There's always one that's prettier
And the one who's not does all the work
She used me and then she left me
Just like you
She puts the barrel of the gun on Allison's temple, and she opens her left hand in front of Allison's face
Come on
take them
Come on, Allie, it's nicer this way
Okay
Close up on Hedra's hand full of blue pills
She pours them into Allison's left hand
Allison's other hand still holds the glass of water
Without warning, Allison suddenly smashes the glass on Hedra's face
Then the two girls start fighting for the gun
Allison slams Hedra's hand on a mirror hanging on the wall
The glass of the mirror breaks into small pieces, but Hedra doesn't drop the gun
The two girls keep on fighting on the floor, knocking various object around them
Close up of Allison's hand holding Hedra's hand with the gun, and smashing it through the window
The pane breaks into small pieces, and Hedra drops the gun on the balcony
Hedra moves away from Allison
Close up of Allison's hand picking up a piece of glass lying near the gun on the balcony
Allison slashes Hedra's chest with the broken piece of glass
Hedra falls on the floor and Allison rushes out of the room
Hedra gets up and picks up the gun from the balcony
'  -  - Allison is fumbling with the locks and the safety bar of the front door
Hedra rushes into the corridor, pointing her gun at Allison
Allie
Allison has opened the door and turns around to face Hedra
Hedra walks slowly along the corridor towards Allison
Please
Allison still has the piece of broken glass in her hand
Behind Hedra, we see Graham moving in the bathroom
Please
Reverse angle shot to Allison standing in the open doorway and holding the piece of broken glass
'm not like your sister, Hedy
Not any more
'm like you now
Close up on the barrel of the gun
Graham rushes out of the bathroom, grabs Hedra by the waist and falls with her on the floor
(voice over) Graham
Graham bangs Hedra's head repeatedly on the floor
Hedra succeeds in moving slightly away from him, and try to point her gun toward him
'll kill you
Allison rushes towards them, grabs Hedra by her feet, and pulls her towards the front door
Hedra, still lying on her stomach while being pulled away by Allison, still tries desperately to point her gun towards Graham
Get off him
Allison succeeds in pulling Hedra out of the apartment
Hedra grabs the front door with both hands to try to resist Allison's pull
'  -    '  - Allison pulls a little harder, and Hedra's hands are squeezed by the door
She screams
Allison lets go of Hedra's legs to close the door shut
Graham, stay inside
(voice over from inside the apartment) All right
Allison runs away towards the elevator
Hedra, still lying on the floor, raises her gun towards Allison and shoots
Allison screams : she's been shot in the left shoulder
Hedra shoots again, but Allison hides behind the corner of the wall of the hall
Hedra gets up to run after Allison
Close up on the elevator
Allison is already inside the cabin and closes the inner door just as Hedra reaches the elevator
'  -   - No
No
No
Allison pulls Hedra right arm through the vertical bars of the inner door, and opens it again, squeezing Hedra's arm very hard
Hedra screams and drops her gun on the cabin floor
Allison closes the inner door shut
Close up of Allison's hand picking the gun up from the floor
No
No
No
Hedra watches the outer door closing slowly
Allison points the gun towards Hedra and presses the trigger several times
But nothing happens : there are no more cartridge in the chamber of the gun
Hedra opens the inner door to get into the elevator
Allison tries to prevent her from getting in, but Hedra eventually succeeds in getting into the cabin
She closes the inner door, and the outer door closes itself automatically
Hedra throws Allison against the wall of the cabin
Then she bangs her head very hard against the wall
Allison pulls Hedra away from her
Hedra hits the wall on the other side of the cabin, and falls on the floor
Allison rushes and falls on Hedra, but Hedra pushes her away from her
The two girls start fighting in the cabin
They fall on the floor, Hedra on top of Allison
Hedra tries to strangle Allison
Close up of Allison's face choking under the pressure of Hedra's hands
Short reverse angle close up shot of Hedra's face, then back to Allison's face
Close up on the screwdriver hanging from its chain and rocking gently with the movement of the elevator
Allison's hand tries to catch it and doesn't succeed
Back on Allison's face, suffocating more and more under Hedra's strangulation
Back, for a couple of seconds, to Allison's hand trying to catch the screwdriver, and then back to her suffocating face
Close up on Allison's hand which has eventually caught the screwdriver, then back to her face
The face slowly relaxes as Allison falls into unconsciousness
Her arm, which was extended to catch the screwdriver, falls on the floor of the cabin
Hedra watches Allison's face intently
Then, when she realizes that Allison is unconscious, she bends down and kisses her on the cheek
She brings Allison's both arms along Allison's sides, then she puts her head on her chest and kisses her hand
'  -  - The outer door of the elevator opens, and, through the vertical bars of the inner door, we can see Allison still lying on her back on the floor of the cabin
Hedra opens the inner door, then pulls Allison by the legs out of the elevator
(snorting under the effort of pulling Allison) Huh
Huh
She pulls Allison along the corridor of the basement
She reaches the door opening on the emergency staircase, and kicks it shut
She suddenly stops and looks intently at Allison lying on the floor
She grabs a green blanket on a shelf and wraps Allison's face in it
She pushes a a heavy metallic storage shelves cabinet along the wall all the way to the emergency staircase door, in order to prevent it from being opened by anyone coming from the staircase
Then she pulls down a big lever on the wall on the side of the cage where the elevator machinery is enclosed
We supposed it is the emergency switch of the elevator, and that she also wants to prevent anyone coming down to the basement from using the elevator
'  -   - Hedra picks up some pieces of dry wood from a wheelbarrow and puts them inside the incinerator, where some flames are still burning
'  -  - Hedra pushes the empty wheelbarrow along the corridor of the basement
Suddenly she stops, drops the wheelbarrow and emits a short scream
Reverse angle shot on the green blanket on the floor
Allison is gone
Hedra looks very worried
Allie
She runs to the blanket, but doesn't stop and keeps on running to the elevator
She gives a quick look inside the open cabin, then tries to open a large locked gate, near the elevator, but doesn't succeed
(yelling) Allie
She goes back along the corridor the way she came from
Near the place where she left the wheelbarrow, she comes to a door marked Storage, and opens it Hey, here you are
But this is just a closet full of various junk
Hedra thinks she heard something and quickly turns around
She takes a big iron hook from the storage closet and starts walking menacingly along the corridor
Don't make me come get you
Allie, come out now
Come on
Allie
She bangs the hook on a vertical pipe on the wall
Close up on a rat scuttling away from the noise
Close up on Allie hidden in a big metal box, near the ceiling of the basement
This metal box is obviously a part of the ventilation system
(voice over) Come on
The rat is running along a large horizontal pipe towards Allison, who seems frightened by it
High angle shot of Hedra seen from Allison's hiding place
(screaming) Come out now
Close up on Allison's face, frightened by the rat
Reverse angle close up shot of the rat coming towards us and Allison
Back to Allison looking at the rat
(voice over) Allie, please
High angle shot of Hedra
She is crying
'm scared
Where are you
The rat has reached Allison's hiding place
She pushes it down from the pipe where it was standing
The rat falls on Hedra's shoulder
She screams
Allison hides back into the ventilation metal box not to be seen by Hedra
Hedra throws the rat on the floor
The rat runs away
Hedra looks up at the place where the rat fell from
Close up at Allison's hiding place
The metal box seems empty
(voice over) Allie
'  -   - Hedra comes back into the incinerator room
Just above the open door of the incinerator, there is a big ventilation metal box, similar to the one Allison is hiding in
Hedra bangs the box with her hook
She must think that Allison is crawling inside the ventilation system
'  -  - Allison is peeking from behind a corner of the corridor
Reverse angle shot showing what Allison sees
We - and she - see the incinerator room with Hedra banging her hook on the ventilation system
'  -   - Hedra is walking backward, away from the incinerator
She hears a strange noise and turns around
'  -  - We see the open door of a cage slightly moving with a squeaking noise
Hedra walks toward the cage
Why are you hiding from me
Close up on a big wooden closet with two doors
piece of green fabric is sticking out between the two closed doors
Hedra bangs her hook on the closet
You think  can't find you
Huh
Your goddam shirt is sticking out of it
She opens the door, sees herself in a mirror at the back of the closet, and thinking it's Allison, bangs her hook on the mirror and breaks it
Hedra backs up one step from the closet
And suddenly, Allison, who was hiding in the pipework on the ceiling, falls down upside down, hanging from her legs hooked in the pipework
She stabs Hedra in the back with the elevator screwdriver
Hedra screams, and tries to take the screwdriver off her back
Allison drops on the floor
Hedra tries to hit her with the hook, but Allison grabs her arm
With her other free hand, Allison pulls the screwdriver out of Hedra's back, then immediately sticks it again in another place on Hedra's back
Allie
Hedra slowly falls on the floor, where she remains motionless
Allison looks down at her, trying to catch her breath back
She kneels down to close Hedra's eyelids
(voice over) cried the whole week of Sam's funeral
'   -   - This is Allison's new place
Actually it is the apartment Allison visited with Sam, just before the puppy's death
Some furniture from the old apartment, and a lot of unopened boxes on the floor
It looks like if Allison just moved in
Very large windows overlooking New-York
Allison is standing near one of the windows, with her back toward us
(voice over) Graham says that won't bring him back
He says  have to start letting go
He's right
Close up on Hedra's collection of photographs, lying near the shoebox where she used to stock them
In the forefront, the black and white picture of Hedra and her twin sister holding a dog between them
(voice over) Hedy's parents said that for years they'd tried to explain her that her sister's death wasn't her fault
We see Allison's hands taking the pictures one by one
(voice over) But she never forgave herself for surviving
The last picture she takes is the black and white picture of the twins with the dog
She puts all the pictures back in the shoebox, with the twins and dog picture on the top
(voice over) So every day,  try to forgive Hedy for Sam
Allison puts the lid back on the shoebox
(voice over) Then  try to do what she couldn't
Forgive myself
The camera moves slowly away from the shoebox to a last photograph hidden underneath some wrapping plastic material
(voice over) know what can happen to someone who doesn't
Close up on the picture
It looks like the picture of the face of one woman
But actually, the picture is a mixture of two pictures
The left half-side of the picture shows Allison's face, when the right half-side shows Hedra's face
The credit are rolling up on the picture of Hedra / Allison for about 25 seconds, then fade-out to black screen, where the end of the credits are rolling up
