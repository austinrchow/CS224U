Draft November 1, 1987 : 1 The screen is composed of large, straight-edge areas of black and white that rest against each other in a manner that suggests some kind of pattern, without making a final sense; it is as if we are too close to something that, could we see it from a distance, would be clear to us
These areas shift and change - both their own shape and their relationship to their neighbors
New patterns are being made, new solutions found - but they are just beyond our comprehension
The effect should be aesthetically pleasing but simultaneously frustrating and, perhaps, a little unsettling
Shortly into this sequence, and subsequently inter-cut throughout, we begin to see, in , the story of Arriving first as very short shock-images, these brief sections eventually convey to the audience all the necessary emotional and narrative information they will need to understand the background to
Meanwhile, the black and white shapes are still moving, the unseen patterns still shifting
Over this constantly mobile background, the  begin to appear
As the  unroll, another change comes over the puzzle pieces behind them
Where before they moved and related only in two dimensions, gradually we see that they are now claiming depth as well
The puzzle we are looking at is now a three-dimensional one
The pieces are now solid blocks of various geometric shapes, locking together, moving apart, finding their final position
Finally, as the  come to their conclusion, the camera pulls back until we can see clearly what we have been looking at
As the final piece clicks into positions we see it is from
The closed box rests before our eyes a moment and then the circle in the centre of the side that faces us gives way to an image of a dusty street with a market
Simultaneous to this, the camera into this image until it fills the screen 2 The  continues up through the market and then turns through the stalls to find a store behind them
As we  through the store's doorway, we pass through a beaded curtain that momentarily reminds us of the   in
3 Once we are in the store itself, though, this impression disappears
It is an ordinary, slightly seedy, junk shop
The stall seems to sell an odd mixture of items; native trinkets share space with second-hand items from European colonists
These second-hand goods give us some sense of period
They suggest the late 'twenties/early 'thirties
This is reinforced by the sounds coming from one of them, an old-fashioned mahogany-cased wireless
foreign voice speaks from it in a language we don't understand, though perhaps the words " world service" are discerned in the middle, and then a dance-hall tune of the period begins to play
(Depending on availability, it would be nice to have something relevant - ''ll follow my Secret Heart', perhaps, or 'Dancing in the Dark'
) Into shot comes an
His uniform, too, suggests the 'twenties, the last days of Empire
He is tall, thin, and dark-haired, but at no stage do we see his face clearly
He stands in front of the stall
The  suddenly stands behind the counter
He has been crouched beneath it, as if checking or preparing something
He is a big, impressive-looking black man
His face is totally impassive as he stares at his customer
Neither of the men speak
Obviously, a deal has already been struck and today is the pay-off
The , a little arrogantly - suggesting racist contempt, slaps down a bag of gold on the stall's counter
Keeping his eyes firmly on the , he reaches beneath him and brings something up from under the counter and places it In the ' outstretched hand
He is holding a The  turns and leaves
The camera  out of the store, looking at the  as he watches the departing
4        ' It is typical of temporary military quarters, complete with a curved ceiling of corrugated material
It is stripped of furniture
The blinds are down
The , still in uniform, sits cross-legged, the  held before him
He is already well into the solving process and very soon after the shot begins the  begins to speed its own solution
Finally, two sections of the  shoot upwards and begin to peel apart from each other, ready to reveal its secret
The , suddenly nervous, drops the  and scuttles back across the floor to stare at it
The  lands upright, its extended parts still open above it
For a beat of two, nothing happens
We become aware of the ' pulse, throbbing excitedly on the soundtrack
5        '         '
Slowly we, the camera, and the , move towards the still, silent, but menacing
We approach it until finally we are above it, looking down into the opening it has made in itself
There is undefined movement inside
Suddenly, something flies up directly at us
We glimpse it only briefly, but enough to see its nature
Unlike the hooks that flaw at  in , this is more organic than metallic
Pink and flesh-like but on a long gray-blue stalk, it flies upward, its lips peeling apart gapingly to reveal scores of yellow, discoloured, and viciously sharp teeth-like hooks
The  screams and the screen begins to take on a red tint so that, just as the thing is about to fill the screen with its hungry mouth, the entire screen turns red
The red screen is held for a second and then suddenly becomes complete blackness
6 The black screen continues and, rising slowly from it and falling back slowly into it, in a dream-like, surrealistic manner, come various images of the ' torment/pleasure in Hell
By various camera tricks, such as step-printing or optical blurring, his face is still not clearly seen, but is seen enough for us to see his sensual, almost orgasmic responses to what is being done to him
Cuts appear spontaneously across his face, leaving a grid like crisscross pattern of wounds
Finally, a disembodied hand gripping a hammer drives nails into each corner formed by these wounds and, as the face comes into full view for the first time, we realize who this is
It is from
' completed face floats on the blackness and stares out at us
(echoed & slow) Kirsty, come to daddy The tiny silence following 's words is shattered by a piercing and terrified scream
7 The scream continues, but the blackness is replaced by 's anguished face; it is she who is screaming
The scream subsides, replaced by breathless panting accompanied by rapid eye movement
(off camera) Ah, you're awake
Good
We pull out to see that  is sitting up, fully dressed, on a hospital bed
, a police detective, sits on a plain wooden chair, which is the only other piece of furniture in the room
The walls are bare save for a piece of primitive art on one wall, and, on another, a circular barred window looking out
stands up and walks to the foot of the bed
He rests his hand on the bed's metal frame and smiles a perfunctory smile
Tell you what - we'll make a deal
'll tell you what know, then you tell me what you know
is still re-orienting herself
She blinks a few times and then focuses on 's hands gripping the bed
looks up at 's face and then around at the room
Where am
You're in the Malahide Institute
It's a psychiatric hospital
But, hey, don't feel judged - it was just the nearest place to bring you
Remember
You and your boyfriend
Steve
Don't worry
He's
We sent him home hours ago
Jeez, what a story
He puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it
What was it, kid
Smack
Angel dust
Don't tell me acid's back in fashion
What are you talking about
Who are you
Oh, excuse me
reaches in his jacket and flashes an
Ronson
Homicide
'm this district's slash and dash expert
Made a career of the nasty ones
That's why  was at your Dad's house
Jesus, what a mess
' eyes prick with tears
She looks away from
(to herself) Daddy
8 , a  , shifts some unpacked crates to allow a closer look at the shriveled and deformed corpse of one of  and ' victims
Jesus
prods at the corpse with his night-stick, attempting to turn it over
stream of maggots pours from the mouth and the cavity that used to be its throat
jumps back in disgust and knocks against one of the several wardrobes in the cluttered room
Another corpse flies out at him, as decayed and flvblown as the first
draws his gun and empties it blowing the corpses head off, scattering flesh, mucus, and bone - but no blood - everywhere before realizing it is already dead
He realises what he has done and lowers his weapon sheepishly
Oh
shit
9 is sitting back in the chair, looking at the now slightly calmer
We got two missing people and a house full of corpses
He holds out his hand towards  in a theatrical manner
Talk to me
swings her legs off the bad, but remains sitting on it, her feet on the floor
She doesn't look directly at  but begins to take in the (few) details of the room for the first time
thought Steve had talked to you
Oh, pardon me
obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value
No, talk to me
But - do me a favor
- none of this  crap
closes her eyes, almost wincing, as memory comes
opens her eyes
Consciously, she slows the rhythm of the dialogue down
He talked about Demons, huh
Yeah
turns her head to look directly at
It's true
All of it
It's all true
stares at her, impressed by her conviction and intensity
There is a second of shared silence
Suddenly, a shocking   shatters the mood starts, then realises it is the radio at his belt
He snatches it up and speaks into it
Ronson
10 Another , , is standing, radio in hand, by the blood-stained mattress
stands beside him, gun now safely re-holstered
Kucich here,sir
We just found another one, though it suffered a little
looks at , who looks embarrassed
er, accidental damage in discovery
Anyway, just about the only portable evidence we've got here - apart from human remains - is the mattress
Looks like someone was messed up real bad on it
11 (off-camera) Can we send it downtown
throws  a look of exasperation with his colleague
The camera stays on 's face as  speaks
What the hell are you asking me for
Tag it
Move it
(to herself) The mattress
The mattress
Without waiting for a reply,  switches the radio off and clips it back to his belt
12          55 We are looking at the mattress
has left the room
draws a pad from his packet
The pad is stapled, and the staple has been badly inserted and is not closed property
In the act of tearing a label from the pad,  catches his thumb on the staple
Shit
The label is adhesive-backed
licks it and presses it on the mattress
He writes on it - 55L/E1
As he stands up from doing this, a single drop of blood from his thumb lands on the mattress
(It is important that we see it is only a single drop - and nothing like the amount  spilled on the floorboards
) leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him move the mattress
We move in to see the drop of blood disappear very quickly into the mattress, as if it is being sucked in
As this happens, we hear on the soundtrack the faintest
13 somewhat antiquated and frightening operating room, filled with machines, monitors, and surgical instruments
The corners of the room fall away to shadow
Sitting upright in the centre of the room is a
She is awake and staring out at the camera
Twin probes/clamps are in each of her ears to hold her in place
Her head is shaved and the skin on the back of her head has been cut open and peeled apart
The flaps of the skin are held away from the area being worked on by four clamps
(we never actually see round to the exposed brain itself) Immediately behind her, and probing with professional skill and coolness into her exposed brain, is
He is in his late forties and looks like all the great doctors look - rational, civilized, competent, and powerful
There is an intensity in his eyes and the lines  of his face though that suggests something more than normal
The room has several attentive listeners and observers, but the one nearest to  is his personal student/assistant , young, conventionally good-looking, with an open, friendly, face
is holding forth on the secrets of his trade, several times looking away from his patient while still working on her, to make sure his audience understand his points
We can bring them back properly more often than scientific orthodoxy dictates, ladies and gentlemen
And the knife, far from the enemy of of analysis, is often its greatest ally in solving the puzzles of psychosis
Analysis isolates and massages
Surgery pinpoints and corrects
though you've got to know what you're doing, of course
Polite laughter from several students
Some things are obvious
Here, for example,
He prods in at a specific area
are the optical motor nerve control centers
The  begins to blink in time with ' prodding
The affect is half-comical, half-distressing
Perhaps carries it on just that half-second too long for innocent demonstration
But the students give impressed murmurs anyway
Now
This case
deeply-buried psychosis severe enough to produce frighteningly frequent hysteria and aggression
Incurable
Say others
Not so
Analysis isolates
The knife exposes
Medication controls
As he speaks,  injects a syringe directly into the 's brain
Her face spasms momentarily
stands back slightly
His face is serene, calm, and confident
He takes a small, motorised drill and sets to work on the brain
And then, ladies and gentlemen, we With all the care and knowledge that our years of training have given us
He looks around at them all, smiling slightly
The students murmur their approval
Perhaps they even applaud
acknowledges their reaction with a modest nod
Suddenly, an intercom on the wall cuts in
Dr
Malahide, the new arrival is awake, and appears very distressed
steps back briskly and begins to peel his cloves off
He nods at a nearby student
My part in this is over
You may tidy up for me
Kyle, you come with me
and  leave the room
14 has her hands over her face and is shaking
stands and crosses to her
He takes her hand from her face and calms her
Easy, easy
Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now
saw it
him
But  got away
And  took the box
And  solved it
And they came
Who
The Cenobites
She stares directly at , daring him to disbelieve
The Demons
stares back, perhaps a glimmer of belief in his eyes
On the soundtrack, the sudden and shocking sound of a door being slammed open and hitting the wall
screams
Even  is startled
In the doorway are   and
advances into the room, smiling apologetically as he does so
Sorry
Must get that door fixed
Detective Ronson
holds his hand out, as  nods in response
am Doctor Malahide
The man shake hands
gestures behind him
My assistant, Kyle Macrae
And this must be Kirsty
speaks quickly, as if to get the formalities out of the way
As he says her name, he smiles benignly at  who, still distraught from her memories and shocked at the slamming of the door, simply stares at him
turns his attention back to , drawing him away and speaking to him in a lower voice
Meanwhile,  walks over to  and smiles at her - long enough to embarrass her into smiling back
've read the boy's statement
Quite the adventure they believe they had
'd like to talk to her alone
Do you think
looks over his shoulder at
He then looks carefully at  and then nods slowly
Mmmm
Frankly,  think she's more your territory than mine
Shame
looks back at
Kirsty
Doctor Malahide's going to look after you now
Maybe we could talk some more tomorrow
nods vaguely and then, just as  reaches the door, calls out to him
Wait
The mattress
You've got to destroy it
She  on it, you see
The mattress
It's haunted now
She can come back
like Frank
smiles helplessly at her, then glances at  with a "you see what  mean" expression, and leaves the room
(to herself) The mattress
stares at her briefly, with a strange expression on his face and then abruptly follows  through the door
is too absorbed to notice this odd behavior, but stares incredulously as  leaves the room
Uh
excuse me a moment
He follows to the door and stands in the doorway, looking down the corridor
15 stands before a set of double-doors, talking to a comes into view, walking swiftly, and instantly talks over their conversation
Detective
'll be able to help this girl
But  need your assistance
16 Looking back at the corridor, we see the door to ' room ajar, and  standing by it looking down
17             ('
) of  and
, and we, are too far away to hear what is said, but  in nodding and gesturing emphatically, as if persuading  of something
18 returns into the room and closes the door
His expression is puzzled, troubled
Then he remembers there is a patient here and he smiles
So
You're Kirsty, huh
You a doctor, too
smiles again
Nearly a doctor
'm Kyle Macrae
Call me Kyle
draws a deep breath, temporarily calmed
She even manages a smile
Hi, Kyle
re-enters the room
Now, Kirsty
looks at him warily
The cop
He didn't believe me
suspect not
But that doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong, does it
Do you believe me
offers a re-assuring laugh
Well,  don't know yet
However, you're not lying
believe this is the truth
It  the truth
Suddenly, the door opens again
An  is standing there
For the briefest of moments,  looks furious and then, catching himself, assumes his calm demeanor
Well
Sorry, Dr
Malahide
But it's Tiffany
She's escaped
again
sighs
Very Well
He looks down at
'm sorry, Kirsty
Kyle will come back with something to help you sleep
We shall speak tomorrow
and  follow the intern from the room,  giving a last friendly smile as the door closes behind them
19 We are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival
On either side, stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their locked doors and tarpaulin-draped entrances deny
light rain is falling
huge wooden cut-out of a grinning clown dominates one stall while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the whole place;  ''
Another has a banner proclaiming  , with the subheading '
On the horizon in the distance, almost denying the reality of what we are seeing, tower vast cranes of unimaginable height while beyond them impossibly huge oil-drums squat against the moon-bright but cloudy sky
Into shot, and running down the midway, comes a girl,
is a girl in her early teens but looks younger then her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over- delicate features
For the last months,  has been finding ways out of the institute and making her way here, where she has one special obsession, which we will soon see
Following her into shot, but many yards behind, come two from the Institute
They contrast each other almost comically, one being tall and plump while the other is smaller and thinner
They're not quite the Stan and Ollie of the medical world but with some serious rehearsal they could get there
1st Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it
Even as the first  says this, we see  make a sharp left turn into a stall entrance
20 front view of the stall into which  has run
The large sign above it proclaims '  ' and a smaller sign perched above a distorting mirror to one side of the entrance says ''  '
The two  enter at a run
21 There follows a hopelessly one-sided pursuit through the mirror maze as  effortlessly eludes the two
There are three major facets to this sequence; 1) Comic relief - as the two interns make fools of themselves
There could even be a room of distorting mirrors where the thin becomes fat and the fat one thin
2) ' ease and expertise with patterns and puzzles
3) Confusion of the audience's sense of the real and the unreal
This goes on long enough for us to realise the 1ST  was right to worry, how long  could elude them
Then, jarringly, as the screen is full of reflected there suddenly appears amongst them a single image of Everything stops
The image of  (and we shouldn't he sure yet if we're looking at a reflection or the real man) puts its hands out, palms up
Tiffany
Come
All the  move quietly toward him until they all disappear from view
Then the real  comes into shot, her back to us, and walks toward what we now see to be the real , who is standing in a doorway deliberately framed like a mirror to confuse the customers
places her hands docilely on to 's outstretched ones
22 has been dozing fitfully, but is awakened by strange noises
At first terrified, she slowly realises it is simply someone being put in the room next door
She waits until activity has ceased and then moves to her door
It is unlocked
She moves out into the corridor
23 Looking warily from side to side,  edges out into the corridor, along it, and then stops by the door of the adjoining room
24
'
hand fits a piece of jig-saw puzzle into the space it belongs
We know it is a jig-saw by the shape of the pieces, but it is clearly not the conventional type - a picturesque photo - because all we can see at this close-up angle are large areas of black and white
25
' We now see that the puzzle is on the floor of a room of a similar size to '
It is slightly more decorated; It has curtains and wallpaper
And a tiled floor
Sitting cross-legged on the floor next to the puzzle is
The puzzle, which we can now see more clearly, is an intricate abstract design in black and white
There are several pieces still un-fitted but  is working steadily, efficiently, and with complete concentration
On a wall behind her there is a visual record of her progress over the last few months
Sealed in plastic by staff members are
Puzzles she has solved, with dates marking her advancement
They begin with the simplest wood block animals usually given to very small children
passing through photo-puzzles of increasing difficulty, and culminating in one or two other examples of the kind of complicated pattern-work she is involved in now
26 We pull out to see that this is '
from the glass panel in the door of ' room
looks up at one point and eye-contact is made gives a tentative smile and a small wave
stares at her
The stare is long but unresponsive and finally  returns to the puzzle
has her back to us and the camera is quite close in when a hand suddenly moves into shot and touches her shoulder
jumps back in alarm, fear on her face
But it is only raises his hand in apology
Oh, Jesus, 'm sorry
God, if anyone should know not to do that, it's me
'm sorry
nods and gives a nervous smile
, still embarrassed by his foolishness and eager to change the subject, nods towards the glass panel
Sad, huh
She's been here six months
Her name's
What's the matter with her
Almost complete withdrawal
She hasn't said a word for nearly two years
God, that's terrible
Yeah
Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though
Says it's helping to bring her out
ushers  back into her own room
27 As he closes the door to 's room,  reaches into the pocket of his lab-coat and produces a small box of pills
Anyway, let's concentrate on you for a moment
Wanna suck on this for me
looks up at him sharply
He is proffering a pill and grinning facetiously
Hey, good joke, Kyle
Do you always come on to the mentally ill
's face falls
He blushes
Pressing the pills into 's hand, he backs off to the door, apologising
Shit
Sorry
Here's the pills
Red face
Door
Bye
He exits hurriedly, closing the door behind him
grins despite herself
She looks at the pill for a second or two and then puts it firmly back in the box
Realising there is no bedside table, she puts the box on the wooden chair
Jesus, 'm glad 'm not paying for this place
She is about to lie down on the bed, when she senses something is wrong in the room
is instantly tense again
She swings her head to the side and tenses in horror, stifling a scream
In the corner of the room, against the wall lying in a pool of blood, is her skinned father
emits a pained moan of pure anguish as she realises what she is looking at
(under her breath) Daddy
The thing in the corner raises its arm weakly from its side and begins to write on the wall in its own blood
It writes :    ;
covers her eyes with her hands and begins to sob
takes her hands from her eyes
The figure has gone
The pool of blood has disappeared
But, on the wall the words remain
makes herself rise from the bed and walk slowly across the room
Her eyes full of tears, she stretches out her arm and touches the word ''
As her fingers make contact, the words instantly disappear
She presses her bloodied finger quickly to her lips before that last trace of her father can vanish, too
28
' is still sitting up cross-legged, weeping
Her puzzle is completed
29 Basically an establishing shot to show it is the next morning but it also serves to show  walking briskly to work
His suit is tasteful and simple, but discreetly expensive-looking
He walks with purpose and looks straight ahead, acknowledging only with polite nods the respectful greetings of various and  he passes on his way
He enters the institute
We should also see several patients being walked, or wheeled, around by  during this shot
(off-camera) And how are we feeling today
30 This is a large, traditional hospital ward with a line of beds down each long wall and a wide central aisle
Nearly all of the beds are occupied and, at the far end of the ward, there is a male patient in a wheelchair
All the ' eyes turn immediately and happily to as he crosses the room, continuing his speech
Better
Good
He-doesn't stop his progress but walks straight through the room and into the corridor
As the door closes behind him the   scowls
/ 105 years and he still doesn't know my name
31 walks swiftly down the corridor in which we saw him talk to  earlier, but this time the camera follows him through the double doors and further down the corridor
He enters an elevator and the doors close in front of him
32 exits the elevator into a lower corridor, one not so carefully decorated
We are in the area in which the more deeply disturbed of the Institute's patients live
The rooms are smaller, closer together, and there is an observation panel set in each door
looks into the first four rooms
In the first, a middle-aged, overweight woman sits completely motionless in the middle of the floor
She is dressed in a shapeless white robe and is sitting crosslegged
Her head is shaven, her eyes are rolled completely up into the sockets so that only white shows
In the second, a very thin man of about thirty is pressed as tight as he can be into one corner of the room
His hair is long and he has a full beard
He is naked but not unadorned - his body and much of his cell wall is smeared in excrement
In the third, a man of about ' age-stands in the centre of the room
He is of normal build but his head is shaved
His face, scalp, and hands are covered in self-inflicted and amaterurish tattoos- all of crosses
He is dressed in -shirt and jeans
With both hands he holds aloft a silver crucifix, pointing it in all directions, as if under constant siege by Devils
He mutters prayers and invocations constantly
In the fourth, a man in his early twenties restrained in a strait-jacket
He shuffles around on the call-floor, his eyes twitching and flitting from one part of his body to another
(muttering) Get them off me
Get them off me
Off-camera, we hear the sound of 's sobbing - which bridges the  : 33 enters, having heard  crying
She is sitting with her legs over the side of the bed with her face in her hands
immediately sits next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder
He doesn't force her to speak
He lets her let the tears out
Finally, she looks up
had a visitor
What
Oh, Jesus
can't explain
It's it's
don't know how to help
have to save him and don't know how to help
(Carefully) Kirsty, 'm sorry
don't understand
know
No-one can
But  have to save him
Where's the other doctor
He said He'd listen
He promised
responds quickly to this
His faith in  is strong, despite that curious incident of the previous night when followed  out of the room
Dr
Malahide
Yes
Look, 'll fetch him
You take it easy
'm sure he can help
stands up, making soothing motions with his hands, and heads for the door
Help
No, no-one can help just want someone to listen or   go crazy
If anyone can help,  can
turns and gives  a strange look as he opens the door
Yeah
He got a ticket to Hell
34 We  with  down the corridor, eventually reaching an impressive door, which is slightly ajar
Even before we reach it, we hear 's voice
He is clearly on the phone
Because of the nature of what he is hearing,  pauses when he reaches the door, listening with a confused expression on his face
(off-camera & gradually fading up) Officer Kucich
Yes, Doctor Malahide
You've spoken to Ronson
Yes
That's right
The mattress
No, 'll meet you by the side entrance
No, no, my
Yes, let me make that clear
The house,  the hospital
Yes
Fine, and thank you
We hear the phone click
waits a moment and then walks swiftly through the door, speaking as he does so
Doctor Malahide
35 ' face fills the screen
Her voice is slightly dreamy, as if she is still trying to understand herself the story she is about to tell
It must have been going on forever
Her voice trails off
We pull out to see  sitting up on her bed
on the wooden chair, and  standing by the door
's voice pulls her back
Kirsty
snaps back and continues to speak in a more normal voice
But the part  know about, That must have started with my Uncle Frank
Then let us speak of it
36
's We  in slowly towards a modern house that we will learn is ', up the drive, towards the front door
37
' The  continues along the hallway and into the 38 The  continues
The room is dim, lit only by stray shafts of moonlight
On the floor in the centre of the room is the mattress
The  stops
main light is clicked on and  moves into shot
pours himself a scotch from the decanter that sits on the writing table and approaches the mattress
He is clearly very, excited
He walks around the mattress two or three times, never taking his eyes off it
He walks back to the writing table, throws his drink back, puts the glass down and leaves the room
39
' leaves through his front door and walks toward the hospital
40 After a few seconds silence we hear a repeated clicking sound, as if something is being forced, followed by a louder snap and the sound of a sash window being opened
The curtains balloon inwards, part, and  steps into the room
He stands still for a moment, as if making sure he is alone, and then begins to take in his surroundings
The room is entirely devoted to ' secret obsession - with the Paranormal in general and the Lament Configuration in particular
It is a fair-sized, square shaped room
Prints, paintings, and photographs cover the walls
All of these pictures relate in some way to his obsession; photographs of ghost-sightings; portraits of magicians from Cagliostro to Crowley; prints of arcane symbols and pentagrams, etc
Specifically, we recognize a print that resembles very closely the jigsaw he has had  recently solve
Also, there are framed diagrams (which look very old) of the Lament Configuration -Both open and closed
On a long, low table there are three glass cases
In each of these cases is a Lament Configuration
On each case is a small label giving a location, a date of acquisition, and a number - which we may assume to be the number of deaths attributable to that specific box
These labels read:           3/4/'59 7 6/2/'72 4 12/3/'81 5 There are also, on a small desk-top bookshelf on a writing table, editions of ' own books
He seems to have spent his career publicly denying what he is privately obsessed with - because the books titles include 'Possession: Not Demons but Disease','The Myth of the Diabolic', and 'The Internal Inferno'
Jesus Christ
Jee-sus-kerr-ist
We assume he has visited ' house before, but he has clearly never seen this room
He stares at the mattress with incredulity, as if he still can't believe his superior has had it brought here
Then he begins to look around the room in more detail
He approaches the glass cases and bends slightly to look at their contents
shakes his head
Oh, shit
41 walks past a bank of meters and huge circuit breakers on his way to the lower and of the corridor, by the cells of the very disturbed
He stops by the cell of the man in the strait-jacket
We hear from the outside the familiar muttering of enters the call
42
' As  enters,  looks at him
His eyes demand, not plead, and he speaks through clenched teeth
Get them off me
Get
Them
Off
Me
43 is rooting through the drawers in the writing table
Generally the contents are unremarkable - handwritten notes, a few patients case-files etc
- but in one of the drawers he finds a black ring-binder which he takes out and lays on the table
It is a book of faces
There are about fifteen sheets in the binder
Some of them are genuine photographic prints, some photocopies of original photos
They range widely in age, race, and sex
They are all full-face portraits
Chronologically, the range is extensive too
Some pictures (generally photocopies) appear to date from the earliest days of photography, the late 1880's, others have an Edwardian appearance, or suggest the 1920's
Only one or two seem to be less than thirty years old
flicks back and forward in the book, wondering on the significance of these people
He is lost in the musings when the click of the front door tells him  has returned
closes the book and quickly slips it back into the drawer
He heads rapidly for the window he came in through but realises is too close for him to open it and make good his escape
Instead he stands between the window and the curtains, pulling the latter closed over him
enters the room, leading  who is still strait- jacketed
44 We see  standing very still in the limited space behind the curtains
It is clearly seen that, given the thoroughness with which he closed the curtains and his immobile position, he is unable to see what is happening in the room
He can hear, but not see
45 leads  across to the mattress
Standing beside it, he unbuckles and removes the strait-jacket from his patient
, beneath the strait-jacket, is naked to the waist
His arms and cheat are a mass of scars of various age and size
gestures to the mattress
Now that his arms are free, is scratching furiously
Mr
Browning
Please, lie down
lies down, still scratching, trust and hope in his eyes
46
'   ('
) As if looking through 's eyes, we see his body stretched out before us on the mattress
The naked chest and arms are covered with raised lumps, red and painful-looking
As his scratching arms attack these lumps, they break open, revealing vile black insects that have hatched beneath his skin
brushes these away while he scratches at the remaining lumps
47 has already re-opened some of the more recent scars, and blood slowly rises to the surface of his skin
walks over to his writing tableland goes into one of the drawers
He produces an old-fashioned cut-throat razor and walks back to Here
This will help
He proffers the razor
siezes it
steps back quickly, a mixture of anticipation and apprehension on his face
slashes at his body and left arm with a short, sharp, slicing motions
In his mind, he is lancing the cysts that contain the tormenting insects
In reality, he is inflicting horrifying damage on himself
Blood pours from the multitude of wounds, running over his body and down onto the mattress
Suddenly, without any preliminaries, two painfully thin, flayed, mucus-covered arms shoot out of the mattress, one on either side of the still-busy
They wrap themselves tightly across his chest and crush him tightly to the mattress, as a head, similarly wasted, oozes out of the mattress to the side of 's head
Beneath his delusions,  suddenly has an inkling of what is happening to him
His eyes widen and his mouth opens ready to emit a scream but the monster beneath him forces a hand over his mouth as it buries its face into the soft flesh of his neck
Two legs now rise from the oozing slime that the bloodstains on the mattress have become
They too wrap themselves around so that he is held tight
Finally, with titanic effort, he gathers enough momentum to roll completely free of the mattress and falls to the floor beside it
The thing on his back now is pulling free from the bed of bubbling, frothing slime that the mattress now is with a sliding, slurping sound
The monster's face is now deep in the flesh of his throat, and even as  forces himself up first onto one knee and then, very unsteadily, onto his feet, we can see him wasting away - his face losing its fullness and colour, his chest sinking in on itself
The creature, which is still wrapped around him and clinging tight is, unlike him, growing in stature by the second
Muscles are inflating, arteries pumping more vigorously, and flesh itself filling out
Its horrific thin-ness when it first appeared effectively unsexed it but now, as its regeneration continues, the fullness of its hips, the roundness of its thighs, and the sacs of fat and muscle that bloom above its ribs confirm its female nature
If there was any doubt that this was , it is now disappearing
is now nearly a walking corpse and it is the strength of his will alone that allows him to take a few faltering steps with still enveloping him
With the desperate strength with which she clings to him and the way her legs are wrapped around his hips, it is like an obscenely perverse parody of sexual passion
has been watching all this with an incredible mix of emotions playing across his face
Still human enough to feel both fear and disgust at what is happening he is nevertheless awe struck and exhilarated
He has waited all his life for such an irrefutable demonstration of the power and the truth of the supernatural
Similarly, the scientist in him is fascinated by the living anatomy lessons that 's regeneration and  rapid decay offer
With one last dying effort, the now-almost-husk-like breaks ' grip and makes a futile step forward as she falls from him
He totters towards the curtains
Just as the audience think he will pull them down with him, revealing ,  grabs his ankle and pulls
He falls back to the floor
48 The loud noise of 's fall renews 's resolve to see what is going on
Carefully, he shifts his position so that he can see through a small gap in the curtains
49
' may have heard one or two strange and unpleasant noises but has not screamed nor  spoken; nothing has prepared him for what he sees - a skinned woman sucking out what life remains from the dried husk of a psychotic man
50 's head jerks back, shaking as if he's just had an electric shock
His mouth moves but no sound emerges
(mimed) Jesus Christ
His terror simultaneously urging speed and silence,  gingerly maneuvers himself out of the window
51 lies back satisfied on the floor
She looks up weakly at Help me
Her voice is perfect
stares at her, his fascination intense
He crosses the few yards that separate them
He looks at her, lying beside the hollow shell that was
Her eyes stare back, brilliant, sparkling, alive
Help Me
realises her temporary vulnerability; all the life force she has absorbed from  has made up her body, but it will take some moments for the strength to return to her
Fascinated and sympathetic as he is however he cannot yet quite brine himself to touch this creature
Instead he moves the mattress nearer to her, allowing her to crawl back onto it and lie down again
stares down at her
He attempts a smile, but is too nervous to make it convincing
He is trembling slightly
This contact with the beyond is something he has dreamt of for years, but nevertheless the physical reality is overwhelming
treats him to the approximation of a smile
She is far from nervous
She studies herself
Her figure is fully formed, her womanliness undeniable
All she is missing is a skin
She stretches her arms
She lifts her legs
She writhes on the bed in pleasure, like an - ray photograph of a calendar girl
stares at her, following the sensual movements of her body
He swallows, a little embarrassed by his response to the naked display he is privileged to watch
' eyes twinkle at him
Don't be embarrassed
You're my friend
She looks away and continues her stretching and wiggling, more conscious of it now as an erotic display
The strength has flooded through her body as she rises to her feet, and stops off the mattress, smiling at
backs away from her as she moves towards him, doing his best to return her smile
After a few steps,  stops and simply stares into ' eyes
He too stops and returns the gaze
The camera circles them slowly several times, studying them - the dressed, nervous man and skinned, confident woman
Well
says nothing
Perhaps he swallows nervously
The camera continues its circling movements
The scene    and begins to laugh, small, sensual giggles at first building finally as the blackness comes into an almost hysterical crescendo of raucous joy
52 is again lying on her back on top of the bed
She is a stark contrast to
No display
No laughter
Her eyes are open and red-rimmed from weeping now
There is also complete silence
All the more jarring, then, the sudden sound of someone fumbling at the handle of ' door
Her eyes widen in alarm and she flings herself off the bed, scanning the room for anything that can be used as a weapon
There is nothing but the chair and she she has all but lifted it aloft when she sees that it is , who comes into the room
Shit, Kyle
This is getting to be a habit
What is it, some kind of shock-therapy
She was angry, relieved, and amused when she realized it was and all these showed in her voice and face
Now they drop away completely, replaced by a nervous apprehension as she becomes aware of the blank horror on his face
Oh, Jesus
What is it
opens his mouth a few times, as if unsure what to say
It's all true
53
' walks around her room, staring at her completed puzzles - those on the wall and the one on the floor - and waiting for the next one
54
' simple shot tells us it is the next morning
55
' , dressed in a black suit, is in the room, staring at the empty mattress
We  with him through to his
56
' In contrast to the secret and private obsession room, this room is the tasteful and upmarket room of the successful professional
It is a long spacious room with modern furniture and white walls
The walls are mostly free of decoration save for two or three large canvases of abstract art
The longest wall is broken up only by a low circular table, which rests against it about half way down
On this table is a very simple black vase containing a spray of beautiful white lilies
Above this vase on the wall is a large frameless mirror
As  enters, the first thing he sees is a bloody palm- print on one of his white walls
He blinks at it and looks down into the room
We  ; At first it seems she is staring at the lilies, but as we around her, we realise she is staring at the reflection of her skinned self
Her face snarls at herself, she roars with rage, forms her hand into a fist and shatters the mirror
rushes towards her
She swings round and freezes him with a glance
They hold their positions for a moment,  nervous and furious, and then  makes herself relax
She sighs, takes a few deep breaths, and then speaks
'm cold
57
' on a strangely Art Deco electric fan heater, with bright red coils emitting waves of heat
We pull out to see  standing by the table with the flowers
There is now a half-full glass of wine on the table, along with an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored
pack of cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of 's jacket
enters the room and closes the door behind her
She is dressed in one of ' suits
It is a light weight suit of white linen, a suit for expensive holidays in hot countries
She crosses the room to the table; pausing slightly in the centre of the room, to allow  to look at her
Well
' nervousness has retreated a little, he manages to smile
He nods his head slowly a few times
Yes
Yes
You look
Surreal
Strange
Nightmarish
No
You look
He pauses, lost for words
doesn't wait for an answer
She crosses to the table and takes up his glass of wine
She downs it in one
stares at her, a little surprised
Yes,  still like
She smiles strangely at him and then moves closer
Slowly, keeping her eyes on his, she reaches into his breast pocket for his packet of cigarettes and places one in her mouth
and more
For a moment, 's face is stone
Then, slowly, he returns her smile and, drawing his lighter, lights her cigarette
58 large multi-level shopping complex obviously up-market and expensive
We see , riding up one on the central escalators, looking around him as he does so, as if searching for a specific shop
He reaches the next level and begins to walk along one of the several avenues that lead away from the central square containing the escalators
He walks past several shops, looking in their windows; a chic specialty shop, a window full of clocks, a cutler's
Finally, he stops in front of one
He stares at its display window
The window is classily minimal
There is in fact only one dress in it
It is an exquisite white cocktail gown
The gown is full length but quite tight-fitting, merely flaring a little from below the knee, and has a halter-neck
walks into the shop
59
' We are looking at a reflection of  in the large mirror that covers the inside of his wardrobe door
His real hand and his reflected hand come together at the edge of the door and tip it slightly, changing the image that the mirror shows us
Now we see
She is in the dress from the shop in the mall
It is a perfect fit and shows her figure off very well
Being a halter-neck, however, her skinned arms and shoulders are completely bare
Also, it is quite low cut at the front, exposing a fair degree of visceral cleavage, and at the back
turns fully around in front of the mirror examining herself from every angle
Her mood is unreadable until she speaks
Close it
does so
He understands and tries to console her
It's a beautiful dress

59
' ' hands applying wide, white, surgical bandages to
We pull out as  steps away from
They are both standing in the middle of the living room floor
' arms, torso, and head are now completely enclosed in neatly and professionally applied bandages
There are three slits for her eyes and mouth but apart from these she is completely covered
Over these she is still wearing the white dress
There
lifts her arms slightly to look at them and then touches her bandaged face
She turns towards
The camera begins the same circling movement it made around them the previous night
' nervousness has practically disappeared
He has helped this woman
He has bandaged her and dressed her
He is slightly in awe of her, but it is now tinged with excitement, not fear
The camera's circling grows faster
Well
walks towards him, slowly raising her hands
When she is close enough her hands cup his cheeks
She pulls him towards her, and, tipping her head to one side, kisses him
Her body moulds itself to his
She leans her head back
Were they have kissed blood has pressed up onto the bandage from her skinned flesh
It looks like smeared lipstick
Well
puts his arms around her waist
They kiss tenderly
Slowly, almost nervously, he lowers his hands until they rest on her buttocks and presses her in towards him
They begin to spin themselves now, echoing the camera movements
They cross the room, kissing blindly, until they come to rest against the wall that bears 's bloody palm print twists their bodies so that  is pressed against the wall, and begins to move her hips forcefully and sensually against The camera is stationary now, watching without movement as begins to raise 's dress up her legs, her hand on his wrist, helping and encouraging
About halfway up the thigh, the bandaging disappears and the raw flesh is exposed
The kissing and the fumbling continue until they are making fast and violent love against the wall
His hands clutch tightly at her hips and he pulls his face away from the kissing to loan it on her shoulder so that we see his face as it grimaces in ecstasy
He cries out and shudders and slowly both their movements stop
He strokes at her back gently and their bodies relax
(almost coyly) Now all we need is a skin

' on shower jets hitting 's face and naked shoulders
Her eyes are closed, but she smiles in pleasure as the water refreshes her
knocking is heard
moves her head out of the water's path and shouts
Yeah
61
' It is basically a studio apartment - everything except the bathroom facilities is in the one room
There is a sofa - with sheets and blankets on it - a bed, a dining/all-purpose table with two chairs, shelves full of records and books, and a small working desk against one of the walls
The desk is weighed down by text books and notes and, tacked to the wall above it, are medical prints, some of the brain and central nervous system, but also two fullcoloured anatomical prints - one of a man and one of a woman
They could almost be portraits of  and
, fully dressed, is standing by the bathroom door, his hand still in a knocking position
You
Silence
Kirsty
You 0
The bathroom door opens and  Comes into the main room, dressed in a toweling robe that is clearly a 'hers' not a 'his'
She crosses the room to a mirror, rubbing at her wet hair with a towel
No bad dreams
So you slept
gestures at the sofa
As much as that bed of nails allowed
glances meaningfully at the bed as he replies
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on
Oh yeah
On your own a lot, Huh
grins
Like the robe
returns the smile via the mirror
crosses the room to sit at his dining table
Empty coffee cups, the remnants of a loaf and some cheese suggests their breakfast was simple and finished some time ago
gathers her clothes from by the sofa and moves back into the bathroom to dress
waits a few moments and then speaks
think  need to talk
About what  saw
emerges, fully dressed, her hair still damp
You thought  was crazy, didn't you
spreads his hands wide
Jesus, yes
What do you expect
mean, God,  still do
It's just that now 'm crazy too
He grins wryly
moves to the sofa and sits down
And you're sure it was a woman
God,  wish  could say no
This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know
grins at him
Don't worry about it
Your attitude sucks anyway
Hey, so for it
Don't let pity stop you
'm down
Nail me
For a moment, they laugh together but then stop
stares downward and then suddenly bursts into tears
What can  do
How can save him
joins her on the sofa
He offers an arm but she shakes it off
The box
need the box
The box
Like in your story
Like in his house
's tears suddenly stop
She looks at
(sharply) What
The Boxes
In the House told you
What do you mean
The boxes
you
You ' tell me
Do you mean Malahide's got
Yeah
The things you were talking about
heads instantly for ' door
'm going
runs across the room and puts a restraining hand on his door
Wait a minute
What do you mean, ''m going
'  the
nods and pulls at the door handle
Get out of the way
Are you crazy
don't know, Kyle
You're the fucking expert
Now get out of the way
(shouting) Because 'm going to get my father
Tears start to her eyes and she stares at  defiantly
Then she repeats, more softly; 'm going to get my father
There is a two-second silence between them as they stare at each other
Finally, Kyle backs away from the door, raising a finger
Two seconds
Just two seconds
Don't move
He rushes across the room, grabs a jacket, and moves back to the door
Let's go
Kyle, you don't have
don't have to
It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot
stares at him, her face at first blank then suffused with emotion
She leans across and plants a chaste kiss on his lips then pulls back
There is a beat while they simply stare at each other and suddenly they are tight in each other's arms, kissing fervently
But the kiss is fuelled, not by passion, but by fear and their mutual need for human solace in the face of the unknown
As the kiss continues, the camera pulls back from them
62
- as  (still bandaged) and  come together for a kiss
They part and, as  moves across the room, the camera begins a long  around the room
First, it reaches a naked
As catatonic as , she says nothing but her eyes betray her terror
Her hands are tied above her
moves in towards the girl, her eyes glittering with an alien hunger beneath their gauze mask
As she nears the girl, the passes them and moves through the room
has done his mistress proud
It had been an empty upstairs room (no furniture, bare floorboards) but now it resembles a nightmarish cross between a butcher's shop and a bordello
The camera slowly reveals, as it , that there are seven more people in the room
Seven dead people
Dried-out husks
The  is now completing its circle around the room
After the corpses, we return to  and the  - but the  too is now a hollow, dried-out shell
moves back into the centre of the room and stands still
crosses the room to her quickly, drawing a wicked- looking kitchen knife from his pocket as he does so
He reaches and raises the knife to her face
With one swift, precise movement, he slices the bandages across the side of her face
raises her hand and pulls the mask away
The camera sweeps in toward her as she does this until her face is in   as the bandage-mask is pulled aside
Her face is perfect
63
' emerges from his front door
He is still in his black suit and looks every inch the respectable professional
He looks neither left nor right but moves straight off, a busy man with things to do
few seconds after he has gone off-camera,  and emerge from around the corner of the house
gestures to  to follow him and leads her around to the window he broke in through on the previous night
64 The room is much as we saw it last
The window slides up and  pulls himself into the room
He looks around it carefully
Sure that the monster he saw the previous night is no longer in the room, he helps  in through the window
's eyes go at once to the three   in the glass cases
She crosses the room eagerly
rushes after her and stops her opening one of the cases
Wait
The
thing
want to be sure it's not here
nods and  leaves the room
65
/ ' advances carefully, and slowly, from the stairs onto the landing
He looks about him at every step he takes
Ahead of him on the landing is a door, which is very slightly ajar
He advances gingerly down the landing to the door
When he reaches it, he pauses
We see his face working as he ponders his choices -should he push it open inch by slow inch, or slam it inwards quickly
Very slowly he moves his hand towards the door
The camera matches his movement, moving in on his hand, the door, and the space between
His fingertips are less than an inch from touching the door when another hand shoots into view and grabs his wrist
has crept up beside him on the landing while all his attention was on the door
swings round in horror, his mouth opening to scream when he sees that  has her other hand to her mouth, her finger at her lips in a silencing gesture
There is of course, nothing for him to recognize from the monstrous vision of the previous night
's arms, chest, and face are completely re-skinned now
All  sees is a beautiful stranger in a white dress
Sssh
think it's still here
What
The
The thing
nods
Yes
had to stop you going in there because  knew you'd cry out
Any normal person would
It
It's just
Is it in there
No
Not now
swallows, nods, and gently, pushes the door open
He walks into the room
66
- The camera follows  into the room
He reaches the middle before horror and disgust stop him
He hears a click behind him and turns to see  has come into the room and closes the door behind her
She looks at
Was  right
Is it terrible
stares all around him
All eight victims have been sucked dry
He is surrounded by dead husks
His face is ghastly
He looks like he is about to faint
He nods
His voice is a cracked whisper
Yes
Yes, it's terrible
crosses the room rapidly towards him
Her face is a picture of concern
Oh
You look awful
You poor boy
Come here
As she speaks, 's arms are opening out to him
sees the comfort offered and advances towards her, too
As they come together, the camera moves around them and we see, for the first time, that  is still incomplete; Her entire back is still glistening raw flesh, the naked bones of the spine still clearly visible
Their arms go around each other just as  completes her speech; Come to Mother
As 's hands touch the sticky, mucoid meat of her shoulders, it is instantly clear to him what has happened
For a moment he freezes in terror
His arms fly from her and he throws his head back
But  is very strong now and her grip does not relax
Kyle's expression is a mixture of terror and confusion as he stares into the beautiful face of the monster
smiles at him, a hungry, aroused smile
What's your name
can hardly speak for fear
Kyle
'm
She raised one hand from his back to the back of his head and presses his face to hers
plays it exactly as a sensual, passionate kiss, her mouth wide open, her head moving rhythmically and sinuously
's reaction is somewhat different; his arms flail in panic (though only from the elbow - ' grip prevents anything more) and his head makes jerking, backward movements against her pressing hand
The camera moves around the embracing couple until it is behind The back of her gown, as we know, is extremely low
As the kiss continues, we see skin creeping above the line of the gown at the base of her spine and gradually flowing up her back until finally it meets and blends perfectly with ragged and raw edges of the skin at her neck and shoulders
is complete again
While this process has been going on,  has been dying slowly and horribly in her arms, his lifeforce being sucked into her through their open mouths
His body, by the time her back is completely formed, is shrunken, hollow, and dried up
takes her arms from around the corpse of  and steps back, allowing the husk to fall to the floor
licks her lips and looks down, not without affection, at the dead
She smiles
Thank you, Kyle
67 has found the black ring-binder and laid it on the writing table
She has separated one of the photographs from the others and laid it out on the table beside the binder
It is the from the opening sequence
has obviously recognized something familiar in it but she can't quite grasp it completely
She is still puzzling over it when she suddenly realises that several minutes have elapsed since  left her there
Her head straightens up and her puzzled look is replaced by a slightly worried one
(to herself) Kyle
She folds up the photograph and puts it in her pocket
She crosses to the door and opens it
She does not go through it immediately but stands in the doorway for a moment, her hand still on the door, cocking her head slightly as if listening
(slightly louder) Kyle
She can't hear anything, but she regards that as a bad sign, not a good one
She leaves the room
68
/ makes her way up the stairs
Unlike  a little earlier she moves up them quite quickly and advances onto the landing
When she is on the landing and looking at the closed door to 's Boudoir she stops, standing still and staring at the door
suppresses a shudder
She bites her lip, takes two or three deep breaths, crosses to the door firmly, and flings it open, moving into the room even as she does so
69
- moves three or four steps into the room and then stops dead
The door swings shut behind her
's eyes flick left and right, taking in the sickening details of the room's contents, and then stare straight ahead, focusing on the figure in white which is turning around to face her
completes her turn and looks at  completely impassively for a moment
Then her mouth opens up into a smile of welcome - but there is nothing but hate in her eyes
Kirsty
How nice of you to drop in
glances meaningfully at the dead thing that lies beside her feet and then back at
You have surprisingly good taste in men
's fear and disgust are momentarily displaced by a furious rage as she realises what  has done
Her face erupts into anger and she screams out
Kyle
No
'll kill you, you
She flings herself across the room at  even as she speaks
is completely unphased by this attack and simply raises one arm
She siezes the wrist of the arm that  has raised into a clenched fist and effortlessly throws  bodily back across the room
We realise for the first time the immense physical strength that  now possesses
smashes into the door and falls to a sitting position against it
She is shaken and slightly hurt enough not to get to her feet immediately but she stares at  with undimmed hatred
throws a look halfway between a smile and a sneer
Oh, you can try it, you little bitch
'd love you to try it
But 'm not just the woman  was
What, you mean you're something more than a whore with a vicious streak
mean 'm something more than human, you little shit
snaps this first line but then holds her anger in check
She shakes her head and an amused smile plays across her lips
Oh, Kirsty
They didn't tell you, did they
'm afraid they've changed the rules of the fairy tale; 'm no longer just the wicked step-mother
The smile disappears and she delivers the next line with an utterly straight face
It is, after all, the truth
Now 'm the Evil Queen
The hatred and the heat returns to her voice
So come on; Take your best shot, Snow White
scrambles to her feet and again charges at
steps forward to meet her advance and delivers a single back-handed swipe across 's face with such force that not only is the girl knocked off her feet but is actually knocked unconscious
rolls onto her back and lies at 's feet
stares down at the unconscious body
When it was awake, it was  and her attitude to it was based on personal enmity
Now, it is simply another body and she judges it differently; it is firm, full, healthy, and young
We see the expression on her face change from hatred and triumph to pure appetite
She licks her lips and her eyes glisten
She begins to bend slightly towards it
(off-camera) Julia
The door to the room opens
straightens up and looks as stands in the doorway
Her eyebrows question this interruption
second later, and it is explained
He leads  into the room
70 sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor
She appears to be alone in the room
Cradled in her lap is a Lament Configuration, taken from one of the glass cases on the low table
On a wall behind , one of the large prints that previously hung there has been taken down
Revealed in the space behind  it is a large mirror
The camera moves in towards this mirror
71 and  stand in a tiny and completely bare room
On the wall in front of them is a large window through which we see a back-view of  in the obsession room
72 looks around the room generally and then turns her attention completely to the
She picks it up and turns it around in her hands, studying each of its faces intently
She begins trying to move the interlinked pieces within it
At first she has no success; the box appears to be one solid construction with no internal movement possible
She stops her attempts and studies it again for a moment, her face still impassive
Then she gives a tiny smile and begins again
Her movements are faster now, less tentative
Suddenly, there is a click and one of the panels on-the box slides out slightly
The little music-box tune begins to play
To  this is a marvelous reward - something the jigsaw never offered - and she lets out a little sound in response, somewhere between a sigh and a delighted giggle
It tempts her to even greater skill and her delighted fingers fly over the box
Another panel moves
Then two more
The tune is prettier and fuller
73 stares fixedly through the window, nervous but terribly excited
He is breathing rapidly and shallowly
Through the glass, 's success continues
Small flashes of intense blue light begin to buzz around the box
The room grows darker and cracks begin to appear in its walls
seems quietly amused - both by what is going on in the room and by 's heated response to it
She glances from one to the other, her eyes twinkling
You're sure this is what you want
doesn't take his eyes from the window
It's what 've wanted
view of
beyond
He pauses
Perhaps he is being ungallant
He turns slightly towards  and takes her hand
You were almost enough, Julia but
have to see
have to smiles indulgently
She nods
Oh,  quite understand
74 is completely engrossed in the box
She seems blissfully unaware of the changes taking place in the room
The cracks have widened in the walls and, in some places, pieces of plaster have fallen away, revealing the slats beneath
Blue light begins to stream into the room, ignoring the geography of what should lie beyond its walls
Where the light comes through the slats, it is as broad beams of light, given contrast by the shadows of the slats
But it also comes through the smaller cracks and enters the room in intensely bright and very thin beams that criss-cross through the room almost like a laser display
Suddenly, 's solution is complete
The central core of the box rises up and twists itself around into its final position
75 takes an almost involuntary step backward
His excitement has now reached the pitch where it is beyond obvious physical manifestation
He is perfectly still, his face perfectly impassive
She's done it
She certainly has
It's coming
It certainly is
turns away to meet her eyes
There is a beat or two where absolutely nothing happens
The mirror explodes inwards into the alcove
76 The room is filled with smoke and suffused with blue light
Two of the walls simply part physically, revealing entrances into the corridors of Hell
These corridors are lined with gray walls and seem to run for a great distance
still sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor, staring about her in astonishment
Surrounding her, in various parts of the room, are the four from
The   smiles and advances towards
The leader of the ,  raises a hand
Wait
The  stops and looks questioningly at
, at a more leisurely pace, crosses towards  and looks down at her
She stares back at him, the remnants of her insanity a temporary defense against fear, her face registering nothing
looks up
No
The  looks across at him
No
shakes his head
No
He glances down at  again
It is not  that call us
He looks up and stares directly at the shattered two-way mirror
It is
77 The wall opposite the shattered mirror has also opened up to reveal a way into Hell
and  are no longer in the alcove
We hear the ringing of their footsteps
They are making their way down the corridor
78 The four  have gone
looks around the room again
She stares from one entrance to the other
Her manner is reminiscent of when she is making decisions during her solving of puzzles
79
- is still on the floor in the boudoir of blood
This room too is now suffused with blue light and smoke
There are no gateways to Hell in the walls but there are several cracks in the plaster and these appear to be spreading
moans and opens her eyes gingerly
She puts a hand to her face, rubbing at the place where  hit her
Still a little groggy, she lifts herself slowly to a sitting position, her legs stretched out
Only when she has blinked a few times, shaken her head, and rubbed her jaw again, does full consciousness return - at which point she looks quickly about the room ( possibly expecting another attack from ) and notices the light and the smoke
She has been in this atmosphere before
She knows precisely what it means
Her mouth opens and her eyes grow nervous again
Oh, shit
scrambles quickly to her feet and rushes through the door to the stairs
80 enters the room just as  is about to go down one of the corridors
screams at her
stops, startled, and looks at the doorway and
raises her hands in a placatory gesture and speaks more softly
Wait
Wait
begins to move into the room slowly and shakes her head gently
Hey, remember me
From the hospital
was in the next room
is rewarded with a small recognizing smile from , returns the smile
You don't want to go down there
You  don't want to go down there
turns her head once more to look down the corridor and then turns back to
For a second it looks as if 's persuasions have succeeded, but 's training has been too thorough;  knows a puzzle when she sees one
She smiles once more at  and then suddenly turns and disappears into the corridor
stands still for a moment, as if she can't quite believe that  has done it
She shakes her head - half in disbelief and half in despair
Jesus Christ
Pausing only to pick up the   from  where has left it on  the floor, She heads straight for the corridor and follows  in
81
/ We are looking straight down one of the very long corridors of Hell
It has the same architecture as the corridor that appeared in the hospital room in ; walls of stained gray stone broken up by vaguely medieval-looking arches
comes into view, walking away from the camera
Ahead of her, at an illogically far distance given that she entered the corridor only seconds before , is
breaks into a slight run, and calls out to the girl
Tiffany
Wait
Her voice has an unpleasant ring in the acoustics of these corridors and echos horribly
pulls a face and doesn't shout again
She increases her pace slightly
Suddenly  makes a sharp turn and enters an intersecting corridor
is forced to increase her speed even more
too makes the turn into another corridor
Even as she does so, she sees  disappearing again into yet another intersection
follows and, again, the same thing happens
This happens several times and, always,  never quite loses sight of  but never quite catches up with her either
In short, 's instincts were absolutely right; this too is another puzzle
The girls are lost in a concrete maze, full of twists and turns and labyrinthine windings
After enough turns have been made to completely confuse 's sense of direction, she makes a final turn into one corridor and sees something different
At the end of this corridor is a blinding white light
As soon as sees the light, the air is filled with beautiful birdsong
disappears into the light as soon as  sees it
Despite the light, despite the birdsong,  is still suspicious and shouts out
Tiffany
Don't trust it
Don't Trust it
But it is too late
The girl is gone
follows-and vanishes into the light
82
/ and  are seen in the corridors of the labyrinth
's face is full of delight
He is absolutely the enchanted visitor
, on the other hand, walks with the brisk assurance of one on familiar territory
The corridors that  sees are different to '; they are grotto-like, dotted with stalactites and stalagmites and not immediately unattractive
The walls contain portals of a glass- like substance at random intervals that emit blooming lights of different colors and  peers eagerly into several of these
In one, the view is like an aquarium
An alien fish swims past his eyes
Its body resembles a human brain but it has pincer-like claws
presses his hand against the glass as the thing comes nearer
Suddenly, from within its body, the thing produces a perfect human forearm and hand and meets 's hand on the other side of the glass
starts slightly but then keeps his hand there
He is turning his head to call 's attention to this marvel when the thing suddenly forms a fist and begins to beat against the glass with tremendous force
jumps back sharply, but the thing shatters the glass and leaps out at him
He gasps and runs up the corridor, the thing hopping after him on its one hand
As they pass , she tuts with the slightly exasperated but indulgent tone of a parent or a teacher
She steps on the thing, squashing it flat
It emits a horrible death-cry
Do be careful
83
' White light fills the screen and  steps through it into view
Instantly the White light contracts and disappears
finds herself standing in a beautiful family sitting room
The room is bathed in the warm light of a perfect summer's day
The birdsong  heard earlier continues but is, if anything, even more melodic, even more sweet
The room is vaguely Edwardian in its decor; real wood furnishings and decorative porcelain ornaments
There is a large wooden dresser, on top of which are many photographs in old-fashioned brass frames
Despite herself,  cannot resist a smile of pure pleasure at the appearance of the room
She touches some of the furniture, as if to assure herself it is real
She approaches the dresser and picks up one of the large framed photographs
She gasps in pleasure
We see the photograph
It is a family group and looks to be have been taken ten to twenty years ago
It is of a man, a woman, and a young girl of four or five
The man is clearly , albeit a younger version, and the little girl has dark, thick, slightly curly hair - just like '
The woman is beautiful and has similar hair to her daughter
's eyes prick with tears - but they are clearly tears of happy memories
She smiles
Mommy
puts down the photograph of her family and looks around the room again
troubled look crosses her face
Despite the aparent Summer light in the room,  suddenly realises what it is that is odd
She looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her face
There are no windows in the room
And no door
At this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes apparent
It is nothing too obvious at the moment - the total effect is simply less sweet than it was
looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, with a look of concern
The photograph has changed
It is now a wedding photo
The wedding of  and
Suddenly the photograph begins to bleed
Blood pours from the paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass-so that it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of the picture showing
The blood begins to escape out of the frame, trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and dripping onto 's fingers
With a cry of horror,  drops the frame
It lands on the floor and the glass shatters
The blood continues to flow
In fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly fountains out, spreading across the floor
steps back and glances at the dresser
Blood is flowing from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing onto the floor
By now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very much predominant and, as  sweeps all the frames off the dresser and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong gives way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking
throws her hands to her ears
Nooooo
She rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with her fists
The walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists strike, like flabby flesh
stands back in disgust
The wall visibly bruises before her eyes, swelling and purpling
The light in the room, like the birdsong, has changed utterly
It is not dark, but simply dull, featureless, and depressing
turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room has given in to decay
The sofas and chairs are mildewed and rotten, the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and rot
skinned rat runs across the room beside the buckled and chipped skirting board
rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom drawer spills out, freeing a whole family of quite large spiders which run wildly across the floor
Suddenly the room begins to fill with smoke, churned up by an ever-increasing intensity of wind
The smoke obscures the screen
84 The smoke and wind subside but not entirely
is standing in exactly the same position in a room of exactly the same proportions, but which is completely empty and which has walls of the same gray stone that the corridors do
Suddenly, rising up from behind , comes
Ah, Kirsty
And we thought we'd lost you
swings round in terror
As the mist continues to clear, she sees, advancing to join , the   and the Beyond them, it is now revealed, that this chamber has no fourth wall; it gives directly onto the corridors So sweet of you to come back
begins to work furiously at the  she has brought from 's house
It sent them away at the end of
She obviously hopes it will work again
raises a hand and the box simply flies out of 's hands and hovers in the air between them
stares, open- mouthed
How can it send us back, child
We're already here
And so are you
Suddenly  works at the box himself - by remote control and with dazzling skill
He turns the box rapidly through positions  and we have never seen before - even opening it out at one stage into  a large, two-dimensional square
Finally, it closes itself down - but in a wholly new shape; a white, multi-faceted, diamond shape - and drops back into 's hands
He stares at  and makes a small gesture with his brow
It is  cute
If anything, it resembles the cocky, aren't-- clever look  gave  after swallowing the cigarette in Then his face assumes its normal deadly blankness
shakes her head dumbly and begins to back into a corner, hoping that if they converge on her, she might just be able to slip around them and get back to the labyrinth
No
You
You can't
It wasn't me
didn't do it
didn't open the box
Didn't open the box
And what was it last time
Didn't know what the box was
And yet we  keep finding each other, don't we
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it
Perhaps you're teasing us
Are you teasing us
To some extent, 's ploy is working
The  are moving closer together as they advance to the corner in which she stands
But  didn't open it
didn't
Then why are you here
've come for my father
shouts this with brave defiance
laughs in response, a very unattractive sound
But he's in his own Hell, child And quite unreachable
Suddenly  makes her break shouting out as she does so
don't believe you
It seems for a moment she has succeeded
She swings around the side of the  and begins to run across the chamber
The  do not move but suddenly, from nowhere a hook flies across the room, attached to a metal chain
The hook buries itself in the wall only inches in front of 's face, the chain pulled tight and barring her path
The wall begins to bleed
screams
The  turn to face her, but make no attempt to cross the room to her new position
But it's true, He is his own Hell
Just as you are in yours
And what about you
almost smiles at the naivete of the question
It's different for us
We've always been here
We have no more surprises
Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the hook withdraws from the wall and flies back into nothingness
puts out his hand in an expansive gesture
But, please; feel free
Explore
We'll always be here
85 can't quite believe this but she has no intention of questioning it
She runs into the corridor and away, with 's last words echoing after her
we have Eternity to know your flesh
Delighted  laughter follows her back into the labyrinth
drops the transformed  into her pocket as she begins running through the corridors again
The labyrinth seems tighter now - the corridors shorter, the turns sharper
Corner after corner we see  turn
Accompanying this tightening, the light in the corridors becomes gradually murkier - not quite dark, more like the oppressive colourlessness that descends before a thunderstorm breaks
Occasionally there are little hissing noises from the walls themselves, which are accompanied by small jets of dull and heavy smoke escaping between the bricks
Over all this, there grows in volume on the soundtrack a rhythmic, labored, resonant sound - a sound somewhere between breathing and machinery
Suddenly, as  turns one more corner, a hand reaches out to touch her
throws herself back against the far wall of the corridor, unsure whether to fight or flee
Then her face relaxes
It is 86
/ In another corridor within the labyrinth,  and  are walking
They too have found their way into the inner sections
They too are in tighter, sharper corridors where the light is distressing
They too hear the machine-like breathing noise
And what is revealed behind the portals in the corridor walls is less ambiguous in its unpleasantness; in one we see  in some Hell's equivalent of a beauty salon
He is being re-made
This involves the scar tissue being manually peeled from the upper part of his face to reveal beneath small, vicious, human eyes
's attitude has begun to change, as well
His nervousness now clearly outweighs his delight
He' rushes on to the next portal
If the last room was a beauty salon, this is the orgy room
But the orgy is very strange
It is a very dark room, filled with a faint layer of smoke
In the background, a bound man is having his chest licked by a kneeling woman
She pulls her face back for a moment
Her tongue is horrifically long and studded with short, sharp blades
The man's chest is stripped of skin where she has been attending him
His face is a picture of ecstasy
In the foreground, three people are buried up to their waists in the floor
They are naked
The one in the middle is a woman, the other two, men
The one in front of her faces her, the one behind has his back to her back
They are all very, close
The men have various hooks in their chests, connected by chains to the unseen walls and their faces are impassive
The woman is unwounded and her head flicks back and forth, as if in the grip of a sexual climax of stunning ferocity
The movements of her head keep the details of her features blurred until, finally, it turns to give a three-quarter profile and holds its position, its mouth open, its eyes half-closed in pleasure
It is 's face
gasps and pulls back from the portal
The camera back to reveal that  is still in the corridor, just a few yards in front of him Come
have such sights to show you
shakes his head crazily from side to side and begins to back away
looks at him and walks toward him slowly
She smiles
She strokes his cheek
She moves closer, gently slipping her arms around him and molding her body to his
She extends her tongue and licks lightly at his lower lip
He opens his mouth and returns the kiss, pressing her body more firmly to him
The kiss becomes quite passionate
87
/ and  are now walking together
is talking to her as calmly as her sense of urgency will allow
Do you see
You were
This  a puzzle, too
But '  in the puzzle
stops walking and catches hold of 's arm stops, looks at the hand holding her arm, and then looks into 's eyes
Yeah
smiles directly at  and then returns her nod
Yeah
nods again, more emphatically
Yeah
throws her arms around  and hugs her
88
/ is leading  down a corridor which has intersections every few yards on both of its sides
walks past these shadowed entrances without pause, without a single sidelong glance
She is clearly confident, clearly back on her own turf
, on the other hand, glances nervously into every one before moving on
There is also one last portal he looks into
He is gazing into a room where the floor is a vast, seething pool of maggots
Suddenly, something breaks the surface
It would doubtless scream were its mouth not full of maggots
It is
His nightmare has come true; his skin is producing the maggots in a constant, spewing flow from numerous sores that pack his face
turns away and calls to
Enough
God, that's enough
We to go back
smiles at him
Go back
What an earth makes you think we can go back
's jaw drops
want to go back
Sorry, friend
No day trips to Hell
Here you are
Here you stay
And forward the only way to go
turns back and walks an down the corridor
, with a glance back at the maggot pool, turns after the now departing
89
/ and  are walking warily along a corridor when, suddenly, the corridor wall parts with a roar
Both girls jump, and  cries out
new, and very narrow corridor has been revealed
The stare down it
It culminates in a door
Despite being set in a blank gray stone wall, the door is normal
But frightening - because it is an exact replica of the front door of 55 , 's house
Before  can react to this, a voice issues from beyond the door
Kirsty
stops dead in her tracks
She looks at the door and moves toward it, walking slowly down the corridor follows
(Very Tentatively) Daddy
Only a low moan comes from behind the door
Tiffany
Wait here
If 'm not back real soon - get out
Get home
Leaving  in the corridor,  opens the door and steps in
90
' The door that  opens gives directly on to a room
Like the   earlier this appears to be an ordinary room and not a stone wall chamber
It's wall-papered walls were once white but are now yellowed and old
Overhead there is an equally ancient four bladed wooden fan that turns sluggishly
In the middle of the floor is a small low table of vaguely Eastern design
On this table lie a hand of cards, face down, an empty and cloudy tumbler, and a soiled ashtray
Over by the far wall (the wall opposite to that containing the door) there is a mattress on the floor
body like shape on this mattress is obscured by a heavy blanket that covers it
To the side of the mattress a latticed wooden screen stands, hiding whatever is behind it from those entering the room
If the atmosphere of the room reminds us of anything it is of the seedy bazaar where  first bought the
We are looking at the door as it opens inwards and  slowly and nervously walks into the room
advances into the room
She stares at the mattress ahead of her
Above it written in blood on the wall, is the message she saw in her vision
:
daddy
low moan comes from the far end of the room
assumes it issues from the figure hidden beneath the blanket and walks nearer, lifting her arm in readiness to remove the blanket
Daddy
It's Kirsty
There is no response
arrives at the mattress and pulls the blanket back
She leaps backwards, her hand at her mouth stifling a scream
Lying on the bed is a husk like figure, vaguely female in shape
Despite its appearance of long decay, it is dressed in vaguely sexual garments of leather
Suddenly, the eyes pop open, revealing a vague remnant of life
Oh God
hurriedly, throws the blanket back over it
voice issues into the room
It sounds like  but, as we shall see, it is not
No
Over here
Behind the screen
walks carefully around the screen, giving it a wide berth in case of a trick
There is a figure standing against the wall behind the screen
It is deeply shadowed by the screen itself but is clearly male
gulps back a sob and her eyes fill with tears
Daddy
The figure leans slowly into the light, speaking as he does so
That's it, baby
Come to Daddy
stands still
There is a second where her face registers nothing
Then she screams
it is her  , back in his skin and dressed in white shirt and jeans
chuckles
backs away from him into the room puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture
realises he is not moving after her
She also sees that his body is curiously angled, the left side still in the deep shadow cast by the screen
Is there something else there
Something she can't quite see
's voice stops her wondering
What's the matter, Kirsty
It's only Frank
It's only Uncle Frank
's anger at being tricked wins over her fear and distress and she shouts at  in fury
should have known
should've known he wouldn't be here
This place is only for filth like you
sneers
Oh, right
Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh
Yes
Shit
Bull
Shit pauses and smiles
Then he begins to move more fully into the room, shifting his weight as he does so and dragging what was hidden into the light
screams again
's white shirt is cut off at the left shoulder
His arm is bare and, from the elbow down to the wrist, joined to another forearm
The flesh is completely fused, like that of siamese twins
As  moves into the room, the owner of the other arm is revealed
It is his brother,
's father
, like his brother, is dressed in a white shirt (cut off at one shoulder) and jeans and, like his brother, has his skin back
His face is frozen into a permanent expression of terror and he seems incapable of any independent movement, simply being pulled along by
steps back in horror
See
He's here
You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank
No
He ' be here
It ' been a trick
'Fraid not, baby
He belongs here
With me
We're the same
Brothers
Equal and opposite
Pure appetite
Pure banality
Too much feeling
None at all
's fear of  is now outweighed by her contempt for his argument
You're full of shit, Frank Cotton
My Dad wasn't like that at all
He could feel
He could love
He loved
's voice breaks
He
he loved me
Don't waste your tears
Look at him
Her hatred for  gives  her strength back
He loved me, you bastard
He Loved me, he loved my mother
He even loved that bitch you betrayed him with
begins to move towards  again,  dragging behind him
Ah, Julia
She hasn't been to see me recently
That's why it's so nice to have you here, baby
Daddy's little girl
So pretty when she's upset
Come to Daddy, is very close to her, now
attempts to run across the room
siezes her arm and throws her back against the wall
He moves in close and presses against her
His voice is midway between arousal and anger
Now don't be naughty, Kirsty
Or 'll have to punish you first
Perhaps you'd like that
Would you like that
screams and stares pleadingly, at the still frozen
Daddy
Daddy
love you
Help me
'm your Daddy now, Kirsty
leans in to kiss the terrified
Suddenly, a hand appears at 's throat and hurls him off It is , roused by his daughter's cries
Get your fucking hands off my daughter, you bastard
Suddenly, the room, previously full of slow movements and tension, is full of furious, violent action as the fused brothers kick, tear, and punch at each other in a paroxysm of killing hatred
91 and  are at the end of a corridor
They turn into an open space
vast open space
It is desert-like in its expanse, almost vanishing into infinity at its furthest reaches
It is criss-crossed by catwalks, on one of which  and now stand
Beside these catwalks, the ground falls away into mile-deep, dark, abysses
Above the catwalks, dominating the huge space, is the master of the labyrinth
The master, , is a monumentally huge, white, multi- faceted diamond, spinning on its own axis, entirely unsupported by any physical means, above its territory
Apart from its very immensity, the most unsettling thing about are the beams of black light that shine out from the corners of all its many facets
Due to the fast spinning, these beams shoot and swoop around the chamber, like a negative laser display of dazzling complexity
The sound that has been in the corridors is now magnified
It is the sound of 's breath
has walked the last few yards like a man in shock
Now a black beam strikes his face and images of horror flash before his eyes at almost subliminal speed
His face suddenly crumbles into an expression of incredulous terror, he makes a noise halfway between screaming and retching, and drops to his knees by the edge of the catwalk
Unfortunately, this allows him to look down into 's pit
Looking down with him, we are given a sudden and vertiginously sickening realization of Hell's immensities
There is a drop of miles visible down the pit and, all the way down, as far as the eye can see, there are other catwalks cutting across the pit at various angles
looks back up, his scream renewed by his sight of the pit
Two or three of the beams of black light flit across his face, filling his eyes with more subliminal images of horror as they pass; a child, a knife, and a dead animal; a naked woman whose private parts are made of sharp, oily, metal; perfect hands ending in crumbling, leprous fingers
Suddenly,  stops spinning
Effortlessly
Instantly
Two more beams are projected at  but, as they come within a few yards of him, they become writhing pink limbs that fly out, sieze  and lift him into the air
He screams out
No
No
Julia
Help me
is held in the air as  replies
But you  this
You wanted to
You wanted to
And here it is
The heart of Hell
Leviathan
As she says this two of the thing's facets part to reveal a raw and gaping cavity lined with angry, sore-looking purple flesh directly behind the dangling
The purple and pink walls of this flesh gash peel apart and open in various places to reveal blades, hooks and needles at the end of various vestigial limbs
The limbs holding  draw him back inexorably into this cavity
He has one last moment to meet 's eyes
Why do you think  was allowed to go back
For
No, it wanted souls
And  brought you
And you wanted to
Now you're both happy
is now held within the walls of the gash
He opens his mouth for one final scream but one of the tiny needle-topped limbs flies at his mouth and sews his lips together with heavy blue wire before he can utter it
His eyes widen in both agony and horror
smiles
Goodbye, Doctor
It's been real
The gash heals itself, closing  within
Despite the gash having closed over , the leathery flesh that covers that area is a mass of movement, ripples and bumps
Small rips and gashes appear and disappear on its surface, allowing us occasional and partial glimpses of  and what is happening to him
At one stage 's hand and forearm appear
long deep, running cut has been made down the arm and the flesh peeled and folded back, revealing the meat and the muscle beneath
As we watch, two of the tiny operating limbs sew the flaps of flesh, still folded back, to the rest of the arm, leaving the wound open and un-healable
Another gash opens and 's face is visible
Here too the needles are at work, diving into and out of his flesh in a complicated sewing pattern that is finally pulled together beneath one ear, leaving 's features permanently pulled out of shape and decorated with running stitches of metal wire
Again, 's torso appears, naked
Two large triangular blades make deep parallel slashes down his chest
Two different limbs appear but these have sucker-like tips rather than metallic ones
They fasten onto the new cuts, as if battening
Instead they are injecting - as becomes apparent when 's skin turns blue
The blueness, the conscious disfigurement, and the almost decorative open wounds should serve to convey that what is happening to  is not simply torture; he is being transformed into a
watches with avid interest
92
' and  are fighting furiously, tumbling around the room
is fuelled by righteous anger and revenge but has had more experience of dirty fighting
At one stage their free hands each have hold of the other man by the throat and are rolling along one of the walls, each trying to establish the dominant grip
They smash violently against one of the walls in the room
It gives and they fall through into the next room
93 This is a small square room
With the exception of the doorway to the  , every inch of the walls is covered with sharp and deadly-looking double-bladed knives -ie One blade is buried in the wall up to a central hilt/handle and the other blade juts out menacingly into the room
The two brothers tumble into the room
Their grips loosened by their fall through the wall, they land on the floor and rise to their feet, staring at each other but taking in the vicious nature of the room as well
How convenient
comes through and gasps as she sees the walls
Stay there, baby
Don't come in
Yes
Stay there
'll be with you in a minute
and  trade blows
lands a powerful blow to 's jaw
It straightens up and  slams the flat of his hand against his brother's chest
flies backwards
He flings out his arm to balance himself but he is nearer to the wall than he thinks and the impetus of his fall drives his arm onto the knives
cries out
grins and prepares to force his wounded brother completely onto the knives
Suddenly  flies across the room at  and beats at his back with her fists
snarls and, without turning around completely, flings her away from him
goes flying but lands just safely short of the deadly walls
, in the pause  gave him and galvanized by her example, has found more strength
He pulls his arm painfully forward, clear of the knives, and throws himself to the side, forcing  onto the knives
With a vicious push,  impales his brother completely
howls, loud and long
Without pausing,  pulls a knife free from the wall and, with one vicious slice, separates himself from his brother
rushes to  and helps her to her feet
They embrace
There is a cry of horror off-camera
We pull out
has followed her friend
She stares in shock at 's wounded arm and at the impaled
94 is being given more glimpses of the transforming
The major surgery seems to be complete
There are no spinning blades of needles in sight as the gashes open
's head is completely bald and his face, like the rest of his skin is blue
The only new sophistications are that his upper and lower eyelids have been stretched wide and stapled to his face and forehead, and that a new mouth has been sliced into what was his cheek before his features were pulled permanently to one side
Over the sound of 's breath and the machinery still at work on , 's howl is heard
's head turns to the direction of this new sound
Frank
She turns away without a backward glance and moves back into the corridors
95 is still impaled on the knives,  but his anguished howl has Become  small whimpers of complaint (with, given his history with the  ,  perhaps  the tiniest note of pleasure in  there, too) ,   and  are now gathered together to one side of the room near the door that leads to the corridor
They should leave, but a kind of sick fascination keeps them watching
realises only leverage will pull him free of the knives and lifts his forearms up as much as they are free to
He turns his palms to face the knives and, with a growl of self- encouragement, drives them deeply onto the knives so that he can begin to push the rest of his impaled body backwards
It takes several seconds and much pain for him to succeed, but succeed he does
He flops backwards into the room
Several of the knives have stayed in him, rather than the wall - his chest is decorated, or armed, with many blades
Just as  begins to stand, and just as  and the girls snap out of it and are about to leave, the door from the opens and  walks into the room
and  gasp
gives a slow smile
Well, well
All my family together again
How very sweet
(delighted/flattered) Julia
(Flatly) Frank
knew you'd come
You knew
Yes
You're a girl who remembers her promises
Oh,  do
do
grins, his grin taking in ,  and  as well as
He extends an arm to
And  know how much  mean to you
Come here
does not move
Come here
Kiss me
And then
He glances meaningfully at the others, perhaps stroking a blade of one of the knives in his chest
we'll have a real family re-union
Suddenly, surprisingly,  laughs
He is genuinely amused
Jesus Christ,
don't believe you
You don't know her at all do you
You still think you're in charge
still has not moved
Of course  am
She to me
begins to cross the room to him
For God's sake
He  you
doesn't pause
grins
She's forgiven me that
Haven't you
is now next to him
Do you really need to ask
laughs
Show them
glances at the knives
shrugs
Just a small inconvenience, babe
shifts position so she is standing behind him
She wraps her arms around him, one stroking his belly, the other across his shoulders
leans his head back and twists it slightly
They kiss
removes her arm from his stomach and slips it behind him
Nothing happens for a second and then, suddenly, 's whole body spasms
We almost think it may be with pleasure until he breaks from the kiss and we see the confused expression on his face - and the blood bubbling at his mouth
There is a ripping, bursting sound and 's hand emerges from his chest, covered in his blood
Clutched in her hand is his ruptured, still pumping heart
Jesus
Out
Out
He shepherds the girls quickly through the door to the corridor
's body begins to twitch
holds it tightly
96     / They reach the end of the corridor
It terminates in a - junction
automatically heads in one direction
makes to follow, but  hesitates
Wait a minute
Why are we following her
Who is this
This is Tiffany shrugs
She's good at puzzles
Fine
They take the turn  has indicated
97 still holds  tight
Slowly, she raises the hand which holds his heart until it is in front of his face
's eyes are glassing over but he can still see
Nothing personal, babe
Without ceremony, she bursts the heart with one quick squeeze
100 ,  and  come running toward the camera
Initially oblivious to the fact that the corridor they were running along has widened and the walls retreated
Suddenly, they come to a stunned halt together, staring ahead of them with awestruck faces
Oh
My
God
The camera moves around them to take in what they see
They are of course in the central chamber of

screams
grabs her
Tiffany, listen
You've solved it
But we've got to solve it the  way
See
See
We've got to get out
is frozen
Come on
spins, the beams fly
Please
Tiffany, Please
Get us out
Take us home, please
nods
They are just about to leave when  stops spinning
large beam flies down , carrying an object which lands on the catwalk before the , who all take a step or two backwards
The beam withdraws
The object at first resembles a large and bloody plastic bag, but then internal movement begins to rip at this covering
Hands appear out of the rips and complete the removal
We realise that the bag-like thing was a kind of caul, a membranous after-birth that some creatures produce their young in
The thing inside completes its escape and stands clear of the shredded caul
Like a new-born child, it is stained and soiled with amiotic fluids and blood
But it is not a new born child
It is a
And it used to be
The transformation we caught glimpses of is now complete
Its skin is entirely blue, its head entirely bald
The decorative wounds and tortures we saw being applied are all present;  its flesh is peeled back in various places, its features are threaded and distorted by, wire, its eyelids are stapled open
For a second it stands and regards the  before it
gasps in recognition
too knows what it was
Malahide
For some reason,  draws from her pocket the photo she took from the
She stares at it
Jesus Christ
Of course
The   stretches its arms and flexes its fingers
And to think  hesitated
It looks at the  again, its gaze finally settling on the still shocked
Tiffany
Come
have a whole new world of puzzles for you to enjoy
It reaches out its hand to her
whole new world of pleasures for you to endure
, confused and used to obeying her doctor's voice, tentatively stretches out her arm to meet the 's
suddenly walks between  and
The expression on his face is strange; it is not fear, nor defiance
It is simpler than that
He is really, really pissed off
No
've had enough of this shit
Who the hell are you
It's
waves a hand at her, but keeps his eyes on Never mind
Never mind
He points a finger at 's face, which is attempting a version of 's imposing glacial stars, but frankly, isn't quite making it
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on
Suddenly, he forms a fist with his unwounded arm and smashes it straight into 's face
is completely decked
grabs  by the shoulders and speaks urgently to her
You've done it before
You can do it again The three of them run back up the catwalk
spins wildly and a myriad of black beams flow from it
As they shine into the catwalk they become limbs like those that captured , but all with different tips; some are organic, vicious mouths, some are hooks or blades, some are faces, some are (as if  Is too angry to be thinking straight) beautiful flowers
The limbs fly up the catwalk, but the  have gained too great a start
The limbs retract rapidly into the black lights
staggers to his feet, just as  re-directs its energy into forming and projecting one much fatter limb
It is dirty pink and segmented, like a vast earthworm
The end peels back as it flies toward , revealing a cruel, metallic, and rapidly-spinning surgical saw
Just as  stands up straight, the limb smashes into the back of his skull
There is a distressing  noise as the limb seals itself fleshily to 's skull and the former surgeon twitches and dances in horrible involuntary movements as takes over what little mind remains
101     / ,  and  are running,  making the decisions as to direction
Down one corridor, blades and knives jut out from the opposite walls at random intervals and they have to weave at high speed between them
They negotiate the corridor successfully but, just as , bringing up the rear, emerges from it, she stumbles and half-falls
The re-structured  falls from her pocket and rolls back a few feet up the corridor
, who is nearest to her, helps her to her feet and, as she does so, catches sight of the  (or white diamond, as it is now)
She makes as it to go and get it
holds her arm
No
Come on
We have to get out of here
moves away with , but not without a backward glance and a puzzled expression
They all make another turning
Suddenly, when they are about halfway down this next corridor, a new gap opens up behind them in the wall and a terrible sucking noise is heard
Corridor debris disappears into the vacuum
Luckily,  has reached the end of the corridor and grasps the corner with one hand, seizing 's hand with the other
grabs  and the three of them flatten themselves against the wall, fighting against the suction
The force is tremendous and 's finger are slowly losing hold
102
/ on a hand picking up the re-structured  from the corridor floor they have just left
103
/ The sucking force is growing stronger by the second
Not only is 's right hand losing its grip on the edge of the wall, but his left arm - stretched tight as it clings to  and, via her,  - is bleeding profusely again
Suddenly,  appears at the top of the corridor next to
In her hand is the white diamond  that  had let drop
She stays just out of range of the sucking wind
She stares at 's weakening fingers and smiles
Oh, poor Larry
You never could hold on to anything for very long, could you
Suddenly, audaciously, his face set in a scowl of anger, lets go of the wall
Before she realises what is happening, he has grabbed 's wrist and pulled her off her feet into the corridor
He lets go almost immediately and with a superhuman effort grabs at the corner again before the wind can claim him and the girls
is not so lucky; without support or foothold, she is seized by the wind and hurtles to the gap in the wall
She manages to brake herself by flinging her arms out to either side of her
For a moment she is hold there and then the pressure begins to draw her in
In her left hand she still holds the , but her right hand is only a few inches from 's left
reaches her hand to her, not knowing  as the others do
Their fingers just manage to interlock when 's face registers a disbelieving shock
There is a terrible ripping sound
's new skin, so recently gained, is giving up its hold and has ripped right up the spine
is drawn from it
With a final, slurping sound, the skinned woman slips from the skin and disappears down the new corridor
The momentary break in tension allows  to make one last effort
He rounds the corner and pulls the girls after him
, finally, realising what has happened, screams in terror and disgust, especially when she looks at what she has brought round the corner in her hand
She drops 's skin to the floor as the three of them scramble to their feet and begin to run again
Still clutched in the skin's hollow fingers is the white diamond
As they turn another corner, they see, very far in the distance, a glimmer of light
points excitedly
My God, it's her room
Let's go
He starts urging the girls down the corridor - a long and very narrow one - but  shows some resistance
No
No, there's something wrong
Before they can discuss it, a new rushing sound is heard
They look back
Hurtling towards them is the  from
screams
Jesus
No more arguments
Just
They begin one last panic-fuelled run down the narrow corridor, the  at their heels
The sequence is equivalent to 's pursuit by the  in , the twist here being that as they approach the entrance into 's room the walls of the corridor, already thin, begin to close together
is bringing up the rear (the corridor is now so narrow only single file is possible) and he can almost feel the ' breath on his neck
Go
Go
Go
Go
Go
Finally, almost impossibly, they reach the gap in the wall
tumbles through, then , and finally
Less than a micro-second after  has made it, the walls seal themselves
104
'     (2nd ) As we see clearly the room they have come into, we perhaps share the feeling that  expressed in the corridor; Something Is Wrong
The tiles that make up the floor are patterned as before but the individual tiles are larger
The room itself seems more spacious, the ceiling higher
There is a bowl of flowers by the window
The flowers were in full bloom before their trip to Hell but now they seem long dead
The audience have to notice most of this for themselves because , , and  are too relieved by, and tired from, their escape to take this in immediately
seats himself in the chair,  perches on the end of 's bed however walks straight across to her window
She is the first to notice anything
She stares at the flowers
Tiffany
rises from the bed and joins  by the window
But these were
Daddy
rises to his feet
Just as he stands, a fleeting expression of bewilderment crosses his face
He strokes at his right arm with an unconscious gesture as he crosses the room
doesn't look at her father right away
These flowers
saw them just
She looks at her father
sea of sweat has broken out on his brow and face as he stares intensely at the flowers
's voice slows, begins to trail off
the day
before
yesterday Daddy
Daddy
's eyes close
His entire face screws up as if an excruciating pain just hit him
He clamps his arm across his chest, the hands clutching his shoulders
He opens his eyes and looks at  for a second, his expression one of surprise
Then his eyes roll up into the sockets and he collapses to the floor
has hardly had time to turn from the bowl of flowers before  is kneeling by her father
Daddy
is unconscious
gasps
looks up at her
Get help
's eyes widen
She rushes to the door and disappears into the corridor
Within two seconds we hear an emergency alarm go off and  re-enters the room
Pass me a pillow
does so and  places it under the head of , whose lips are now blue and who is breathing very shallowly
looks up at , despair in her eyes
What do you do
just don't know what to do
shakes her head helplessly
Suddenly, the door to the room flies open and two  - maybe Stan and Ollie from the carnival sequence - come in, complete with stretcher and gurney
They assess the situation with a glance and it is serious enough to make one of them break their professional silence
Coronary arrest
Let's be quick
They are good at their job - within seconds  is secured on the gurney and they head for the door,  and  behind them
The following exchanges are spoken on the move
Is he going to be 0
We just can't say
's on standby
They'll do what they can
But it's bad
The  exchange a glance and decide honesty is best
(gently but flatly) Yeah
It's bad
105 The elevator is uncomfortably full,  and  squashed up against the back while the  hold the gurney in the centre
The elevator is descending
The ride seems to take longer than it should, even though they are going to basement level;like the look of 's room, it's  normal but just different enough to make us slightly uneasy in an un-focused way
Eventually, though, it does come to a stop
squeezes 's shoulder sympathetically (
: 's character - it should be clear to the audience by this stage that, though she is still mute,  is now a responsive, more rounded character) The  wheel the gurney out of the elevator and the girls follow
106 The basement corridor is long, cavernous, and not very pleasant
It has a grimier, more uncared-for look than the upper floors and the high ceiling is covered with an intricate system of naked pipes and conduits
The  wheel  down this corridor, going so fast that and  are continually breaking into a trot to keep up with them
At the far and of the corridor are a set of double doors
The nearer they all get to these doors, the tackier the corridor seems to become
The walls now have pipes running over them, as well as the ceiling, and several of these pipes are dripping water into small pools on the corridor floor
The sound of these drips is artificially loud on the soundtrack
Finally, the doors are reached and the , ,  and disappear through them
107
- This is a small ante-room to the operating room which is beyond a further set of double doors
Without ceremony the two pass straight across this room to those doors and wheel the gurney through, one of them throwing back a parting remark to Wait out here
doctor will talk to you when we know more
The double doors part and close, giving just a glimpse of the operating room beyond, all lights, monitors and whirring machinery, and the several gowned and masked experts attending to
As the doors close,  turns to , expecting a long wait before anyone comes to speak to them
Surprisingly, though, the doors open again almost immediately and two figures step through
They, too, are masked and gowned in surgical green and very little of them is visible
Is he going to be all right
1st (matter of factly) No
He's not going to be all right
staggers visibly, shocked by this bluntness
Wh
1st No
He's going to die
He's got a ruptured aorta
He's going to die in agony
As he makes this speech, the mask of his colleague stains rapidly with blood, as if it is literally pouring from its mouth
Simultaneously, his own mask is slowly pierced by a score of nails bursting through from beneath
screams
The 1st   pulls the mask and cap away from its face - It is
His colleague does the same
It is the Oh, Fuck
She's had too much experience with these two to hesitate
She grabs 's arm and bursts through the double doors to the corridor
108 We are now looking along the corridor in the other direction - back towards the elevator
and  come into shot, running rapidly along the corridor
As they make their way, a rumbling, flatulent sound is heard from the overhead pipes and they all begin to drip blood not water
We hear the sound of the doors flying open behind them
and  reach the elevator
presses frantically on the call button, while  looks behind them with frightened eyes
'mon
'
The sound of steadily-pacing, purposeful feet is heard coming up the corridor, getting louder, coming closer
begins hammering on the closed elevator doors stifles a cry with her hand
Suddenly, the doors fly open
and  tumble into the elevator
109
('
) We see the door-frame of the elevator and the floor buttons beside it and, looking down the corridor through the open elevator doors,  and the   marching towards us
We also see ' finger jabbing frantically at the floor buttons
The doors are not closing
The  are getting very close
Finally, just as  breaks from his determined but medium- paced stride and speeds up eagerly for the last two or three yards, extending his arm as he does so, the door slams shut across our vision and we hear the elevator machinery start up
110 leans against the back wall of the elevator, breathing heavily
stands very still in the middle, a frozen expression of fear on her face
Faster, you bastard, faster
She slams her fist against the elevator wall
The elevator stops
Its lights flicker
Oh, Jesus
'm sorry
'm sorry
didn't mean it
The elevator starts again
It's 0
They can't beat an elevator
Not upstairs
It'll be
The lift stops, but this time it's where they want it
's finger hesitates over the   button
It'll be
She presses the button
111
(
) We are looking at the closed elevator door
When it opens we will be looking down the corridor on the main hospital floor - the floor with the girls' rooms on
The door flies open
lunges in at them
screams, but because of the eagerness of his lunge they are able to get around him as his impetus carries him to the back of the elevator
112 The door begins to close as the girls straighten up in the corridor and as   turns around to come back out at them
He tries to put his hand out to stop the door closing, but succeeds only in trapping his fingers in the door
, as soon as the doors began to close, had hit the button
Now, she squeals with horror as she realises what is about to happen
The elevator begins to descend - we can tell this because 's fingers move down to the floor and are then sliced off
The  run off down the corridor
This way
Short cut
They turn into a set of double doors leading to a large ward
113 and  enter the ward at a run and then slow down to a confused and horrified walk
Every bed in the ward is occupied, some by men, some by women, and every patient has in their hands, and is busily working on, a Despite this collective work-in, the  obviously still have the vicious characteristics they have previously demonstrated when used individually - as is witnessed by the ten or so patients who are struggling on with their work despite having one or two hooks and chains connecting their flesh to their
and  move slowly down the room, a look of incredulity on both their faces
Oh, Christ
This isn't just personal anymore
nods slowly, her eyes flicking back and forth across the ward
Suddenly, the wheelchair patient from the earlier scene in this ward, who has been between two of the beds on one side of the ward, cuts across the ' path
He too has a  on his lap
As he passes in front of them, he looks at them, giggles in an unmistakably insane fashion, and gives them a conspiratorial wink
Then he simply proceeds to the other side of the ward
second or so after this, as the  edge down the middle of the room, they hear a rushing sound behind the double doors they are heading towards
Suddenly, the doors slam open and revealed in the doorway is But he is not standing there
He is hovering about two feet off the floor
The umbilical limb that connects him to  is still at the back of his skull
His face is contorted in a grin of manic glee as he floats three or four feet into the ward
The Doctor is in
He laughs, and the sound is far from human
and stare at him
Oh, shit
looks sharply at  for a second,  as if she is about to comment on her re-found voice, but instead simply nods
She takes her friend's hand and the  begin to walk very slowly backwards to the far end of the ward
is too enraptured of his new power to pay attention to specific victims and so makes no move to stop the ' slow retreat
Suddenly his palms erupt into a writhing mass of tentacle-like limbs as his head tips back to emit a wide band of 's black light at the ceiling, accompanied by, renewed inhuman laughter
Taking this as their cue, the  turn and bolt for the doors at the far and of the ward and exit through them
The limbs extrude from 's palms only twelve inches or so and are all quite thin, but they all have independent movement and they all have various surgical-like, gleaming tips floats over to the nearest bed
He looks at the patient and then looks at the bladed tips of his new limbs and, as if addressing them, speaks
recommend amputation
There is another burst of laughter as the limbs fly at the patient, writhing, twitching, slashing, and slicing
114 The  run wildly along the corridor, not knowing  is working his way through his former patients
They come to another door and pause
They look back down the corridor to ensure they are not visible as they hide and  pushes the door open with the flat of her hand behind her
Carefully, still looking down the corridor, they back into the room and let the door close
115
/ on the ' faces as the door closes in front of them
lets out a breath
Then they hear the rattling sound behind them
They swing round and the camera pulls out to take in the room
It is like the   in
The walls are black, the floor slimy, and the room filled with chains, hooks, and torture-pillars
And, in the room and staring at the , are the four
glances theatrically around the room, as if checking something
Oh
No Boxes
Such a shame
No more delays, Kirsty
No more teasing
Time to play
Time to play
looks at his unforgiving face and then her eyes suddenly widen as she thinks Of something
Wait
No more deals, Kirsty
It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining
No deals
Just information
Information
Free of charge
No strings
Just information
Go on
But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell
Carefully, making no fast movements,  reaches into her pocket where she placed the photograph from 's She brings out the picture that she realized earlier was of  and hands it to him
He takes hold of it and looks, his face registering nothing
What is this
Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank
No, No, this one didn't escape
You told me you'd always been in Hell
You were wrong
Look at it
'
Nonsense,
It's you
You ' always been as you are
You were Remember
Remember all your confusions
Think
The   strides across the room
Enough
She raises her hand towards
's arm flies out and stops her
Wait
He is staring at the photograph, that great immobile brow finally puckering, as if something is stirring
remember
You were  human
The other three  stop moving and stare at
Any advances they were making on  or  stop as the same dim, distant, recollection begins to stir within them
Suddenly, the door bursts open
is there, still floating, his voice still a mixture of hideous threat and insane joy
Tiffany
Come
He turns his palms downwards, mirroring his gesture in the hall of mirrors
lets out a moan of terror and shakes her head
One of the snake-like limbs from 's palms flies towards 's face
Before anybody can react, its scalpel tip has sliced an inch or so off several strands of her hair
Tiffany
Come
throws her arms around the cowering  and snarls at her tormentor
Leave her alone, you asshole
makes no reply, but suddenly several more limbs fly towards the  and begin to weave in front of 's face like snakes awaiting their moment
At this stage, the camera   the watching
He lets the photograph of his past life flutter to the floor
looks up at the tiny noise this makes and his eyes meet '
He turns more fully to face  and the other who are now standing with their leader, and a strange smile crosses his face Oh,good
fight
Suddenly, the air is full of flying chains
is hooked everywhere
It is like a high-speed version of 's final re- capture in
The chains start tugging almost instantly
Is  about to be ripped apart
With contemptuous, dismissive speed, the limbs that ooze from 's palms have sliced the chains to pieces and, almost before we have time to realise that, three of them have lengthened, thickened, and hardened and have skewered the ,  , and  to the walls
The three limbs detatch themselves from
The three are all well above the floor, pinned and twitching like the rats in 's attic
As they die, they suddenly revert; there are three human corpses on the walls of the room
woman, a fat man, and a little boy
smiles
Be looks at  again and advances
Suddenly a heavy torture pillar smashes into him, knocking him slightly off-balance
is backing across the room, weaving pillars in front of him as he moves
moves forward, knocking them out of the way
As each pillar is knocked aside, 's face is more and more human
Finally, when the face we see is nearly that of the from the opening, he turns his head slightly away from the advancing  and finds 's eyes
look passes between them
Understanding
Gratitude
Friendship
Whatever emotion lies beneath it, it is clearly a cue and and  make a break for it, bursting through the door
Simultaneously to this,  and  find each other's eyes a final time
For a second, everything is still then a single bladed limb flies across the space between them and neatly and calmly slices 's throat open
The thin red line becomes a torrent of blood and the former lord of Hell falls dead at the feet of his successor
116 and  burst out into the corridor and almost fall over the
So what, girls
It's
for an ego-trip but it doesn't got the job done
Shaking their heads at the insanity, they run up the corridor
looks slightly distracted and when she speaks it is half to herself
have to go back
Or it'll never stop
(Confused) What are you talking
(to herself) 've got to finish it
Finish what
Even as  says this,  has moved past her and is resuming her run down the corridor
Tiffany
Wait
starts after her friend
They turn back into the main section of the corridor that contains their own rooms,  still four or five yards in front of reaches her room
The door is open
She goes in
second later,  follows
117
' enters the room
It is as we last saw it except that the walls have re-parted to give onto the corridors of Hell
Carefully and slowly,  moves across to the entrance and looks down it
She is rewarded with the sight of  just disappearing at the far end of the first corridor
With a grimace,  follows her in
118
/ 's skill at finding her way through puzzles means the are soon in the murkier corridors close to the Centre
Hell seems angrier now, steam is issuing in jets from the corridor walls, the cries of children are heard faintly on the soundtrack, 's breathing is more dominant, perhaps the light is even pulsing in time with it
is still several yards behind
takes a corner and is out of sight for a second or so
dashes around the corner to find  staring with distress at something on the floor
It is the skin ripped off  by the vacuum tunnel earlier
Oh, gross
bends down and retrieves the white diamond  from the empty fingers
What are you doing
What are  doing
looks at the  in her hand
When she speaks, it is not to  but to herself
can't do it here
have to go to it
119 spins and fires light in the centre, his machine-like breathing drowning all other sound
We are looking down the catwalk as  and  approach its edge
The beams of black light wash across their faces, as they passed over 's in the earlier scene
Images of horror freeze momentarily before them and then pass on, only to be replaced by others
'm scared
No
Don't let it
You've come this far
The  press on
Whether  is oblivious to their presence or simply doesn't consider them a threat, the beams stop striking the ' faces
Nevertheless, the mood remains ominous
The audience should feel something is about to happen
They are six feet from the lip of the catwalk
kneels and, holding the white diamond  in front of her, begins to move her fingers over it
The music box tune begins to play as the  begins to move
That 'something' that the audience was waiting to happen, suddenly does;  flies up from the abyss beside the catwalk
The vastness of the limb that seals him to  is now directly apparent; instead of merging into black light, the limb itself trails through the air over the huge distance to itself
One of the limbs from 's palms flies out and knocks the from 's hands
It rolls perilously close to the edge of the catwalk
grabs  and, dragging her to her feet, pulls her further back down the catwalk as  floats to a landing between them and the
Ah, girls
And how are we feeling today
The blades on the end of his limbs twitch eagerly
You have your whole lives behind you now
The limbs fly forward
screams and both girls run up the catwalk
About halfway back up, however,  stops, turns around, and begins to walk back
calls out
Tiffany
No
The camera stays with  as she makes her way back
's voice stays on the soundtrack for a time, imploring her friend to turn back and then simply stops
This should be abrupt enough to make the audience notice but smooth enough to avoid their attention leaving
waits, happy to see a patient so keen on the knife
Very slowly,  moves forward, inch by slow inch
This is something she  to do; the expression on her face is not determination but terror
And  is very happy to encourage this
Surgery is open, Tiffany
What was today's agenda
His scalpels flick in the air, making small slicing motions
Ah, yes
Evisceration
Still  comes forward, closer and closer until she is surely close enough to be grabbed
Suddenly, she is grabbed
But from behind, and by a human hand
gasps, and turns to see who has seized her
She screams
It is
The limbs retract into 's palms
He smiles
Doctor
've missed you
, having presumably just replaced her skin, is not quite as perfect as before; there are bloody lines like scars beneath her ears and chin as if the skin required some adjustment before being put on
moves forward, her left arm still holding , her smile returning '
knew you'd come back
'm a girl who keeps her promises
is right next to  now
Smoothly, she releases her grip on  and embraces  sensuously
He returns the embrace
They kiss
Unseen,  moves to the edge of the catwalk and picks up the Her fingers move over it, finding its solution
Suddenly, 's breath becomes a roar of anger and fear
breaks away from his kiss, his face a mixture of confusion and rage
plants both hands in the middle of his chest and pushes
He falls over the lip of the catwalk but, almost before he drops from sight, he is suddenly pulled backwards through the air, screaming, as 's limb retracts
jumps back
shouting
Do it, Tiffany
Do it
's fingers fly over the  and suddenly we see what is happening
The mountain-like  is following the movements of the small replica in 's hands
As  inverts the new configuration back towards a closed ,  too is being twisted and turned
Being closed
The whole centre of Hell shakes as if suffering a mild earthquake
and  almost lose their footing, but continues working
She is nearly, there
is halfway between its white diamond, majesty and a huge closed
takes her hands from the
It is done
The larger operates a few seconds behind it's control, so that we can inter- cut the final sliding and creaking into position with the following human drama; As  makes its final closing, the mild tremors of before become larger
Hell shakes violently and this time  does lose her footing
She looks set to tumble into the vast abyss to the side of the catwalk but just manages to catch hold of the edge with one hand
The small  flies from her hand and hurtles down into the miles of blackness below
dangles over the edge, her feet kicking wildly for a foothold that doesn't exist
Suddenly, a hand extends to her
She looks up
It is
For a second, nothing happens
Trust me
lifts one hand off the edge and grabs at 's proffered wrist
begins to pull up and for a moment it seems the crisis is over
Then a terrible and familiar ripping noise is heard: The skin of the arm that  clings to begins to rip free at the shoulder
Gradually, like a shirt's threads unraveling, it comes off
's weight pulls it clear like a very long and very tasteless evening glove and it seems she will finally make the long drop
At the final second, as the arm-skin comes off, the entire skin flies from the body and falls with its arm into the abyss
screams
She is going to die
But suddenly the two arms that have Just lost their skin fly out again and catch her fingers
is hauled over the edge and staggers to her feet, staring into the-bloodied face of , who had donned 's skin to help her friend
The two girls share a quick and joyous embrace and then run rapidly up the catwalk
The camera stays with
The rumbling stops
And the mountainous  creaks into its final, sealed position
120 on a bowl of beautiful flowers, sitting on a shelf in the recovery room
The camera  out to let us see , pale, drawn, but basically okay, in the room's single bad
He is wired up to various drips and monitors
Sunlight is flooding into the room from a window and the camera continues its  up to and through this window to; 121 is kissing  on the cheek
is dressed in smart clothes and has a small traveling bag in her hand
So
What're you going to do
Open up a games-shop somewhere
Sell jigsaw puzzles
gives a smile
Oh, yeah
There is a slightly awkward pause
Well
'bye
It's been Hell
They share a rueful knowing smile, like the smile of soldiers back from a war who say goodbye on a dockside and know they will never meet again
turns and walks down the long path to the hospital gates
watches her for a few moments and then turns and re-enters the institute
The camera  back to the window of the   and we watch through the window as  enters the room
She bends to kiss her father's cheek
slips an arm around her shoulders and they embrace
The camera moves away again
122
's The camera  slowly up 's hallway
The hallway is lined with packing cases filled with items from the house is shoving something into one of the cases
As the camera moves past him, he speaks
So whose was all this shit
The camera reaches the doorway of the   as an answering voice is heard
2nd Not our problem
The  continues into - 123 and we see the 2nd
He is crouching over the mattress which is still in the middle of the floor of the otherwise empty room
2nd Gimme a hand with this
Almost faster than the eye can register it, a hand shoots out from the mattress and grabs his wrist
He has about half a second to issue a strangled shout and then, hideously quickly, a matter of two seconds or so, his body is drained of all life and the dried husk collapses to the floor
The first  appears hurriedly in the doorway and then freezes, an awestruck expression on his face
is rising, headfirst and upright, from the centre of the mattress
The movement is smooth, magical, unsettling
It is graceful but not slow
is fully fleshed, fully skinned, and fully dressed
She is in a replica of the dress  bought for her, but this one is jet black
She looks fabulous
As the  stands open-mouthed, her feet clear the mattress
But they don't stop there
She slows to a graceful halt about six inches above the mattress
She stretches and flexes her arms sensually
Than her head swivels and her excited, aroused eyes meet those of the
'm Julia
Love me
Suddenly, her head tips back and, accompanied by 's delighted laughter, a wide beam of Hell's black light flies at the ceiling from her open mouth
Instantaneously, it spills across the ceiling and falls,like a fountain of blood, across the screen
