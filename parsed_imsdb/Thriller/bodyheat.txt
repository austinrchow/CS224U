: Flames in the night sky
Distant
, we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense, black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of Miranda Beach, Florida
We're watching from across town
The sound of a bathroom  comes to a dripping stop at about the same time we see the naked back and head of We continue to    -- '  - Racine, dressed in undershorts, is standing on the small porch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house
Racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at the fire
We've passed him now, into the bedroom of the apartment, and the shape of a young woman, , flashes by, drying her body with a towel
(
) My God, it's hot
stepped out of the shower and stared sweating again
It's still burning
Jesus, it's bigger
And  thought you were making me hear those sirens
(she giggles) What is it
The Seawater Inn
My family used to eat dinner there twenty-five years ago
Now somebody's torched it to clear the lot
Angela reappears briefly, gathering her clothes
She sits on an unseen bed to get dressed
(
) That's a shame
Probably one of my clients

(') wouldn't mind having breakfast
What do you care
You're watching the fire
You're done with me
'm just getting into my uniform here
She is, in fact, slipping on the blouse of her Avis Rent- a-Car uniform
There's a smile on her lips as she buttons up, watching Racine
You've had your fun
You're spent
(trying for a straight face) 'll just slip into my uniform here and slip away
My history's burning up out here
Hey,  don't mind
'm leaving
Why do they make these damn skirts so hard to zip
Now, for the first time, Racine turns to look at   her
She is sitting on the edge of the bed, half into   her uniform
Racine smiles broadly at the  sight and   moves into the room
He pushes her back and  they both   disappear from sight, fabric rustling
Where's your hat
(
) Hey
hey
(giggling) don't wrinkle it
(
) 'You're spent
' Where'd you hear that
We are left looking out over the porch at the night
And we go back there, across the rooftops, to the flames
- An Assistant County Prosecutor named   has been conferring at the bench with   and now they both wait as Racine comes into view to join them
The Judge is irritated

Racine,  do no longer care whether these alleged toilets were () Converted to  by www

think we're wasting our time here
It's pretty clear your client has attempted to defraud the county in a not very ingenious manner
(he nods at Lowenstein) The Assistant Prosecutor has made what  consider a generous offer
And given that you've failed to generate even the semblance of a defense -- Judge Costanza, perhaps when 've presented all -- Yeah, yeah
If  were you, 'd recommend to your client that held quickly do as Mr
Lowenstein here has suggested -- plead nolo contendre, file Chapter Eleven and agree never to do business with Okeelanta County again
Racine is surprised and pleased
You would look favorably on that
(nods) He can walk
But don't test my patience for even five more minutes
If he hesitates, 'll nail him
'll talk to him
Racine starts to turn
Mr
Racine
Next time you come into my courtroom  hope you've got either a better defense or a better class of client
Lowenstein smiles
Thank you, Your Honor
Racine goes back to his client, a Businessman of enormous confidence and extravagantly untrustworthy appearance

'   -   - Racine and Lowenstein are seated at the counter
Racine drinks beer while Lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea very rapidly and signals for another
This place is across the street from the courthouse/police station and there are plenty of lawyers and cops around, several of whom acknowledge Lowenstein and Racine with pats or nods
single unit air conditioner is blowing away above the door, but it can't compete with the blasts of hot air that come in with each new patron
All of these people, like the pedestrians outside the window, have stripped down to essentials In the infernal heat
The lawyers all carry their Jackets, but even so their shirtsleeves are sweaty
The town is sizzling
--  think 've underestimated you, Ned
don't know why it took me so long
You've started using your incompetence as a weapon
(smiles) My defense was evolving
You guys got scared
Costanza doesn't like me
What'd  do to him
He's an unhappy man, Thinks he should be Circuit Court by now
Here he is in a state with really top-notch corruption and he's stuck with the county toilets
(he drinks) 'm surprised you weren't in on that toilet caper
Could have been that quick score you've always been searching for
Maybe Costanza was in on it
That's why he was mad
, the owner of the coffee shop, writes and places separate checks in front of the two men
What's the word from the hallowed halls of justice
Anything juicy
Maybe Stella was in on it

You don't like it there's lots of other places
They don't have you
Gotta go
He stands fishing for change, but Racine takes his check and places it with his own
Lowenstein nods and moves for the door
You can't buy me
No sirree,  don't come cheap
Just before he reaches the door he does a strange thing -- he takes several graceful dance steps in the Astaire manner
Lowenstein, you're a fag
Lowenstein spins out the door, where he is blasted by the heavy air
His body droops as he disappears
Why does he do that
He's pretty good, that's the weird part
Did you hear about Dr
Block
No
Do  want to
(leans toward him, confidential) Agnes Marshall
(the thought disgusts him) That must have been Mrs
Block's idea, some kind of punishment
It was
How'd you know
Christ, you're plugged in better than me
So you must know about Mrs
Block's friend in Ocean Grove
Racine winces, gets up, and puts money on the counter
He lights a cigarette

Stella, this is beneath even you
Things must be slow
Stella agrees with a shrug as Racine heads for the door
It's the heat
- Racine makes his way up First to the corner of Main and crosses diagonally to his building on Main
He is well- known here, greeted through glass by many of the shop owners
The heat dominates much of the pantomimed conversation
Racine goes in a doorway and heads up the stairs to his office
'  - Racine's secretary, , is behind the desk in the modest reception room
She's a pretty girl barely past twenty
She pushes some phone message slips toward Racine and nods toward the sofa
middle-aged woman client, , sits there clutching a walking stick
Her face suddenly is contorted in pain
Racine glances meaningfully at Beverly then turns his full solicitous charm on Mrs
Singer
Mrs
Singer,  would have gladly come to the house
He helps her up and leads her slowly to his office
No
no, the doctor says  should walk and  had some shopping
Not that that quack knows what he's talking about
tell you, Mr
Racine, 'm not sure his testimony is going to be very useful
Don't worry about it
'll find you a doctor who's more understanding
Is it bad today
Oooh, you can't imagine
Nothing can make up for the pain they've caused me
How well  know
We'll sue those reckless bastards dry
Excuse my language

As Mrs
Singer disappears into the office, Racine flashes a grin at Beverly
Don't apologize
That's the kind of attitude you've got to have these days
- The hottest January in fifty years has brought the crowds to the beach in search of relief
But they've been disappointed
Even the breeze off the ocean seems blown from a hair dryer
Still, the nights are a trifle better and the Beachfront, the penny arcades, the ice cream stands and bars are busy, even now in the middle of the week
Racine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette, idly watching the passing parade
There is a free band concert in progress at the band shell
Racine wanders in that direction
- The Miranda Beach High School Orchestra is playing to a full, sweating house; the audience is a sea of orange programs fluttering away as fans
People come and go frequently
The atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music the band is playing now
Racine leans against the back rail, smoking, his eyes playing over the scene with no expectations
Then, down near the center aisle, a  rises
As the band plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in a simple white dress, moves down the aisle
She moves wonderfully
The dress clings to  her body in the heat
Racine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly toward him
She passes within a few inches of him, her eyes lowered
Racine's body sways a moment as she goes by, as though buffeted by some force
But they do not touch
She goes out onto the Beachfront walkway
- The Woman, , has walked to the rail
She stands there now lighting a cigarette
She presents her face to the ocean, hoping for a breeze
We move in on her, with Racine
Racine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her
She looks at him and, for an instant, her eyes race over his body, then she looks back at the ocean

You can stand here with me if you want, but you'll have to agree not to talk about the heat
She looks at him, and there is something startling about the directness of her gaze
When she speaks, she is cool without being hostile
'm a married woman
Meaning what
Meaning 'm not looking for company
She turns back toward the ocean
Then you should have said -- ''m a happily married woman
' That's my business
What
How happy  am
And how, happy is that
She looks at him curiously
She begins walking slowly along the rail
He walks too
You're not too smart, are you
Racine shakes his head "no
" like that in a man
What else you like -- Ugly
Lazy
Horny
got 'em all
You don't look lazy
Racine smiles

Tell me, does chat like that work with most women
Some
If they haven't been around much
wondered
Thought maybe  was out of touch
She stops again at the rail as a small breeze blows in from the ocean
She turns her back to it and, with her cigarette dangling from her lips, she uses both hands to lift her hair up off her nape
She closes her eyes as the air hits her
Racine watches very closely
How 'bout  buy you a drink
told you
've got a husband
'll buy him one too
He's out of town
My favorite kind
We'll drink to him
He only comes up on the weekends
Matty lets her hair fall and again begins moving down walkway
She drops her cigarette and steps on it
'm liking him better all the time
You better take me up on this quick
In another forty-five minutes 'm going to give up and walk away
You want to buy me something
'll take one of these
They have come upon a Vendor selling snow cones
What kind
Cherry

(to Vendor) Make it two
The Vendor scoops and pours as Racine lays some change on the cart
(to Matty) You're not staying in Miranda Beach
(she shakes her head "no") would have noticed you
Is this town that small
Racine hands her a snow cone
They walk over to the rail
Racine watches her eat the snow cone with enormous interest
Pinehaven
You're staying up in Pinehaven, on the waterway
(she gives him a look, surprised) You have a house
How'd you know
You look like Pinehaven
How does Pinehaven look
Well tended
She looks out at the ocean
Yes, 'm well tended, all right
Well tended
What about you
Me
need tending
need someone to take care of me
Rub my tired muscles
Smooth out my sheets
Get married
just need it for tonight

For the first time, Matty laughs
moment later, she spills the snow cone over the front of her dress
It makes a bright red stain against the white
The thin material clings to the line of her breast
Good
Nice move, Matty
Matty
like it
Right over your heart
At least it's cool
'm burning up
asked you not to talk about the heat
Would you get me a paper towel or something
Dip it in some cold water
Racine starts toward the restroom nearby
Right away
'll even wipe it off for you
You don't want to lick it
This causes a momentary hitch in Racine's retreat, but then he hurries off
' Racine comes in, snaps some paper towels from the rack and turns on the water
The room is full of smoke fifteen-year-old Boy is leaning against the wall
After looking Racine over a second, he brings the smoking joint he's been holding behind his back into view and takes a toke
He nods at Racine, who nods back and stands up with his wet towels
As he walks out, Racine takes a deep breath
- Racine comes out of the structure
And stops
Matty is gone
Racine  looks around without much hope
Finally, he puts a wet paper towel to the back of his neck
We begin to  a strange, measured thumping, and then -- (82ND ) - Racine is running
The  is the sound of Racine's battered running shoes hitting the weathered wooden planks of the Boardwalk
Converted to  by www
screentalk
org             12
Racine wears old gym shorts and a torn tee-shirt with "
" fading from the front
The raised wooden walk works its crooked way through lush, tropical vegetation, first coming close to the wide, white beach, then jutting back inland, swallowed by greenery, then shooting out again toward the sea
Racine hits this last stretch at top speed and launches himself flying out onto the gleaming sand
- Racine is running on the sand now, on a raised, hardened section that bisects the beach
His shoes make a weird whooshing  each time they break the compacted surface and sink an inch below
The sun is just rising from the ocean to his right, yet the day is already broiling
Racine's shirt is drenched
The  is hypnotic, steady; his expression indicates that it is just this sound which keeps him going
/  - Further on, Racine runs by the Band Shell where he'd seen Matty
- The  returns, as Racine runs the long, straight pier directly out to sea, toward the rising sun lifeguard boat with an outboard motor is on the left of the pier
Racine watches it as he runs until it disappears beneath him, then reappears on his right and turns out to sea, so that it is running beside him
Racine speeds up, really kicking, racing the boat to the end of the pier
The Lifeguard on board isn't even aware of Racine, but he beats the runner nonetheless, then veers off to continue his business
Racine pulls up, breathing hard
He walks it off a bit, watching the boat, then turns and starts walking back along the pier
He reaches into the waistband of his shorts and takes out a pack of cigarettes
'  - Racine is behind the desk
Occupying the two seats in front are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce
They are arguing now, each trying to convince Racine of their view
Racine nods occasionally, looking from one to the other
But he is also looking between them, through the open door out to the reception room, where his secretary Beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of a filing cabinet
Her back is turned and her jeans are tight across the bottom
There's nothing especially provocative about her pose
She's just there
Working away

Racine walks across his office and closes the door
He goes back to his seat
The couple continues
- Another concert going on, a trio   of musicians
Racine moves down the sidewalk away from   the audience
He looks around as he lights a cigarette
She is nowhere in sight
Racine opens the door to his car,   a nicked-up red '64 Stingray
- Racine drives past a neat sign -- "You are entering Please drive carefully" There's money here
Many of the homes are not visible from the street -- only their gates announce their presence
Those that can be seen are sprawling and lavish
The Waterway appears to the left
large white yacht cruises slowly by
'  - Racine sits in bed smoking a cigarette
At the mirror, a Nurse in a fresh white uniform steps into her white shoes and begins attaching her cap with bobby pins
-  - Dark
Almost classy
The place is half full
Matty is drinking at the end of the bar, her cigarettes next to her glass
The bar chairs near her are empty
Racine comes in, looks around, walks over and sits in the seat next to her
She looks up, surprised
Look who's here
Isn't this a coincidence
Racine looks at her, almost as though he can't place her
But he doesn't push that effect hard
He lights a cigarette
know you
You're the one that doesn't want to talk about the heat
Too bad
'd tell you about my chimes
What about them

The wind chimes on my porch
They keep ringing and  go out there expecting a cool breeze
That's what they've always meant
But not this summer, This summer it's just hot air
Do  remind you of hot air
The Bartender has come up
Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks
(to Matty) Another
She thinks, then nods her agreement
The Bartender moves away
What are you doing in Pinehaven
'm no yokel
Why,  was all the way to Miami once
There are some men, once they get a whiff of it, they'll trail you like a hound
The Bartender brings their drinks and leaves
'm not that eager
What is your name, anyway
(offers his hand) Ned Racine
Matty Walker
She takes his hand and shakes it
Racine reacts strangely to her touch and doesn't let go right away
She gently frees it, then refers to his look as she picks up her drink -- Are you all right

(laughs) Yes
My temperature runs a couple degrees high
Around 100 all the time  don't mind it
It's the engine or something
Maybe you need a tune-up
Don't tell me -- you have just the right tool
don't talk that way
How'd you find me, Ned
Racine gives her a look
This is the only joint in Pinehaven
How'd you know  drink
You seemed like a woman with all the vices
(smiles) You shouldn't have come
You're going to be disappointed
Racine looks out over his drink
Several of the Men in the place are looking at them
(referring to the men) What'd  do
(indicating Racine's chair) lot of them have tried that seat
You're the first one 've let stay
(spotting a few more) You must come here a lot
Most men are little boys

Maybe you should drink at home
Too quiet
Maybe you shouldn't dress like that
This is a blouse and a skirt don't know what you're talking about
You shouldn't wear that body
Natty leans back in her seat and glances down at herself
She's magnificent
don't like my body much
It's never been right
Racine has been looking at her body too
With her line, he just laughs
Matty watches him, then leans over her drink
Her tone is different
Sometimes,  don't know
get so sick of everything, 'm not sure care anymore
Do you know what mean, Ned
(he's not sure) know that sometimes the shit comes down  heavy  feel like  should wear a hat
Matty laughs, studies him
Yeah, that's what  mean
Ratty drains her glass and stubs out her cigarette
think 'll get out of here now
'm going home
'll take you
have a car

'll follow you
want to see the chimes
You want to see the chimes
want to hear them
She looks at him a long time
That's all
If  let you, that's all
(gestures his innocence) 'm not looking for trouble
(very serious) mean it
like you
But my life is complicated enough
Racine again accepts
This is my community bar
might have to come here with my husband some time
Would you leave before me
Wait in your car
know it seems silly
don't know who we're going to fool
You've been pretty friendly
She gives him a look and then slaps him hard
Everyone turns toward them
(steadily) Now leave me alone
She stands up, takes her purse and her cigarettes, and walks to the other end of the bar, where she sits down
Racine watches her with amazed eyes
He stands up and throws some money on the bar
(angry) Lady, you must be some kind of crazy
He stalks out of the bar

'  - on his face as he drives
His look is intense, expectant
He's feeling lucky as he watches up ahead
'  out the windshield
Matty's shiny Mercedes 450  is gliding down the road ahead of him
She puts on the blinker, slows and turns into a gated drive
The drive is canopied by heavy trees, the vegetation crowding the road with a primeval lushness
The headlights create sinuous welcoming shadows
It is as though Racine were entering some separate, parallel, jungle world
Eventually the house comes into view
(
) Jesus
Matty's car swings around in the parking area and stops
Racine pulls the Stingray up next to it, facing the other way
He watches Matty slide her long legs out of the car
She glances at Racine and for an instant there is a hint of self-consciousness under the weight of his gaze
We begin to  the soft tinkling of chimes
-   - Racine follows closely behind Matty as they go up the stairs
At the door, Matty turns suddenly and looks at Racine
Remember your promise
Racine agrees
Matty looks him over a moment, then turns to unlock the door
/   - Matty comes in and puts her purse on a hall table as Racine moves forward to look around
Despite the night gloom, it's clear the place is expensively decorated in a manner entirely consistent with the exterior of the house
Fine antiques, carefully chosen fabrics, and a meticulous selection of accessories have given the place the look of an affluent home of Thirties America
And yet the overall effect is almost contemporary, so burnished are the woods, so fresh all the elements
It works
Just like my place
Matty gives him a searching look, then      leads   him up the stairs, flipping on only an occasional      light   in their path
In the second floor hall, Matty       moves   to the front of the house
Racine glances into the       gloom   that hides Matty's bedroom

No help
She goes home nights
You're not nervous alone
Matty pauses at the doors to the porch, unlocking them, and looks at Racine as though she barely understands the question
No
- The  is distinct out here
Matty and Racine come out onto the porch
There are about thirty wind chimes of various, lovely designs -- crystal, metal, wood hanging at intervals from the rim of the wide porch awning, completely encircling Matty and Racine
Halfway down the long lawn is a white gazebo
Beyond it, the waterway is shimmering in the moonlight
At the edge of the water is a small boat house
Racine walks along under the chimes, looking up at them
smile plays across her face
He looks back at Matty, You do have chimes
He looks out at the boat house
What's that
gazebo No, out there
Boat house
What is in there
Boat
Racine moves back and stands very close to her
He looks at her in the moonlight, but she concentrates on the distant water

It's a mess
There's a row boat, a lot of lounge chairs
things like that
Racine puts his hand up under her hair, on her nape
She closes her eyes at his touch, then moves away, as though by an act, of will, to the door, half opening it
think you should go now
just got here
You've seen them
Please go
Racine steps toward her, but she ducks inside and moves through the intermittent light of the hall and down the steps
Racine follows her
Matty stops at the entry hall, leaning against the wall
You didn't bring me here to see your wind chimes
He puts an arm on each side of her, caging her against the wall
She looks up at him
Yes,  did
said what  meant
Do you ever do that
No
not very often
He kisses her light on the forehead
Again she reacts, but fights it
don't think you want me to go
Yes
Please
He kisses her lightly on the nose
There's nothing to be afraid of
There is for me

Matty slips under his arms and quickly steps out the front door
She stands just outside watching him
Racine shakes his head, goes out there
- Racine stops next to Matty
She doesn't move away
Thank you
'm sorry,  shouldn't have lot you come
Racine looks at her a long time
You're not so tough after all, are you
No
'm weak
She kisses him on the lips and steps quickly inside the front door
She closes it, looks through the window at him, then moves away
- Racine stands looking at   the door a  few moments
Then he walks to his car
Again    he stops
He looks back at the house
The wind picks up    a bit and  the  of the wind chimes gets louder
And then  louder
Racine goes back up onto the porch fast
He goes to the front door and looks through the window
- '
Matty is standing at the bottom of the stairs in the hall
She is looking directly at the front door
Frozen in the spot
Racine tries the door
It's locked
He shakes it hard, but it's solid
He looks to his left
There are windows down the wall there
He moves to them
They go into the living room but their shutters are closed
He looks through a broken slat at Matty, who watches him from the same spot, through the living room door
Racine tries them
They won't budge
Racine moves to his right past the front door, to the windows off the dining room
He pushes at them as his eyes lock with Matty, who watches from the hall
The windows won't move, Racine spins and picks up the nearest object, a wooden rocking chair
He lifts it, turns and smashes the big window
Glass showers into the dining room
Matty watches
She hasn't moved

Racine pushes the broken window out of his way
He comes in, like a violent gust of wind
Racine crosses the dark living room  fast
As he reaches Matty, she lifts her arms to match  his embrace
They come together hard and tight
They   kiss
And kiss again
Her hands travel over his body, as  though she's wanted them there for a long time
They turn once slowly along the wall, into the dimness of the central hall
Then he rotates her body away from him, holding her close
Yes, yes
Then she is just nodding
Racine puts his face deep into her hair, closing his eyes as the smell of her washes over him
Matty turns in his arms and kisses him hard
Racine pulls her close to him and they sink to the floor
That's right
that's right
Matty's face, a look that might be anguish
She bites her lip in expectation
Racine moves over her
Please, please
She pulls him tightly to her, clinging like a drowning woman
: '  - Racine and Matty lie under a sheet on her big bed
Her eyes are closed
There are more wind chimes on the    second floor of the verandah, which is off this room, and   Racine is listening to their
Racine looks over    in that direction
'
The moonlit, sheer white curtains on the window roil to a light breeze
Racine's gaze travels over the luxurious bedroom; here too, it is in the Thirties style
Their clothes are haphazardly thrown across a divan and on the floor nearby
delicate fern sways in the wind
Finally, he is looking at a lovely writing desk against the far wall
Some tissue-thin stationery flaps in the breeze, kept in place by the weight of a pen
Then, as he looks, the paper stops flapping and the chimes gradually
Racine looks toward the window
It is still open, but the air had died

But didn't try hard enough to stop it
Because  wanted you
wanted you here, like this
This is bad for me
know it
Now nothing's going to be the same anymore
, we see them framed by the bed
- Near the front gate of  the Walker place, a heavyset, middle- aged woman, ,   ' , has been waiting on a bus stop  bench
Now she lifts her tired body to board a public  bus
Down the Street, just around a corner, Racine watches her go
He puts the Stingray in gear and drives to the Walkers
'   - Lights are going on across the waterway, sending shimmers toward the boat house
'   - We're looking out a dusty window at the waterway
We Racine and Matty disentangle and roll apart o

, Racine grunting his exhaustion
After a moment, Racine rises up into frame, looking happy
He looks down to where he was and rests against the wall
like this place
It's got a nice feel
(
) You were on top
So it could use a better mattress
See to it, will you

She pulls him down
On the lounge cushions that are spread across the floor, Matty rolls on top of Racine
Racine reacts with exaggerated pain to the roughness of the cushions
Jesus,  think you're right -- (he rolls over her) -- you better be on the bottom
No, you misunderstood -- (she rolls over him) -- this is my new saddle, and  just want to -- Wow
No,  must object -- Laughing, they roll again and we're on Racine's face as we: : '  - Racine's face; he is still rolling, but he is alone

He selects a cologne, is impressed by its expensive look, and slaps a little on his jaw
He doesn't like the smell
He closes the cabinet and moves back into the bedroom

Racine watches from across the room
What are you doing

You're afraid of your maid
That's right
My mother told me "knowledge is power

Is that why you've started smoking my brand
Matty straightens with an armload of sheets
No one must know
Promise me, Ned
No one
He promise with a gesture

He throws his jacket across a chair
Out the windows to the porch, the sun is rising out of the Atlantic
Racine goes there and closes the curtains
In the gloom he walks to his bed and sits on the edge, kicking off his shoes
He picks up his alarm clock and begins setting it
- / - Racine has just parked his car and is walking back across the lawn
Matty is standing in the gazebo, her back turned, looking out at the Waterway
She is dressed in white and from here she looks very much as she did when they first met

Mary Ann gives him a salacious smile
Maybe you were supposed to deliver it next door

Unbeknownst to either of them, Matty has been watching from the lawn
Now she moves up into the gazebo
In her right hand she has an envelope, well-filled and sealed
block away from the station, the patrol car races toward an intersection
Suddenly, a  steps into the street, pushing a baby buggy
Pat slams on the brakes, and the car skids sideways toward the intersection, where it rocks onto two wheels and stops just a few yards short of the buggy
Sam sticks his head out the window
Are you crazy, lady
Didn't you hear the siren
The woman dives to the ground as the  sits up in the buggy -- he is a midget with a cigar in his mouth and a tommy gun in his hands
Pat jerks Sam to the floor just as the midget opens fire
The midget riddles the car with bullets
Headlights explode, windows are smashed, the grill is torn to shreds, and steam mushrooms into the air

All four tires are flattened, a bumper is sheared off, and still the blasting goes on

The sedan speeds away, and Pat and Sam climb out of the rubble, unhurt but very shaken
: ' Siren off, Tracy cuts the motor and silently glides into Cullen Park, stopping just under a low-hanging weeping willow
Approaching the boathouse carefully, Tracy takes out his pistol
The front door is ajar
Tracy pushes it, and it creaks open
He enters cautiously
The boathouse is dark, lit only by moonlight and park lights that shine through the windows
Tensely, Tracy listens for sounds, then moves very carefully past stacked up rowboats and canoes
Traced against a window at the far end of the boathouse, Tracy sees the silhouette of a man
Gripping his pistol, he moves silently toward that silhouette, closing in on it while keeping alert for movement
Ned, this is Mary Ann
Matty hands the envelope to Mary Ann, who puts it in her purse

Ned made me feel very welcome

There is a pregnant pause as Mary Ann looks him over, fighting some private amusement

She pecks Matty on the cheek, then steps close to Racine to shake his hand
You two have fun now
She's smiling as she leaves the gazebo and walks across the lawn
Matty  takes Racine's arm as they watch Mary Ann get into her little sports car, which has been pulled up close to the house
She pulls out waving

On the floor beside the tub is the container that catches the ice from a refrigerator's automatic icemaker
You're killing me
Is there any more ice

Racine gropes for the ice container and dumps the remaining ice cubs Into the tub with them
Matty snatches one out of the water and holds it to her forehead
He's coming up tomorrow

There's something dangerous about the man and it's perfectly distilled in his smile, which is quick, frequent and vaguely threatening

Walker looks at Racine and laughs
As he begins to speak, he focuses intently on Racine
He seems to be trying to communicate something other than what he's saying
You wouldn't believe the dorkus she was with when  met her
The guy came to us with a business proposition
We're always looking for opportunities
If the conditions are right
We're willing to take an occasional risk, if the downside isn't too steep
But this guy hadn't done his homework, he didn't know the bottom line

Matty grasps his face in her hands and looks into his face
Why, Ned
What's happened
Because we're going to kill him
We both know that
Matty's face looks different than we've seen it
There's a fire burning behind there and the heat it's throwing is bringing her equal portions of dread and relief

Whatsa matter, you can't think with a little music

Racine nods then duplicates the clipping
Teddy goes back to his stool, slapping the beat of the music on his thigh

He listens for sounds from below
He starts down the steps in the dark

The thrill of the hunt is in Edmund's eyes
The downstairs is thick with ominous shadows
At the bottom of the steps, he stops and listens again
He moves in two quick steps to the entry hall and looks into the living room and dining room
He seems to hear something at the rear of the house
He turns and moves back along the central hall, very slowly

He brings it down fast toward Edmund's head
Edmund reacts instinctively, raising his arm, the arm that holds the gun, to protect himself
The wooden plank smashes down -- half its force taken by Edmund's forearm, half by his head
The gun  once
One small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night
Edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner
Edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp
But he is coming on like a crazed beast
His glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine around the legs
With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs out
Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank
Matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out
Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might, crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor
Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine even closer
Racine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his head back
The glasses fly away and Racine loses his hold
Edmund comes on

Edmund hadn't mentioned anything about it to me
Hardin looks at Racine a beat, but Racine has nothing to say
Mrs
Walker explained to me that when she and her husband decided to make some minor changes, they just took care of it up here for simplicity's sake
And, indeed, as you know, the new will is almost identical to the old but for the disposition of a few items
(to the group in general) At the risk of oversimplifying, the thrust of the will is to divide the estate in almost equal parts between Heather Kraft and Mrs
Walker
Would you agree with that assessment, Mr
Racine
Racine nods
Mmmm
And you witnessed the    signing by Edmund Walker along with   this Miss -- (glancing at papers on the desk) -- Mary Ann Simpson on July   twenty- first

Racine violated what's known as "the rule against perpetuities

It's a small thing, but it's the law
It forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations
Many general practitioner lawyers don't fully understand it
It doesn't come up much for them, because wills this complex are usually handled by estate departments in larger firms
Handled by lawyers who specialize in this type of work
Matty turns a confused look to Roz who returns it sympathetically
Hardin notes it
know this is terribly confusing, but if you'll bear with me spotted the problem right away, but since Edmund's intent was clear, thought it in everyone's best interest to try and get the will admitted into probate anyway, even though it was technically incorrect
knew that a probate judge in Miami would spot the mistake right away
That's all they do all day, they're expert
So  thought 'd bring it up here to Okeelanta County -- since Edmund had the residence here -- and see if could get lucky with a judge who didn't know estate law quite so well

Racine

She puts her head on his chest as Racine lights a cigarette
They already think you're involved
don't care
Great
There's nothing we can do about it now
In a little while we'll either have the money or we won't
It's out of our hands
Racine thinks about this awhile
He exhales a stream of smoke
fired the housekeeper
We can stay together as long as we want
We're all alone here now

'  - It's cramped, hot, cluttered
There is one other door out of the office
Grace has his feet up on his desk
He's nursing a bottle of Coke and looking at Racine, who stands across the office, leaning on a file cabinet and glaring between sentences
Racine gives Lowenstein an ugly look then returns his attention to Grace
Racine is angry, but in control

Isn't that amazing
Miami
Jesus
'm handling the purchase of some property down there
'll be going back in the future
if that's all right, if it's still legal to go to Miami
There is silence
Lowenstein looks between them, speaks to Grace
He is mad
Nooo
No, 'm not mad
Why should be mad just because my friend here, who 've know for years, wants to know of my whereabouts on the night of our recent local murder
It's not so recent anymore
Maybe he's feeling some pressure
Grace is pained by all this, but his tone is scolding, defensive
You brought this on yourself, man
don't run this department, you know
There are people watching this thing
They hear you're out there banging the widow every night; it tends to call attention to you
So don't give me shit
Lowenstein goes to Oscar's desk and takes a pull from the bottle of Coke
That's my business
This whole damn case is getting crazy
(to Grace) Did you tell him about the glasses
Grace, exasperated, indicates that he didn't
Seems Walker always ware glasses -- steel-rimmed glasses
He was a real fanatic about them

Racine is still staring at Grace
He barely seems to pay attention
But there were none on the scene
Coroner says they should've been there
He says that even after the fire the frames should've been seared into his -- well, you don't want to hear the details
So what
So it's looking more and more like he was killed somewhere else and brought there in his own car
Your honey, his wife, says he left the house in the middle of the night driving himself to some mysterious meeting
Is that vague enough for you
Look, what is this
What do you want
Am  supposed to be an undercover agent for you guys, or something
Interesting choice of phrase
How 'bout tonight  ask her
'Say, did you kill your husband
My friends were just wondering
' Hey, that's an idea
Ask her where the glasses are, where she did it
Anything else 'm forgetting, Oscar
Just one thing
Lowenstein looks at him a long moment
Racine watches them
Oh, yeah
Right, right
You'll love this, Ned, this latest development
Maybe you'll be able to work up a little sympathy for us, see why Oscar here has a tendency to get carried away

This is from the sister-in-law, the Kraft woman
She's been driving me batty lately
She's convinced she ain't gonna be out into the will
It seems that a couple weeks before the murder, Walker's niece stayed up there for a while with your friend Matty
One night she waxes up, goes to see her aunt and catches the lady with some guy
The three men look at each other
Lowenstein breaks into laughter
Do you get it
In the act or some fucking thing
We haven't got all the details yet
Mrs
Kraft is bringing the little girl up here today to tell us her story
(to Grace) Oh, they're here
ran into them on the way in
They're waiting outside
Christ
'm not sure 'm up to dealing with this scene
There is a long pause
The other two look at Racine

She's a little wild
Why don't you slip out the back way here
Racine looks first at Lowenstein, then at Grace
Are we done here

Lowenstein nods
Racine opens the door and goes out of the office

Lowenstein watches him go
Heather is absorbed in a magazine and Roz is distracted with her cigarette
Racine could keep on walking, but instead he walks over to Roz
She jumps when he speaks to her
Hello, Mrs
Kraft
She seems confused about how to act toward him
Heather looks up casually
Racine shakes Roz's hand
Hello, Mr
Racine
How are you making out
We're all right,  guess
Racine crouches in front of Heather and smiles at her
You must be Heather

- Racine walks down the sidewalk and enters Stella's Coffee Shop
'   - As Racine comes in the front door, Stella is leaning over the counter in a gossipy huddle with a Cop and Glenda, the Meter Maid
When Stella notices Racine, she breaks off suddenly and moves away
The Cop and Glenda see Racine and go back to their food with great deliberateness
Racine takes all this in and settles at the other end of the counter
(too boisterous) Hi, Racine
How you doing today

What's the latest
Any hot news
Nothing much doing

Racine is almost done with his lunch
(to Stella) The usual, my sweet

Lowenstein looks at Racine and smiles
Are you ready to hear something wild
don't know
may have had my share for the day
No, this is right up your alley
Stella puts the two ice teas in front of Lowenstein
Lowenstein has to give her a look before she backs away
Lowenstein leans in confidentially toward Racine
Little Heather comes out onto the back porch, and this dude is out there with her aunt, see
And he's turned away with his pants or shorts or whatever dropped, so he's mooning the little girl, right
And he and your friend are going at something which Heather couldn't quite figure out
Lowenstein begins to shake with laughter; he almost falls off the stool
Racine is confused
Lowenstein recovers his balance and lowers his voice again
There are tears in his eyes
Poor little Heather
She's never seen one angry before
But it made quite an impression on her
Yessirree

She says the guy's hair was greasy
He wore it slicked back
"Like a Cuban," she says loved that

She hustled back to bed after getting a gander at that
And listen to why she got up in the first place, this is the capper
She had a nightmare
Christ, can you imagine what kinds of dreams she had the rest of the night
Lowenstein rocks with laughter
And Racine does too
-   - Matty has been pushed roughly across the entry hall
Her back hits hard against the wall at the front of the central hall
She rubs  her wrist where the skin is red and looks with frightened eyes at Racine
Don't say that
Don't say you don't have them

Plenty
No, Ned, not with her  wasn't could tell there was a difference

It's us

Your first reaction is to accuse me

Bright under a full moon
And very quiet
The surf can be heard  at the beach
And then we hear
- No sign of life
Still the ; it's a Broadway show tune
- Lowenstein is there, all alone, silhouetted in the moonlight
He uses the rail like a ballet bar, returning to it each time he finishes a small combination of dance steps
The moves are not extravagant, there is not highkicking
Just a nice, smooth little combination that Lowenstein is repeating, again and again
He  his own accompaniment
Then, softly at first, from the distance, comes the  of running shoes on old wood
It grows as Lowenstein completes another repetition
When the  has gotten close, it slows, then stops raggedly
Lowenstein looks that way

You're some kind of health nut

Is this gonna be one of those conversations
Maybe  should have my lawyer present
Buddy, your lawyer is present

You know, that Edmund Walker was a bad guy
The more  find out about him, the happier  am he's dead figure it's a positive thing for the world
You're not known for being a hardliner
Mmm

(he looks at his cigarette) As far as 'm concerned,  don't care who killed him
And  don't care who gets rich because of it
(shakes his head) But Oscar, Oscar's not like that
His whole life is based on doing the right thing
He's the only person know like that

He's in pain
Why is that

They finally found her place in Miami yesterday, but the woman herself was gone
looked like she left in a hurry

He thinks you need help
Racine turns around, drapes his arms back along the rail and lets his head loll, like a tired runner
Someone's putting you in deep trouble, my friend
From about three thirty to five  on the night Walker was killed, someone called your hotel room repeatedly
The hotel didn't want to put them through, but whoever was calling convinced them it was an emergency
The phone rang and rang, but you didn't answer
Racine looks at him
Don't say anything
Save it for some Other time
It gets worse

We don't know who
We don't know what the glasses will tell us
But our negotiations are continuing
Lowenstein steps away, toward the street

His mind is elsewhere

Racine finally appears
He too carries a briefcase
He looks across the huge lobby at the entrance to a restaurant/bar

Once more, he glances diagonally to the end of the bar, at a guy in a three- piece suit
The guy seems to be looking at Racine whenever he isn't watching the front entrance
Finally the guy can control himself no longer
He picks up his drink and walks around the bar to the space next to Racine
His name is and he's bright, successful and irritating

Racine's focus is on the doorknob of the closed door
But he moves past it to the window
The curtains have been carefully drawn across it; it is impossible to see beyond them into the boathouse
Except
except for one little slice at the bottom of the window where the curtains are held apart a fraction of an inch by something
Racine crouches down to look through the crack
The curtains are being held apart this little bit by a wire
wire which is attached to the window and runs tautly back into the gloom of the boathouse
Racine shifts his head an inch and he can see another wire
It originates from that same spot back in the gloom and runs toward the door, although Racine, with this limited view, cannot actually see where the wire is attached
But Racine is not really trying -- Racine has rocked back on his heels away from the window
He stands up and steps away from the boathouse

All the lights on the lawn, gazebo and boathouse are off

Headlights move very slowly up the drive toward the house

Ned
no matter what you think, do love you
Grace has gotten out of his car
He starts toward the front door, but sees Racine out on the lawn
He heads out in that direction, but stops as Racine steps into a bright spot of moonlit lawn and the gun's shiny silverplate glints in the light
The gun is pointed at the retreating Matty
Grace pulls his own gun from a shoulder holster and raises it
He is about to call out, when Matty disappears completely in the gloom
Racine lowers the revolver wearily and stares out toward the boathouse
Grace lowers his gun and looks out there too
He moves slowly forward
Close on Racine's face
It's changing now
It's not just that he's very tired
The hardness is going out of his look
As the seconds tick by, and Matty does not reappear, he begins to lose faith in his view of the world
He begins to be afraid
Afraid for Matty
Even now
sudden breeze starts the wind chimes  loudly
No, Matty
Stop
Don't go in
Matty
Racine breaks into a run, dropping the revolver on the grass
He has taken two big strides when -- There is a sound like the  of a dragon, and the roof of the boathouse lifts and then disappears in a huge The air is  sucked around Racine's body, whipping at his clothes, as he stumbles on the lawn and falls forward
Grace steadies himself against the side of the gazebo
Racine knows horror
He struggles to his feet and stumbles toward the fire
His body is silhouetted against the leaping,  flames in the night sky
: '   -    - Absolute quiet
We move above cell after cell, dark with sleeping convicts
We stop at Racine's cell
It is dark like the rest
Racine is in there alone
We move down close to his sleeping form
He looks thinner

Suddenly he wakes with a start
His eyes snap open wide; he is totally and instantly awake
He talks to himself, with true amazement
She's alive
-    - Grace sits on the other side of the glass from Racine
They talk on telephones
Grace's eyes are sad; they say he thinks Racine is going crazy
But what if that was someone else's body in there
What if it was already there when  got there -- dead and waiting for me
Maybe her friend
Mary Ann
Her teeth were left, man
We sent them back to Illinois
The identification was positive
That was her, that was Matty Tyler Walker
That was her and she's dead
You're not listening to me
What if she's been using this other girl's name
Since she met Walker three years ago, since she first spotted him and decided to take him
one way or another
Maybe Walker -- or any of us -- never knew her real name
Why would she want to hide her identity
don't know
Maybe there was something in her past, something so bad she was afraid it would queer it with Walker if he found out -- that he'd never marry her
Grace is unreceptive to this
But Racine is charged
Let's say she's living as the other girl, this girl from her past
Someone whose history she knew and could use any way she wanted
And there's only one person in the world who knows the truth

(') (he leans in) And then just when Matty's got me on the line, when she's finally going to collect, that one person shows up
That girl
Finds her
And threatens to expose her
So Matty starts paying her off
Maybe she even promises to cut her in on Edmunds' money
Now she's got to share it with two people
Racine peaks, tapping the glass between them as though it were all there for Grace to see
But when Matty sees a way to get rid of both of them at once
way to solve all her problems and get clear, with no one looking for her
At the boathouse
You find two bodies, me and this girl
Two killers dead
Case closed
Oscar isn't buying
You can't find the money, can you, Oscar
Doesn't that tell you something
It tells    me she moved it and we can't find it
And that don't mean shit
It could    be sittin' in any bank in the world    waiting for a dead lady to come for    it
Racine, calmer now, shakes his head "no
" Do you hear what you're saying
It's crazy
This Matty would've had to been one quick, smart broad
Racine confirms Grace's fears with a look that can only be called half-crazed
There's the glimmer of a rueful smile
Oscar, don't you understand
That was her special gift she was relentless
(much quieter) Matty was the kind of person who could do what was necessary
Whatever was necessary

These words have no special import to Grace
He looks at Racine without hope
Racine, you got to face something
You killed Edmund Walker, man
And you're going down for it
Two people are dead
And no matter how you want to figure it, you ain't bringin' either of 'em back to life
Grace gives him a long look, then hangs up the phone
He stands up and walks away
Racine sits and stares
: '   - Racine, bearded now, comes to the front of his cell to get his mail
Trustee hands through a book-size manila envelope, which has been neatly opened by the prison authorities
Racine looks at the return address and becomes very intense
He sits on his cot and slides out a book letter is clipped to the front
Racine scans it quickly and begins looking through the book
It is an old high school yearbook
Racine's fingers are shaking slightly as they leaf quickly past black and white scenes of youthful innocence among the Wheaton High School Cougars of 1966
He reaches the individual pictures of the seniors and hi hurries through the 's and 's to the 's
Racine's eyes are darting over the pages
Suddenly they stop
He has found her entry
We see it too -- Home Economics "Matty" - 29 39 4 Ambition -- "To Graduate" The picture is not great
The pretty face is a little cheap-looking
It is not the Matty he knew
It is her friend from the back verandah, Mary Ann
Racine's eyes dart
He thinks
Then, he flips back a few pages
He finds what he wants -- English - 2, 3, 4;  2, 3, 4 3, 4;  2, 3 Ambition-- "To be rich and live in an exotic land
" We're very close on the type of her ambition when we pan up the page to her smiling face
Her smile is so big, she seems almost to be laughing

Racine's face
That's the woman he loved
Back to her picture
We're moving in on it
Closer
Closer
And then through it -- To her real face, this Matty, this Mary Ann, alive and fine in the sun of -- -    - One shot, very close on that lovely face, moving around it in a tight half-circle that barely lets us glimpse the sun-drenched, foreign town far below and the tropical foliage that surrounds the patio
For one brief moment, she seems to be crying
But no, it is not a tear
It is a little drop of sweat
She wipes it from her cheek as she turns to an unseen male , who has spoken to her in Spanish
She wipes her eyes and looks off at him
(
) Hace Calor
What
(
) It is hot
Yes
She turns her face to the sun
