Written by Michael France -   - An unparalleled set of sheer mountains -- part of the Colorado Rockies
The peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out of the valley -- wind-whipped snow mists over the mountains like a low fog
The tranquility is broken as a helicopter into view, fighting the wind as it heads for the center of it all
Our  fly us past and through this magnificent range
There are sky-piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow, high pinnacle -- and others that are steel, straight-up approaches to large plateaus
One of the mountains has a crystal lake on top -- with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the middle of a mountain wall
Nearby, an abandoned cable ladder is bolted into the same wall, leading to the top
We can see a man sitting in its doorway, looking out -- /  - The glasses scan systematically, slowly -- to us, it looks like nothing more than a field of gray and white
(
) Nothing yet
- The helicopter now circles this tallest mountain -- "The Tower", separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by a chasm of two hundred feet -- that drops 3,500 feet below
- Spotter   (50s) scans the mountain wall (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm winds
Both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as members of the Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team
Wait a minute -- there's Hal
(beat) And his date
- that's part of the smaller peak
(30s) and his "date",   (20s), are decked out in climbing gear
Hal's aplomb suggests he's a veteran climber -- Susan's worried look shows she isn't
Hal and Susan huddle together, both cold, but okay
Hal has a makeshift splint wrapped around his lower leg, and a slow burning flare in one hand
Frank lowers his glasses -- Maggie struggles with the wind
How do they look
- Hal, now aware of the copter, looks towards it, smiling -- and starts jerking off the flare
(
) He's signalling "okay
" (
) Where's Gabe
The  dips down -- there's somebody climbing below, in an orange rescue jacket
(
) Right where he's supposed to be
This is   (30s)
In spite of the cold and the snow, he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling the tower without safety lines, as if he's done it a hundred times
That's because he has done it a hundred times
This is what Gabe lives for
Gabe, almost there, finds a fingertip-width handhold at arm's length -- grabbing it, he pulls himself up on the ledge with a move that's just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a doorjamb
Winded, Gabe slumps down next to the couple, and tries to light a cigarette
The lighter only sparks
Excuse me --  know you're my salvation, and all -- do you think you could rescue us before your smoke break
Hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one Bogart style, one-handed with a thumbnail, cupping a hand to shield it against the wind
Gabe bends down for it -- a familiar routine
We know in a glance they've been friends for years
Maybe you could tell me why  am rescuing you
Basically -- 've fallen down, and can't get up
(into radio) Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare idiot line for transport, over -- dips down towards the ledge -- no way can it land there
Frank lowers a rescue wire to who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it -- the wire is just out of reach
Hal grabs the radio
Rescue One -- please remind me to tell you about the time  hauled your hero here down Mt
Huntington on my back, over -- (
) (through radio) Hal, if  hear that story one more time, 'm making you limp down the entire three thousand feet, over -- Gabe finally grabs the line, secures it to a heavy piton, and hammers it into the wall
(to Susan) This guy showing you a good time
swings over across to the facing mountain -- Maggie lands the copter, in spite of the winds, on a small plateau
Frank gets out to secure the wire -- there's now a lifeline spanning the chasm
Gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock -- he extinguishes his cigarette in the snow, and naturally, pockets the butt
Hal, propped up against the wall, expertly rigs a seat harness around his legs -- Susan helps him get part of it around his splint, and Gabe clips it to the line
Now, remember -- keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times -- (laughing) Fuck you -- With that, Hal pulls himself hand-over-hand across the sloping line -- Hal makes a point of looking down -- '  -- is vertigo defined
Thirty five hundred feet straight down
You could stack the World Trade Center towers on top of each other and they'd still be shorter than this mountain is high
However -- lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face in mock horror -- he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet of the line, where Frank catches him and pulls him out
Hal gets out of the harness, checks every stitch of it, signals thumbs-up, and sends it back
Gabe, retrieves the harness on a small attachment line, and gives Susan a reassuring smile, but she's still, sensibly, very scared
Gabe recovers the harness, rigs Susan into it, and meticulously re-checks it
Ready
(sees she's afraid) Did he tell you about the time he almost made it up Everest
He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask -- Well, if he's bored you with that bullshit, then this has to be the best part of a bad date
Right
Susan nervously laughs
Ready
(scared but tough) Okay -- Gabe starts to push her out on the line, but she grabs his arm in a panic
can't -- Susan starts to tilt her head down -- Gabe gently takes hold of her chin, turning her view up to face him
Yes you can
(reassuring) You can do it
Don't look down
The whole way across, don't look down
Look at me
Just keep looking at me -- and you'll be okay
Susan looks at Gabe -- trying to be confident -- nods
Sure
Yeah
(beat) have always depended on the kindness of Rangers
Gabe grins and gently pushes her out
Susan tentatively pulls herself across -- then develops a rhythm, building speed -- '  - inching away in the harness, looking more confident now -- '  - signalling "" -- "you're doing fine" -- - thirty feet out, going fine -- -- holding the strap under Susan's left leg breaks -- '  - The harness completely unravels all at once, its strands shoot through the clips -- what was a seat has become a trap door in half a second -- as the harness shoots out from under her, Susan falls but grabs the harness strand -- is helpless, and can only watch as too scared to breathe, dangles on the remaining strand of what used to be the harness -- she sways from the wind and the jerk of her own weight, her grip loosens -- - that is supporting all of Susan's weight is being seriously tested -- a single knot in the harness has caught there, but it clearly won't last long -- moves back from the ledge
(loud, in control) Hold on
'm coming out to get you
Gabe gently pulls himself up on the line, crosses his ankles on it, and clips himself on with a three foot safety line
Gabe starts smoothly, quickly pulling himself out, but -- is in trouble -- the bobbing of the line from Gabe's weight and the winds are making her lose her grip even more -- urgently pulls himself along the line faster, trying not to shake the line
As he gets closer and closer to a terrified Susan, his eyes lock on hers -- Keep looking at me
Hold on -- Gabe is only ten feet away from -- who stares at Gabe, petrified -- this focus is helping, but her strength is just about gone -- - The knot has worked itself halfway through -- it doesn't make any difference how tight she holds on to the harness, the harness itself is letting go -- who knows it and pulls himself the rest of the way, a little faster, almost bridging the gap -- staring desperately at Gabe, holding on -- - that's keeping Susan alive surrenders the knot -- it passes through, and falls -- deliberately lets go of the main line and launches himself at Susan -- miss -- Gabe's three foot safety line pulls taut, testing the limits of the line above as it yanks him back -- '  - is just out of reach -- her hand is still stretched out, her eyes still locked on who can only look down, swaying helplessly on the wire as Susan's  starts -- Frank and Maggie look down in horror, but neither look as anguished as Hal -- - falling -- falling -- falling -- looking very small against the vast mountain range -- '  - from this height takes the longest nineteen seconds you can imagine -- twists from his safety line, spinning helplessly -- he wants to, but can't, shut his eyes -- '  - Susan is gone
Her , cut short, echoes -- the "safety" harness spirals down after her like a carefree bird -- : /   - '    - As the plane dips to land, Gabe can see a bird circling far below, over the same mountainous terrain
- sweating, panting, awake
It hasn't been that long since the accident -- a year, to be exact -- but he looks older
He looks as if he's watched Susan Collins drop at least one hundred times
Gabe reels himself in as a  hands him a glass of water
Take this
(Gabe does) Afraid of flying
Gabe shakes his head
Falling
- Gabe, with no luggage, is at the small airport's only car rental counter, doing the paperwork for a
Midsize
Any size, any color, any model
How long will you be needing it
(flat) Just under six hours
(
) You aren't wasting any time, are you
Gabe turns and looks at who is standing off to the side
knew you'd be coming by
Today
Gabe's happy to see her -- but at the same time, he isn't
She looks too good -- and she brings up quite a mixed bag of memories
Maggie carves on a smile
If you're in that much of a hurry, why don't you ride with me
- Maggie pilots the copter, heading out toward the mountain range
Gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside
Both grope for a way to start the conversation
This is new
It's a thermal scope -- picks up body heat of lost hikers -- Gabe flicks it on, looks at the total absence of heat as they fly over the snow
Still find the dead ones the old fashioned way,  guess
So much for small talk
Gabe is clearly uneasy watching these mountains go by
Maggie breaks an awkward silence -- You could have said goodbye
(shakes head) If  did, 'd have to listen to you tell me one more time that it wasn't my fault
(angry) Today -- especially today -- you get to hear it again
The harness clip broke
Cold stress -- one in a million equipment failure
You and Hal could have checked it from then till now and it still would have happened
(beat) You did everything right -- -- If  did everything right, Susan Collins would still be alive
whizzes on to the Ranger station -- a small building by an old country road
Not much activity outside of some working out on a
Maggie starts to land the copter, and as she does -- Do you really believe all that
That it wasn't our fault
Maggie slows the rotor, her eyes on the controls
Gabe's eyes are locked on her
(turns to Gabe) Yes
Yes,  do
But she answered a half beat too slow
The helicopter touches ground
'm not sure what  wish more, Maggie
That you meant what you said, just now -- or that it were really true then
Hal, wearing Sheriff's garb, storms towards Maggie's side of the copter as the engine shuts off and the rotor dies
Maggie, where the hell have you been
've got two climbers out -- Gabe gets out of the copter, and Hal sees him for the first time
Unlike the last time we saw them, neither man is glad to see the other
Hal turns on Maggie
Brett and Evan are up there again to jump off the spur
Their wives called twice
want you in the air and want them found before the storm system moves in
(Maggie hesitates) Now
Maggie takes off as Gabe and Hal step away from the copter
Gabe eyes Hal's uniform and almost -- not quite but almost -- laughs
Christ
You're in charge of Rescue now
There was a vacancy
Maybe you heard about it
The last guy lost his nerve and lit out of town
Well, you're a better man than  am, Hal
Nothing rattles you
The rookie climbers get off the practice wall to watch this faceoff
Gabe and Hal are one crack away from beating hell out of each other
Frank heads over to defuse the confrontation
(steering Gabe away) Gabe
Long time, son -- why don't you come meet some of the new guys -- Good idea
Say, Hal
(beat) Why don't you come with me so we can show these rookies how to death-rig a woman properly
That tears it -- Hal rushes Gabe and they pummel each other until Frank and the others pull them apart, panting and bleeding
Hal throws off the men holding him back -- but instead of going at Gabe again, Hal throws Gabe a set of car keys
Take the Bronco to where you're going
've already been
Then go back to wherever it is you like to hide
And stay there
Hal heads back into the office -- Gabe heads for the Bronco
: -   - The Southwest regional center for printing and distributing currency
Hundreds of troops stand guard over the impressive Treasury complex
- is at work -- the  of its parts is deafening as it stamps out a plate design on huge sheets of paper -- we move in on which is moved by mechanical arm to a  that razors the bills apart -- it's moving too fast for us to see the denomination -- the cut bills are separated by -- that fire the bills down to a mechanical  that serializes, counts, bands and stacks them faster than any human could -- a  reaches to pick up a band -- are something a banker could work a lifetime without seeing, but are real nonetheless --  $5,000 bills, banded here in hundreds
The band is put back in the growing stack by mid-thirties, a tough, imposing Treasury agent -- he regards the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold, professional interest
Travers is flanked by a trio of equally tough   -- he turns to flunky  (20s)
It's clear who's in charge of protecting the money here, and who's in charge of counting it
Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment is ready
(phone already out) Right away, Mr
Travers
As Davis dials we move to -- of   (50s), comptroller of currency -- his demeanor suggests he's in control, and used to keeping it that way
(into phone) Good -- good
'll be right down
As Wright gets up from his desk, though, we hear in the outer office -- (
) You can't go in there -- (
) Watch me
(30s) bursts into the office, trailed by Wright's flustered
Walter Wright
(flashes badge) Matheson
We need to talk
- has now been packed into a trio of metal briefcases -- ten thousand $5,000 bills
Travers shuts the cases in turn, and locks each with an electronic key card, triggering a on the locks as he does
uniformed  shows up behind Travers as he cuffs the cases to the hands of the three other agents
We'll be fueled and ready in ten minutes, Mr
Travers
(an order) Be ready in five
(
) Go ahead and take ten
We'll need the time
Travers looks up at Matheson, who has just arrived with Wright
Travers is instantly furious at the challenge to his authority
(flashes badge) Matheson
(looking down at it) Your parents must be proud
(to Wright) What the fuck is this about
Small problem with the shipment, Travers
(to Matheson) Tell him what you just told me
Matheson draws out a file and hands it to Travers
We got word that somebody's been observing your currency shipments -- this load, the $5,000s -- over the last three deliveries
(laughs) There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe
(beat) This is the most protected shipment we've got -- and the most useless for a thief
Those bills aren't in circulation
You think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass
Who the fuck would try
Matheson hands Travers a folder
This guy might
We look over Travers' shoulder at the photos, which are all blurry, all blown up from different surveillance pictures -- and all of them show
Who is he
(patient) His name's Eric Qualen
One of the East German spies who got shut out by the reunification
The  issued an inter-agency warning about him right after the wall came down
He's got nowhere to go and nothing to lose
He's also got the international connections to get rid of bills like these -- and he's probably desperate enough to try for them
Fifty million bucks buys a lot of sanctuary
Could you get to the part where 'm supposed to care
(shows him more photos) We had two agents monitoring him
These two -- Gleason and Quinones
Their last report said he was going to try to take this shipment
(turning away) Thanks for the tip
But 've got work to do
(stopping him) Did  say "last" report
think did
mean last fucking report
These guys have vanished
You have my sympathy, but -- (exasperated) There's a reason we do things this way, all right
Armored cars can be hijacked
Trains can be derailed
But nobody can get to us in flight
The only time this is on the ground is at the mint, or on the Presidio runway in San Francisco
Either way, someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards
Matheson still isn't convinced
If you're worried about an inside job, forget it
checked the plane from top to bottom an hour ago
And these three are my best against
Even if one of them did go skydiving, they wouldn't get far
Each case has an electronic tracer with a range of one hundred miles
Travers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman out of his jacket pocket
The small screen shows three red blips at rest -- matching the three currency cases
(facing down Matheson) haven't lost a bill in eight years
And 'm not scrubbing this shipment because you scare easily
(an easy smile) Who said anything about stopping the shipment
(beat) 've been tracking Qualen for almost a year
If he pulls something,  want to be in on the party
Travers, angry, turns to Wright
Wright clearly doesn't like this either, but is resigned to it
This is cleared from the top, Travers
Matheson will accompany you on the flight to San Francisco
(beat) Show him every professional courtesy
Travers turns back to a smiling Matheson, looking like he'd rather kill him instead, as we -- : - ' is being buffeted by storm winds and a light snow -- Maggie struggles hard with the controls, but -- Visibility is near zero
Maggie keys the radio
Rescue One to base, over
(
) Rescue One -- have you sighted them
Over -- Negative, Hal -- storm's already moving in --  can't see them, and winds are too strong to stay up here -- over -- (
) Rescue One -- abort
They'll be all right
Brett and Evan are dumb enough not to log in, but they're smart enough to have storm gear
Head back to base
(not unkindly) Maybe you can catch Gabe before he leaves
Over
don't think he's planning a long visit, Hal
(back to business) Rescue One heading back to base, over and out
banks a 180 to fly back -- we can see over the horizon that the storm is moving in fast
- We can hear Maggie's helicopter flying off overhead -- camped inside the cave are  and , both 20s, both shivering, amid their gear -- backpacks, cooking stuff -- and parachutes
These are Colorado rock jocks -- thrillseekers who'll try anything if the odds are strong enough they'll die in the process
(freezing) Way to check the weather, Brett
(shivering yet macho) Hey
If it were easy, it wouldn't be worth d-doing
: (-9) - The -9 cruises over increasingly mountainous, remote terrain
- who looks tense -- we   the cabin and find two more relaxed Treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the plane, their arms chained to the currency cases
Matheson is edgy
Another  offers some condescending reassurance
Just enjoy the view, huh
(Matheson says nothing) Relax
mean, what could happen in the air
Matheson turns back to his window and looks down -- - is covered with snow -- the jet's shadow moves sleekly and plainly over it
But after a moment we see -- -- another jet's shadow on the ground, coming up fast
-9 - reacts this and shifts his look upward to -- -   () is flying a parallel course to the Treasury jet, and is just one hundred yards away
Close enough to see Eric Qualen's face in one of the windows
Matheson stands -- Travers has noticed the plane by now too, and gets out of his seat as the other agents react
(to other agents) Stay put
Don't panic, goddammit
Travers moves into where the pilot seems nervous, but oddly, not frightened
He's coming in too slow
(cool) No -- we're going too fast, and we're too high up
Push flaps forward twenty degrees and drop to five thousand feet
Matheson is out of his seat, pistol drawn
Seems a little puny under the circumstances
(to agent) You got any rifles
Forward compartment -- left side -- Matheson rushes through a curtain to the area between the cabin and the cockpit and pulls open a closet door
To his horror, he finds inside not rifles, but who we'll recognize as the missing  agents from the photos Matheson showed Travers
backs up in horror -- and he sees Travers calmly coming out of the cockpit
Rattled, Matheson pulls his gun on Travers
Travers looks dumbfounded -- then angry
What the hell are you doing -- Checked the plane from top to bottom, huh
You fucker -- (clicks hammer back) Put your hands behind your head
It's over
Travers puts his hands out and walks forward -- slowly, backing Matheson into the cabin
Not in surrender, but as if he's calming a nutcase
The other agents see this and don't know which way to jump
Calm down -- give the gun to me -- (to other agents) There's a couple of dead bodies in the front compartment -- they're agents -- He's losing it -- They now think Matheson is crazy too -- he looks nuts -- the other agents move behind him
Matheson gets even more frantic and point his gun at them
Goddamn it
Don't you see what he's doing
He's hijacking the fucking shipment
(back to Travers) Don't make me shoot you
The other two agents get behind Matheson and rapidly disarm him
Travers pulls out his gun with a slow, leisurely move
Don't make me laugh
Travers  his gun three times, one for each agent's chest -- the agents are cut down, realizing too late what's happened
fourth  knocks Matheson over a seat as if he'd been kicked
Travers puts his gun away and puts on a radio headset as he goes to a window
(to mouthpiece) Move into position
'  - maneuvers over the -9 -- and holds steady above it
: -  - The stone reads "Susan Collins -- 1965 - 1991"
It's surrounded by wreaths -- one of which has an old snapshot of her attached to it
Mementos sent on the first anniversary of her death
brushes some of the falling snow away from the marker
He lays down his flowers and pauses for a moment -- then gets into the Bronco and drives away
- Gabe looks out the window at the countryside he used to belong in
He's wondering if he still does
: /'  - Qualen's jet is now flying parallel to, and slightly above, the Treasury jet
The door in Qualen's jet is open, and we get our first good look at -- /
' -- Qualen, who is also wearing a headset radio and is wired to a safety line in the jet
He's lowering a thick steel cable down to the Treasury jet
Qualen is as deadly as advertised -- 150 mph winds are tearing at him through the open door, but he is unfazed and unfrightened
is also wired to a safety line by his own jet's open door
(into radio) More -- more -- keep it coming -- Qualen's jet lowers the cable into the Treasury jet -- it looks like an Air Force midair refuelling -- difficult and dangerous
After about thirty feet of line is lowered -- -- takes it in and clips it to a ring at the top of the jet's doorway
(into radio) Locked on
Move into lateral position
' The pilot, , is a woman
Her skill, like her hard beauty, can be measured in a glance: she's a lot calmer than her counterpart in the Treasury plane
Moving into lateral position
Qualen's jet lowers itself, banking to the side -- the Treasury jet raises itself
Both are now flying side by side, with the cable serving as a thirty foot bridge
Travers, unclipped from his safety line, cautiously goes to the cockpit
The pilot, nervous, struggles with the controls
We're right on the edge of the storm -- let's move it
Travers pulls the two dead  agents out of the compartment -- one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot, one in a suit like Travers
This isn't going to work -- Wright will suspect something
So what
He'll sift though a plane that went down in a storm -- (gestures to bodies) -- find enough pulverized bone for six men heroically killed in the line of duty -- (finds three suitcases) -- and just enough of the right kind of ash
Travers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the others -- except that it's full of one dollar bills
He's thought of everything
We get twenty-one gun funerals and they write off fifty million
It's perfect, as long as you hold the plane steady -- so concentrate
Travers moves back into the cabin
' We can now see four other passengers
All are fit and armed -- and  are seated, while  and , ready to help with the transfer, are on the opposite side of the door from a very impatient Qualen
(into radio) Travers -- hurry it up
Travers, now in a harness like the one seen earlier -- uncuffs the money cases from the agents
(into radio) On my way
Travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch over and  -- starts counting down from 2:00 -- 1:59 -- 1:58 -- Even in the last minute, the storm's gotten worse -- the plane is flying right into the blackest center of it
The pilot looks more panicked than ever
That charge is going to blow both engines -- the plane'll go down like a rock, so clip yourself on to the end of the cable with the money as soon as get over
(an afterthought) And make sure you bring the right cases
Travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the cable between the planes
(into the headset) Dip the plane
'm coming over
- Qualen's jet dips down so there's a sharp incline -- Travers starts the slide down, zipping in seconds across into ' where he's pulled in and unclipped by Qualen
(shouting over the wind) Why didn't you send the money over
(shouting too) Somehow,  didn't think you'd have waited for me if 'd sent it first
Qualen smiles in reply
No
Maybe he wouldn't
The pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin
counts down -- 0:38 -- 0:37 -- 0:38 -- The pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach them to the cable -- but as he steps past the bodies of -- Matheson's eyes open -- he's not dead yet
The pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable and is about to put his harness on -- but behind him, Matheson shakily crawls to his feet, draws his gun, and  the pilot in the back twice
drops out of the plane, flailing -- if he's screaming, we can't hear it over the  of the storm -- ' Qualen and Travers are watching the whole plan unravel -- (shouting to cockpit) Get underneath the jet
The cases will slide over
- Qualen's jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide over -- but at the same time -- Matheson, groggy, holds onto the doorway and  a full clip from his automatic at Qualen's jet -- and counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- and ' are destroyed as the charge  -- - As promised, the Treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had no wings at all, levelling the angle between the planes -- the cases dangle precariously on the wire -- ' (shouting) Lower
Get underneath it
Matheson struggles to the cockpit and gets behind the controls -- as if that's going to do any good -- - Qualen's jet is deliberately racing the disabled Treasury jet down, but it's hopeless -- there's no way to get underneath the falling jet long enough for the cases to slide over
'  - isn't quite panicked
Yet
It's dragging us down
Disconnect the cable
'  - Heldon and Ryan try to do just that, but the cable is taut -- there's no way to loosen the clip on the door -- dive down faster at an ever steeper angle, over the edge of the Colorado mountain range -- -- the clip on the door finally breaks -- - -- the Treasury jet drops as Qualen's jet, trailing the cable and the money, sharply shoots upward -- makes a one point landing nose first into the wilderness, cartwheeling into a
/ The sound of the , muffled in the wind, far-off, but audible, drives Hal outside -- he's alert, but can't see anything in the murk of the storm -- '  -   - levels off the plane, but it's still in trouble -- - struggle to reel in the cable, because -- The money cases are still, barely, holding on, the cuffs caught on the broken clip at the end -- aren't even bothering with the electric winch, they're dragging it in hand over hand -- but -- -- the cases, torn by the wind, work their way loose one at a time and drop -- one -- two -- three -- into the snowy mountains below
Heldon and Ryan clamp the door shut as Qualen angrily attacks Travers -- - tries to bring the plane up, but can't -- the fuel guage needle is dropping fast -- - is pouring out fuel through a dozen bullet holes -- one of two engines sputters to a stop
- The plane is now just skirting the mountain tops, and is still being battered by storm winds -- Kristel aims it for what looks like the flattest, longest mountain top -- Kynette and Ryan grab Qualen and Travers to separate them -- all strap in, because is going down -- it just tops the edge of a precipice and hits the ground level -- - -- the problem is, the ground itself isn't level, it tilts down towards another edge five hundred yards distant -- if the plane keeps skidding, it'll go over the edge -- sleds down at an angle, skipping over rocks -- -- through trees -- -- tearing off a wing -- Kristel rides the stick only out of habit -- nothing she does is going to matter now -- The men are jolted around -- windows  as Kynette tries to protect a bag of what is obviously explosives -- rips downhill through a wooded area like a runaway train -- -- the second wing is sheared off by trees -- - is coming up fast -- but wrenches to a sudden halt, the fuselage intact
- or what's left of it has stopped several feet short of the edge -- we can see why: the steel cable, trailing from the cargo door, has lashed itself around a half dozen trees, acting as a tripwire to stop the plane
Quiet
All are dazed but, outside of superficial cuts, unhurt
Kristel moves out of the cockpit, looking around
So much for phase one
(to Travers) Now what
She speaks for all of them -- especially a still-seething Qualen
Travers pulls out the tracer monitor for the cases
The tracer screen shows three distinct blips -- the tracers have survived the fall
Now -- we call the police
- Hal, agitated, paces in the main office -- Frank, unconcerned, puts a coat hanger and some aluminum foil on a little  to drag in the fading signal of a Broncos game
Look --  know there's a storm, but that wasn't thunder
(unconcerned) Hal, when you've been in this line as long as  have -- The station's scanner radio barks to life
(
) (panicky) Mayday -- mayday -- downed -3 -- mayday -- Hal runs to the radio and keys the mike
Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in, mayday -- Kristel is on the radio, as Travers and Qualen hang back

The transmission cuts off/ Mayday -- come in, mayday -- Kristel hangs up the radio and smiles, Travers and Qualen standing behind her
Qualen lightly applauds
Not bad
The insulin was a nice touch
- The Bronco wends through a winding country road, coming finally to a cabin settled in a clearing
pulls into the driveway and puts the Bronco in park
He doesn't cut the engine, because he's not sure whether he's going in or not
Finally -- he cuts the ignition
- knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside
Gabe opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside
Maggie
No answer
Gabe takes a look around the living room
His face tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home
Gabe moves inside, pausing at a mantle
Two framed photos -- Gabe and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer wall over a 2,000 foot drop
Gabe, Hal and Maggie, all younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave
Gabe smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a  at the back of the cabin shakes him out of it
-  - has come open and swings in the wind
Gabe steps outside and pulls it shut
Gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a small but sturdy shed a few yards away
Gabe heads over to it
- Not a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and whistle-clean
Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off
-- inside is a bald eagle
One of maybe 2,000 left in the country
Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us it isn't nearly full grown
bandage on its side tells us it's been injured
Maggie's smile tells us it's healing
Hey there -- The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the door behind him
Maggie looks surprised to see him
Gabe just looks awkward
Hi
(beat) Could you introduce us
Sure
Gabe Walker -- this is A27
A27 -- Gabe
Not the tag -- what do you call him
Her
call her Lucky
(bends down, eyes wound) Poachers
(Maggie nods) Bastards
They got the mother -- and left this one behind
Too small to make a decent trophy,  guess
About four months, right
(Maggie nods) Christ -- it must have been just about his --  mean her -- first flight -- Time to change the dressing
Maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves
You can't do that alone -- 've had to learn
She trust me -- Maggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing
'm making her nervous -- (beat) You hold her, 'll do the dressing
Gabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the cage, holding it firm
This is clearly something they've done many times before
They move together, tight -- Gabe and Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage the eagle
It's getting warmer in here
Gabe reaches down and yanks off the patch
The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the wound
Got some fight in her -- that's good
(beat) What happened to Dave
The usual
Flew off -- never calls, never writes -- Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch and sticks it on the eagle's side
Maggie puts the eagle back in the cage and closes the top door
Gabe and Maggie don't move any further apart as they pull their gloves off
Gabe tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him hand away
'm glad to see you, Gabe
But  kind of wish you hadn't come
was almost used to you being gone
(beat, quiet) Why are you here
(pauses) thought  came back to see if 'd learned to live with it
Well, big surprise
Coming back just tore me open all over again, like it all happened yesterday instead of a year ago
Nothing's changed
Including the way  feel about you
(beat) didn't realize it till  saw you at the airport
But  came back for you, Maggie
Does that mean you're going to stay
No
Not here
(beat) want you come with me
Start over, somewhere else
(incredulous) You come back after being gone a year, and you expect me to -- (beat) You don't live here any more, Gabe
Your choice, remember
But this is my home
'm not leaving
You can stay with me, or you can go alone
It's still your choice
(
) Now there's an easy call
Standing in the shed's doorway is Hal
Stone faced
Grim
Furious, Gabe heads out after Hal
What the hell do you want
(beat) need your help
plane's gone down on Comb Bluff
This storm would blow a copter all over the place -- but we can climb up to it
"We"
(beat) Talk to somebody who's still on the payroll
You've got a half dozen new guys -- -- who couldn't climb that wall now if there were stairs cut into it
But you've soloed it
During the summer
On a bet
This is a little more important than a bet
Just a few injured people with no first aid or shelter, camping in a zero degree blizzard
They'll be ice sculptures by tomorrow morning
(shakes his head) Maybe you missed the headlines -- but don't do rescues any more
They're bad for my conscience
(beat) Fuck this one up on your own
Gabe walks past Hal
Furious, Hal spins Gabe around
Play it again, Gabe, about how we killed her
was there too, remember
(hot) Not like  was, pal -- her fingers brushed mine on the way down -- (right back) -- and  was the one who had to deal with her family when you fucking tore out of town
(takes a breath) We lost her
Whatever anybody says about cold stress and the clip, you and  have to live with that
But right now, there are some more people who need our help, and they shouldn't die too just because you've got a problem keeping the past in the past
Gabe knows he's right
But he's hesitant
And scared
don't want the responsibility
Walk away and you are responsible
They'll die
can't do this alone
(Gabe slows but doesn't stop) You know what else, Gabe
You can go anywhere you want, but if you don't do this, now, you're going to be stuck on that goddamn ledge for the rest of your life
Gabe turns
Sees Maggie in the doorway
She's heard every word
Gabe turns to Hal -- hesitates -- and nods
-   - Relative to the other mountains, Comb Bluff is smaller -- about 2,500 feet high
But that's like saying the Empire State Building is smaller than the Sears Tower
It's still a long way up if you're climbing the stairs
- with full packs of mountaineering gear on
They've got to climb up this beast
Gabe -- now back in his orange Sheriff's jacket -- scrambles with Hal up the base of the mountain, the last few yards before it turns into a sloping wall
Gabe takes a bolt gun -- which fires rope-fastened bolts into rock -- and hangs it from a strap on his chest
(indicating gun) That thing's dead weight
Completely useless for an ice climb
Just backup
Gabe readies a coil of rope and starts up the wall
(not a challenge) 'll lead
left a few bolts last time  climbed this --  think  can find some of them
Hal starts up after Gabe, easily keeping pace with him
Save the rope for when it gets tough
(beat, realizing) That bet was for you to free climb the wall
(further up) Tell you what, Hal -- if we're still alive tomorrow morning, 'll give you the twenty bucks back, okay
- Two orange specks move their way up the mountain -- it's definitely going to be a long trip
: -   -  - are now visibly two-thirds of the way up
- is not only higher, it's a lot tougher to climb
Instead of being angular, the wall is now completely vertical -- and coated with ice
Rough, irregular ice ledges are all Gabe and Hal can grip -- it's a matter of grabbing what you can for a handhold, and kicking the spikes of the steel crampons on their boots into the ice for footholds
Gabe leads, planting pitons into the ice, threading the rope through them as he goes
Three steel pins between Gabe and Hal
Their only safety net
Gabe, trailing rope behind him, goes up a difficult slab of ice and climbs under a ledge, where he anchors the rope in the ice with another piton
(shouting down) Anchored
is beside and slightly below Gabe -- at the other end of the fifty foot rope
Hal cautiously pulls himself along the line to the first piton -- as is standard for a climb, he pulls out the piton, then moves on to the second -- but up above Ice, building in a small crevase, builds and  the adjoining rock -- several ten-pound boulders fall, causing a chain reaction that bounces down the wall -- hugs the ice wall, making himself as flat as possible -- (shouting down) Rockslide
flattens too as rocks bounce past -- the second anchoring piton  as it is struck by a falling rock -- Hal nervously eyes the last piton between him and Gabe -- - also has been clipped by the still falling boulders and droops at half mast -- no way are these going to hold in the unreliable ice -- tries to stay flat, but one boulder painfully  him on the shoulder, knocking him from his perch -- Hal falls -- - In falling, Hal's weight on the rope yanks out the nearest anchor piton -- Hal tumbles in space, keeping pace with the boulders, as -- who's seen everything we have, quickly reaches to the piton he's just anchored, and removes the carabiner clip -- - The rope draws taut, yanking out the last piton between he and Gabe -- nothing but a few yards of slack rope now -- has the bolt gun out
He rapidly hooks the rope's carabiner clip to the chambered bolt, and  it at a solid rock ledge above him -- - imbeds solidly in the rock -- lashes the rope to his shoulder, bracing for the coming impact by lodging his feet in the ice -- - The line pulls taut, leaving Hal suspended, the wind knocked out of him from the impact -- is almost dragged down by the jolt -- he painfully takes most of the impact in his shoulders -- the shock forces his feet through an ice ledge -- but the rope, bolted to the rock above, has held
Barely
(shaken, voice gone) Anchored -- (shouts this time) Anchored
now somewhat recovered, steadies himself
(breathless too) You're sure this time -- Hal climbs up the rope, finally reaching another ledge slightly below Gabe's
Hal leans against the wall, gasping, as Gabe clips the gun to his pack
(looking up at gun) Don't say it -- (wheezing too) It's kind of hard to resist -- It's not dead                It's not dead weight -- you                weight --  am
are
Hal and Gabe start howling -- that hysterical, giddy laugh that only comes from just missing a violent end
- Hal and Gabe's friendship is starting to resurface -- their is nearly louder than the wind, as we -- : -  - From the top of the bluff, someone is looking down through binoculars -- Gabe and Hal's orange jackets are plainly visible a few hundred yards below
lowers the binoculars, and keys an ear button on the headset radio he's wearing, sending a beep
Travers is wearing another headset -- the others are just resting in the seats (into mouthpiece) Have they arrived
(two beeps in response) Good
Return to the plane and cover your tracks
(to others) Get ready
Hal and Gabe are tired, but get a second wind from the excitement of being almost on top
Gabe stops, breathless for a second, then goes on
Hal lags a little behind
Come on -- the hard part's over
Gabe heads up and over ' / and helps Hal up
From here, the rest of the range looms large
Even in the continuing snowstorm, it's a spectacular sight -- but Gabe and Hal don't pause to enjoy it
This isn't a trip for sport
Hal looks off into the trees, and sees the torn tree stumps from the plane crash
(grim) That's it
Hal and Gabe run into the wooded area and follow the wreckage -- felled trees, a smashed wing -- and reach which sits intact by the other edge of the precipice
thought the fuselage was broken
That looks pretty cozy
(puzzled too) The pilot was hysterical
Something's wrong here -- Does this look like a prank to you
Come on -- Hal pulls open the passenger door and goes in -- Gabe, wary, takes a look around the plane
It's comparatively dark in here -- Hal starts in, shining a light -- the beam finds '  - slumped down on the cabin floor, a blanket wrapped around him -- he's shaking and is generally giving a good impression of a shock victim
Hal rushes to him
Relax -- we're here to help -- "Weak", Travers whispers as Hal gives him some water
Don't try to talk -- Travers won't quit -- Hal leans down to hear
(hoarse whisper) Where
-- Where
What are you -- gun barrel moves   as it presses against Hal's neck
Heldon and Ryan are right behind him
Travers instantly drops his act
You said "we"
Where are the rest
- notes footprints in the snow -- fresh ones -- and kneels down to look at the cable wrapped around the tree
No ordinary accident
But before he can think about this, he gets an earful of gun barrel from Qualen, who is behind him
Qualen hustles Gabe inside the plane -- his hands are on his head, and his pack has been removed
Qualen throws the pack to Ryan and Delmer, who rifle through it, removing anything that could be a weapon -- they quickly confiscate Gabe's bolt gun and ice axe
What's for dinner
(Kynette tosses packet) Ugh
"Dried Beef Slices With Barbeque Sauce
" (tosses it back) Try and make this edible
Travis looks at Hal's park ranger badge
Hal Tucker
(to Gabe) Where's yours
He doesn't have one
Just a wallet
Qualen tosses it to Travers, who glances through it
Gabe Walker
(notes photo of Maggie) Very attractive
My ex
Too bad
Let me tell you what's on for today
We'd like you to help settle a wager
You see, we lost some luggage -- Travers motions to Ryan and Qualen, who shove Gabe and Hal forward in the cabin
Travers takes out the tracer monitor
(showing them the blips) See these
Now 've bet the gentlemen behind you that you know enough about this mountain range to lead us to each of these, quickly, and that you'd be happy to do so
They bet me you couldn't and wouldn't
(guns are clicked) Now tell me -- who wins
Gabe and Hal eye each other -- no choice
Gabe nods
Good dog
Now let's get this expedition started
- Hal and Gabe lead the "expedition" down a steep, but passable, descent, leading to -- that links Comb Bluff with the next mountain
Travers stops Gabe and pulls out the monitor
Okay
Connect the dots
Gabe pauses as he holds the monitor up against the mountainscape
The first blip is up a thousand feet -- it's a wall, and obviously not something for a novice
Gabe pauses a little too long -- Qualen nudges him with his gun
Gabe hands the monitor back to Travers
This way
Gabe, with Hal right behind, leads them up the wall -- it's not a straight climb, but there's a series of zig-zagging natural ledges that cut up the wall
Wide enough even for an amateur
The others follow Gabe and Hal's example
: -   -  - have led the gang further up the wall, using pitons and carabiner clips to create a guide rope
It's still just a matter of climbing relatively easy ascending ledges
Hal and Gabe lead them by jumping to the next ledge
As Gabe hammers in a new piton, he turns to Hal
(sotto) We don't have to do this
We know these mountains -- they don't
If we can get ahead -- Can you climb faster than they can shoot
We've got to try something
Think we'll get a finder's fee after they get all their "luggage"
Sure
All the bullets we can eat
That's not what really worries me
There's something else to worry about
Yeah
Once they've got what they're after -- they're gonna need a copter to get out of here
(realizing) Maggie
Gabe nods grimly -- and keeps moving up
The rest keep pace
The climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on the wall -- the ledge is now two feet wide
Travers takes out the tracer monitor -- the monitor shows that the first case is just above them
Hold it
(beat) It's up there
" " - juts out of the wall fifty feet above their position
As the rest of the wall above is completely sheer, it's obvious that the case, if it is above, has landed on top of a ledge
But this isn't easily accessible -- we   from the overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds to get up there, and those are slick with ice and snow
Worse, the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve, making climbing almost impossible
Travers holds his gun on Gabe, and motions up Fetch
'll need the ice axe
(laughs) You've got to be kidding
(sighs) Okay
How about some tape
Travers nods -- Kynette pulls a roll of tape out of Gabe's confiscated pack and throws it to him
Crampons too
Travers hesitates, but nods -- Kynette throws him the iron spikes
Gabe fastens them to his boots
Gabe looks up -- this is going to be tough, even for him
In spite of the cold, he takes off his gloves -- that's how small these holds are -- and he meticulously tapes up his hands and his fingers
- moves up the wall with some ease at first -- there are hand-sized handholds, and decent footholds -- but twenty feet up, there's nothing
To keep going, Gabe has to painfully wedge his fingers into small cracks, essentially supporting his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment
We can see from the angle that Gabe is at least 3,000 feet from solid ground
We can see from his face that he's trying not to think about it
- watch Gabe's slow progress
don't trust him
(indicating wall) Where could he go
'd rather he didn't show us
(beat) We don't need two guides
(shrugs) You win
Kill him when he gets down
- Make that "if he comes down"
Gabe is now in one of the worst positions possible for a free climb
He is moving up the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging upside down, knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support
It's excruciating -- both in terms of muscular effort, and the abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock again and again
Gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides the other up, hammering it into a crack wedge with ice -- some of the ice chips whistle past and down -- -- finally, Gabe gropes one hand over the edge, and pulls himself onto Exhausted, Gabe pulls himself prone across the top
Something hard is underneath him -- Gabe recovers and brushes the snow off the money case that's underneath
It's battered from the fall, but is still barely holding together
Gabe manages to force open the trashed locks -- he looks inside the case, and fingers a band of $5000s
Jesus
- look up
They can see Gabe has made it -- but they can't see him, or the case
(impatient, shouting) Lower it down -- now
- has no intention of doing this -- he snaps the case shut and looks over at a ledge that moves off from it -- and at the ice and snow above
-   ' try to look up and locate Gabe
They can't
Until -- (
) (shouting down) 've got a better idea
Why don't you come up and get it
With the case, Gabe moves, back against the wall, on a ledge that skirts off the overhand -- from Travers and Qualen's point of view
Gabe can hardly be seen -- since the mountain bulges out as it goes up
Gabe's got a slight edge of cover
(shouts to Heldon) Get him
Heldon runs along the lower ledge,  up at -- who has to flatten against the upper ledge -- bullets howl past at twenty per second,  against the lip of the rock -- it's cover, but not much -- looks up, worried -- '  - piled by the ton from the storm, lie further above -- the ice holding it back already, already weakened by the sun, is being chiselled away by bullets -- - grabs Hal and puts the gun to his head
(shouting) Bring the money down, or we kill your friend
Travers pushes the barrel away from Hal, shaking his head
We can't
(frowning) And he knows it
- Gabe moves across his thing ledge as Heldon runs across his -- Gabe ducks back and has to flatten even more against the wall, because his ledge is getting smaller -- smiles, seeing Gabe's cover is gone -- Heldon's ledge is getting wider, so it's easier for him to fire up
Heldon moves out to the edge -- ' There's now nothing between Heldon and Gabe -- Heldon takes dead aim -- looks up, sweating it -- Come on -- above finally give way, dropping an avalanche on who drops the case and hugs the wall -- - Only now can we see how much snow and ice had been penned up on the mountain top -- tons of ice and snow sweep down the mountainside -- it  the case against the wall as it easily swipes a  Heldon off the ledge -- , are safe at their vantage, but stunned at the sight of -- Heldon's machine fun  uselessly as he's swallowed in an explosion of white -- as well as a flurry of green as the bills scatter amid the snow -- -- then: quiet
The avalanche ends as abruptly as it started
The rumble dies down to complete silence
apoplectic, stares at seventeen million dollars worth of snow settling far below
He takes his gun, furious, and fires at where Gabe was hugging the wall -- it's now blanketed with snow
Travers  an entire clip at where Gabe used to be
The snow  , revealing nothing but stark rock
Gabe has been swept away
reacts and attacks Travers
You son of a bitch -- Travers turns and pins Hal against the wall with the gun, ready to kill him too
But he's stopped by Qualen
No
We need him to get the rest of the money
(he isn't backing down) If he dies we lose everything Travers, furious, takes the gun out of Hal's face
(to Hal) Get us out of here
Hal stares at Travers with absolute fury -- but he leads the gang back along the ledge in retreat
- Powdery snow is settling from the avalanche
From a cave in the rocks, Brett and Evan crawl out a little timidly
What the hell -- Evan takes a pair of overpriced binoculars and looks up -- - The figures are small, but it's clear that one is pointing a gun at an orange-jacketed figure
lowers the binoculars
Brett -- you're not going to believe this -- but a couple of guys are holding a gun on Hal and forcing him up the bluff -- (
) believe it
Evan turns to who has found both Heldon's broken body, and his gun, half buried in snow
Evan walks over, amazed
What the fuck is going on here
Brett picks up the gun -- this is more an adventure than he ever dreamed of
Let's catch up and find out
Brett and Evan grab their packs, and hurry onto a trail, as we return to -- where Gabe was
Nothing is stirring
Until, there's some movement ten feet from where Gabe was hugging the wall
It's a crevice in the mountain, about two feet wide -- a climber would call this a "chimney" -- and it's packed with ice and snow
It's also packed with -- his hand gropes out -- and with some difficulty, he digs himself out, gasping and coughing
Gabe, coated with snow, leans against the wall and rests
Alive
- Maggie is on the phone, pacing, as Frank is slumped in front of the radio scanner
Suddenly, the radio comes to life
(
) -- Come in, Rescue Unit -- over -- Maggie bolts over to the radio before Frank can react
(keying mike) Rescue Unit -- what's going on, Hall
-- over -- -   - Travers has his gun pressed to Hal's temple
No tricks, no procedural codes, no personal messages -- just tell them everything's under control and you're taking care of the wounded
(keys it) We've reached the wreckage -- top of Comb Bluff -- six injured, but they're responding to treatment
Everything -
Over
(
) Everything isn't okay, Hal -- 'm coming up after you -- over -- Negative, Maggie
Winds are too high, and the passengers' injuries are all superficial
We're going to ride out the storm here -- over -- Travers yanks away the radio
Have her come up
Forget it -- downdrafts would wipe her all over the peaks -- (Travers starts to argue) -- Not that  expect you to give a shit, but it's our only copter
You'll be stuck
Travers relents and hands the radio back
(
) can handle the winds -- (breaking in) Forget about it, Maggie, that's an order -- acknowledge -- Maggie looks out the window
The station's windspeed gauge is flying around so fast it looks like it might take off
Acknowledged
Let me talk to Gabe -- over -- (
) (hesitates) You can't
He's taking care of passengers
Just like  should be
Over and out
Maggie leans back in the chair, looks out at the storm, and tries not to worry
She fails miserably
-   - (snatching radio away) Good
You might live longer than your friend
Now -- (takes out monitor) -- what
Hal takes the monitor -- the next blip is above, almost straight up
Hal motions to the wooded area ahead
The next one's on top of the peak
This'll be long, but easy -- more like a hike than a climb
(suspicious) It looks like a winding route
There's a more direct route
The East Face
But it's the wall on the other side, and it's smooth as glass
Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather
Only a psycho would try it in a snowstorm
Travers digests this, and motions Hal to move on as we -- : - ' is torn in pain
In spite of the cold and wind, he's drenched in sweat, half exertion, half fear
We pull back to take in - Envision a wall
really big wall
really, really big wall
wall that's as wide as it is high -- five thousand feet by five thousand feet -- narrowing to a domed peak at the summit
Now picture the same wall, checkered with ice
If this were horizontal, you or  couldn't walk on it without falling
Now picture the same wall with an orange dot, two-thirds of the way up it
The orange dot is and he barely has the strength to hold on, much less go up
Gabe holds himself steady with one hand, gets a foothold, and swings another hand up to  it against the wall
He's improvised gear -- he's tied a crampon to one hand
But it's as awkward as it sounds
Gabe moves up only a foot or so -- then pulls out the crampon, reaches up, and  it into the wall, starting the painful process over again
; - '  - Wright's pacing around, trying to figure out what in his office he should break first
Davis shows up at the door
(furious) Okay --  know it's not in San Francisco
know it's not here know it's not in any fucking airport from here to Montana
Where it's not - we got that covered
Now, do you have any ideas on where it is
(walking to a map) There's no radio contact, sir
At all
We're not receiving the tracer signal from the cockpit's flight recorder
Radar lost it after it went low here
He points to a huge part of Colorado
Hundreds of square miles
We have to assume it went down in the storm
Air search
(shakes head) That storm hasn't quit yet
Weather service says we've got it until tomorrow morning at least
Even if we could get a plane up now, it'd be impossible to see anything on the ground
And -- Wright slumps into a chair
-- The roads are shut down, right
Most of this area doesn't even have roads
(rubs his eyes) Keep two copters on full standby
And let me know the second that storm starts to wind down
: -   -  - is clearly exhausted and freezing -- his lips are blue, his eyebrows encrusted with snow
Wind still threatens to knock him off the wall -- but he forces himself on
(teeth chattering) steambath
(spikes himself up) steambath -- and a bottle of whiskey
(new foothold) steambath with a bottle of Glenlivet
And a fire
(new handhold) steambath -- with a bottle of Glenlivet -- and a steak
(new foothold) steak soaked with Glenlivet, cooking over a steambath on fire
Gabe finally reaches the top of the wall, where it meets an enormous overhang of ice
is right underneath where the ice flows over the wall
Gabe takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice overhead with more force than usual
This one is going to have to hold
Gabe steels himself for a tough move -- with one hand gripping that crampon, he swings out, away from the wall
Only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand are keeping Gabe from falling
Gabe needs the second crampon to make the move up -- but that's not going to be easy to get
It's attached to his boot
As Gabe clings to the upper crampon, his body swaying, he reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon
'  - The ground is one slip and five thousand feet away
Gabe fumbles desperately with the buckles on the crampons -- but both his fingers, and the buckles, are frozen stiff -- ' shows real, solid terror for the first time -- '  - Gabe gets the first buckle off -- then the second
The crampon is off his boot
still swinging from one hand, takes the now-freed crampon and slams it into the ice
It doesn't hold -- but the force of Gabe's swing, pushing him away, has loosened the other crampon
Gabe only gets one more shot at this -- he swings the free crampon up with all his might -- it catches in the same split second as the other dislodges
But the hard part is over -- with the two crayons, Gabe quickly manages to climb up over the lip of This is a field of ice sloping up to the top
Gabe pulls himself a few feet away from the edge, and puts the crampons back on his feet where they belong
It's now pretty simple for Gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to which is a rocky, wooded area
Gabe seems to have a second wind now -- he runs to the other side of the summit
The other side is obviously the route Hal and the others will be taking -- beneath the summit is a winding, well-beaten path
Gabe finally arrives at a small shack with a sign nearby commemorating the "  - 1933"
is just a small "point of interest" shed for hardy tourists who have hiked up this far -- there is a corny photo stand, where you stick your head through a hole, so your face is put on top of a cartoon climber hacking up a mountain
Gabe rushes past this to a glass display case on the wall
has black and white photos of a square jawed 1930s climber with his expedition -- more important is what's beneath it
Douglas' original climbing equipment -- a coil of rope, some pitons, a hat, a cloth backpack, small binoculars, other odds and ends
Gabe prepares to smash the glass -- and hesitates
Respect
(sighing) Sorry, Gordon --  promise 'll have it back tomorrow
Gabe  the glass as we move to -- - Hal is leading Qualen, Travers and the others upward -- this is a comparatively easy route, but still tiring
The sun goes down beyond a facing, taller mountain
Ryan is huffing and puffing -- the altitude and exertion are getting to him
Hal allows himself a smile at his discomfort
Come on -- tourists take this trail
Qualen pokes Hal with the gun -- he moves on ahead
- It's getting dark rapidly -- Gabe has scaled a rock formation so he has a view of the rest of the summit -- '  - Gabe slowly looks along the trees of the summit -- looks pretty ordinary to us, but something must have caught Gabe's eye, because he swings back to look at one tree
With broken branches on top
climbs down from his rock perch and rushes toward the tree
- This "expedition" reaches the top -- Hal is in the lead, with Qualen just inches behind
Qualen shoves Hal forward
Is this it
Yeah
This is it
Good
Get out of the way
Travers takes out the tracer and starts following the blip
- frantically rushes around, looking for the case -- he spots a crater of snow, rushes to it and starts digging
Even below the snow, the tracer's blinking red light is glowing and visible
Gabe laughs as he digs it out
- has his eyes glued to the tracer monitor, which shows the case is nearby
(smiling) This way
Qualen shines a light -- all of them push their way through the trees
is excited now -- he can't even wait for Qualen's flashlight, he intuitively races through the trees, dividing his attention between his surroundings and which shows he's practically on top of the case -- finally shoves his way through some small pines -- he can see the blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches
(calling behind) It's over here
Travers shoves his way through the branches, and heads for the light -- but something's wrong -- Qualen comes up behind Travers and shines the light on cute, if hastily constructed, stands with a five-pebble smile, as well as Douglas' cap, in a clearing
The still blinking, still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman
The case is leaned up against it
Travers runs over to the case, furious, and opens it
It's empty -- except for a single $5000 bill
Travers picks it up -- scrawled on the margin is "'
" (incredulous) He's still alive
(furious) He's still alive
(to Qualen and the others) He can't be far away -- spread out
Qualen, Kynette, Delmer and Krystel fan out into the woods, each with a flashlight and a fun
Ryan, however, straps on nightfinder goggles and runs out without a flashlight
(to Hal, brandishing gun) Put your hands on your head
- watches the chaos with a grin from a slightly elevated vantage point -- he can see the flashlight beams, all headed in the wrong direction
But he doesn't see - "" With these goggles, light is amplified a thousandfold -- this isn't one of those infra-red, thermo-blob jobs -- it looks more like day for night photography
Even starlight is enough for Ryan to run easily through the thick woods -- and he's going in the right direction
begins climbing down to level ground so he can circle closer to where Travers is holding Hal -- before he can get far -- ""  - looks up, and can clearly see Gabe climbing down the small rock, twenty yards distant -- smiles, looking macabre under the goggles, and opens fire -- is startled as the bullets impact inches over his head -- he jumps the last ten feet to the ground and is running even as he hits the ground -- more bullets hit where Gabe was a split second ago -- chases Gabe, easily maneuvering through the trees -- runs too, trying to dodge Ryan's continuing fusillades -- Gabe knows this territory, but to him, it's still pitch dark -- he stumbles, and rams against trees -- keeps coming up behind, closing the hap, Gabe's bright form just ahead -- comes out of the trees and finds he is on another part of the summit
All that's beneath him is ' -- a sudden, sloping plunge down a field of ice
No escape route here -- anything that goes down this slide is going all the way to the ground far below
is driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets -- he dives to the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder -- the sole source of cover
Kristel, Qualen and Kynette, having heard the gunshots, are now rushing to Gabe's position -- almost casually emerges from the woods
He can see there is nowhere for Gabe to have gone -- except behind the boulder
He walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world
fumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the Douglas exhibit -- an ancient flare that looks like a can of sterno
Gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it -- it resists and looks like a dud, but finally it catches, and as it ignites Gabe heaves it over the boulder at Ryan -- - ""  - arcs over the boulder to fully ignite, turning everything into a blinding, agonizing flash of white -- , putting one hand over the goggles, trying to rip them off -- bolts out from behind the boulder to rush him -- instantly aware of what Gabe's doing, blindly shoots, fanning out in a semi-circle as he gets the goggles off -- just runs straight ahead to Ryan, getting to him before the machine gun field of fire can intersect his path -- Gabe tackles Ryan as he manages to get the goggles off -- both men fall to the ground, and -- The machine gun  away, landing on the edge of the ice, just out of reach -- Ryan, now recovered from the blinding flash, pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at Gabe -- Gabe rolls away in time, and gets to the machine gun, grabbing it -- But Ryan dives for Gabe, slamming into him -- the force of it knocks the machine gun loose -- it skips down the ice slope -- but the momentum of Ryan's hit also carries both Gabe and Ryan over the edge, onto -- Gabe and Ryan both tumble over the edge and start sliding down, Ryan face first on his stomach, Gabe head first and on his back -- both are in immediate agony, because -- it's covered with razor sharp, irregular ridges, both large and small, that slice through clothing and shred skin as they pick up speed -- ' -  - The edge and a five thousand foot drop are less than a hundred yards away -- Ryan flails and  as the ice gashes him from underneath -- Gabe, however, manages to flip over and to the side -- he lunges on top of Ryan and rides him down like a bobsled -- '  - is coming up too fast -- tries to maintain his perch on Ryan, who is  and not yet used to the idea of being a human sled -- he isn't remaining still enough to provide a smooth ride -- Gabe frantically reaches behind to Ryan's wrist to get the ice axe, trailing from a wrist strap, but Ryan's arm is thrashing away, threatening to toss off the axe -- Qualen, Kristel and Kynette arrive at the lip, and look down, incredulous -- - Gabe and Ryan, accelerating, have almost reached the edge -- finally grabs the ice axe, pulling it off Ryan's wrist -- just as they reach the precipice edge, Gabe loops the axe to his wrist and swings toward the ice with everything he's got -- The axe's scythe-like blade catches on the ice, right at the lip of the precipice -- Gabe is wrenched to a painful halt, suspended over the drop, as what's left of Ryan, still , shoots over the edge -- Gabe unhooks the axe, and gets another handhold
Gabe uses the axe to climb further down the ice to some rock -- finding easier hand holds, he quickly disappears into the darkness
, look down -- Ryan's death scream is still echoing
Qualen is furious -- Gabe has escaped with the second case
(to Kynette) Follow him
Kynette shines his flashlight below, illuminating the long, frozen streak of blood on the ice
(gestures with light) After you
- The expedition has holed up here for the night -- Travers and Qualen look upset
Things aren't going as well as they'd hoped
Kristel tries to get some candy out of a vending machine that's obviously empty
Kynette saws at some camp food with a distinctive knife -- the handle is a set of brass knuckles
Delmer guards Hal, who is bound, and seated by the souvenir photo stand
Well -- look at the bright side
(beat) At least you've only got to make the split five ways now
- Gabe confidently drops down onto a large ledge that juts out from the wall -- obviously familiar territory for him
The ledge leads to a small, enclosed cave
Gabe takes out his penlight and shines it -- but the light looks dim
Batteries are low
Gabe pockets it, flicks his lighter and goes in -- in the flickering light, we can see that no one has been in here for a while -- snow, dust, rocks -- but we should also recognize this from the photo seen earlier as Gabe, Maggie and Hal's hangout
smiles with the memories -- then his face brightens with one memory in particular
Gabe rushes to a corner of the cave and opens a rock-lid to a hiding place
Please still be there -- oh, please -- Gabe reaches in the stash and finds an ancient half-full pint of Jack Daniels
The first thing to go right all day
Gabe uncaps it and gratefully gulps down a double shot
Peace, at last
Gabe smiles and leans against the wall, closing his eyes -- but he's startled instantly by a  -- Gabe's eyes shoot open -- An aggressive rat scurries toward him on the floor
Gabe grabs a rock and  the rat off-screen, ending the screeches with one blow
Gabe's face first registers disgust -- then an idea
Then real disgust
Sighing, Gabe pulls out a pocket knife and opens the blade
: -    - Gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass -- properly skinned and butchered -- off his knife blade
We can see from flickering shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave -- we pull back to see which is built out of small bundles of $5,000 bills
It's safe to say that something like $500,000 is going up in smoke, and the fire's dying down
Gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on the flame
Gabe cools the knife in some snow, saws off a rat leg, and chews unhappily
(mouth full) Mmm
Just like -- chicken
Gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of Jack Daniel
It's going to have to last him
He has an entire rat to get through
: - The first rays of the sun start to poke through the mountains
It's stopped snowing -- the storm seems to be letting up
Very quiet in here
Frank is snoring, slumped over the radio
Maggie is wide awake and obviously hasn't slept -- her attention is fixed out the window
'  - The gauge is still flying around, but clearly shows that the winds are slowing
- ' Wright is coiled at his desk, tense
Ten empty styrofoam coffee cups -- and dark rings under Wright's eyes -- make clear he hasn't slept
Wright's assistant bursts in
We've got a fix on the plane, sir -- we're getting a reading on the flight recorder tracer -- Any visual
Any radio contact
Not yet -- (heading to the door) Get the copters ready
We take off in three minutes
The winds are still too strong -- Sorry to hear it
We're still going
The plane might be intact
Wright drags the protesting Davis out the door
Sir -- Shut up
That fifty million isn't coming out of my pension
-    - Travers, Qualen and the rest of the expedition head out of the shack, a little groggy
Odds are no one got much sleep
Travers shoves Hal toward a sketchy "  " map of the mountain range, and hands him the tracer monitor
Still interested in staying alive
Hal matches the monitor to the map -- the blip is higher up
(pointing to map) It's up here
Somewhere on the Tower
There's a way to cross over to the top in about half a day
Show me
Travers shoves Hal forward -- the others follow
/ - From about fifty yards off, someone watches Hal lead the gang away from the shack
(
) They're heading toward the opposite edge
An easy way down
are crouched in the woods
Brett, gun in hand, has no idea how far out of his league he is
Evan looks like he's having second thoughts, but he can't hack down now
'll cut around this side, and wind up in front
You come up behind them -- quietly
And we've got 'em
Brett -- they've got five guns -- And you can collect them all after get the drop on 'em
Let's get moving
Brett, automatic held high, circles off through the woods
Evan reluctantly lopes off toward his assignment
- ' Gabe pulls his jacket on -- reversed, with the grey lining out, so the orange won't make him so easy to spot -- and starts out towards the facing Tower -- his route, clearly, is going to be along the rock wall
It's relatively sheer, but there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy
/ - races quietly through the woods in a parallel path with Hal, who's guiding the hang
Brett circles around ahead of them, waiting
Before he can jump out -- '  - hiding ahead in the trees and rocks
makes eye contact with Brett, realizes what he's doing, and shakes his head as violently as he dares -- no, don't -- gives Hal a confident wink in response, then pounces in front of the gang, gun held high
End of the line
Travers, Delmer, Kristel and Kynette are startled, but don't immediately comply
This throws Brett off his stride
(nervous now) You heard me
Drop the guns
Travers smiles and steps closer to Brett
The others walk up in front of Hal
Travers actually laughs
"End of the line"
That's classic
(beat) You've got style
So, 'm going to give you a three-count to figure out how to turn the safety off
Brett doesn't even look down -- he responds by  a short burst over Travers' head
Nice try
've got one of these at home
Now drop 'em
All drop their guns -- Brett, unfortunately, realizes at the same time we do -- Hey -- where's the other guy -- (shouting) Brett, behind you
Too late -- Brett can only twist around half way before -- easily mows down Brett with his machine gun, riddling him with at least thirty rounds at close range
Brett falls dead into the snow
Qualen walks up to Brett's corpse, blood steaming in the reddening snow, and kicks it over
Gabe, reacting to the sound of the machine gun fire, climbs up, but there's nothing he can do -- and the others pick up their guns
(turning to face Hal) Time to -- Travers sees that Hal is gone -- he's escaped in the confusion
- runs like his ass is on fire and practically collides with Evan, who is more panicked than ever
What are we going to do -- You came up here to jump the spur -- (pulls Evan's chute out of his pack) This'd be a great time to do it
(panicked) But -- (quick) Listen -- they don't know you're up here -- 'll draw their fire, you've got to make the jump and get help
don't --  -- uh -- (exasperated, grabs chute) Unless you want to do it the other way around
Evan snatches the parachute and runs off
Hal, wasting no time, runs in the opposite direction, deliberately making as much noise as he can, slapping branches, stomping on rocks
- runs into the woods -- Qualen and Kristel, hearing Hal's noisy retreat, run after him
But Travers stops for a second -- he has spotted ' in the snow -- not unlike a neon arrow
runs in the direction of the footprints and quickly closes the gap between him and who tries to pull on the chute and run at the same time -- it's not easy
Evan closes one of the three buckles -- but bursts out of the woods and runs up right behind him -- in the meantime, get behind Hal in a clearing -- Kristel over his head
Stop
Hal, caught again, freezes in his tracks
is still up and running -- he dodges Travers' fire, weaving through trees, getting the second buckle closed -- he sees the edge, just ahead, and puts on an extra burst of speed -- does likewise, still firing -- his clip runs out, but this only buys Evan an extra few seconds -- is a rock formation that just out like a diving board -- Evan runs like hell to the edge of it -- is right behind him, and has slapped a fresh clip in place, but before he can shoot -- dives off the edge and clasps the third buckle -- - is directly below a few hundred feet -- looking up, he thinks Evan has made it -- but - throws himself down, aims quickly but carefully, and twenty rounds towards Evan's falling figure -- - Evan  -- he hasn't been hit -- - Come on -- wait till you're out of range -- don't pull it yet -- - Several seconds pass -- Evan is now several hundred feet down and apparently out of firing range -- stops firing -- but doesn't seem unhappy at all
more and pulls the -ring -- the parachute billows open, inflating -- which has been shredded by bullets that hit the pack -- as quickly as it inflates, it deflates through dozens of holes -- whatever resistance is left vanishes as the canopy collapses
' exhilaration turns to panic as he frantically pulls on the chute's guide lines -- but the more he does this, the faster the chute caves in -- he  as the chute finally gives way and plummets right past who is powerless to do anything but watch -- falls the long, full five thousand feet, desperately, uselessly, pulling in the lines of the tattered chute until he's tangled in it like a shroud -- turns away -- he can't watch Evan hit bottom -- he grimaces and looks up with absolute hate at who doesn't see Gabe -- he's laughing at Evan's desperation, which ends as his death scream is cut off
Hal is led over to the spur, with the other gang members behind him
Hal looks as angry as Gabe
Was that Walker
No such luck
(to Hal, smiling) Cheer up
Everyone should die in a spot this beautiful
- who has heard this and is shaking with fury
(quietly) Don't worry
You will
On top, Hal reluctantly leads the gang away -- below, we can see Gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges
-  - Winds or not, Maggie is untying the helicopter's rotor from the bolts on the helipad
Frank, who has obviously just awakened, rushes out of the station
Maggie -- what are you doing -- 'm going to go nuts if  sit here one more hour
Still a little breezy out, Mag -- Maggie gets into the helicopter and starts the rotor
(over engine's whine) You coming
Frank hesitates, but climbs in the other side
The helicopter lifts off and heads toward the mountain range
-   - The next obstacle Hal is leading the gang through is a buttress -- a large, stark boulder formation -- that lays between the mountain they've just come from, and the nearest mountain to it: the Tower
This is lower down from the summit -- it's solid and treeless
Hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they climb in single file up to the top
Terrain is flat enough that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours
Hal leads the gang forward -- and keeps casting anxious glances back at them
And beyond them
Travers notices this
Forget about it
He's smart, but he's not invisible
Hal looks back
Travers is right
There's absolutely no way Gabe can come up behind them without being seen
where the bluff meets a tree-lined plain
Gabe, in hiding, watches Hal and the others go up
No, he can't follow them up the bluff's side without being seen
But Gabe moves closer to the bluff's base -- Gabe shoves through some trees to the beginning of "" crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff
pulls out his ancient binoculars, and scans the crack
'  - Starting with an outside view, we can see that the crevice runs all the way up, and through, the bluff -- but it's a zig-zag, not a straight line
Picture a mine shaft designed by a madman
The crack moves upward, then erratically to the side, then straight up again
The width of the crack is uneven, ranging from six inches to six feet
And that's just how it looks on the outside
There's no telling what the interior is like
Gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack
It's hard to see much -- it's very, very dark
But it looks as if the crack goes all the way through the bluff, as well as all the way up it
On this route, Gabe can tunnel through the mountain instead of going up the side
puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack, starting the long process of going up -- and through -- the mountain formation
-    - frenzy of activity, as several dozen Treasury agents sift through the snow for the wreckage of the -39, some taking photos, some taking videotapes, some putting the pieces into bags for analysis
Many bags
Many small bags
The Treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash and its subsequent explosion -- there are few pieces here that aren't charred, and fewer still that are any larger than a paperback book
unhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering up the plane, to a harried crash specialist from the  -- (40s) -- who is organizing the debris
What can you confirm
Well, sir -- it crashed
That,  can confirm
(condescending) We've been here just about one hour
These events take months to analyze
So if you'll excuse me -- He walks away -- but Wright, pissed, spins him around
No,  don't think  will
The reason the  pays you is to exercise your vast, amazing knowledge of these "events"
So  expect you to come up with some stunning insights, something a slow-witted fuck like me hasn't already observed
(gesturing to wreckage) One: it didn't blow up in mid-air, because the debris isn't widely dispersed
But was there a bomb on board that could have disabled it wonder
(pointing back) Two: There wasn't an attempted landing
Otherwise, there'd be debris to the east of the wreckage, where the plane was coming from
Did it come straight down
That's got me scratching my head too
(gesturing back to wreckage) And three: the flight recorder's tracer led us here in the first place
So where is the goddamn thing
That one's got me all aflush with curiosity
(a little cowed) You'll be the first to know
Oh,  believe you
Wright storms off as agents delicately handle debris
/ - vista
From this point, you can see everything else in the mountain range
The only thing left that's taller is the Tower, a hundred yards away
Between the two mountains lies a drop of a mere four thousand feet
Hal has led the rest of the gang up to the edge
Travers approaches him, furious
thought you said there was an easy way across
There is
You might not like it much
Hal points steep two hundred yard downhill climb leads to a wire that bridges the two mountains
The same wire we saw at the beginning -- left behind from Susan Collins' botched rescue
- Of course -- we'll have to do it hand over hand
Seems  forgot my harness
Sorry
Don't be
Lead on
Hal is surprised to see Kynette pull a harness out of his pack -- the one Travers used earlier
Disappointed, Hal leads the downward climb, looking several hundred yards to running up, and through, the bluff, coming out on this side
' registers a thought -- will he
-- then dismissal
Nah
He couldn't
/ -   ' Gabe is sweating, straining in the dark, climbing up -- this'd be a good spot to pull back and take in the view, except -- -- there's nowhere to pull back to
There's about two inches of clearance between Gabe's chest and the rock, and about the same between his back and the rock
To the right, there is no light
At all
To the left, there's no light
Even above, there is no light, because the crack isn't straight -- nature isn't that obliging -- it zig-zags up
Gabe is well within the mountain rock
Nothing could be closer to being buried alive Gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up -- he takes out his penlight and turns it on -- '  - even this dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the wall, surrounding him, up and down, left and right -- ' is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that he's made a big mistake
didn't need to see that
really didn't
Gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark
- Maggie and Frank are flying low and fast, over treetops and snow -- both are intently staring down -- is nothing but empty wilderness
But a  goes off -- turn their attention to the helicopter's heat scope, which shows something alive beneath them
Got 'em -- they're under the trees -- Maggie smiles and slows the copter over a clearing -- / touches down
Maggie is out of it before the rotor has stopped turning, running into the trees
Hal
Gabe
Maggie runs into the trees, headlong into that are preying on -- a body
pair of legs are gruesomely sticking out from the feast
One wolf turns to  at Maggie -- but Frank runs up and pulls a gun from a holster
Frank aims high and  twice to scare the pack -- the wolves run off
Maggie goes to the body -- Frank holds her back, but she goes ahead anyway, worried it might be Gabe -- as she examines the body -- It's Evan
(she stands, looks up) Parachute failed
(not unkindly) Damn fool
Why would anybody try that in the middle of a storm
Why would anybody try at all
(sighs) Get the bag
/ Gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now
He pulls himself up with his hands, then braces his body with his back, and pulls himself up again -- he's not looking up, because he can't see anything yet anyway -- naturally, this leads to -- head and rock collision
Gabe's head crashes against a new part of the crack, as the passage thins out
He gropes up
The passage is narrowing to the point that he can't get through it
Dead end
Should've taken that left turn at Albequerque
Gabe backs down, and starts to slide across the side
With his back wedged against the rear wall, he uses his feet to push against the forward wall
'  - Zero visibility -- Gabe can't see what he's shoving toward
There has never been light of any kind in here
blindly pushes to the side, rattled by the difficulty of doing this in the dark
It's just like any other side move -- you can't see where the fuck you're going, that's all -- Gabe stops and fishes out his penlight
Turning it on, it's clear those batteries haven't gotten any more potent in the last few hours
Gabe shines it to the side
'  - is fading fast
match's last gasp is brighter
exasperated, puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on
(garbled) Much better
Gabe inches on to the side
Looks up to see if the crack has gotten wider
It hasn't
Gabe mumbles something phonetically near "motherfucker" around the flashlight, aiming it up -- '  - No opening larger than a mail slot -- still cursing, still looking up, still moving to the side -- he gets the opening he wants, but not where he wants it -- The crack suddenly, drastically widens as he moves to the side -- since he's been bracing his back against the wall, Gabe falls out of control, twisting around, face down -- Gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack
It's now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself -- '  - falls out of Gabe's mouth and tumbles down, ping-ponging from one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long, long way down -- even after the light is gone, we can still hear the penlight's receding clattering against the walls -- is now, literally, in a jam
There are no handholds, no ledges, and the walls are slick
All he can do is remain braced against the crack's walls until his already sore arms and legs give out
-  '  - Frank is now flying the helicopter -- a body bag is stashed in the back, and Maggie is in the passenger seat
(motioning down) Bring it down here
Maggie -- Just do it, Frank
The copter touches down -- Frank doesn't turn it off
Maggie jumps out with a walkie talkie
Frank makes another try
Maggie, this is dumb -- No it isn't
'm going to find Brett --  don't want to have to talk to his widow too
Fly Evan's body back to base -- 'll call you when 've found Brett
Or Hal
Or Gabe
Or anybody
Maggie runs off into the snow as Frank lifts off
Maggie moves quickly through the snow, and it isn't long before she spots multiple tracks in the snow -- they lead toward, and up, the buttress
Now she's really confused
But with nothing left to do, she starts climbing up the side
- ' As we've caught Hal in mid-crossing, he's looking from whence he came -- the opposite side of the buttress, where Travers has a gun trained on him -- unhappily hangs high above the ground from the harness kindly provided by Travers -- '  - Kristel is waiting, also with a gun trained on him
Hal arrives and disengages -- the harness is pulled back
Kynette pulls the harness back and hands it to Qualen, who's standing next to Travers
(motioning up) 'm going back
Look -- this part is nothing, believe me -- Walker should be coming up by now
Kynette, automatic strapped to his chest, rushes back to the buttress' summit
/ Gabe is just as we left him
Face down, arms and legs pressing against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls
Carefully, Gabe takes one hand off the wall, gets out his lighter with the other, and ignites it for a look -- '  - Just as the crack has widened below him -- it's wider above him
More important, it slants at an easy enough angle to allow him to walk up
If only he can get up there
snaps the lighter shut, pockets it, and readies himself
Gabe steadily "walks" up the vertical passage by bracing himself with one leg and one arm -- then moving the other leg and arm up
Gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge where the crack snakes into a sideways passage
But there are no handholds that will allow Gabe to get a grip and simply swing over and climb up
(winded) So much for the easy part
- Gabe takes a deep breath, readies himself, and shoves himself away from the wall with his arms, pushes himself into a squat against the opposite wall, hanging for a second with no support at all, and he springs from that all into Gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts backsliding into the drop, but he digs in with his boots and his hands
Safe at last
Gabe carefully stands in a crouch -- and starts heading up
Kynette moves to the edge, lies flat, and looks down -- '  - Maggie is climbing up, but she's still some way down -- and the hood of her parka has been pulled over her head
All Kynette can see is what she's wearing: an orange parka
smiles and hits his headset radio
He's on the way up
could hear that jacket before  could see it
(
) (over radio) Then get the money, kill him and get back here
Now
(into radio) 'll wait till he comes to me
Kynette flattens out to wait -- Maggie is coming up fast
/ Gabe moves up through the diagonal section -- the crack is starting to go directly upward
Gabe looks up -- '  - It's coated with snow, but not too much -- Gabe can faintly make out light shining through up there
knows the top is twenty feet away
Gabe starts up the easy segment, his back braced against one wall
- is staring down intently at the climber below -- '  - is now almost to the top -- sweating with exertion, she throws her hood back
keys his headset radio again
(into radio) Bulletin
The climber isn't Walker -- it's a woman
/ Gabe, wedged near the top of the crack, is ready to dig through the snow -- but he hears the sound, muffled and distant, of Kynette talking
Gabe strains to hear -- a bad time to come up
Might be
Maggie, tired, gets near the top and collapses, resting for a moment, her arms on the edge -- Maggie looks up and is very surprised to see Kynette, standing over her, smiling, his gun aimed down at her
Rotten weather for a climb, huh
(aims barrel) have two questions 'd like to trouble you with
Ready
Maggie stares up, frozen -- whatever she was expecting, it wasn't this
This first one's easy
Do you know a man named Gabe Walker
Yes
(breathless, scared) Where is he
You don't know either
am sorry
That was question number two
(lowers barrel) Thanks for your time
As Kynette tightens his finger around the trigger -- appears -- he completes his run toward Kynette's back and kicks him over the edge -- goes flying over Maggie, his shots going wild -- but he catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe halt after skidding down ten feet -- yanks Maggie to her feet and onto the top
Maggie gets a good look at Gabe -- his clothes are slashed, he's covered with cuts, and coated with slime and dirt from the crack
He looks like he's just spent a week in Hell
Gabe doesn't react to her reaction -- he just grabs her hand and runs
chooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge -- he fires and automatic  at Gabe and Maggie
Come on -- Where
-- Here
Gabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack, caving it in -- Gabe falls two feet into - ' Gabe has grabbed, and is hanging from, a rope anchored to a piton on the edge of the rock
He's also glowering up at Maggie a little impatiently
Today, goddamit
Gabe rappels down the rope into the darkness
hesitates -- she's still getting used to the idea of being shot at -- woozy but recovered, has climbed up -- he runs toward the opening,  his gun -- drops into the relative safety of the crack and rappels downward
Maggie reaches rope's end thirty feet down, as the vertical passage again becomes diagonal
Gabe is there waiting
reaches the edge of the crack and  down into it -- - -- bullets are  all over -- Gabe throws himself over Maggie to shield her
can't see what he's shooting at, so he mercifully stops
Seeing the rope, he bends down to climb after them -- - Gabe reaches up and tugs gently on the rope twice -- - -- which is tied in a standard climber's slipknot and comes undone with a final tug -- the rope, freed of the piton, falls down, but Kynette firmly grabs hold of the end -- feels the rope go taut -- he yanks the rope down hard -- gets more pull than he counted on and takes a head first fall into the crack, disappearing with a scream -- Qualen has just arrived in time to see this -- looks over as Kynette bounces past him, a few feet away -- the rope goes slack in his hand as Kynette falls below
- in frustration,  a burst straight down into the crack -- -   / Gabe and Maggie move laterally through the crack -- now about thirty feet from where they started, so ricochets are a serious but decreasing problem
The crack narrows from five to three feet
Gabe edges Maggie down into it, and along a ledge moving to the side
This way
(off Maggie's look) like the outside of the mountain better too, but -- Gabe and Maggie move along the ledge -- is still at the edge of the crack -- stymied
He's definitely not climbing down after them -- he pulls back from the edge
/ - find a comparative point of comfort -- a toe-sized ledge
Maggie is moving ahead of Gabe
Stop
We can't -- need to stop
Exhausted, Gabe braces himself against the wall
(looks at Maggie) 'm glad to see you -- but Christ, wish you hadn't come
-   - Qualen whizzes across the wire on the harness, easily making it to where Hal, Travers and Kristel are waiting
Don't tell me -- (disengaging) He's still alive
Travers takes a couple of heavy swings at the connecting bolt with Hal's axe
Qualen grabs his arm before he can take a third swing -- and looks at his watch
For another two minutes
/ - Gabe catches his breath
All this is taking its toll on him
It hurts just looking at you
(still panting) Try it from this side
Do you still have your radio
It's not going to work in here
Let's give it a try
(she hands it to him) 'm in bad need of a ride
(keys it) Come in, Rescue Unit -- - Hal is leading the expedition upward along a ledge -- the radio, in Travers' pack, comes to life
(
) (over radio) -- Come in, Rescue One -- Travers stares daggers at Qualen
Qualen looks to his watch
Patience
The radio is reading Gabe loud, if not clear -- the interference of solid rock is garbling it
But we can see out the window that Frank is now between radios, carefully hauling Evan's body from the helicopter to the station on a collapsible gurney
No one else is in the station
(
) (over radio, broken up) -- Come in, Frank -- / Gabe, exasperated, stops for a moment
Is there anybody else on the radio
Maggie shakes her head no
take a year off and the department goes to hell
(keys it) -- Come in, Rescue Unit -- - We can see there are three holes punched in the snow along the crack's top -- Recognizably the part of the crack Gabe and Maggie dove into -- but perched on the edge is a block of plastic explosive -- the detonator  races down -- 0:20 -- 0:19 -- has been punched in the snow at the center point of the crevice's top -- another bomb has been planted there -- at the opposite end of the crevice has a third timer tied to a third pack of plastics -- Qualen is staring at his watch, but pointing the others toward the buttress
(
) (via radio) Come in, Frank -- over -- Try to get thirty million in entertainment out of this, because he is definitely in for thirty million worth of pain
Gabe's radio calls continue as Qualen extends his arm towards the buttress and starts a silent hand countdown, stage manager style -- five -- four -- three -- - The  runs down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- is shattered by a huge blast as the first bomb detonates -- / The walls are pulverized near the top and cave in, raining rocks further down towards -- who are hit by a blast of air booming down through the confined space -- Gabe drops the radio -- Maggie slips, but Gabe grabs her -- both slide down the crack, out of control, until it narrows to a three foot width -- and they stop -- Gabe shoves Maggie against the wall and tries to protect her with his body as the rocks start to rain down -- Hal lunges at Qualen, but is held back by Travers
You sick fuck -- Don't worry
They may still be alive
That was the small one
Frank stops wheeling the gurney and looks up at the far-off blast, and the smoke, amazed
Jesus -- that's some flare
Rocks tumble down it, filling it in and sealing it off -- - is braced over Maggie, protecting her from the first round of falling rocks, but rolling  in the crack announces that more is coming -- Gabe looks up as the noise gets closer -- The rockslide arrives -- the crack is filled in seconds with rocks and dirt, packing it in -- Gabe tries to hold on, but is shoved down by the falling rocks -- Maggie, however, is buried in the crack as it fills -- is knocked down to a point where the crack narrows -- he stops himself by jamming his body against the sides
Suddenly, it's quiet
little dirt whistles through, but that's all
The cave-in has stopped, as it's filled in the crack above
And Maggie is in the middle of it
Gabe unsheaths his ice axe and starts hacking up to get at Maggie
Dirt and rocks fall in his face as he digs -- - Another  is counting down from 3:00 -- 2:59 -- 2:58 -- Gabe frantically hacks at the ceiling of dirt -- rock and soil tumble down, but no sign of Maggie
Gabe uncovers one of Maggie's feet
Is it too late
Gabe digs up around her -- Maggie realizes Gabe is there -- she starts kicking
Finally Maggie tumbles out of the cave-in -- gasping and coughing, but alive
Gabe catches her and brushes the dirt off her face
Are you all right
(terrified, coughing) Why are they doing this
Frank, having lain Evan's body to rest, runs back to the helicopter, starts it up and takes off
/ Gabe is leading Maggie horizontally through the crack, fast and furious -- (looks up) We might be able to get up that way -- there's an opening -- No -- there could be another bomb up there -- even if there isn't, we could get another cave-in
The only sure way out is through the side
- Treasury agents sift debris as Davis runs up to Stuart
've got something here
Let's have it
There's an unconfirmed report of a distress call made from a plane that crashed
That's really, really interesting, but -- (gestures around) -- kind of old news, don't you think
This call was supposedly made from a plane that crash landed
After it landed
(waves it off) Sounds like they got it wrong
Next time you interrupt my work make sure it's something  can use
/ Gabe and Maggie cautiously move along a single ledge -- finally, some light can be seen, thirty feet ahead, as they round a corner
(smiling) Come on -- we're almost out
The crack narrows, and Gabe straddles it, putting his feet on the opposite edge to walk faster
But before he can go on -- grabs one of Gabe's ankles from below and yanks him down -- Gabe tumbles painfully, braking himself in front of bruised and bloody, who has survived the earlier fall and made his way out
His look is not a forgiving one
Miss me
Kynette smashes Gabe's face with a devastating, brass-knuckled punch -- falls back, desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself from going all the way down -- as he weakly tries to get up -- calmly opens his knife, and re-laces his fingers into its brass-knuckle handle
The gang and Hal watch the mountain top, with very different expectations and hopes -- their vantage point keeps them from seeing where the crack actually comes out
(looks to Hal) You might say a few words for your friends -- this is the one that will bury them
- Ready to blow -- 0:10 -- 0:09 -- - can only look down helplessly at fighting -- Gabe is on his feet, but Kynette, slashing at him with his knife, is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is getting wider, and finding footholds while crab-walking backwards in the dark isn't east
Gabe's in a rotten fighting position -- as he has to spread his feet out wider as he backs up, he's always lower than Kynette
Gabe throws a punch at Kynette's stomach, but there's no power to it
Kynette hits Gabe with a brutal knuckle-duster punch -- Gabe flies back several feet, somehow managing to straddle the crack walls -- which are now four feet apart
Kynette moves in for the kill
- The  counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- but doesn't detonate
green light starts flashing, but the bomb hasn't gone off
/ Kynette moves in over Gabe and swings down with the knife -- But Gabe grabs his knife hand, and adding his own force to the swing, imbeds the knife to the hilt in the rock wall, trapping Kynette's hand in the brass-knuckle handle
Gabe stabilizes himself on Kynette's trapped arm and gets a little payback -- three solid roundhouse punches to Kynette's face -- he then climbs up his pinned opponent, stepping up on Kynette's stuck hand as if it were a piton
Qualen's smirk is wiped off his face
The bomb didn't work
What happened
'm not sure --  set the timer -- Qualen gestures helplessly, putting the radio in Hal's reach
Hal takes advantage of this, throws off Travers, and grabs the radio
(keying radio) Gabe, it's a dud -- But the second Hal transmits -- detonates over the central part of the crevice, and as promised, it's even bigger than the first -- The bomb instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice -- The  of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable -- Gabe shoves Maggie forward -- Move
Maggie doesn't have to be told twice -- she and Gabe move out the narrowed crack quickly, but under the circumstances, this "running" looks damn slow -- struggles with the stuck knife as the cave-in knocks him off the wall and buries him instantly -- cover the last ten feet, shoved forward by an airburst from the giant explosion -- they make it to the crack's edge at last, but on the Gabe and Maggie still have to cling desperately to the sheer wall -- the airburst has turned the crack into a wind tunnel -- it's as if the mountain were trying to blow them out
Hal, shocked, stares at the enormity of the explosion
Qualen looks serenely satisfied
When  was seventeen,  was a sentry on the East Berlin boundary
There was a problem, then -- too many defectors were managing to sneak through the wilderness to the west man would take them through, every night of every week -- a man like your friend
(beat) He had quite a sense of humor
Every time he got someone through, he'd radio us at midnight to let us know how many
"Five tonight
" "Eight more have been freed tonight
" No one could find the route
It made me look bad
(beat) looked day and night and finally found it
tunnel
didn't tell me superiors
put a charge there, with a timer to trigger a radio receiver on the detonator
At midnight
Our friend made his radio report, and  heard him say "seven" before the explosion
(beat) They pulled eight bodies out of the tunnel, and  was promoted to intelligence the next day
Hal, stunned, looks at the radio, realizing Qualen tricked him into detonating the bomb
Travers, grinning, takes the radio from Hal and pats him on the back
Thanks
We couldn't have killed him without you
- The force of the airburst, as brief as it is strong, is over
Dust slowly swirls out -- Gabe and Maggie raise their heads
Gabe looks back -- the crack is now sealed off
Gabe takes a piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to Maggie along with the rope
Knock this in the side
Make it firm
Maggie does as Gabe takes the binoculars out, and climbs out on a slim toehold so he can look up the wall
'  - Gabe whips the binoculars up to the top edge of the wall
It's blurry -- Gabe focuses the binoculars on -- the third bomb, visible on the mountain's edge
The  counts down, but it's partly obscured
All Gabe can see is the seconds, not the minutes, that remain -- :42 -- :41 -- (
) Bad news
There's another bomb up there
We've got to move quick
Gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below
All smooth
Until -- Gabe swings the binoculars back
There's a lip ninety feet below, leading into the wall
cave
(
) Good news
There's a cave down there
puts away the binoculars and swings back to Maggie -- she lets the length of rope drop
It's thirty feet long
Not even almost long enough to get to the shelter
Gabe leans against the crack wall, drained
Now what
- Frank is in the air, heading back out toward the range, frantically working the radio
Maggie -- come in, Maggie, this is Rescue One -- Frank's call is heard on the radio
Travers takes it, and takes charge
There's our ride out of here
Everyone out of sight -- except you, Kristel
(hands her radio) Make the distress call
You're so good at it
All scramble up towards the clearing
- We can see what Gabe couldn't -- the timer has about two minutes left -- 1:59 -- 1:58 -- -   ' Gabe looks completely defeated
Can't go up
Can't go back in
Can't go down
(frantic) What are we going to do
(defeated) Die
'm sorry, Maggie
'm sorry you got into this
Gabe and Maggie fuse together in a tight embrace -- a final embrace
But Gabe opens his eyes as the rope, still in Maggie's hand, brushes his cheek
The end is frayed
Gabe's eyes light up
Inspiration
Gabe breaks off the embrace and snatches the rope from her -- he pulls at the end and furiously starts unravelling it
What are you doing
- Davis has just filled in Wright on the "unconfirmed" distress call
Wright looks furious
He didn't think a distress call from a crashed plane was "important"
(Davis nods) Get me a fucking radio
Now
flying over the mountains
Frank is practically there, heading toward the buttress and the facing Tower
(over radio) Come in, Maggie, over -- (
) (over radio -- "weak") Alpha Charlie Niner -- please -- help -- Frank recognizes the pilot's voice from the "distress call"
(over radio) copy, Charlie Niner -- what's your position -- over -- An aerial flare fires up, leaving a clear marker
(over radio) Sit tight, Charlie Niner -- 'm right on top of you
-   ' Gabe is still unravelling the rope fiber -- it's three different segments wound together
The helicopter flies overhead -- and past
(shouting, waving) Frank
Down here
Frank
Forget about it
He can't hear you
(hands Maggie some rope) Tie these together
Tight
(realizing) -- Are you out of your mind -- This is rope from the Gordon exhibit
The way guys climbed then, they'd tie on three at a time -- this rope'll take around nine hundred pounds
Gabe -- this rope is sixty years old -- (misses the point) Yeah, they made it pretty good then
Each of these strands ought to hold about 300 pounds before snapping
Gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton -- Maggie works on the third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of what she and Gabe weigh together
(dazed) Ought to
About
(beat) Will it hold
Gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop
Ninety feet of what looks like twine
Depends on how big a breakfast you had
You want to go first
Maggie's stunned -- but there's no choice
She starts the rappel down, and Gabe is close behind
- is ready to blow -- 0:12 -- 0:11 -- - To make this even trickier, they have to swing over to the side about fifteen feet to get to the cave -- meaning they have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more pressure on which looks sorely tested at one knot -- it's coming undone -- - They swing down lower -- twenty feet to the cave, four thousand to the ground -- - -- 0:04 -- 0:03 -- - They reach the end of the rope -- six feet above the cave and fifteen feet away laterally
(shouting) Swing towards it -- and drop
Maggie nods -- they start the swing over -- as they get over the cave's lip -- snaps -- fall, landing roughly on the cave's narrow lip -- Gabe starts to slip over, but Maggie pulls him back as -- The bomb detonates and starts raining debris -- an instant, massive rockslide -- dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past -- exhausted, they collapse on the cave floor
- Frank, obviously, is surprised by the nearby explosion
What the fuck -- But he sees Kristel in a clearing
Face down in the snow
First things first
/ Frank lands near her, and rushes over to her
Frank turns her over and breaks a capsule under her nose
She "wakes up" with a start and looks "terrified"
What -- who are -- Don't worry
'm here to help
(recovered) Glad to hear it
Kristel sees the snap is off Frank's holster -- she grabs it, spins it around, and pulls the trigger
Frank grabs her wrist with a move faster than you'd expect from him, and he yanks the pistol back
Jailhouse load
First chamber's empty -- (aims gun) -- the rest aren't
Forgive me, but things have been a little strange this morning
Nearby, the helicopter radio crackles to life
Frank backs toward the helicopter, keeping the gun trained on Kristel
But Frank only gets to the helicopter door before -- comes out of hiding and empties a clip from his automatic into Frank
Frank is pinned to the door by the fusillade before he can even get a shot off
Travers runs over to Delmer and shoves the barrel up
Stop
(explaining) You'll damage the helicopter
As if to punctuate this, Frank -- and the now ruined pilot side door -- fall to the ground
The radio continues to squawk as Travers grabs Frank's discarded gun
(to Kristel) Answer that
Kristel brushes the snow off her and goes over to the radio
(
) (over radio) Calling Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over -- (keying radio) Rocky Mountain Rescue One, over -- - Wright, davis, and an irritated Stuart huddle over a radio
This is Ross Stuart, Federal Aviation Administration -- please identify -- over -- - By now, the others have come out of hiding and up to the helicopter
Kristel grabs some papers from a plastic packet on the helicopter seat -- and keys the mike
Copy,
This is Margaret Deighan, Rocky Mountain Rescue
Over -- (
) We have an unconfirmed report of an air crash in your area, and a distress call on this frequency -- can you confirm -- over -- (keying mike) Copy,
Distress call came at approximately eleven hundred hours yesterday
investigated -- the call turned out to be a false alarm
Over
- Stuart gestures with exasperated triumph
Please repeat, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- distress call was a false alarm
-- over -- (
) (over radio) Repeat, distress call was a definite false alarm -- we've had several here
Somebody's sick idea of a joke
Do you require further assistance -- over -- Not from you
Thanks, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over and out -- Stuart shuts off the radio with finality
don't want to say  told you so
But did
Can  go back to work now
/  - Kristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket
almost believed you myself
Travers smiles and turns, looking at trembling with fury and grief, bent over Frank's body as the last trace of vapor -- his breath -- trails from his lips
He's gone
Hal gently closes the eyes of his friend
(quiet) Goodbye, Frank
Travers moves up behind Hal and kicks him
Time for number three
Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere
(low) Fuck off
Travers kicks him in the face, knocking him into the snow
think 'll wait here
You just murdered three of my friends
Sooner or later, whoever's chasing you is going to show up and return the favor, and 'd love to watch
Travers puts his gun at Hal's forehead and shrugs
Suit yourself
You see, we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government -- one of whose members  know has zero imagination -- and  can tell you, the cavalry just isn't going to make it by this week
(beat) No, you're taking us where we want to go
Because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch
You want to kill me -- more than anything, even more than you want to keep on breathing, and with a little more time you pray you'll get that chance
(tightens trigger) Am  right
Hal's answer is a stony, loathing stare
He gets up
But -- - ' -- we can see Hal has palmed something from Frank's body
- Dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening, but the worst is over
Gabe rolls Maggie over carefully
Are you okay
My ears are ringing -- but 'm all right
Gabe, what's going on
(shows money in his pack) This
That plane crash -- it's a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks, but dumb enough to drop it all over the range
They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and right now they're heading for the rest of it
Where
It's close to the lake -- Hal's probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it
(stiffly gets up) can get there first -- all  have to do is make it along the north wall to the Bitker ladder -- "All
" Jesus, Gabe -- what do you expect to do then
(aching) Something -- subtle
Gabe lurches towards the cave opening, looking more like Quasimodo than a champion climber
Maggie stops him
'm going with you
No way
You're climbing back down -- try to get to the station or find some help
'm just as good a climber as you are -- and right now, 'm definitely in better shape
(hard) And you're definitely not going -- Maggie stares Gabe down
Guess who won all the arguments when they were together
Gabe's face is a portrait of familiar exasperation
Okay
Come on -- As they move out of the cave together, Gabe favors one foot
-- but the second you slow me down, 'm leaving -- (slips on sore leg, Maggie catches him) -- 'm leaving you behind
Understood
(helping Gabe out) Anything you say, Gabe
- If you have a good imagination, this corner of charcoal looks like it could have been -- (
) One of the currency cases
are standing over some of the wreckage
One of the suits bags and tags the "briefcase"
We've tested the ash inside -- it's the right paper
What about the men
It's -- hard to tell
But forensics says yes
All of them were in the plane
(sags with the news) Everything's accounted for, then -- time to head back and start making excuses
(beat) Fifty million bucks up in smoke, and just don't give a shit
It's one more run of the press
But we lost five good men and they aren't so easily replaced
(beat) Especially a guy like Travers
/ -  - Dedicated agent Travers leans in reasonable comfort against the helicopter and keys his headset mike
Qualen
How far along are you
(
) (over radio) Not as far as we'd be with the helicopter
/ Qualen, Kristel and Delmer follow Hal's lead down the side -- it's not too steep a grade, but it's solid rock and it's covered with ice and fresh snow -- all have to brace themselves with their hands to keep from slipping down
(
) (over radio) We have less than half a tank of fuel, Eric -- if we burn it up treasure hunting we'll never get off this rock
Now -- how far away are you
(keys radio) It looks like two miles, but -- Qualen's foot slides out from under him -- he catches himself
-- it'll take some time
(
) (over radio) Time we have -- Walker's dead, Wright's an idiot
And our guide -- (keys radio) What about him
(
) (over radio) As soon as he becomes a convenience instead of a necessity -- kill him
(keys radio) Agreed
can only hear Qualen's end of the conversation -- but his face shows he can guess what they're talking about
: '  - Gabe's rattled too -- but for a brand new reason -- we to see Gabe at ' where the wire -- that wire -- links the buttress with the facing Tower
Whipping in the wind, it looks risky -- but that's not the problem
Gabe stares at the other edge for a moment
Immobile
Remembering Susan's death
Gabe shakes out of it when -- Gabe
(beat) 'll go first
(shakes his head) If  don't go first,  might not go at all
Gabe hooks his ankles over the wire and starts dragging himself, hand over hand, across the abyss -- no safety line this time
As his weight pulls the line taut, the wind rocks him back and forth
Gabe steadily drags himself out -- - Fatigue stops Gabe in the middle -- a half mile up, strung between two gigantic mountains, he looks as insignificant and alone as a man possibly can be -- Panting with exertion, frozen -- he can barely hold his grip and has an elbow crooked around the wire for support
Gabe's eyes are shut -- he looks near collapse -- - ' Gabe is falling from the wire in slow motion, trailing Susan -- she spirals out of reach as his line  him back -- ' grip unconsciously relaxes -- but his eyes jolt open and he clamps both hands shut on the wire
Gabe, drawing on some inner fury, drags himself with long, sharp yanks -- tensely watches Gabe's crossing -- - is about ten feet away from the end -- ' -  - looks a lot further away than that -- pulls faster -- and reaches the other side
Gabe maintains his hand grip and swings his feet onto the ledge, leaning back against the wall to catch his breath
(winded, shouting across) Think you can beat my time
smiles -- this is more like the Gabe she remembers
She gets on the wire and starts across in a fast, easy rhythm
watches her, grinning
Admiration for Maggie is washing away bad memories of Susan
(to himself) Shit -- she is in better shape
Maggie pulls across fearlessly -- but -- - on Gabe's side of the wire is giving where Travers had hacked at it -- just a millimeter, but it's pulling loose -- doesn't notice and shouts across at Maggie, now half way
(enjoying it now) Quit sandbagging it --  haven't got all day -- - is coming looser -- Maggie's quicker crossing is thrashing the wire and straining the bolt's weakened anchoring -- - who is now twenty feet away -- fifteen -- ten -- five -- - pops out of the wall as if it were shot -- which was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm -- Maggie, stunned and without options, lets go two feet short of the ledge -- drops low just as Maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out towards hers in one lightning-fast motion -- catch -- maintains his grip on Maggie's hand, but her weight nearly pulls him off the ledge -- Maggie drags him down, the window goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledge's bottom, but their grip holds
All of this in a split second
Maggie hangs from Gabe's arm, locked in terror -- but skill wins out over fear
She finds a handhold with her free arm, and climbs up to the ledge with Gabe's help
Maggie collapses into Gabe's arms and they fall back against the wall, but Gabe's the one who's really holding on tight
That -- tears it
(gasping) You're not coming any further
(just as breathless) Gabe -- you're going to get yourself killed -- (breath almost back) Maybe
But 'm not getting you killed
(she starts a reply) Look, Maggie
don't know what'll happen when  catch up with Hal -- but 've got to know one thing for sure -- that you're making it off this mountain
Alive
Gabe's eyes are pleading
Maggie hesitates
But gives in
Okay
Gabe lightly kisses Maggie -- he doesn't want to turn this into a farewell kiss, afraid that that's really what it might be
They stand -- and separate
Gabe moves away
Get on the trail and stay out of sight
(beat) 'll see you on the ground
Maggie wonders if she will as Gabe vanishes around a corner
- as the zipper is pulled down -- before we can see anything we mercifully reverse  to , near a helicopter, look down with disgust
Davis turns away
give up
What was it
zips the bag back up
says this used to be your pilot
(beat) And we found him seven miles east of the wreck
Davis and Wright look at each other, drawing the same conclusion
hijack
(beat) The plane was hijacked
Son of a bitch -- Oh, give me a break
Your pilot lost it when the flight started going south, and he bailed -- Excuse me -- but there's no parachute there
Check it yourself
Before this can go on, a   runs up to Stuart carrying a recorder
Sir -- we found the flight recorder -- it was driven twenty feet deep into a crater
It was demolished, but we salvaged the recording -- (grabbing it away) 've heard a thousand of these, Wright -- whoever was at the stick is going to begin by screeching the Lord's Prayer and wind up screaming "Oh, shit" at ground zero -- Stuart clicks the recorder on with a flourish, but his smug look melts as the voice of  agent Matheson explains -- (
) (shouting, rushed) -- the money's been stolen -- Travers and the pilot were in on it -- the pilot's dead, but Travers took the cash and made a mid-air transfer to a jet flown by Qualen -- controls won't respond -- (screaming) shiiiiii-- Matheson is cut off by the sound of impact, which is followed by silence
Wright gently turns the recorder off
Guess we're both right, Stuart
Thanks for your expertise
(turns to pilot) Well
(jerking a thumb back) You'll be waiting till Groundhog's Day for him to pull his head out of his ass -- let's get it in the air
Wright, Davis and the pilot scramble into a helicopter -- Stuart pauses, but goes after them
/ -   - that's a little narrower than your coffee table
It's got irregular breaks, causing it to go up or down several feet -- and Gabe is jogging it, leaping across the ledge's gaps, leaning toward the wall -- and away from the four thousand foot drop
Gabe's gotten his second wind -- he keeps jumping from ledge to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity, and with renewed purpose
Gabe makes the last jump to a section of ledge near the bottom of "" which consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable bolted into the rock, running two hundred feet to the top -- something left behind by a past expedition, now a tourist's toy
And the bottom rung is three feet above Gabe's outstretched arms
Hasn't gotten any lower in the last year
(coiling for jump) Bitker, you cheap bastard
Would another four feet have killed you
Gabe leaps up, grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile of air, and he shoots up the ladder as we   -- closer look at terrain seen earlier -- fifty yards away from the ladder, a waterfall is spewing out of the wall, giving the appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak
As we track Gabe up the ladder, we can see where the water's coming from -- a whirling lake on top of the mountain
Its constant motion keeps it from totally freezing, but the lake is still coated with a veneer of ice, moving in thick chunks through circular currents on the surface
- are negotiating the grade, which is slippery, thanks to the fresh, thick snow -- we can see from their relative position to the lake that Gabe has a lead on them
very slight one
- pulls himself over and starts running -- as he does, he uproots a big, 3' x 3' park service sign commemorating the " " and takes it with him, moving ahead into a where Gabe replants the sign near the top of another slope
Gabe heads down towards some rocks -- -- and spots the third case, which took a tough landing on one rock -- it's shattered into halves, and the bands of $5000s are scattered around in the snow
Gabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the cash -- soaked by the snow, they've frozen into ice bricks
As Gabe stuffs them into his pack, he's startled by something coming over the rock -- Gabe whirls around to face that's landed in the snow and looks a lot more frightened than Gabe was
Gabe leans back, relieved
For now
- are closer now -- but as they move down, Hal freezes in place as he sees the "Bitker" sign some distance ahead
The sign is out of place
signal from Gabe -- he is alive
And here
Qualen and the others check the monitor
Hal takes the opportunity to back up to a rock formation and swiftly, subtly wedge something into a crack behind his back -- - is what Hal lifted off Frank's body -- a speed load cylinder from a revolver, with six fresh bullets in it
checks the monitor -- the relative position shows they're -- Almost there
-- but Qualen's grin is wiped away as he looks down at -- -- the tracer blip is moving -- fast -- away from their position
' face shifts from incredulity to realization to rage
All eyes are on the monitor -- Hal, at the rock formation, has one hand behind his back
- ' shakes a box of matches from his sleeve -- he slides a single wooden match halfway out of the pack -- and ignites it with his thumbnail -- moves away from the rock, to draw their attention from what he's been doing -- Oh, no -- you didn't lose another one, did you
Delmer clicks off his safety and aims at Hal -- Qualen runs into the woods, guided by the monitor -- Kristel follows
Delmer backs Hal up at gunpoint
Hal deliberately moves in a semi-circle, putting Delmer's back to the rocks
What about him
(over his shoulder) Kill him
Now
Delmer grins as he aims at Hal
Tell me -- where would you like the first half dozen shots to go
- has burned more than halfway down to the rest of the box, which is behind the speed load cylinder -- (hands up) As long as you're taking requests -- how about -- the base of your spine
Delmer smiles and starts to squeeze the trigger -- Hal tenses up, it's now or never -- - burns down to the box, igniting all the matches -- as there is the sudden sound of six distinct, consecutive gunshots behind him -- the fire's blasted the powder in all the bullets
Delmer, startled, spins around and  up, down,  across -- by the time he realizes no one's there and he turns back around to find -- -- Hal is gone, vanished into the woods
through the woods -- up a slope, around a tree, down another slope -- his eyes fixed on the screen and the blip that's zig-zagging just ahead of him
(tagging headset radio) Travers
Get down here
Now
is trying to repair the helicopter door when the call comes
Have you found the money
(
) No
Walker has
Travers, furious, flings the door aside, jumps into the copter and starts the rotor
is running alone, following the monitor lead -- until he sees a band of $5000s in the snow
Sure he's on the right track, Qualen picks it up and picks up his pace too
But we can see that behind him and higher up -- who is on a rise behind a rock, watches Qualen's futile pursuit from a distance, amused
Amused, until -- You would have lived longer, if you weren't such a smartass
Gabe spins his head around -- and his temple smacks into Kristel's gun barrel
You telegraphed this kind of stunt with that joke snowman
Too bad for you we're not all gullible
Kristel starts to squeeze the trigger
Good thing for Qualen you are
(pauses, wary) What do you mean
When he comes back, he's going to shoot you and the other guy, grab the money, and take off with Travers
(squeezing trigger again) No sale
Say "night-night" -- (talking fast) He already blew up one of your pals in that crevice
And 've been in that copter
It goes a hell of a lot farther with two people than with four
(beat) Am  wrong
Give him a buzz
Kristel eases back with the gun
You've got my attention
You've also got all the money
And can show you how to get off the mountain with it
Right now
- tears into a clearing, trying to put some distance between him and Delmer -- as soon as he's out in the open, though, thunders over Hal -- Travers  down at Hal through the doorless pilot's side
Bullets kick up tufts of snow at Hal's heels as he runs down into a steep, sloping wooded area
The tree cover is too thick for Travers to take good aim
Looks like temporary refuge -- but Travers finds a new use for the search copter's heat scope -- using the blip that betrays Hal's body heat as a guide, Travers can still fire down through the trees at who's still running down the grade -- he hasn't been hit yet, but there's an awful lot of bad luck in the air -- banks the helicopter around and up for another pass
/  - is slogging uphill after his own tracer blip -- which is turning back around and heading towards him
Qualen aims his gun and waits, but at the top of the hill -- that spooked Gabe earlier sticks its head up for a curious sniff
It has the tracer fastened to its neck with a currency band
Furious, Qualen  at the rabbit -- it safely speeds away as Qualen smashes the useless tracer monitor and turns around
- On the heat scope
The blip that represents Hal -- vanishes
Delmer, who has caught up, is at the edge of the tree-lined area -- he looks up at Travers
(keying headset radio) He's hiding twenty yards in -- be careful
- "replies", beeping twice on the headset's ear button as he moves downhill into the woods, closely following Hal's tracks -- they lead up to the replanted "" sign
Just big enough to hide behind
Delmer smiles, and advances toward the sign -- -- and looks behind it
Nothing but a mound of snow
Delmer looks again to the tracks, which lead toward also big enough to conceal Hal
Delmer moves toward it as -- "" the mound of snow shifts as Hal climbs out, silently shaking off the cover -- the snow hid him not only from Delmer, but from the heat scope as well -- hovers overhead, watching Delmer's blip on the heat scope -- but Hal's blip returns, rushing ahead -- (keying headset radio) He's right behind you
whirls around at the warning, his gun , but Hal is too fast -- he swings the sign like a club, knocking Delmer's gun away into the snow
Before Hal can swing again, Delmer brutally punches Hal in the face -- stunned, Hal drops the sign -- - Travers can't do anything now but watch the heat scope as if it were a video game -- now it's just one big blip -- thrash around in the snow, pummelling each other -- Hal's getting the worst of it, as Delmer manages to get on top of him and deliver a series of punishing blows to his face
Ready to end it, Delmer tries to get the bolt gun off a clip on his front pack strap -- but he has trouble unfastening it
Hal rallies with a solid punch to Delmer's face
Hal gets Delmer off of him and follows with two more
Delmer is knocked away, landing on the sign board -- but clear from Hal -- another chance to get the bolt gun off -- Hal quickly moves to the sign and grabs its post -- before Delmer can move off the sign's board, Hal's running forward
shoving the sign ahead of him with Delmer on top -- Hal lets go, and the sign, with Delmer, sleds downhill on the hard packed snow -- - can now see one blip moving quickly away from the other -- (into radio) Something's moving fast down the hill -- is it Tucker
has found Delmer's fallen headset radio and put it on
(
) (over radio) Answer me
Is it Tucker
Hal smiles and beeps twice -- affirmative
Happy at last, Travers takes off after the blip, flying down the incline and staying just above the trees, strafing an intense fusillade at who's screaming as a storm of bullets rip through him and the sign and the surrounding snow, keeping pace with his downhill slide -- until his clip is empty -- he heads for the end of the tree line as his target comes out, skidding to a stop in the snow
Travers gleefully moves lower down for a closer look but is shocked to see -  "" Delmer's highly perforated body rolls off the sign as it finally skids to a dead halt
who is apoplectic -- he's just shot one of his own men
(
) (over radio) Thanks loads
(beat) couldn't have killed him without you
Travers looks down at the heat scope -- blank
is hiding his body "heat" under a rock formation
Stymied, Travers furiously banks it away from the wooded area and circles around the mountain's other side
-   - Gabe, hands on his head, moves down a slope near a mountain edge, ahead of Kristel, who's aiming her gun at his back
How much further
(stops) It's right over there
Gabe nods ahead, indicating what looks like a that is partially obscured by snow, about twenty feet distant across a snowy plateau
It's a storage locker for the rangers
Everything you need to get off the mountain is in there -- skiis, food -- 'll show you -- Gabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly moving ahead again -- Kristel suspiciously notices this -- Don't move
Kristel gets ahead of Gabe and walks backward, keeping her gun trained on him as she crunches through the snow
Skiis, food -- and maybe guns too, right
(moves backward) Keep walking
Not too close
We'd make better time walking straight ahead
Qualen's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer
(walking backward) Right
So 'd better have one less problem when he arrives
(knowing this means him) Don't fuck up
You still need me to show you a route off the mountain
You've worn that one out, Walker -- (snaps back bolt) -- 'll find my own way down
Kristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot Gabe, but her feet sink through the crystallized snow cover -- -- Kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it collapses under her -- she's pulling the trigger and go wild as she sinks and sinks -- who's had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same fate -- as he scrambles back to solid land, Kristel's arc up through the snow toward him, and the snow crumbles around him -- but he bellies ahead as -- ' Kristel's  slow, and finally, stop, the very last of them loosening the snow around -- "" that was obscured by snow was a tall, three-sided park service sign shouting " --  --   " in eight different languages
The rest of the snow falls away from it, revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration -- a stick-figure fatally sinking into the snow
bellies ahead, flat on his stomach, testing the snow with the ice axe's staff -- only when he hits something solid with it does he get back up to his feet
But the sound of ice-crusted snow  above Gabe alerts him that -- has just hit the top of the slope and spotted him -- Qualen's gun  down -- is on the run, but it's that lead-footed, slow motion stuff that only happens in nightmares -- with every step, a foot breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of snow -- Gabe stays just ahead of the barrage, making it into which is very temporary refuge -- Qualen will be down in seconds
Gabe looks down the slope
Running is impractical
So he sits down
arrives where Gabe was and looks down the slope -- '  - is whizzing down the slope in a sitting position, using his back and his shoes as gliders, the ice axe as a rudder
Alpinists call this a "sitting glissade"
Colorado climbers call it "butt skiing"
Some psychos do this for fun
'  - is anything but fun -- Gabe can't control his speed or direction well at all -- Gabe barely manages to steer in and out of trees and boulders in his path -- starts running down the slope -- he doesn't have speed, but he does have the machine gun -- he  short bursts at -- who tries to steer away from the line of fire -- Gabe is hit in the shoulder -- he slides out of control, and rolls down -- -- to the slope's bottom
Gabe painfully lifts himself up and moves through the woods, coming out of the trees to The bridge that spans it is ahead of Gabe -- but there is nothing around but flat terrain
It's a beautiful sight, but no good for hiding
And Qualen is right behind him
- rushes down to Delmer's body -- in the snow, he finds the discarded machine gun and holds it up, but stray bullets from Travers' fusillade have made it inoperable
Hal tosses it aside and checks Delmer's bloody pockets for more weapons
Nothing
Just a couple of machine gun clips, and the bolt gun
- is wending her way down a hiking trail on the opposite side of the mountain
In plain view, is circling the mountain -- he spots Maggie from on high and moves down after her
hears the helicopter, and turns around -- she has no way of knowing it isn't Frank, so she takes off her jacket and waves it as a signal -- Frank
Down here
The helicopter moves down until Maggie can see -- is at the controls
starts running, but it's useless
Nowhere to hide
Travers hovers over her,  ahead of her,  behind her, not to kill, just to make a point
He's in charge
Maggie finally stops -- Travers lands the copter and opens the passenger door, keeping his gun trained on her
Hop in
know someone who'd like to see you again before he dies
- moves down to the slope's edge, noting with pleasure the blood in the snow
Gabe is wounded, and he's left a trail as a bonus
Qualen moves out lakeside -- nothing visible but the thick, flat ice chunks circling in the currents
But Gabe's footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge
Qualen starts to run across the bridge, but stares down -- '  -  ' The blood -- and slush from Gabe's boots -- end halfway across
Smiles and shakes his head
Too obvious
Gabe is hiding underneath the bridge, in the three foot deep network of steel supports
Qualen slows his pace, staring down through the thin, but visible cracks between the planks
- - ' grimacing, shivering, ashen from his wound and exertion -- lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge
(
) You've come a long way to die
enjoying himself, slams a fresh clip into his machine gun
If you were smart, you'd have left your friend behind
would have
There's no shame in staying alive
Qualen stops, staring down
Through the gaps, Gabe's parka is visible
Right where the blood trail ends
(aims down) But you're not smart
And now you're going to die from an overdose of heroism
Qualen  the gun into the planks -- - is clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge, several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being shredded by the  -- without the parka, Gabe is freezing, and too many bullets are coming too close for comfort as they  on the bridge's supports -- stops firing and kicks away the planks, which are a tangle of toothpicks at this point -- Qualen bends down -- -- and sees there's nothing in the parka except for Gabe's back
Qualen's face registers anger and surprise as -- -- Gabe appears at the edge of the hole -- before Qualen can react, Gabe swings up with his ice axe, hooking it around the shoulder strap of Qualen's machine gun -- Gabe yanks down, and Qualen falls head first with Gabe -- Qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a leg on one of the steel supports -- but both fall, landing on separate chunks of ice floating underneath the bridge -- Gabe pulls himself through the girders to Qualen and punches him with his good arm, but Qualen is unfazed -- neither are in good position, it's like a fistfight on a jungle gym -- -- Qualen steadies himself to savagely punch Gabe in his shoulder wound -- Gabe  in pain and tries to block the next one, but Qualen punches him again, and Gabe lets go of the support, falling -- -- on the way down, Gabe grabs Qualen's leg with his good hand -- too low to grab the bridge, Gabe dangles just over the water, raising his legs above it as Qualen tries to kick him off -- -- Gabe holds onto Qualen's leg, and swings on it like a pendulum -- Gabe twists the leg -- Qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go -- both fall -- they land hard, not in the water, but on a raft-sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the current
Their weight teeter-totters the ice as they get up -- they're in danger not just from each other, but from where the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling vortex that drains into the waterfall -- Qualen and Gabe circle each other like cautious boxers, as the ice itself swirls in the current -- if either makes the wrong move, they'll both go over
Gabe swings at Qualen, but Qualen throws a leg under Gabe and stiff-arms him down -- Gabe hits the ice hard, his chest hanging over the side -- Qualen moves in to shove him off -- but their combined weight on the same side of the ice starts to tip it over -- Gabe viciously kicks Qualen back, gashing his face with his boot's crampon as Qualen grabs the ice raft's opposite side, levelling it
(wiping the gash) Stalemate, isn't it
(winded) Not any more
Gabe, still prone, reaches out -- the chunk of ice with Qualen's machine gun is floating by
Gabe snatches up the gun and pulls the trigger
Nothing but an empty
Far more intimidating when it's loaded
The chunk of ice with Gabe's ice axe floats by Gabe -- Gabe grabs for it, but misses -- as the ice raft spins around, Qualen manages to snatch it up -- Qualen scythes it down at Gabe, slamming the blade into the ice as Gabe rolls away -- - is nearing the center of the whirlpool -- the current is faster and stronger here -- if it doesn't swallow the ice raft, it will definitely upend it -- stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance -- Qualen swings out at Gabe with the axe
Gabe ducks and tries to go low to hit Qualen with the gun, but Qualen swings the axe down again, whizzing right past Gabe as it sinks into -- -- a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade -- quickly reacts, jumping onto another bed-sized chunk of ice floating by, landing on his stomach and braking himself by digging his crampons in -- just as -- realizing what deep shit he's in, looks for another chunk of ice to make the same move -- to sees one just out of reach
Qualen pulls the ice axe out of the raft's center to drag the other chunk closer in -- -- as he does, the entire raft disintegrates under him -- Qualen plunges into the water, and tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left -- -- but now at the center of the whirlpool, Qualen is drawn into the vortex -- struggles to his feet and looks down, wincing -- '  - Qualen's inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as he shoots down to the bottom of the lake -- and beyond -- '  - Qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the lake's tunnel drain -- - full force, hurling a still thrashing Qualen a half a mile to the ground below
has no time to celebrate -- the chunk of ice he's on leaves him moments from the same fate
One more time around, and it's down the drain
Gabe takes a deep breath
No choice
He leaps -- -   - -- from one chunk of ice to the other, running the way you would across stones in a stream, zig-zagging to catch the ones big enough to support him -- only his crampons keep him from sliding off, only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the ice chunks, which shoots away from him in his wake -- lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge
No choice -- Gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge supports -- his hand catches -- but it's slippery and he's weakened -- Gabe slides off, but -- reaches down and grabs him -- pulls Gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge
Gabe's surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as Hal's
(eyeing Gabe's ruined shirt) Nice outfit
(hands him his parka) know you never liked the orange, but -- Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear hats, either
That's why  quit
(pulls on parka) You all right
feel better than you look
can live with that
Gabe looks down at the parka -- it's completely full of bullet holes
Hardly seems worth zipping, huh
(serious now) Frank
Hal sobers -- shakes his head no
cloud passes over Gabe's face
It's not over, Gabe
Travers took the helicopter
- Maggie's hands are cuffed to a bar on the helicopter's roof
Travers keys his headset radio while piloting the copter
(into radio) Qualen -- Kristel -- come in -- Gabe hears Hal's borrowed headset radio crackling -- he holds his hand out to Hal
May
(dons it, keys it) They can't talk right now, Travers
Kristel's busy making snow angels -- and 'm not sure, but  think Qualen is still falling
(radio silence) Any messages
moment's silence -- then -- (
) (over radio) Gabe
(keying it) Maggie -- - yanks the radio off Maggie and puts it back on -- (into radio) You wanted to make a trade earlier, Walker -- still interested
(
) (pause) 've got the money
Fly to the lake
And if you touch her -- Travers cuts off the radio, smiles, and banks the helicopter down around the mountain wall
Now what
have no fucking idea
(holds Qualen's gun) Empty
(smiling) Not for long
Hal fishes into his pockets and pulls out one of the ammo clips he took from Delmer, Gabe tries to force it into the gun's stock -- but it's the wrong size
(sagging against rail) Why can't anything be easy
thunders around the mountain wall, getting closer -- have crossed the bridge, near the mountain edge -- Gabe, now wearing his pack again, nods over to the wooded area
Stay over there -- Look -- let me -- -- what, throw snowballs at him
Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie out of here
(relenting) Count on it
(beat) And Gabe
Thanks for tagging along
(smiles) Thanks for asking
forgot how much enjoyed rescue work
Gabe limps toward the mountain's edge as Hal runs into the woods
blasts along the wall towards the lake -- the waterfall and the ladder are just ahead
The copter radio crackles -- (
) (from radio) Come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- urgent -- come in -- Travers recognizes the voice -- frowning, he snaps off the radio and banks the helicopter up over the top -- - tops the precipice, revealing Gabe, standing on the end of a narrow spur -- it just out from the edge like a diving board
Gabe has his pack on one arm -- the money is visible
Gabe levels Qualen's emptied gun on Travers and the copter -- this bluff is all he has left
(over radio) Remember that bet you made
About whether  could find the money for you or not
(holds pack over drop) You won
Travers helplessly flies in low, tight circles over Gabe and the spur -- if he shoots Gabe, the money falls too, Travers presses his gun at Maggie
(into radio) 'll kill her -- (over radio) You do, and the spring thaw's going to be worth thirty million bucks
(pause) No rush
'm sure you've got lots of time
(into radio) All right
Drop the gun first
(into radio) When she's safe on the ground
/ Travers has no choice but to give in -- he gives Maggie the handcuff key, and she frees herself as he flies away from the spur, touching the copter down on the mountain top
(to Maggie) Get out
Maggie moves out the door and stares uncertainly at Gabe
(shouting) Run
(she doesn't) Run
Maggie runs for the trees
When Gabe is sure she's safe, he throws the gun away -- but keeps the pack suspended over the edge
(into radio) Now come and get it
My arm's getting tired
Travers flies the copter up and over, until he and it are five feet away from Gabe's position on the spur
Gabe is buffeted by the copter's wind, but stands firm
Travers levels his gun at Gabe through the open passenger door as Gabe heaves the pack in
Travers doesn't even look down -- he just stares at Gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot
(shouting) Don't you want to count it
Puzzled, Travers takes his gun hand and rips open The $5000s are there -- but they've been shredded by Qualen's earlier blast of gunfire
Few, if any, of the bills are passable
stares down, incredulous -- as he does -- rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt gun from his waist -- Travers looks up and raises his gun at Gabe -- but Gabe fires first -- the bolt imbeds itself high in Travers' chest
Gasping, Travers drops his gun -- it falls over the pack and out the open door -- Travers clutches at his chest -- Don't spend it all in one place, you son of a bitch
Travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the helicopter -- it spins around, and Gabe has to instantly flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him -- Gabe looks down as -- quickly begins to spiral down in wide, aimless circles -- Travers has clearly lost control -- stares down coldly, waiting for the crash -- but -- - won't give up -- sweating, bleeding, he sits forward and grabs the stick, seizing control of the helicopter again -- '  - stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and up -- with clear purpose -- eyes widening with realization
Gabe gets up from the spur and starts running back towards the woods -- several hundred yards from safety -- before he can get very far -- tops the precipice edge and, sweeping low over the snow, it gets between Gabe and the trees, cutting him off -- - watch, powerless -- He's going to run Gabe down -- Ashen, hyperventilating, he's running on pure adrenalin and fury as he drives the stick forward -- - is stiff-legging it toward the edge of the mountain -- but he's too banged up to run fast through the thick snow -- with its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes -- as he throws himself flat into the snow -- the front of the skid misses Gabe by inches as it blasts over him -- moves out over the precipice edge -- Travers banks it wide to circle back around for another run -- gets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him -- Hal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it into one of the ammo clips -- Maggie stays back as he runs for all he's worth out into the clearing -- has circled back around, stopping at a hover far back in the clearing -- Travers intends to not just run Gabe over, but to run him off the edge as well -- lumbers as fast as he can towards the edge -- knows he has Gabe nailed -- he shoves the stick forward -- flies forward, skids just inches over the snow -- runs out to where Travers is heading -- he lights the cloth in the ammo clip -- as flies past Hal hurls the clip, with its cloth "fuse" burning down, into the doorless side of the copter -- -- the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit -- Travers sees it and looks down, but -- "" sputters out -- nothing but glowing embers in the cloth -- smiles -- nothing to worry about -- he speeds ahead -- ' as they slice through the top of the snow towards -- as he runs toward the mountain's edge -- it's just a couple of feet ahead, but the copter is a couple of feet behind -- -- as the copter overtakes Gabe, dipping even lower into the snow, he dives off the edge -- - Gabe is at the ladder -- he falls the first twenty feet of the long drop, then grabs a rung on the cable ladder, very painfully stopping his fall -- but in the same split second -- skid meant to impale Gabe catches the top two rungs of the cable ladder -- - -- caught in the rungs of the cable ladder, the helicopter keeps flying out over the abyss, but as it pulls the cable ladder, it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place, rung by rung -- -- still going full tilt, the copter strains against the ladder -- thirty feet of it tethers the copter to the wall -- -- and Gabe is dangling from the center of it
- has one arm hooked around a rung, hanging on for his life as the copter thrashes the ladder up and down -- Travers is disoriented by the jolt, and tries to maintain control -- he doesn't see -- -- that the cloth fuse on the ammo clip has reignited -- it burns down to the clip, and fifty rounds explode like a string of firecrackers -- -- Travers tries to shield himself as he is struck by airborne lead
Shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel -- still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes dead -- the rotor blades slow -- Gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor -- if it were possible for him to grip the ladder tighter, he'd do it now -- -- as the rotor  to a dead halt the copter arcs down and slams against the mountain wall -- the skids are still caught in the ladder, and it holds -- is shaken off by the massive impact -- he falls -- -- landing on the helicopter, half in and half out of the cockpit
As Gabe scrambles for a solid hold -- -- Travers, who has been shaken to the opposite side of the copter, reaches into his jacket and pulls out the pistol he took from Frank -- he aims at Gabe -- - One of the two rungs holding the copter up bursts -- slips, now hanging from just a single rung -- -- and the impact of the slip makes Travers drop the gun -- it falls out the open passenger door
Travers scrambles up through the cabin to go after -- -- Gabe, who is trying to get off the helicopter and onto a solid part of the ladder before the whole thing goes down --           Gabe jumps for the wall as Travers scrambles behind him and -- -- as the last rung supporting the copter snaps in two -- grabs hold of the ladder as plummets down -- but as it starts its fall -- leaps from the falling copter and grabs Gabe's leg -- Gabe struggles to support both of them, but Travers, weakened from his wound, loses his grip on Gabe's leg -- he stares up in terror at Gabe as he clutches Gabe's snow-slick boot -- Cheer up
It's a beautiful spot to die
Travers slides off and away -- - Travers  as he free falls, trailing behind the helicopter -- we follow the entire four thousand foot drop -- -- until the helicopter explodes when it hits the ground far below, and the fireball engulfs Travers just before he impacts into the explosion
looks down at the burning wreck and clings to the ladder, closing his eyes for a moment in exhaustion
But the of another helicopter makes him look up -- has shown up, a little too late to be of any help
Wright, Davis and Stuart look at the billowing flames of the wreck -- even from here, the burning money is visible, drifting up in the smoke
Wright turns to Stuart
'm no expert -- but what do you make of that "event"
is drained -- from somewhere, he finds the strength to lift his head up -- '  - The section of ladder above him, of course, is gone -- he has to cover the fifty feet of wall above him by free climbing
There are holds that look easy enough for him, but -- leans back, gripping the ladder, too tired to move
Just the thought of one more climb drains him
(mumbling) Forget it
No fucking way
'm staying right here
've spent the night on walls before -- some of the best nights of my life have been spent lashed to walls -- Before Gabe can take this any farther -- a loop tied to the end of a rope falls to a stop next to him
Gabe looks up -- - has thrown the line down
Maggie is by his side
Remember -- keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times -- puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote -- even this action aches
(too tired to shout) Fuck you -- Hal and Maggie draw Gabe up -- Gabe pulls some of his weight by using hand and foot holds, but when he reaches Hal and Maggie are both winded from the effort as they haul Gabe onto the top
Gabe unties himself, and collapses into Maggie's lap
(winded, coiling the rope) Jesus Christ -- you think you could have put a little less effort into that climb
mean, what have you done for me -- lately
Hal ends his harrangue and looks over -- Gabe has apparently revived, because he and Maggie are locked in the kiss of their lives
Hal stands, and smiles -- he walks toward the Treasury agents, who are scrambling out of the helicopter
Hal starts an explanation that's going to take a long, long time as -- break off their kiss
Does this mean you're staying
