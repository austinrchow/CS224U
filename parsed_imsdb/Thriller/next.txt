Ferris' face is replaced on the plasma screen by a series of random video clips
Hang-gliding
Traffic jam
Volcano erupting
Ferris Now if you would, please look at the monitor and tell us what you see, say, five minutes from now
Cris looks at the clock
16:32 / March 9, 2006
He squints and the clock speeds up a little
Ferris (o

In a few seconds, the clock reads 16:37

On the monitor
Ferris' image has been replaced by footage of surfers riding big waves in Hawaii

Now can you move ahead ten minutes
Varied images fast forward on the plasma screen
He arrives at 16:47 and reports on what he sees

Can you get to 1900 hours
Cris looks ahead and squints
Minutes whiz by
Clips play and change almost too fast to be recognized
Clock Cris gets to 19:00 -- and keeps going
Mirror Cris has a five o'clock shadow
Clock Hours tick off like an accelerating metronome

His face fills with rage

Mirror Like a window into a time machine
Cris' beard lengthens
He grows pale
His clothes change every few seconds
Rage gives way to the panic of a man trapped on a runaway train

Wrinkles etch into skin
Hair greys, recedes
Outrage ebbs into hollow resignation as Cris watches himself waste away

The future changes every time you look at it
Because you looked at it
As Cris 2 pays cash, Cris 1 proceeds into the casino

) Cause once you see it, you're different
Cris 2 follows, literally walking in Cris 1's footsteps
(
) Maybe just a little
bumps into Cris 1 and spills his Daiquiri on him
(
) And that changes everything else
Cris 2 -- the real Cris -- follows a moment later and sidesteps the Drunk, who spills his Daiquiri on someone else
(
) It's got something to do with quantum physics
Cris 2 reaches the gaming tables and merges with Cris 1
Cris (
) That's why  stay away from roulette and craps
It only takes a millionth of an ounce to change a roll
Just placing a different bet can throw things off

In person, she's edgy, confident, and impatient with those who aren't as quick as she is

This time, Cris hurriedly scoops all his chips into his coat pocket, jostling the Waitress as he stands
Scuse me, sorry
Hustling away, he glances back just as the first reach his stool, but this time it's empty
They look around
One of them whispers into his mike
The three pairs of goons get instructions and split up

Tracking shot / eye level Cris strides crisply through the casino
Sees another , scanning for him
He ducks into the maze of slots
Zigs and zags from aisle to aisle, seemingly at random
moment after each turn, a Black Suit appears ahead, behind, or to the side - where they would have spotted Cris
Tracking shot / high angle clearer perspective as    approach Cris' aisle from different directions
Cris has no way to see them or know they're coming, but at the last moment, he  in between two aisles where neither guard will see him as they pass

Phalanxes of slot machines Black Suits converge from various directions, in that fake- calm fast-walk
Cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby, then heads to a particular spot - where he is sure to be spotted - except that a -  repositions himself, blocking the Black Suit's view
The Black Suit moves on
Cris shifts to another spot just as a different Black Suit arrives at the other end of the aisle
This time,    change machines and obscure Cris from his gaze

Davis There
There
He's right there in front of you
Walk toward each other

'm going down there
Convention annex Arriving at the foyer, Cris sees Five Meeting Rooms
He squints then decisively enters one of them

Without wasting a beat, each of them goes through a different door
All except the one Cris went through
Cris re-emerges a moment later and heads back toward the casino
Casino Ferris, arriving, adjusts her headset
Cris sees her
Recognizes her from his prevision as the woman on the plasma screen
Turns and walks away
She sees Cris
Takes off after him
Ferris (to head mic) He's heading toward

Security Staff converge on the area
Cris is in plain sight
Suddenly a busload of tourists surge in through a door and clog the way
Cris continues into the

Kitchen area Passing a room service cart, he rolls it in front of him few steps on, he takes the bottle of   on the cart and pours some in front of one random closed door
Cris then shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty intersecting corridor
Black Suit barrels into the empty intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it
Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out; steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and falls on his ass
Cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of Big guys
They try to grab him
He evades their grasp almost magically and, like a Shaolin Monk, somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a pile on the floor
Cris darts around them into the
Lobby He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery
Rolling it to the left, a Black Suit on that side doesn't see him - and moves on
Cris switches to the right side of the card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him
Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a herky-jerky rhythm
He walks four quick steps without being seen
Then stops behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way
When Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting across the lobby at an acute angle
In this way, he avoids being seen by Black Suit 2
Cris now backs up three steps and avoids being seen by Black Suit 3
By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like invisibility
The last obstacle to daylight is Ferris
She sees him
He makes a run for the door
She dashes after him
You
just need to talk to you
Cris grabs a guest's suitcase and keeps moving

The guest chases after Cris - and collides with Ferris, knocking her to the ground
Which allows Cris to slip through a door to the

Hotel loading dock - Where     are flinging sacks of clothes into the back of a truck
Cris steps toward the open tailgate with a steady pace
As if on cue, both Laundry Guys turn and bend to pick up another sack of clothes
Cris walks right by them without being noticed -- and climbs into the truck moment later, the Laundry Guys pivot back around, toss sacks of clothes in after Cris, and slam the rear doors
They get in the truck and drive off just as Ferris, Davis, and several Black Suits arrive to find a cold trail

This guy is a lot more than lucky

Why else would you kill a stranger

But no good deed goes unpunished, eh

Now confident he's found the right approach, Cris approaches Liz and deliberately bobbles his coffee

Why would  do that

Look, 'm sorry

But silently, right
Unnoticeably
And that's when we go in
Ferris rolls her eyes with exasperation
Ferris You still don't get it
(tries to be patient) This has to be clear to your whole army
(to Baines) And yours
-- After she comes out and we lock down the cabin
We don't do anything
We wait
Policeman But if he's already trapped
Gentlemen, try to think like him
- If the plan is to go in right after he's trapped, he'll see it coming and he'll slip away before he's trapped
(to Cavanaugh) Like he's always done
cavANAUGH How does your plan change anything
baines At least he won't hear it when the trap closes
And if he doesn't know he's trapped, he can't foresee knowing he's trapped
That kinda makes sense
69
The eureka moment is when he realizes he's been trapped
When is that
ferriS That's the point
We want to delay "eureka" for as long as possible
So by the time he sees trouble and decides to waltz away

Cris
Do you think we met for a reason
You mean, do  believe a higher power brought us together
Yeah
No
think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang
70
That's not very romantic
Oh, but it is
Think of it: For us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub-atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and  could be together, right here and now
She is moved by his words, but they make her strangely sad

Hands one to Liz

Liz,  really did have this problem

This time, Cris doesn't move

She hesitates
Let me talk to you for one minute
won't hurt you,  promise
She turns around, trembling
Cris,  know you don't mean to hurt people
But you need help or you're going to keep on hurting them
The man  killed was there to rob the store
He was going to panic and shoot five innocent people

Yes
You were afraid something bad might happen so you
Not "might"

He snaps out of it
There's one decent path

How can she listen to this madman

One chance in exchange for a miracle
Ferris, Cavanaugh, Baines, and Rick are getting worried

WiSDOM (impressed) What other tricks can he do
Ferris pushes a toggle, and a pocket door slides open in a wall
ferris (to Cris) Please step into the next room
'm going
No need for a hotfoot
BaiNES (explains, to Wisdom) The floor is electrified
He must have tried resisting and foreseen the result
Cris walks through the doorway into
which is familiar from the opening sequence, but not exactly the same
Because it's not exactly the same future , bolted to the floor, faces a    on the wall
To the left of the screen is a ; to the right, a  -
Ferris'  appears on the monitor
Ferris on monitor Cris, it's time to get started with the next test
This won't be unpleasant
We just need to you sit in the chair
Cris eyes the chair with suspicion
101
Ferris on monitor want you to look ahead, tell me the time on the clock and then tell me what film clip you see playing
Let's start with five minutes from now
Then we'll press ahead as far as you're capable of
(to Wisdom) The clips have been assembled at random by a computer, so nobody knows what'll be playing next
Cris looks into the mirror and sees his face reflected - as an old man
He turns away
cris Look, 'll stand here and tell you what  see
/ Ferris on monitor 'm afraid we need you to sit
Why
Ferris on monitor Why not
know what happens
Ferris oN Tell us
You tie me down and never let me out
Wisdom looks at Ferris
She shrugs, sheepish
FerriS That's only because you won't cooperate
Because you're trying to force me
102
Ferris Work with us, Cris, and you can be a hero
Fight us, and things will get worse and worse
Cris squints, frustrated, looking for a way out
Ferris (severe) Now sit in the chair
One
Two
Three
Ferris switches the toggle
The sizzle of electricity
Cris hops and jumps in agony
Ferris turns away, then makes herself look
Whoa, you are one tough bitch
We're still in a Code Red if 'm not mistaken
She turns off the juice
He knew he'd get shocked, but he chose to resist
He's almost never had to face consequences
(flips toggle) Cris, are you ready to get in the chair
Cris, recovering, shoots her the finger
She switches the toggle again - and leaves it on
Wisdom doesn't have the stomach to watch
We need information, right
Cris collapses, unconscious
Leave him there
We'll start again when he recovers
103
Wisdom's office - Wisdom and Ferris are both traumatized by the torture
Okay, how do we use him to find the bombs
Simple
We make him watch the news and tell us about it
How far ahead can he see
don't know
But  suspect we can increase his range with practice
Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news
Then he'll be like a timescope
Wisdom nods
You were right
This is huge
This is just for starters
You want to stage a pre-emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong
And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin
Wisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential
wisDOM And all he's ever done with it is a little gambling and securities fraud
FeRRIS know, it's amazing; but he's not ambitious
WiSDOM Damn, how will we control this guy when he figures out what he's capable of
104
Ferris We control him now
We just have to keep it that way
Right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair
Dread suddenly washes over Wisdom
We've got to think this through
Your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists
Ferris Aren't you running ahead of yourself
With this guy, you have to
Or it'll be over before it begins
Ferris So we'll keep him in chains
That may not be enough
We may have to cut off his arms and legs
Then  might start to feel safe
Ferris grins uncomfortably
Ferris You're not serious
Think about it
What we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution
And 'm not gonna make the same mistake the Neanderthals made when they ran across this good-looking Homo Sapien fellow and all the lady Neanderthals said, "He's so cute
Let's keep him around
" Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time
105
You mean after it's too late
Ferris seems to come around to Wisdom's logic
Ferris wish you'd given me a chance to chain him up before you decided to prune him into a stump
They are both filled with dread
wisdom You think he knows
Already
white room Cris on the floor
His expression hardens
CorrIDORS Ferris and Wisdom stride through the facility almost at a run
WiSDOM haven't made any firm decisions
Maybe we will just keep him tied up
told you, he doesn't read minds
He sees the results
Cris rises from the floor into a crouched position, like an animal ready to pounce
The door flies open and    's charge in, rifles at the ready, and surround Cris
Cris checks the time on the digital clock
It's 5:12
Corridors Ferris and Wisdom getting closer; he's on a cellphone
Wisdom Tell Baines to meet us there
And bring a dozen men
106
Motionless, in a crouch
Cris suddenly dashes between two 's, shoves them aside, makes for the door
He gets smashed by the   of the nearest ones, then stomped by the full contingent
[Attempt #1] White Ferris and Wisdom arrive and look through the window
: Cris is alone in the room, in that crouched position
No 's
What we've just seen
hasn't happened yet
Baines arrives with    's we saw in the previous scene
Wait for my signal, then go in and surround him
Wisdom and Ferris hurry upstairs into the Observation Booth
We pass through the wall into the
White room Where in some future Cris is once again surrounded by the Dozen 's who are actually outside, waiting to charge in
Suddenly, Cris pounces low at one soldier's hips, shoving him into the soldier next to him, which knocks over a third soldier
Cris dashes for the door, but four 's pull him away before he can get out
[Attempt #2] Observation Ferris and Wisdom enter and look down at Cris, who crouches alone, motionless, in the White Room
Ferris prepares to speak to him
Wisdom interrupts
'll do the talking
Wisdom goes to the microphone
Cris, this Eric Wisdom
'm the director of this facility
() 107
(cont'd) We're in the middle of a Code Red, and we'd like your help in preventing a major catastrophe
don't believe you
Outside  room and the  's wait, ready to charge in
(o
s
) apologize for the way you've been treated
Agent Ferris got a little carried away
White room Cris, once again surrounded by the same Dozen 's, suddenly punches one of them, kicks another, and now has the mobility to start using his Tai Chi moves
But the other 's gang up on him and pile on, burying him under their weight
[Attempt #3] wisdom (o
) Could  ask you as a favor to please sit in the chair so we can begin
observation Wisdom and Ferris watch as Cris still just crouches there, motionless, alone, in the empty room
He checks the clock
It's 5:09
Just minutes before The 's will charge into the room
Cris runs to the door and tries to bar it so they can't enter
He gets shoved aside by the force of the 's as they charge in
[Attempt #4] observation Wisdom and Ferris watch as Cris still just crouches there, motionless, in the empty room
Wisdom flicks off the mike
WiSDOM What's he doing
FeRRIS Looking ahead
108
(to microphone) Cris, time is running out
White room - Cris is again crouched and surrounded by the Dozen 's
wiSDOM (plasma screen) We need your cooperation right away
Suddenly Cris attacks using his Tai Chi skills
He outfights four of them, but then is subdued by the others
[Attempt #5] SnAPBACK: Cris is again crouched and surrounded by the Dozen 's
wiSDOM (plasma screen) Cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us
Your ability could save so many lives
Suddenly he repeats the martial arts attack, but refines it, beating six 's this time before being subdued
[Attempt #6] : Cris is again crouched and surrounded by the Dozen 's
wiSDOM (plasma screen) Cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us
Your ability could save so many lives
Faster and faster, over and over, Cris relives the attack, perfecting his movements, finding new opportunities
His skill increases with each iteration as he anticipates every soldier's action and counters it with the greatest economy of means
[Attempts #7-12] The fight takes on the quality of choreography as the 's seem to step right into Cris' punches and kicks
Cris flips and throws them into each other, leveraging their movements to achieve his goals with perfect efficiency
But Cris still can't quite get out the door
109
Looking down at Cris, still crouched there, alone
Don't give him time
Send them in now
Baines, do it
Ext
White Baines gives the signal and the dozen waiting 's charge in through the door, rifles at the ready
The foreseen attack is now beginning in real time
White room The 's surround Cris, as foreseen
He remains in the center of them, crouched, motionless
For a long beat, they just stand there, rifles aimed at their frozen quarry
wiSDOM (plasma screen) Cris, don't you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us
Your ability could save so many lives
Cris suddenly attacks
and with perfect economy of movement, like a diver executing thirteen twists in the second before he hits the water, Cris executes the previous routine with a new "finale" and
Elegantly slips past all the 's into the hall - and slams the door behind him, locking them in
The escape has the quality of magic
It takes a beat for the 's to realize what has happened
oBSERVATION Wisdom and Ferris are agog
wISDOM What happened
- You idiots
Ferris draws her gun and charges down the stairs
white room Cris is waiting for her and somehow he has her gun in his hand
110
CrIS Don't make me do what  can do
Cris spins and shoots Wisdom in the shin as he starts down the stairs
Wisdom collapses
Don't get too attached to your arms and legs
Cris spins and gets the drop on Baines
CrIS Don't
Baines sets down his gun
Cris takes off
Don't let him out of here alive
Baines opens the door to the White Room
's stampede out in hot pursuit
baINES Isolate the building
If there's one exit overlooked, he'll know it
If there's one soft heart, one slow shooter, he'll know it
Ferris attends to Wisdom, bleeding on the stairs
FeRRIS Don't worry
caught him once; 'll catch him again
Be careful
don't want anything to happen to you
They care about each other more than they've let on
corridors Cris
Running
's and general Security Police close behind
No place to hide
Soldiers open fire
Cris dives for the floor, tumbles, gets to his feet, serpentines, and ends up behind a door that opens at the moment, as if by mental command, shielding him from gunfire
111
Security Police pour out from the other side
Cris reaches around and grabs someone's gun
He opens fire, buying himself enough cover to get to a doorway
Cris stops, thinks, then charges out shooting, fighting, running -- completing a condensed burst of four impossible tasks that get him to the next point of refuge
He waits, thinks, charges and, with another burst of choreographed action, makes it into an elevator whose doors conveniently open at that moment
He darts inside, keeps shooting, presses certain buttons - starting several stories up, and waits for the doors to close
Sergeant You five, up
You five, down
The rest stay with me
- Banks of monitors, each containing a grid of mini-frames containing the pov of a surveillance camera -- hundreds in all
, the Soldier at the console, is twitchy and hyper- alert
Leo watches as the Security Forces split up
He scans the monitors to see where Cris will resurface
- Cris climbs up through the ceiling panel
Elevator shaft - When the elevator stops, he rips open a   and climbs inside
approaches Wisdom with a syringe
No demerol

Get him a local
Amanda, Ferris' junior analyst, rushes in with lab reports
amanda You asked for these as soon as they were ready
112
Not now
amanda You might want to check this result
She points to a particular page
Impatient, Ferris reads
Her eyes widen
FeRRIS How pregnant
amanda few days
Ferris turns to Wisdom
This is getting interesting
We have a mating pair
Secure the female
- Liz sits in a waiting room by herself, reading a magazine
Psst
She looks up at the camera
Cris (o
c
) Unscrew the vent
She moves a chair under the vent and prepares to stand on it
The door opens and several 's march in
(to Liz) We're here to protect you
Without looking up at Cris, she moves the chair back against the wall and sits in it
Cris, frustrated, shimmies back through the vent
Leo checks all the video screens
Cris is nowhere
113
Leo He must be in the walls
Settling in, Cris looks at his watch
5:17
He concentrates and time speeds by - until a flashlight beam lights up the duct from a distance
found him
In here
As more Security Police and flashlights fill the shaft, Cris checks his watch: 5:33
: Which is once again dark, quiet and empty
Cris looks at his watch
5:17
Cris (to himself) Sixteen minutes
Cris takes a deep breath and crawls forward
Remarkably, he seems to be       like a snake shedding its skin
- In fact, Cris 1 lies there in deep concentration, while Cris 2 creeps onward
Cris drops down from a ventillator shaft into an office
He opens the door, walks into a corridor, and strides forward, preternaturally calm
He advances through an unfolding panorama of "stage sets" on which different hypothetical scenarios play out, one at a time, several simultaneously, or layered in like the melodic themes in a round or fugue, creating the visual equivalent of harmony and counterpoint
Cris encounters Security Police searching for him
When they discover Cris, they aim their weapons at him
He checks the time
Snapback a few seconds
He hides before they arrive
He goes through a door into a room
People are there
Snapback
Hides in a different room
It's empty
Cris searches the room
Looks in the desk drawers
Puts things in his pockets
The door flies open
Security Police find him and shoot
Snapback
114
Cris treads down empty corridors
He multiplies into a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, as he explores room after room, searching them sequentially
Simultaneously
He spends much time in a Handyman's Storeroom, while other Cris Johnson's fade away
Cris 27 finds the surveillance room with Leo in charge
Cris scans the room
He is seen
He waits to see who will shoot him first
He is hit in the chest
Fade out
Cris 35 gets caught by two Security Police
He fights them, takes their guns, but gets killed by reinforcements
Cris 63 waits in a room and peers through a crack in the door as his   , and he charts the comings and goings of the search parties, until they discover him, at which point he snapsback and hides in a different room
He's hiding in many rooms simultaneously
Spying
Piecing together the schedule of the patrol in that corridor
The same situations repeat
Scanning for security cameras
Fighting
Winning
Losing
Dying
He goes down a stairwell
One version of himself exits at a landing
second iteration of himself continues to the next floor down
At that landing, two iterations of himself turn in different directions, left and right
We follow the one that went to the left
He sees 's taking Liz from her holding room and escorting her somewhere else
He follows
Gets seen
By her
By them
Snapback
He is waiting in several locations, watching to see where the 's will emerge with Liz
The 's and Liz emerge from an elevator in one of the locations
The other Cris' fade out
Liz is ushered into a room and locked inside
Four guards depart
Two guards remain posted outside
They see Cris
He runs down stairs
Into the corridor
Into the room directly under the room where Liz is being held
Cris enters    where the captured bomb is being studied
There is a barrel of C4
's in the room turn on him and open fire
Cris is blasted and falls to the floor, dead
Snapback to
115
Cris, where he started, motionless as a hibernating bear, exploring his futures
passes through walls, floors, ceilings and finds Baines rushing through the corridors
Baines enters
Wisdom's office Where Wisdom paces with one crutch while Ferris sits on a sofa like Rodin's Thinker, in concentration almost as deep as Cris'
Baines He hasn't gotten out through any exit
The bad news is
wisdOM You've lost him
'm issuing infrared to all my men
We should have a fix in a few minutes
You realize if he gets away now, we'll never get him back
He'll be out there, and he'll be our enemy
Ferris looks up
FeRRIS know how to flush him out
bainES (at a loss) Fine
Tell me what to do
The thought crystallizes as she speaks
We don't actually have to do anything
(beat) We just have to decide to do something
unthinkable
Ferris shudders at the dark brilliance of her own idea
116
int
ground floor of facility - Guards stand in a solid line
No way out
Cris off to one side, in a niche just inside the door
Camera pans and finds a second Cris standing back, away from an exit
Pans and finds a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, trying each exit
At one dim exit, he lies on the ground, charred and dead, next to the gauntlet of 's he has tried to outrun
Wisdom's office Wisdom and Baines are looking at each other, appalled, then turn to Ferris
You want me to threaten to kill a pregnant woman
Threats don't count
When he foresees that you actually did kill her, that she's dead
(beat) He won't let it happen
- He'll come to us
Surrender
And she'll live
Wisdom regards her with perverse admiration
But it only works if we're not bluffing
Because he'll know
Wisdom considers the decision that lies ahead for him
- Cris is still trying to get out the front door, but there's one Soldier, call him  , who kills Cris repeatedly
Cris snapsback and tries various tactics, but he can't get past Crack Shot alive
He gives up
Turns and runs back into the heart of the building
Cris' mental pov expands to include the entire facility, like a crystal doll house
Simultaneously, he is observing every room, present in every room, charting the place, testing possible actions
117
The facility is a bee hive of activity
bee hive that accelerates to fast forward -- until all times are simultaneous
Until the simultaneous activity is made even denser by the accumulated layers of possibility
Cris-134 spies Ferris and Wisdom walking together
He follows them for a while, until he is discovered
Cris-134 fades out
The Ferris and Wisdom who saw him fade out
But another Ferris and Wisdom continue through the building, and their trail gets picked up by Cris-62, who has detoured in order to encounter them
As Cris' goals are accomplished, superfluous versions of himself fade away
The surveillance of a sequence of Ferris-and-Wisdoms is continued by Cris-91, then Cris-14, who watches as Wisdom and Ferris approach two guards standing outside an We recognize them as the 's who are guarding Liz, inside
Wisdom is let into the Interrogation Room by the 's
Ferris proceeds into a nearby office alone
SnaPBACK : vENTILLATION duct Cris comes out of his trance
Checks his watch
Sixteen minutes have passed
Cris composes his thoughts, takes a breath, then crawls forward, leaving no Cris behind
Now it's for real
moment after he rounds a corner,    stabs into the duct that he vacated
It scans around
Withdraws
: The situations that Cris has just previewed from the Ventillator Shaft constitute the raw material that he will now re-craft into a single narrative: the story of his actual escape attempt, staged in long takes, unfolding in almost- real time
When appropriate, to illustrate Cris' ability, we will portray several locations simultaneously via split- screens which change in number, size, shape, and placement
'  - Ceiling
The ventillator grill pops open
Cris drops to the floor
He grabs a backpack conveniently hanging on a hook
Without the slightest hesitation, he goes from shelf to box to drawer, loading particular objects into the backpack
118
Empty
door opens
Cris steps out into the hall carrying the backpack and a foot stool
He stays close to a wall, steps on the foot stool, and spray-paints over the lens of a surveillance camera
Leo spots Cris as he blinds one camera after another
Leo 've got him
Third level, building Pete, Brian, get up there
Kyle, block off the west staircase
Jason, bring your dogs in from the east
and   charge into an empty corridor and begin their search for Cris
door slams open, bashing Pete in the face
Cris breaks his shooting arm, grabs his -16, hides behind the door, and sprays bullets low, hitting Brian in the shins
He runs to Brian, breaks his shooting arm, takes his rifle
Drags Brian and Pete into an open room
Tapes their mouths
Baines arrives and takes command
Leo He was on third level seventy seconds ago
BaINES But where is he now
- Cris pours floor polish in specific places
and his  charge out off the stairwell
Each one steps directly into the polish and slips
As they fall, Cris punches them out or puts them in chokeholds, utilizing the elegant minimum of force or violence
Child's play
As soon as they are unconscious, Cris takes their guns, tear gas, and a gas mask
119
and   are on the way, each with a Cris lies in wait for the patrol
When they appear, he is perfectly placed to mace each dog and each soldier with a quick spritz
He goes back and sprays them again, to keep them out of commission
Surveillance room Cris appears on several screens
He's on this floor
Shit
He's coming here
The door opens
tear gas canister flies in
moment later, Cris charges in wearing a gas mask
He opens fire at the video monitors, shattering every one
By the time the 's are ready to respond, Cris reaches and grabs Baines' handgun
He swings out into the corridor with Baines' gun in his hand
Without looking, his hand aims and shoots several times
Emerging into the hallway, Cris looks down at the end of the hall and sees two 's falling to the floor, wounded
Cris wraps electrical tape around the door handle and a pipe on the wall, sealing the room shut, then turns and maces the last of the dogs
As the tear gas clears, the damage is visible
Every monitor in the surveillance system has been shattered
Leo, coughing, feels his way to a phone
' Wisdom answers on speakerphone
(o
c
) He blinded us
120
(o
c
) And the dogs are useless
Ferris stares at Wisdom expectantly
He's getting away
Cris, on the run, encounters   - not where he was seen in prevision
Crack Shot reaches for his gun
Cris breaks his arm before Crack Shot can fire
' Wisdom on the phone
Ferris watching in suspense
Any developments on the Code Red
Let me know if there are
He hangs up, discouraged
Dials a number
Baines, bring the girl friend to the Interrogation Room
(to Ferris) 'll deal with her there
- Cris sneaks into room where he foresaw that Liz will be brought
The door is recognizable by its industrial look
Where Liz is being baby-sat by four 's
Baines enters
We're moving her
- Cris writes a note
Slips it onto a side table
Opens the drawer of a desk
Writes in it
Puts something inside
Baines and the four 's arrives with Liz
Baines, Liz, and two 's wait while two officers carefully open the door and check out the room
121
We expect them to find Cris
But they don't
Outside, in the hall, a pencil rolls on the floor toward Liz
She notices it and looks where it came from
Sees Cris, hiding behind a janitor's cart
He puts his fist over his heart
Gesture of love
The two 's in the room signal for Liz to be brought inside
Two 's outside the room bring her in
Baines stays on guard outside
While the Guards stand on alert, Liz sits in a chair and discovers a piece of paper on a side table, placed exactly where her hand has come to rest
On the paper, in pencil, a square with a square cross within
She flips over the note
It reads, "
" She considers, then  as loud as she can while running around wildly
Hearing the commotion, Baines opens the door
Behind his back, Cris steps from hiding, opens the door to a room and slips inside, closing the door just as Baines looks back
The 's force Liz into a chair behind a desk
Sit there and shut up
Liz sees a drawer which is partially open
She looks inside
Sees a hefty pair of scissors
Inside the drawer, a message is written on the wood
"5:44, stab Wisdom
" She looks at a clock in the room
5:41
But Wisdom isn't there
Wisdom and Ferris, walking
You understand what's at stake here
We're playing for the future
Not just what happens next, but what the future is
What the rules are
() 122
(cont'd) If one man will know it and control it -- and have power over the rest of us
Or if we'll have power over him
By killing an innocent woman
She looks him in the eye
If you want, 'll pull the trigger
think that might be
more reliable
She accepts the terrible responsibility
'll join you in a minute
need to take care of some details
Wisdom turns to Baines
Get more men up here
Ferris walks to a nearby office and goes inside
Liz anxiously checks the clock
5:43 and still no Wisdom
Then the door opens
And Wisdom enters
They study each other, neither knowing the other's plans
She glances aside at the clock
' She picks up the phone
Dials a number
This is Ferris
'll need a chopper tanked up and ready
Behind her, Cris steps out of hiding
By the time she sees him, his forearm is around her neck
At 5:44, Liz grabs the scissors, lunges at Wisdom, and stabs at his neck
He raises his arm in time to block the blow
123
The two 's in the room fight her off, calling to the sentinels outside
Baines and the sentinels rush in to help
When the corridor is empty and no one is looking, the door to Ferris' office opens, and Cris emerges with Ferris as his hostage
's drag Liz away from Ferris
(not listening) Where the hell did she get the scissors
Cris and Ferris make their way toward the entrance
They come across a Patrol
The 's take aim
Cris holds his gun to Ferris' head
Hold your fire
(gets on the radio) We've got the target in plain sight in Corridor 2C, but he's holding a hostage
Agent Ferris
- Request instructions
IntERROGATION Baines, on the radio, turns to Wisdom
You won't believe this
He's got Ferris
How
don't know, but he's on his way to the front door
(beat) They want instructions
Wisdom thinks hard
124
Don't shoot
Then how are we going to stop him
We don't
We let him go
- It's part of the plan
Baines tries not to be insubordinate
You're sure about this
No, but Ferris is
Wisdom takes a deep breath - then grabs Liz by the arm and aims his gun at her head
hope he loves you as much as love her
Cris marches Ferris through the building, flanked by Security Police who aim at him but hold their fire
' comes over the public address system
wisdom (o
c
) Cris Johnson
've got your girl friend
We know her condition
That gets his attention
wisdom (o
c
) Something very bad will happen at six o'clock unless you're back in custody
(to Ferris) He hasn't got the balls
We'll find out, won't we
IntERROGATION Wisdom holds Liz at gunpoint
She seems remarkably calm
125
You're not going to kill me
That's what the bad guys do
In war, you have to be as ruthless as your enemy
(emphatic) Cris isn't the enemy
didn't mean him
Near lobby, where Crack Shot repeatedly nailed Cris
This time Crack Shot's shooting arm is in a sling, and he crouches next to a substitute sniper, who lies in wait
Cris walks into view and fires one shot, which wings the substitute sniper -- causing him to miss his shot at Cris
Cris pulls Ferris to the next location
Wisdom and Liz
He watches the clock
Now she's afraid
Can't you just leave us alone
He shakes his head, trying to gather courage
Another sniper takes aim at a section of hallway that Cris is approaching
As Cris enters the sniper's field of vision, he shifts Ferris to a different position, blocking the shot
As they pass under him, Ferris sees the sniper above
Cris takes aim at an empty space and fires just as a soldier charges from hiding and absorbs the bullet as if deliberately catching it with his body
126
God, you're remarkable
Cris breaks a window
Tosses a grenade outside
wish you had a little more sense of duty
'd say you have way too much
- The grenade explosion attracts many of the guards
Cris and Ferris slip out the front door where the Guards were previously stationed
He addresses a Soldier in a patrol car
Give me your keys
The Soldier obeys
Cris shoves Ferris into the car and gets in after her
(to soldier) If  see you, 'll kill her
They drive off
IntERROGATION Wisdom, agonized, is about to pull the trigger
Liz, trembling, sees that he's going to do it
'm sorry
Ext
Car - Driving away
Ferris realizes that Cris' escape is going to be successful
She checks her watch
It's 6:13
You know what our problem is
"We got off on the wrong foot
" He has taken the words right out of her mouth
127
It's really
"all been a big misunderstanding
" Exactly
"We've never meant you any harm
" It sounds so insincere when you say it
guess you're a better liar than am
You know what 'm going to say next
Cris nods
It'll never happen
She offers her card
My door will be open
We can start from scratch
He takes it
The phone number stands out: 888-CFerris
Flips the card out the window
The magic word is cooperate
That's all we've ever wanted to hear from you
helicopter lands on the road ahead, blocking the way
When are they going to give up
After you're dead
Cris holds his gun threateningly to Ferris' head
Two 's get out of the helicopter, carrying something heavy
128
Cris reacts to what he can't see yet
They are carrying a body
They remove the hood from its head
It's Liz
Dead
Quaking with rage, Cris prepares to shoot Ferris
: - Corridors - Twenty minutes earlier
Cris is marching Ferris through the corridors to the exit
ferriS wish you had a little more sense of duty
Cris stops in his tracks, quaking with rage
To a gang of murderers
Ferris seems pleased
see you got our message
He checks his watch
5:54
What's about to happen
you've brought it on yourselves
Cris changes course and charges into a
which he descends at a run, roughly dragging Ferris with him
fERRIS It's not too late Cris
You can save her

Cris shoves Ferris in front of him as a shield
Approaching a turn in the stairs, he fires blindly
Rounding the turn, he sees his would-be assassin collapsing, dead

Wisdom keeps his gun aimed at Liz's head as he watches the clock: 5:55
Soldier He's heading this way
Cris charges out of the stairwell, shooting without hesitation - forward, left, right, back - efficiently targeting Security Police in the precise order of their imminent readiness to fire at him
For each bullet, one soldier dies
Wisdom's voice comes over the

WiSDOM (o
) Johnson, this is Wisdom
It's 5:55
You have five minutes to turn yourself in
Cris and Ferris keep moving
Wisdom (o
) Or your worst nightmare will happen
Cris marches right up to the Interrogation Room where Wisdom holds Liz prisoner, using Ferris as a human shield
WisDOM (o
) Look ahead if you don't believe me
Cris opens the door to the room, revealing Wisdom, Ferris, and thirty Security Police and 's - who take aim at him and fire
Cris gets chopped to pieces
SnAPBACK : Cris crouches on the floor outside the Interrogation Room, reaches up and opens the door
He gets off a shot at Wisdom, who lives long enough to put a bullet in Liz's heart
SnAPBACK : Cris uses Ferris as a shield, gets off a burst of shots at Wisdom, killing him instantly
130
But a Soldier at Wisdom's side puts a bullet in Liz's heart -- then the thirty Security personnel blast Cris and Ferris to pieces
SnAPBACK : - Cris, dragging Ferris, arrives at the level of the Interrogation Room and continues down one more flight
Using Ferris as a human shield, he shoots his way into
- Where Cris previously saw the seized barrel of C4 Explosive
He guns down several armed 's whom he knows would be present, then threatens the technicians
Get out
They flee
Cris locks himself and Ferris inside
Cris goes over to the bomb
Squints for a beat ,  ,  , he goes through the whole learning curve on bomb detonation, blowing himself up - and snapping back to life -- several times before figuring out the right way to set it off
Wisdom holds Liz at arm's length with his gun pointed at her head
Watching the clock count up to 6:00
It's 5:59:41/ /42/43
Cris moves the bomb
Closes his eyes for a beat
Moves the bomb again
Closes his eyes
Opens them
Sets the detonator to 10 seconds
's wait, preparing to gun down Cris when he emerges
The door opens
Ferris sprints out
feRRIS It's going off in ten seconds
The crowd flees with her

Wisdom watches the clock count advance
5:59:55/56/57
Now empty
Cris runs for it

As Wisdom prepares to the pull the trigger, the bomb explodes in a giant cataclysm
Smoke and dust Roiling
Opaque
Then clearing
The center of the building is gone
jagged raw atrium extends several stories down and up
To the side, on a narrow ledge of floor extending from a wall
crouches Liz
The only person remaining
She has survived by inches
Very precise
As she recovers from the blast, a door opens behind her
Cris appears, extends a hand and helps her from her perch

Private jet - night Cris and Liz bound up the entry steps, exhausted but elated
- At the door, no one is present to greet them
Odd
They continue into the main cabin, where Neal, the Showgirl, the Pilots, and the Flight Attendant are glued to the television
Neal sees Cris and Liz, but hardly acknowledges them
He's in shock
They all are
Cris and Liz turn to the

) The situation in Chicago is not quite as severe as in the other nine cities where the dirty bombs exploded, as prevailing winds blew the nuclear waste across Lake Michigan rather than straight into town
Radiation levels in Detroit, on the other hand, may require the entire city to be evacuated
Liz and Cris look at each other, ashen
This is what they wanted you to prevent
guess
And you wouldn't help
They didn't explain
They were trying to force me
Liz shakes her head, incredulous
CrIS They were gonna make me a slave
She looks at Cris like he's scum - and heads for the front of the plane
Liz
Where are you going
Liz To the doctor
She walks out of the jet and down the steps
She's not coming with us
Cris stands there, bereft, and watches her go
He has run out of futures

Tears escaping from his eyes

Since that point, Cris has been up for hours - scanning the futures
Finding no path worth taking
Wisdom's  - dawn Ferris sleeps next to Wisdom
She's hogged the covers
Her cell phone rings
Drowsily, she answers
FeRRIS Ferris
Cris (o

She sits up
Where did you get this number
Liz's kitchen - dawn Cris is dressed
Despondent
CrIS want to cooperate
That's music to my ears
But  have conditions
'm sure we can work something out
liz's bed - dawn Liz
Sleeping
Cris sits next to her on the bed
Liz

Her eyes flicker open
She sees him looking down at her like an angel
LiZ Come back to bed
can't
-  have to go
(incredulous) You're not leaving
There's something  have to do
Something you'd want me to do
And can't put it off any longer
(wounded) Fine
Then go
What do  care
Liz, it's not like that
searched for you for a long time
want to be with you forever
Don't overdo it
We just met last night
But a lot has happened since then
While  was sleeping
He proceeds with difficulty
We're going to have a child
Then you really are an angel
don't expect you to believe me
But when you do find out, remember that we came together for a reason
That this wasn't just
one night
It was a special chance for both of us

Seeing his misery, she softens
Then why are you running away from me
He holds back tears
'm not
'm taking the long way around
Now she's crying
don't understand
We got off to such a great start
He nods, wistful
And  looked for a happy ending
But this was the best  could do
They kiss good-bye, and she makes it so wickedly sweet that he can barely pull himself away
Liz watches, mystified, as he leaves - stirred by feelings for Cris that are just coming into being
See ya
wouldn't be surprised
And he walks out the door

LiZ'  - Cris walks down the driveway to the street
He stands there a beat, then Ferris' car drives up and stops in front of him
Cris opens the passenger door and gets in
Ferris' car - They look at each other, coming from very different places
Ferris Mr
Johnson, we meet at last
136
wasn't ready till now
Ferris shifts into gear and drives off
We don't have time to waste
Maybe you could start by telling me how your talent works
He thinks how to phrase it
"The future ain't what it used to be
" Ever hear that expression

(v

The future changes every time you look at it
Because you looked at it
Cause once you see it, you're different
And that changes everything else
Liz puts her hand on her belly
