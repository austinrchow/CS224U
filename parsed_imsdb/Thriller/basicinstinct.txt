a man and woman make love on a brass bed
There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling
On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine tape deck  the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil
" Atop him
she straddles his chest
her breasts in his face
He cups her breasts
She leans down, kisses him
is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking
We don't see the woman's face
She has long blonde hair
The and to the side of them
She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth
she kisses him
she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms above his head
She moves higher atop him
she reaches to the side of the bed
a white silk scarf is in her hand
her hips above his face now, moving
slightly, oh-so slightly
his face strains towards her
The scarf in her hand
she ties his hands with it
gently
to the brass bed
his eyes are closed
tighter
lowering hips into his face
lower
over his chest
his navel
The  plays
He is inside her
his head arches back
his throat white
She arches her back
her hips grind
her breasts are high
Her back arches back
back
her head tilts back
she extends her arms
the right arm comes down suddenly
the steel flashes
his throat is white
He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses
It flashes up
it flashes down
and up
and down
and up
and
- Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy
Cop cars everywhere
The lights play through the thick fog
Two Homicide detectives get out of the car, walk into the house
is 42
Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face urban, edged, shadowed
is 64
Crew-cut, silver beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher
There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a Picasso on the wall
They check it out
Who was this fuckin' guy
Rock and roll, Gus
Johnny Boz
never heard of him
(grins) Before your time, pop
(a beat) Mid-sixties
Five or six hits
He's got a club down in the Fillmore now
Not now he don't
Past the uniformed guys
nods
waves
past the forensic men
past the coroner's investigators
they get to the bedroom
They walk in, stare -- it's messy
It's like a convention in here
, in his 50's, silver-haired, the Homicide guys;  , late 40's, puffy, affable;   , 30's, black
'  is working the bed
(to Nick and Gus) You guys know Captain Talcott
They nod
What's the Chief's office doin' here
Observing
(to the Coroner's Guy) What do you think, Doc
' The skin blanches when  press it -- this kind of color is about right for six or eight hours
Nobody say anything
The maid came in an hour ago and found him
She's not a live-in
Maybe the maid did it
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds
' (deadpan) There are no bruises on his body
(grins) It ain't the maid
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight
That's the last time anybody saw him
(looks at body) What was it
' Ice pick
Left on the coffee table in the living room
Thin steel handle
Forensics took it downtown
There's come all over the sheets -- he got off before he got offed
(deadpan) That rules the maid out for sure
This is sensitive
Mr
Boz was a major contributor to the mayor's campaign
He was Chairman of the Board of the Palace of Fine Arts -- (to Nick) thought you said he was a rock and roll star
He was a retired rock and roll star
civic-minded, very respectable rock and roll star
What's that over there
We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror on the side table
(deadpan) It looks like some civic-minded, very respectable cocaine to me, Gus
(evenly, to Nick) Listen to me, Curran
'm going to get a lot of heat on this don't want any
mistakes
Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then -- Who's the girlfriend
Lt
Walker looks at the notepad in his hand
Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero
Nick writes it down
He and Gus turn, leave
Captain Talcott watches them
He looks disturbed
As they head out -- Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes
What are they nervous about
They're executives
They're nervous about everything
Nick
He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them
Walker comes up to them
(to Nick) Keep your three o'clock
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to -- said keep it
- It is more a mansion than a house
They ring the bell
An Hispanic  answers
They flash their badges
'm Detective Curran, this is Detective Moran
We're with the San Francisco Police Department
We'd like to speak to Ms
Catherine Tramell
(after a beat, an accent) Just moment
Come in
She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room that offers a sweeping view of the Bay
Sit, please
Just moment
They look around, impressed
There is a Picasso on the wall here, too
Ain't that cute
They got his and her Pig-assos, son
(smiles) didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus
(grins) 'm a smart sonofabitch
just hide it
Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful  walks into the room
She looks like she has been asleep
She is in her early 20's
She wears a very sheer robe
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some -- Are you vice
(after a beat) Homicide
What do you want
When was the last time you saw John Boz
Is he dead
(after a beat) Why do you think he's dead
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you
Were you with him last night
You're looking for Catherine, not me
Who are you
'm Roxy
(a beat) 'm her -- friend
She looks at them a beat
She's out at the beach house at Stinson
Seadrift
1402
Thanks
They start to head out
You're wasting your time
Catherine didn't kill him
beat, they look at her, and go
-   - Foggy
Cold
It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean
Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming pools
There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, one white
They get out of the car in front of the house
They see a woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring at the sea, a blanket around her
As they get to her -- Ms
Tramell
She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away
is 30 years old
She has long blonde hair and a refined, classically beautiful face
She is not knockout gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about her
'm De
(evenly) know who you are
She doesn't look at them
She looks at the water
How did he die
He was murdered
Really
Maybe that's why you're from Homicide
How
Nick glances at Gus
With an ice pick
She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see a thin smile
They see it, too, and glance at each other
How long were you dating him
wasn't dating him
was fucking him
They glance at each other again
What are you -- a pro
Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again
No
'm an amateur
She looks away
How long were you having sex with him
About a year and a half
Were you with him last night
Yes
Did you leave the club with him
Yes
Did you go home with him
No
We had a drink at the club
We left together
came here
He went home
Was there anyone with you last night
(looks at Nick) No
wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night
They look at her a beat
Let me ask you something, Ms
Tramell
Are you sorry he's dead
Catherine looks at him
Yes
liked fucking him
They stare at her
She looks out at the water
don't really feel like talking anymore
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you -- Read me my rights and arrest me and 'll go downtown
She doesn't even look at them
(quietly) Otherwise, get the fuck out of here
Please
long beat as they look at her
- The door says Dr
Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling
Nick opens the door, peeks in
The receptionist is not there
clock says 3
He walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in
'm sorry, Beth
--  got hung up in Stinson
, the police psychologist, is a very good- looking, dark-haired woman
She is 30
(smiles) How are you, Nick
'm fine
Come on, Beth
You know 'm fine
How the hell long do  have to keep doing this
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to,  suppose
Sit down, Nick
It's bullshit
You know it is
(smiles) know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay
He sits down
So -- how are things
(after a beat) Things are fine
told you
They're fine
She watches him closely
(after a beat) How is your -- personal life
My sex life is fine
(a beat) My sex life is pretty shitty actually since  stopped seeing you -- maybe  should think about my Electrolux again
That embarrassed her; she looks away from him
(after a beat) Sorry
She shrugs
beat
How about the booze
It's been three months
(after a long beat) How about the coke
No
No
(hard) No
'm working my tail off
'm off the sauce, 'm not even smoking anymore
She smiles
How's not smoking
It's fucked -- now will you please tell
that 'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here
(after a beat; smiles) Yes
Thank you
And he starts heading out
(behind him) still miss you, Nick
He doesn't even turn, pretends he didn't hear
He walks in
Gus Moran gets up from his desk as soon as he sees him
Talcott's in there
They're waiting
They start heading for Lt
Walker's office
How'd it go, son
She misses me
(grins) Hallelujah
' He and Gus sit there with Lt
Walker, Harrigan, Andrews and Captain Talcott
Sixteen stab wounds to the chest and neck
No usable prints, no forcible entry, nothing missing
No prints on the ice pick, either -- it's available at any Safeway
The scarf is Hermes, expensive -- they sell about 20,000 a year worldwide
The powder was cocaine, high- quality, high-content
He inhaled it; there were minute quantities on his lips and penis
Mr
Boz leaves five million dollars, no insurance, no direct survivors
He liked his coke, he liked his girls, and he liked rock and roll
He liked the mayor, too, right
Talcott gives him a look
What about his girlfriend
Is she relevant here
didn't know she was a suspect
She's a suspect
On what basis
(looks a notes) Catherine Tramell
Age 30
No priors, no convictions
Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980
Literature and Psychology
Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir
Estimated assets $110 million
It hangs there
Are you kidding me
(continues) Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased -- Bobby Vasquez
Bobby Vasquez, former middleweight contender, killed in the ring Atlantic City, 1984
(smiles) love it
She's got a hundred million bucks
She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars
And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads
You forgot her degree in literature
She's a writer
She published a novel last year under a pen name
Do you want to know what it's about
They just stare at him
It's about a retired rock and roll star who is murdered by his girlfriend
It hangs there a long beat
'  - His apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide open spaces
There is a lot of chrome
He sits on the couch, reading a book
It is a paperback
We see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams
He puts the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials
Page 67, pop
Do you know how she does the boyfriend
With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk scarf
- Nick, Gus, Lt
Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott -- and Beth Gardner
With them is an older, white-haired man, There are copies of "Love Hurts" around the table
Dr
Gardner
've asked Dr
Lamott to consult with us
This isn't really my turf
Dr
Lamott teaches the psycho- pathology of psychopathic behavior at Stanford and is also a member of the Justice Department's Psychological Profile team
Dr
Lamott
There are two possibilities
One
The person who wrote this book is your murderer and acted out the killing described in ritualistic, literal detail
Two
Someone who wants to do the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate the writer
(after a long beat) What if the writer did it
What are we dealing with
You're dealing with a devious, diabolical mind
This book must have been written at least six months, maybe years before it was published
That means the writer planned the crime, at least in the subconscious, back then
The fact that the writer carried it out indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior in terms not only of the killing itself but in terms of applied advance defense mechanism
long beat
Most times  can't tell shit from shinola, Doc
What was all that you just said
Some grins, titters
She anticipates the book to be her best alibi
Correct
She's going to say Do you think 'd be dumb enough to kill anyone in the exact way 've described in my book
wouldn't do that because 'd know 'd be a suspect
long beat -- as they think about it
What if it's not the writer
What if it's someone who read the book
You're dealing then with someone so obsessed that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim to place the blame on the person who wrote this book
We are talking about deep-seated, obsessional hatred; an utter lack of sense of proportion or perspective
We've got a top-of-the-line, once- in-a-lifetime loony-tune either way you cut it -- that's what you're saying, right, Doc
You're dealing with someone very dangerous and very ill
'  - , a big man in his 50's, with Captain Talcott, Lt
Walker, Nick, and Gus
Corrigan is reading a file
He gets up, yawns, goes to his window, looks out
Come on, you know there's no case here
There's no physical evidence -- okay, she doesn't have an alibi but there's no motive
Her defense would just beat us to death with the copycat thing
Anybody who read the book could have done it
long beat; no one says anything
So what do we do -- nothing
(after a beat) We bring her in for questioning
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down
She was the last person seen with the guy -- 'll take the responsibility
It's yours
It won't do any good
She'll come in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli trailing behind her on a solid gold chain from Tiffanys
Yes she will
(after a beat) No she won't
They look at him
(smiles) don't think she's going to hide behind anybody
don't think she's going to hide at all
(after a beat) think you're as crazy as she probably is, Curran
Nicks says nothing
You know what they say: It takes one to know one
Nick looks a Gus, grins
- They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house
They ring the bell
They hear typing inside
The typing stops
She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt
Ms
Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us
Are you arresting me
If that's the way you want to play it
They look at each other a beat
(smiles) Can  change into something more appropriate
It'll just take a minute
He nods
Come in
It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif
She goes to a bedroom of the living room
Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into
Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom
There is a coffee table between them
She leaves the bedroom door halfway open
An old newspaper is on the coffee table
Nick reaches for it
The headline says headline underneath says
There is a photograph of Nick
He stares at the paper
How long will this take
Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table
He is lost in his thoughts
Gus picks the paper up
(looks up) don't know
Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near the wall of the bedroom
The mirror reflects her in the other corner of the bedroom
She is taking her clothes off
He stares
She strips down
He sees her back
She has a beautiful body
Naked, she puts a dress on
She doesn't put any underwear on
Do you always keep old newspapers around
Only when they make interesting reading
And she is suddenly out of the bedroom
She stands there, smiles
They look at each other a long beat
(finally) 'm ready
They get up, head out
You have the right to an attorney
Why would  need an attorney
- They sit in the front; she is in the back
The car goes over the winding, two-lane Mt
Tamalpais road
The fog is heavy
It's starting to rain
We see the beach far below
Do you have a cigarette
don't smoke
Yes, you do
quit
She smiles, looks at him
beat, and he turns away
Another beat, and she lights a cigarette up
thought you were out of cigarettes
found some in my purse; would you like one
He turns back to her
told you --  quit
It won't last
beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away
You workin' on another book
Yes  am
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time
He watches her in the rearview mirror
It teaches you to lie
How's that
You make it up, but it has to be believable
They call it suspension of disbelief
like that
"Suspension of Disbelief
" He smiles at her in the mirror
What's your new book about
detective
He falls for the wrong woman
He turns back to her
What happens to him
She looks right into his eye
She kills him
beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns away from her
Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror
- It is large, fluorescent-lighted, antiseptic
She walks in with Nick and Gus
In the room are prosecutor John Corrigan, Lt
Walker, Captain Talcott, Harrigan, and Andrews
There is a police stenographer a plain young woman in her 20's
As soon as she comes in -- 'm John Corrigan
'm an assistant district attorney, Ms
Tramell
Can we get you anything
Would you like some coffee
No thank you
Are your attorneys -- (hiding a smile) Ms
Tramell waived her right to an attorney
Corrigan and Talcott glance at Nick
She sees the look
(smiles) Did  miss something
told them you wouldn't want an attorney present
Why have you waived your right to an attorney, Ms
Tramell
(to Nick) Why did you think  wouldn't want one
told them you wouldn't want to hide
have nothing to hide
The two of them keep their eyes on each other
She sits down
They sit around her
Nick sits directly across from her
She lights up a cigarette
They watch her
She is poised, cool, in complete command of herself
There is no smoking in this building, Ms
Tramell
What are you going to do
Charge me with smoking
Ever so casually, she blows her smoke across at Nick
: - Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr
Boz
had sex with him for about a year and a half
liked having sex with him
She has control of the room; she looks from one man to the other as she speaks
He wasn't afraid of experimenting
like men like that
like men who give me pleasure
He gave me a lot of pleasure
beat, as they watch her
She is so matter-of-fact
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him
(smiles) Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr
Corrigan
(after a beat, little flustered) Did you ever tie him up
No
You never tied him up
No
Johnny liked to use his hands too much
like hands and fingers
They stare at her
: - You describe a white silk scarf in your book
've always had a fondness for white silk scarves
(she smiles) have a very vivid imagination
But you said you liked men to use their hands
No
said  liked Johnny to use his hands
(she smiles) don't give any rules, Nick go with the flow
They have their eyes on each other
: - Did you kill Mr
Boz, Ms
Tramell
'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way  described in my book
'd be announcing myself as the killer
'm not stupid
She smiles
We know you're not stupid, Ms
Tramell
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him
Yes it does, doesn't it
She holds his eyes a second, then -- The answer is no
didn't kill him
: - Do you use drugs, Ms
Tramell
Sometimes
Did you ever do drugs with Mr
Boz
Sure
What kind of drugs
Cocaine
She looks directly at Nick
Have you ever fucked on cocaine
(she smiles) It's nice
He watches her
: - You like playing games, don't you
(smiles) 've got a degree in psych
It goes with the turf
Games are fun
They are holding each other's eyes
How about boxing
That's a game
Was that fun for you
They don't take their eyes off each other for a second
think that's irrelevant to this inquiry
(to Nick) Yes it was
Bobby died
How did you feel when he died
loved him
hurt
Their eyes are still on each other
How did you feel when  told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach
felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game
But you didn't hurt -- No
Because you didn't love him -- That's right
Their eyes are digging into each other
Even though you were fucking him
(after a beat) You still get the pleasure
Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick
beat; he stares at her, expressionless
How did you know he was married
(watching Nick) Maybe  was guessing
What difference does it make
She lights a cigarette
He stares at her
Would you like a cigarette, Nick
He just stares at her, expressionless
Do you two know each other
No
No
- How did you meet Mr
Boz
wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock star went down to his club and picked him up
Then  had sex with him
You didn't feel anything for him
You just had sex with him for your book
She looks at Nick
In the beginning
Then  got to like what he did for me
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady
'm a writer,   use people for what  write
You write what you know
Let the world beware
She and Nick have their eyes on each other, then -- (to Corrigan, smiles) Would you like me to take a lie detector test
: - We see her in a glass-enclosed cubicle with a polygraph Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt
Walker
Her back is to them
The Examiner shuts the machine down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle
No blips, no blood pressure variations, no pulse variance
Either she's telling the truth or 've never met anyone like her
long beat, then -- Well,  guess that's it
long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside
How does somebody beat this machine
Ninety-nine point nine percent of the cases, they don't
You'd have to be able to mask the truth from your own central nervous system, your circulatory system, your adrenal glands
In my opinion, this woman is telling the truth
The Examiner walks away
They stand there
Catherine stands at the door of the cubicle behind them -- Can  go now
(after a beat) Yes
Thanks for coming in, Ms
Tramell
'm sorry to inconvenience you
She says nothing, has a thin smile
Can  ask one of you for a ride
They look at her a beat
Sure
(smiles) Thanks
And he and Catherine walk away
Gus and Walker watch them
- It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche
It is pouring rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm
Nothing is said a long beat as he drives
She yawns
Stretches
He looks at her
(smiles) 'm tired
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine
She looks at him and looks away
beat
If  were guilty, and if  wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring
It wouldn't be tiring at all
Why not
Because 'm a professional liar
spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies
(a beat) For my writing
He looks at her
(smiles) love the rain, don't you
He says nothing, doesn't look at her
You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you
He looks at her now
passed
You see
We're both innocent, Nick
He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops
He sees the white Ferrari in the driveway
How do you know all this stuff about me
You know all about me
don't know anything that isn't police business
(after a beat) You know  don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick
They look at each other a beat
(smiles) Thanks for the ride
And she's out of the car
He watches her as she hurries in the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the door and is inside
- - It is a police bar, San Francisco style
Ferns  Joe Montana and Will Clark posters
The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett
He walks in
He sees Lt
Walker at a back booth with Gus, goes to them, sits down
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette
Nick can you give me a ride
She didn't ask me for the ride
She asked anybody
And you volunteered
stays behind the bar, but yells to him
Perrier, Nick
Double Black Jack rocks, Harry
(with concern) What you doin', son
It's my first drink in three months
That okay with you, pop
(to Lt
Walker) She doesn't know me
never saw her before Gus and  talked to her
Here you go, Nick
He gets up, gets his drink -- Thanks, Harry
He sits back down
He takes a big slug
They watch him
You sure
'm sure
He takes another big slug
Now what
What now what
Now nothing
She passed the polygraph
That's it
She knew she could beat it
That's why she asked to take it
How the fuck do you know
What is it with you and this broad anyway
Come on, Phil
You're not gonna let this slide
What about her parents
What about what else she's published
At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence
Her parents died in an accident
don't care what else she's written
What are you -- a book critic
How did they die
Was there an investigation
How you're saying she killed her parents
Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch
Maybe she did, Gus
Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face
Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it
(casually) Fuck you, Phil
Fuck you, too Nick
beat, then -- (calls to the Bartender) Can you get me another double Black Jack, Harry
Gus looks at him with concern
man in his 50's -- is suddenly there
He is overweight, florid
(to Nick) Hey, shooter -- You back on the Black Jack, Shooter
He grins
Nick doesn't look at him
We're discussing a case, Marty
know that
had no doubt of that
Here you go, Nick
Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick
(grins) Double, huh, Shooter
Nick turns to him
He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is standing there
Nick looks like he's barely restraining himself
'm off-duty, Nilsen
You hear me
'm off-duty discussing a case
Internal Affairs shouldn't have any trouble with that
Maybe should put in for overtime
(grins) You do that, Shooter
Why don't you send it to me
'll give it special attention
beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him
'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen -- Lt
Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back
Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there
What's the problem
(grins) No problem, Doctor
Here comes the Doctor just in time to save her patient
Take care, Shooter
And he walks away
Nick still looks like he wants to go after him
Beth pulls him away from the booth
You okay
(after a beat) Yeah
(smiles) You don't look so okay
Nick looks at her a beat
(smiles) What are you doing here
(smiles) Baby-sitting
(she shrugs) Rookie cop
(smiles) What else is new
beat
He looks at her again
You want to get out of here
She looks at him a beat
(smiles) Yes
At the booth, Gus and Lt
Walker watch the two of them leave
Maybe it's for old-time's sake
(watches them go out) Sometimes  think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs
(after a beat, smiles) He ain't that way
He's got heart
(smiles) Yeah
know
'   - He is kissing her -- hard, rough
He forces her against the wall
Don't -- please, Nick -- We hear her dress
He kisses her harder -- we hear her panties
He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under her bra -- Please don't -- don't -- He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move down to the floor
'   - It is dark
The are still partially dressed
They are on the floor
He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling
She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her
There is a bite mark on her shoulder
long beat, silence -- then -- What was she like
Who
Catherine Tramell
(after a beat) She said what you said she'd say
She sits up, looks away
He looks at her, puts his finger on the bite mark idly, gently
beat, and he kisses her shoulder gently, then lies back down
met her at Berkeley
He looks at her
We were in some of the same classes
(after a beat) Why didn't you tell me
She looks at him
'm telling you
They look at each other a long beat
(with difficulty) You've never been
like that
before
He says nothing, looks away from her
Why
He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing
You're the shrink
She keeps looking at him
He won't look at her
You weren't making love to me
beat; he looks at her
Who was  making love to
She looks at him a long beat
You weren't making love
They look at each other, a long beat, then away
He lies back down
Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up
(finally) need a cigarette
(after a beat) thought you quit
He says nothing
Top drawer in the foyer
(a beat) Get it on your way out
He looks at her; she won't look at him
- He walks in
He looks hung-over
He sees Gus with Harrigan and Andrews and Lt
Walker in Lt
Walker's glass-enclosed office at the end of this big room
They look at him when they see him
You look like dogshit
(grins) He looks a little shrunk, that's all
(after a beat) We got a call from Berkeley
There was a killing
professor
Icepick
In his bed
Multiple stab wounds
1977
(a thin smile) She was there, wasn't she
University records say she was there
He and Nick look at each other a long beat, then -- (suddenly) Gus -- go over to Berkeley
Harrigan -- find out what else she's published
Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident
Carbon Beth on everything
want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus
What about me
You're already gettin' psychological input, son
(to Nick) Go stick your head in a tub of ice water
(a beat; then seriously) See where she leads
- The black Ferrari is in the driveway
He sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house, watching
It is a bleak, leaden gray day
Catherine comes out of the house
She is dressed casually
She gets into the Ferrari
He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson Beach into Marin County
She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting in and out, passing cars very fast
He has to start cutting around cars to keep up
This woman really drives
He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey Lines Tour Bus head-on
Close call: sheer drops on either side
He looks frazzled
He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns
He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her
And then he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured by hedges
He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a long beat
He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks
small, nondescript house
He watches
He can't see anything inside the house
beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it
He takes an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins
- He watches as she comes out of the house
frail old woman in her 70's is with her
She hugs the old woman, gets into the Ferrari,  it up
He waits a beat and then  after her
He stays behind her at a distance -- she is going slowly
And then she suddenly it, cuts her lights -- her wheels
He  his car after her
He makes a turn
She is gone
There is a fork in the road
He turns one way, goes a few hundred feet
Nothing
Blackness
He stops
(quietly) Shit
- He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach
The black Ferrari is in the driveway
light goes on in an upstairs bedroom
The curtain is drawn
He sees the outline of her body now
She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, behind the curtain
He watches her body as she does an almost languorous strip
His eyes are intense
ravishing
- He is alone, nobody else in the big room
He sits in front of a computer
We see the screen
He has punched in , , 145
,
He is waiting for a response
We see it come on screen long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these words ,  ,  7, 1965
We see him type in the words long beat, and then it comes up ,  10, 1956 - He stares at the screen a long beat
(behind him) Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine
(after a beat; lost in his thoughts) What are you doing here, Pop
(grins) came in here to jack off the damn machine
(a beat) One dead psychology professor
Noah Goldstein
Dr
Noah Goldstein
And guess what
He was her counselor
Nick looks at him a beat
Was she ever suspect
No, sir
They never even got a statement from her
Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere
(slowly) Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins
(grins) Hell yes
Couldn't get it outta my head for years
Still can't
Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems
One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em
All of 'em
Used a knife
He got for a wedding present
Didn't even deny it
Sweet as honey
Said she didn't know why she done it
Nick just stares at him
- He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car
He stands there a beat, thinking
He walks down to the beach entrance of the house
He hears a Rolling Stones  playing inside
He stands there
The door suddenly opens
Catherine stands there, smiles
She wears very tight-fitting spandex leotards
Hi
He looks at her a beat, then -- Am
disturbing you
No
Come in
They have their eyes on each other
beat, and she turns to go in
She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside
He watches her body
His movements are tentative, off-balance
She turns the Stones
On a table by the window, he sees a word processor
Spread around it are newspaper clippings
They are all about him
We see the headline on one
She sees him glancing at the clips
'm using you for my detective
In my book
You don't mind, do you
She smiles
He looks at her, expressionless
Would you like a drink
was just going to have one
No, thanks
She goes to the bar
(smiles) That's right
You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you
She is making herself a drink
She takes the ice out and then opens a drawer and gets an icepick
It has a fat wooden end
She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him
He watches her
'd like to ask you a few more questions
'd like to ask you some, too
She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles
For my book
She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick
She raises her arm, plunges it
Raises it, plunges it
He watches her
(wary) What kind of questions
She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to him
How does it feel to kill someone
He looks at her a long beat
(finally) You tell me
don't know
But you do
Their eyes are on each other
(finally) It was an accident
They got in the line of fire
Four shootings in five years
All accidents
(after a long beat) They were drug buys
was a vice cop
long beat, as they look at each other
Tell me about Professor Goldstein
There's a name from the past
You want a name from the present
How about Hazel Dobkins
She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her eyes off him
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year
(she smiles) That's probably where  got the idea for the icepick
For my book
Funny how the subconscious works
(a beat) Hazel is my friend
She wiped out her whole family
Yes
She's helped me understand homicidal impulse
Didn't you study it in school
Only in theory
(she smiles) You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter
Not in theory -- in practice
He stares at her a long beat
(quietly) What happened, Nick
Did you get sucked into it
Did you like it too much
(after a beat) No
He stares at her, almost horrified
(quietly) Tell me about the coke, Nick
The day you shot those two tourists -- how much coke did you do
She steps closer to him
Tell me, Nick
She puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand roughly, holds it
didn't
Yes, you did
They never tested you, did they
But Internal Affairs knew
They are face to face
He is still holding her roughly by the hand
Your wife knew, didn't she
She knew what was going on
Nicky got too close to the flame
Nicky liked it
He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed against each other -- their eyes digging into each other
(in a whisper) That's why she killed herself
He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against him
We hear the  behind them
beat, and he lets her go, turns away from her
Roxy stands there, staring at them
Her hair is up
She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a black -shirt, and black jeans and cowboy boots
(brightly) Hiya, hon
You two have met, haven't you
Roxy looks at Nick
Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of them looking at Nick
He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask
You're going to make a terrific character, Nick
He doesn't look at her; he's gone
'  - He comes in
He looks like he's going to kill someone sits there
She's on the phone -- she'll be right with you, detective --He sweeps by her into Beth's inner office
She hangs up when she sees the look on his face
Who has access to my file
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you
Who's got access to my goddamn file
She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him
Nobody
He goes closer to her; she backs away
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall
She looks very scared
He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall
Don't, Beth
Don't lie to me
She says nothing, looks scared
(suddenly) It's Internal Affairs, isn't it
No, Nick, please -- (loud, hard) Who
(blurts it) Nilsen
- He storms into the big room
He sees
He is sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside this big room
About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in the big room
He goes by them into Nilsen's office
' He closes the door
Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs his chair away towards the wall
What do you want, Curran
He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against the wall
(out of control) You sold her the file, didn't you
(scared) What are you talking about
(out of control) What'd she pay you
He slams him against the wall again
The glass  behind them -- a chair comes into the room
Nick is frozen, holding Nilsen by the throat against the wall
Let him go, Curran
Nice and easy
He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns drawn, pointed at him
beat, and he lets Nilsen go
He turns calmly and starts to walk out
You're on sick leave, Shooter
As of right now
Pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation
- He gets into his old Porsche
He  the car up
Gus Moran comes up to the window
They look at each other a What's goin' down, son
Nothin' (a beat) 'll be okay, pop
They look at each other a long beat
No, sir
You won't
There's smoke off yonder on the horizon
They're gonna want your badge
(after a long beat) got tired of being played with
(after a beat) You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that
They almost smile at each other, then -- (almost to himself) She knows where  live and breathe
She's coming after me
(after a long beat) What is it you got between you
(after a beat; to himself) don't know
Somethin', though
beat, and then Nick looks at him
Yeah
(a beat) Somethin'
- He sits in front of the , watching a lame sitcom
bottle of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him
He is smoking a cigarette
(behind him) still have my key
He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom
don't want to see you, Beth
He keeps watching the sitcom
long beat
(suddenly angry) Damnit
Don't shut me out
You owe me more than that
He goes to the , shuts it off
don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything
(he looks at her) We went to bed -- what was it
-- ten or fifteen times
(he smiles) It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations
(after a long beat) Sometimes  really hate you
(smiles) Yeah
Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out
(a beat) But take my advice
Put a little more life into it than you usually do
beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury, trying to claw at his face
He grabs her, blocks her
They look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go
The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from each other
(finally) 'm sorry
don't usually
act like that
Nick looks at her a beat
How could you let him have my file, Beth
long beat, then -- (not looking at him) He was going to recommend your discharge a behavioral disability
made a deal with him
He could review the session notes himself
It was the only way  could keep you on the force
She looks at him
He looks away from her
You did it for me
Yes
care about you
did it for you
He turns away from her
(quietly) Get out of here, Beth
(a beat) Please
He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more
She looks at him pour it and turns to go
- He is asleep on the couch -- the  is on to a blank screen
The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone
The phone on the coffee table
It  again
He wakes, picks it up, listens
Yeah
(a beat) Okay
He hangs it up
He sits there a long beat, staring
He looks disturbed
-  - He walks down the alley
There are lots of police cars, flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men
As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt
Walker, Gus, and several of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office
They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car
They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside
He can see into the car now
Martin Nilsen lies against the front seat
He has been shot in the head
Nick stares
One shot
Close range
Probably a
38 caliber revolver
Nick stares at Nilsen's body
They watch him
Give me your gun, Nick
beat, and then Nick gives him his gun
Walker smells it, shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men
(to Walker) You think  -- don't son, but  got the minority opinion
- He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt
Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott
Lt
Walker and Gus sort of sit back --
is running the investigation
The same police stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in the room who was there with Catherine
Okay
went after him
lost my temper
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone
(after a beat) No
Beth Gardner comes into the room
They look at her
We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr
Gardner
Nick gives her a look
'd like to sit-in if you don't mind
'd really rather -- don't see anything wrong with Dr
Gardner sitting-in if Detective Curran doesn't object
Nick looks at her, shrugs
Where were you tonight
Home
Watching
All night
Yeah
Were you drinking
He looks at Beth
Yeah,  was drinking
When did you start drinking again
(after a beat) couple days ago
saw Detective Curran at his apartment around ten o'clock
He was sober and lucid
asked him in my capacity as his departmental therapist about his altercation with Lt
Nilsen
He expressed regret and displayed no hostility
(to Beth) How long were you at his apartment
About fifteen minutes
saw there was no reason for my concern and left
She and Nick look at each other
He looks away and lights a cigarette
There's no smoking in this building
(after a beat) What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking
It is the exact line that Catherine used
long beat
'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him
No
They look at him a beat
Come on -- 'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night 'm going to kill him
'd have to be really dumb to do that
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi
Like writing a book about killing a guy gets you off the hook for killing him
(to Walker) don't understand
What are you talking about
What book
(to Nick) Private joke
don't think it's funny
(grins) Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, 'll say that
- He is by the elevators with Gus and Lt
Andrews
He spots Beth going for the stairway
(to Lt
Andrews) 'll get my stuff tomorrow
Beth
She stops
He catches up to her
They walk down the flights together
They speak quietly
Thank you
She looks at him, smiles
They keep walking down the steps
It's the least  could do
considering  got you into this mess with those reports
(smiles) No
mean it, thank you
She looks at him, smiles
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports
She knows stuff about me that only you know
(after a beat) She must really be something
(she smiles) From a clinical point of view
What was she like in school
hardly knew her
She gave me the creeps, though
don't know why
- They get outside
Beth kisses him quickly, softly on the cheek
Get some rest
Promise
He nods
She starts walking toward her car
Beth
didn't mean what  said
About -- (smiles) Yes you did
'm a big girl can handle it
She goes to her car
- He is cleaning his desk out, putting things into a duffel bag
Only Andrews is in the room
We see Lt
Walker sitting in his glass-enclosed office
He closes the duffel bag, looks at the place a long beat
Andrews is watching him
He goes up to Andrews (after a beat) Take care, you hear
(after a beat) Did you find out about her parents
You're on leave, man
(a beat) You're on psycho leave
'm talking to a possible whacko here
You know 'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find
beat, and Andrews opens the file
The boat blew
There was a leak in the gas line
There were two previous repairs
There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em real heavy investigation
Zilch
Goose-egg
It was an accident
(after a beat) Thanks
He sees Lt
Walker looking at him
He goes into Walker's office
's going to talk to you more about Nilsen
They're handling the investigation, we're not
Stay in touch with Dr
Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation
(after a beat) She killed him
Beth
Now you've got Beth killing people
Catherine Tramell
It's part of her game
First you've got her buying your file
Now you've got her killing Nilsen
Forget her, willya
Go someplace
Sit in the sun
Get away from this goddamn fog
Get her out of your system
You don't but it, do you
She knew nobody would but it
(he smiles) She knew 'd say she did it
And she knew nobody would buy it
Lt
Walker looks at him a long beat
She's screwing with your head, Nick
Pretty soon you're gonna look in the mirror and think you're seeing her
It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes
He gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there
She is sitting on the front stoop
She wears an Indian jacket, jeans and a -shirt
He goes up to her
She looks at him a beat
heard about what happened
What good's a shooter without his gun
She smiles
(a beat) How exactly did you hear
(after a beat) have attorneys
They have friends
have friends
Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends
(after a beat) don't know about that  don't have any money  don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend
(smiles) wasn't talking about real friends
Why doesn't Gus like me
(after a beat) like you
Do you
(smiles) Yeah
Would you like to come up and have a drink
She looks at him a beat
didn't think you'd ask me
He looks at her a beat
(smiles) 'm not that easy to figure
They start walking inside
She walks ahead of him
He watches her
She turns suddenly
You're not easy to figure
'm just very good at figuring
(after a beat) Don't get too cocky
Why not
You can make a mistake
(smiles) Not me
And she turns, heads inside; he follows her
- They walk in
She looks at the bareness of the place
You should put some warmth into it
You don't want it to reflect on your personality
She turns, smiles at him
He looks at the bottle of Jack Daniel's; there's not much left
Jack Daniel's okay
It's gonna have to be
Fine
Ice
(smiles) Please
There is a palpable tension between them
He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick
Let me do that
You like to watch me doing it, don't you
She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick
She takes it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him
He lights a cigarette
Can  have a cigarette, please told you you'd start smoking again
He watches her working on the ice
Light it for me, will you
He does, steps to her
She parts her lips -- he puts it on her lip, watches it
Their eyes are on each other
Thank you
She works on the ice again, opens the cabinets for glasses
What did you pay Nilsen
(doesn't look at him) Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter
She makes the drinks
What if  asked you not to call me Shooter
What if  call you Nicky
(after a beat) My wife used to call me that
(smiles) know, Nicky, but  like it
She hands him his drink, holds hers
Cheers
My friends call me Catherine
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately
You don't have any coke, do you
love coke and Jack Daniel's
(after a beat) There's Pepsi in the fridge
(smiles) It's not the same thing, is it
They look at each other a long beat, their eyes very involved
(quietly) Where's it going
What do you want from me
Their faces are close together
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine
" (after a beat, quietly) What do you want from me, Catherine
beat, and she suddenly turns away
(brightly) brought you something
She goes to her purse, takes a paperback book out of it
We see it -- The First Time, by Catherine Smith
He looks at it
(smiles) Aren't you going to thank me
What's it about
boy kills his parents
They have a plane
He makes it look like an accident
He stares at her
long beat, then -- Why does he do it
To see if he can get away with it
They look at each other a beat
When did you write it
(after a beat) You mean did  write it before my parents died
Yes
No
wrote it years afterwards
He watches her; she has turned away from him -- and then she turns back to him in a different mood
(smiles) You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you
(after a beat) No
Good
'd miss you
(a beat) You can get into trouble, though
You're not really a cop anymore
'll risk it
Why take the risk
To see if  can get away with it
She looks at him; she smiles
How's your new book
'm getting deeper and deeper into my character
They look at each other a long beat
Thanks for the drink
He nods, say nothing as she goes to the door -- 'm leaving the house around midnight
In case you're going to follow me
(a beat) 'm going down to Johnny's club
(after a beat) 'll meet you there
She looks at him a long beat; and she's gone
As she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up
He does a real double-take as he goes by her
(smiles) Hi, Gus
He looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, into Nick's apartment
' Nick stands at the window, watching her outside
long beat, and he looks at Gus
(after a beat) Forgive me for askin', son, and don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass
(after a beat) She want to play
Fine
can play
(after a beat) Everybody that she plays with dies
(after a beat, quietly) know what that's like
'  - It is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here
The  is ear-splitting, pulsing
Lights flash
The floor is huge
At one time, this club was a church
He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for her
He doesn't see her
The he catches a glimpse of Roxy
She is dancing with another woman
He watches her
She is wearing pants and a jacket, her hair off to the side
She looks very masculine tonight
Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts moving through the sea of dancers
He follows her through the press of bodies
She goes towards the men's room
She walks in
' It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy
crowd scene men and women
Roxy presses through them
haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers
She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in
Nick is behind her
As the door opens, he sees Catherine
She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, stiletto heels
Her hair is up
He make-up is severe,  In the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19
hot 19
hot flash-trash 19
She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body- built black guy
She has a vial of something near her face
She sees Nick watching her
She whispers something to the tall black guy
He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile
The door to the stall closes He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in his hand
The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's "Miss You
" He sees her
Her black leather jacket is off
She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels
She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy
He watches her move
watches her body
She turns, sees him, dances, watches him
gets between Roxy and the black guy
they sandwich her with their bodies
keeps moving, turning
eyes on him
playing to him with her body
He watches

His movements are almost trance-like
They look at each other
long beat
Catherine stops dancing
he reaches for her
She moves away
beat their eyes are on each other
She moves a step towards her
beat, as they look at each other
and they start to move together
Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning
the movements tighter, hotter
and he suddenly grabs her and kisses her
as they keep moving
the song seques into the Stones's "Gimme Shelter
" She is melting into him now, kissing him
Tex watches, expressionless
the black guy is gone
he holds her by the back of the neck, kissing her
their bodies pressed into each other
his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into him now, almost holding her up now
and then under her skirt, under her panties
as he kisses her neck
People around them stare
he moves his hands under her top as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back almost arching
cups her breasts now
she keeps moving
the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, it's just a kiss away, a kiss away
" They devour each other
Right there on the floor
Barely able to hold it back
As Tex watches expressionless
As people stop dancing and stare
: It is dark
We can't see clearly
side table, lines of cocaine on a small mirror
player The Stones play "Love In Vain
" There are mirrors all over the walls and ceiling
They are in bed
The bed is big and brass
Atop her
he kisses her neck
his hands under her, raising her
he moves down, kisses her breasts
puts his mouth around  a breast
she arches, moves
he kisses her shoulder
biting into it
she opens her mouth
we hear no cry
we hear the Stones

a white silk scarf is in her hand
she moves higher above him
kneeling over his face
moving oh-so-slightly
his face strains towards her
The scarf in both hands now
she starts to tie his hands with it
his eyes are open, watching her
she ties it loosely, gently
it isn't tight
but his hands are tied to the brass bed
She kisses him
moving her hips lower now
over his chest
lower
And he is inside her
her arms above him
his eyes open
she kisses his neck
bites but not hard
moves
grinding hard against him now
she is on her knees
head arches back
her breasts high
still grinding
Her back arches, strains
he strains toward her
she holds her arms high
she comes out of the arch
shivering
falling over him
the scarf loosens
his arms come forward and hold her close
closer
closer
as she moves with slight
shivery
movements
: - It is dark, quiet
Pindrop quiet
He is sitting on the side of the bed, his head down
his back a line tracing of dried blood
She is asleep nest to him, naked
He looks around the room
The white scarf around the bedpost
the coke on the side-table
clothes all over the floor
He gets up, walks into the bathroom
- The light is too bright
He looks at himself in the mirror
He pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his face
long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes
Roxy is in the mirror behind him
She startles him
He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn
She is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at the club
He lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the towel
She is still looking at him in the mirror the same way
He looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn
(quietly) If you don't leave her alone, 'll kill you
He looks at her a beat, then turns -- Tell me something, Rocki
Man-to- man
(he smiles) think she's the fuck of the century, don't you
For a second, she looks like she's going to spring at him, then controls it and turns to go
How long you been here, Rock
You like to watch, do you
(after a beat, looks at him) She likes me to watch
And she turns and she is gone
- He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room
He is on his back, his eyes open
He has his arm around her
She is asleep
(murmurs) Nicky
He looks at her
- He wakes up
She is not there
He looks around
The white scarf is gone
The coke on the side table is gone
In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach --
" - cold and foggy day
He gets out of his old Porsche, walks down the driveway
He sees her out on the beach by the water
small bonfire is near her
He walks towards her
Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of the house
He doesn't see her
He walks up to Catherine
She has an Indian blanket over her and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose underneath
(expressionless) 'Morning
She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly
She doesn't smile and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either
She walks along the beach
He walks with her
long beat
think Roxy got jealous
She looks at him
He looks like he is trying to hide a smile
(after a beat) She's seen me fuck plenty of other guys
That wipes the hidden smile off his face
He looks at her, walks with her
long beat
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before
She's seen everything before
She looks at him; he's smiling now
She's never seen us before
He's serious
She looks at him
She smiles slowly
Did you think it was so special
told her it was the fuck of the century
He can't hide his smile anymore
She says nothing, keeps walking
(after a beat) What did you think
thought it was a pretty good beginning
They look at each other
They keep walking
long beat
How about Roxy
Is she a fuck to the century, too
(after a beat) Do you want her to join us sometime
He looks at her: she's serious
didn't mean for me --  meant for you
She looks at him
'm not as judgmental about women as  am about men
They keep walking
long beat
How's your shoulder
Fine
How's your back
It hurts
She stops, looks at him
long beat
We're alike, you know
beat, he looks at her -- Are you kidding
You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation
(keeps walking) Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets
don't do those
The keep walking
You mean getting inside you isn't going to get me any deeper into your character
She looks a him
beat
She smiles slowly
Not unless you confuse my character with my body parts
They keep walking
long beat
Were you frightened, Nicky
He looks at her
(after a beat) thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty
told you  had a vivid imagination
They look at each other
long beat
You shouldn't play this game
(after a beat) don't have a choice
Their eyes are into each other
(after a beat) You're in over your head
(after a beat) know
long beat
They look at each other
've got a book to write
'll see you around, Shooter
beat, and she walks away towards the house
He watches her
- Nick walks in
Waylon Jennings is on the
Gus is sitting at the bar wearing jeans, a cowboy shirt, and a cowboy hat
Nick goes, sits next to him
(grins) What is this place
Hillbilly heaven
He glances around
(loud) Where in the fuck you been went over to your place
He is drunk, slurring
Nick sees it
Easy there, partner --  wasn't there
went over last night, too
(grins) wasn't there last night, either
Gus takes a long, drunken look at him
You
fucked her
Goddamn dumb sonofabitch
You fucked her
Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch -- (trying to quiet him) 'm not gonna get , pop --don't worry about it
always use a rubber
(loud) don't give a
flyin'
chili- bean
fart about
(grins; quietly) You oughta use a rubber, pop
You really should
(loud) What in the hell for
You think 'm gettin' any at my age
don't like blue-haired women
don't like 'em
(straight) You don't like punk rockers
(loud) Say what
- Gus is eating chili, drinking coffee
Hick keeps pouring him more coffee
(grins) You feeling better
(loud) feel fine
Nick pours him more coffee; Gus guzzles it
(loud) How could you fuck her
It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes him, pours him more coffee
He drinks it
(quietly) You wanna die, son
What is it -- those goddamn tourists -- you still feel so bad about that you're wigglin' your way into an icepi -- (suddenly louder) We got too many goddamn tourists comin' here anyway -- plenty more goddamn tourists where they goddamn came from
Some people here really give him the looks now
Gus looks angrily away from them, drinks more coffee
(after a beat; quietly) 'm not afraid of her
(loud) Why the hell not
don't know
'm just not
(loud) That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger
He winks at her
The woman looks away from him, shaking her head
(smiles; to Nick) It ain't your brain
They look at each other a long beat
Gus drinks more coffee
He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes
long beat
(quietly) done did a track on Lt
Martin for Dickhead Nilsen
They found a safety deposit box with fifty- thousand dollars in it, taken out three months ago, used that one time
He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely
She looks away
(after a long beat) It doesn't make sense
She didn't know me three months ago
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him
Maybe the money was for somethin' else
How the fuck do  know
'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle
Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, he's completely preoccupied
- Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner
- He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage Cadillac
You all right, pop
You want me to drive you
In that little pissant car of yours
Hell, no
ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- 'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch
Come on, 'll drive you in this thing
You think 'd let you drive my Cadillac car
ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car
And he steps on the gas and  out of there, forcing Nick to get out of the way
Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes his head
- Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street
He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, parked behind the country and western bar
The car suddenly speeds up --  down on him from the back, full bore
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood
barely avoiding the car
He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out It is a black Ferrari
He  it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction the Ferrari turned
The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping them, looking almost out of control, its  screaming
He sees the Ferrari turn ahead
When he gets to where it turned, he turns wildly
The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in North Beach, its  screaming -- the Porsche is gaining ground behind it, making turns
The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a road going up a hillside
He yanks the wheel hard
The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the air, almost out of control
As it crests the steps and gets to the street
Nick  it and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into blackness
But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street
Another set of steps leading up he  it, it rockets up, , bucking -- And lands on the next street
Nick makes a wild right turn onto the street
And the black Ferrari appears from around a curve to the right, heading right for him
Nick steps on the  and heads head-on for the Ferrari
The Ferrari  head-on for him
And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls down the hillside
The Ferrari has landed right-side up
He runs down the hillside and gets to it
beat, and he opens the car door
Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open
Her neck is broken
She is dead
- Police lights have been set up
He stands there with Lt
Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men
Tell me again
want to hear you say it again
(after a beat; sheepish) It was an accident
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way -- don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you
(quietly) Don't fuck with me, Nick
don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling
He and Nick look at each other a long beat
Andrews comes up to them with a piece of paper in his hand
Full name, Roxanne Hardy
Last address -- Cloverdale, California
No priors, no convictions
The car is registered to Catherine Tramell
Lt
Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him
Nick looks calmly away
You knew her, didn't you
Gus and  talked to her at Tramell's house
All we did was write her name down
(after a beat) told you to stay away from Tramell
(after a beat; smiles) Yeah
But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car
Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief
want you in Dr
Gardner's office at nine o'clock
You're out of control, Curran
(to the
Man) Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time
They stare at him
He watches as Roxy's body is taken away
- He walks in
He looks good, in control
Beth Gardner is sitting there with two middle-aged , both of them wearing suits, who smile and scrutinize him the instant he walks in the door
Hello, Nick
This is Dr
Myron and
McElwaine
They've been asked to consult with me on this evaluation
They shake hands with him
Sit down, Nick
Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- stand there
He sits down, looks at them
beat, as they look at him, then -- (courtly) Nick -- when you recollect your childhood, are your recollections pleasing to you
Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief
(calmly, directly) Number one  don't remember how often  used to jack off, but it was a lot
Number two  didn't get pissed off at my dad -- even after  was old enough to know what he and mom were doing in the bedroom
Number three  don't look in the toilet before  flush it
Number four  don't wet the bed and haven't for some time
Number five You can go fuck yourselves because 'm out of here
He is walking away quickly
Beth is with him, trying to keep up
She is very angry
What is your problem
'm trying to help you
Why won't you let me help you
don't need any help
Yes you do
Something's on with you
(a beat) You're sleeping with her, aren't you
beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking
What is this interest you've got in her
My interest is in you, not in her
She seduces people, she manipulates -- thought you hardly know her
know the type
'm a psychologist
He stops, looks at her
(after a beat) That means you manipulate people too, doesn't it, Beth
You're a practicing psychologist -- that means you're better at it than she is
She looks at him a long beat
(quietly) feel sorry for you, Nick
beat, and she turns and walks away
- Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house
He is driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and twisting road
- Nick enters and shuts door
Looking around, he does not see her
Catherine
(after a beat) Catherine
Finally he sees her sitting by the window
He walks over to her
(near tears) should have known
came into the house when you were down on the beach
She looked at me so strangely
She left right after you
(a beat) shouldn't have let her watch us
She wanted to watch me all the time
She tried to kill you, didn't she
(a beat) Did you like her to watch
(a long beat) Do you think  told her to kill You
(softly, with intensity) No
(after a beat, near tears) Everybody that  care about dies
She is about to break into uncontrolable sobbing
Nick puts his arms around her
(soothing) It's
It's
(quietly, almost begging) Make love to me
- They are seen rolling and turning around on each other
Their love making is sensual, sincere
Later in bed
(calmly, but seriously) Do you think she killed Johnny Boz
(surprised, startled) For what
to set me up
She loved me she wouldn't frame me
(a beat) Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too
(after a beat) No, she didn't
she never got jealous before
she got excited
(a beat) don't have luck with women
There was this girl  met while was in college
slept with her once
She started following me around, taking my picture
She dyed her hair, copied my clothes
Lisa something
Oberman
It was awful
long beat, he looks at her
thought you didn't do adolescent secrets
(after a beat) never have before
- It is a bright, sunshiny day
He is out there looking at the water
She comes up behind him, hugs him
(full of life) Isn't it just beautiful
love it here like this
He looks at her
(cold) We're still playing games, aren't we
She looks hurt
No
(cold) No
No more games, Nick
'm tired of playing games
They have their eyes on each other
Then tell me about Nilsen
She turns away from him
He watches her
You won't believe me
Try me
beat, she looks at him
paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file
(after a beat) When
About three months before  met you
Why
She turns away from him
'd read about your shootings in the papers
decided to write a book about a detective
wanted to know my character
You paid $50,000 for your character
would've paid more
wanted to know everything about you
Then you came down here after Johnny got killed
it gave me a chance to get to know my character better
(after a long beat) What about the other night
What about last night
Was that to get to know your character
(after a beat) Maybe 'm losing interest in my book
Their eyes are on each other
Do you believe me
(after a beat) don't know
'll convince you
And she kisses him slowly, with more and more heat, on the lips
The cordless phone on the deck table goes off
It keeps She breaks finally from the kiss, picks it up
Hello
She listens a beat, then hands him the phone
It's Gus-who-doesn't-like-me
He takes the phone
Catherine says you don't like her
- (on the phone) She's right
You got an icepick in you yet
- Catherine sees him smile
What did he say
He asked if  had an icepick in me yet
(smiles) Funny
- (on the phone) You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends
don't believe it
- Why not
(smiles) You're my friend, Gus
She watches him
- (seriously) 'm gonna make you believe in it, friend
- In : We see a large, glossy photograph of Roxy
She looks about thirteen
She has braces in her teeth
Nick is looking at the photo -- it is in a file in his hands
He sits there with Gus in front of a woman juvenile officer
He turns the file and we see a glossy of a little boy in a pool of blood
Nick looks up at the woman
(after a beat) How old was she when this happened
Fourteen
We seal juvenile records until they're deceased
That's why you didn't find it in your computer
What was the motive
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse
(she shrugs) The razor just happened to be there
They stare at her
That's what she said
- It is a small, old, rural buildinga lot of Four- type stuff on the walls
don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop
Ain't that hard, son
This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em
Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present
She used Daddy's razor
They are going to their cars, parked side by side
The Porsche looks pretty badly banged up
It sure makes you wonder what they talked about when they set themselves down in front of the campfire at night
You ever met any of her friends who hasn't killed somebody
Nick looks at him
It musta beat your ordinary everyday girl talk
Nick get into his car, sits there a beat
'm not sure anymore she did it
(after a beat) Which one you talkin' about now, son
We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain
Nick looks at him
'  - young woman is checking a computer
Nick is with her
Anderson
Jack
Donald
'm sorry
No Lisa
Did you check all four years
Yes  did
(in disbelief) Can you check again
She gives him a look, but punches it in again
No Lisa Anderson, detective
(after a beat) Can there be some mistake
(straining patience) Only if you're making it
He looks at her
'    - He gets out of the Porsche, starts to go in
He looks disturbed Catherine comes out of the house with Hazel Dobkins, the old woman we saw with her in Mill Valley
Nick watches them a beat, then goes up to them
Hazel , this is Nick
told you all about him
This is Hazel Dobkins
(smiles) You're the Shooter, aren't you
How are you
He looks at her a long beat
Fine
Thank you
He looks at her sort of warily
( to Catherine) Can  talk to you a minute
(to Hazel) Honey, why don't you go in the car
'll be right there
The old woman starts going to the Ferrari
(brightly) Goodbye, Shooter
Nick looks at Hazel a beat, then at Catherine
You like to hang out with murderers or what
Did you know Roxy -- Of course  knew
He looks at her a long beat
(casually) Look
Sometimes when  do my research,  get involved with people
It happened with you, too
She smiles
He looks at her, doesn't know what to say
Killing isn't like smoking
You can quit
He looks at her What did she say
(preoccupied) 've go to go
promised to get her home by six o'clock
She just loves "America's Most Wanted
" America's Most Wanted
She turns to go
There was no Lisa Anderson at Berkeley when you were there
She stops, looks at him a beat
What were you doing, checking up on me
What for
He says nothing
long beat, she looks hurt
(after a beat) Henderson
And she's gone
- He is on the phone
Henderson
Lisa Henderson
With an
He waits
You do
- He sits in front of a computer screen with Andrews
can get my butt kicked for this
You're not supposed to be in here
It's not gonna take long, Sam
We see the computer screen
The screen says We wait and then we see the words 1983  -- , 147  , ,
Nick stares at the screen
Bring it up, will you, Sam
beat, and then we see the license itself It is Beth Gardner on the photo
Nick stares
Hey, that's Dr
Gardner, isn't it
Bring 1976 up
beat, and the license comes up
We see a young Beth Gardner on the photo
She has blonde hair
Nick stares
'  - She walks in
The apartment is dark
You shouldn't leave your door open
She is startled
(after a beat) didn't
Something's wrong with my lock
beat, she looks at him
(cold) What do you want, Nick
(quietly) Tell me about Catherine
She looks at him a long beat, then turns away -- She told you, didn't she
(after a beat) What did she tell me, Beth
(after a long beat) slept with her once in school
(a beat) was just a kid
was experimenting
It was just that one time
(a beat) She developed a
fixation
on me
She styled her hair like mine
She wore the same kind of clothes did
It scared me
She looks at him, sees his look
Isn't that what she told you
He looks at her a long beat
She told me it was you
You wore the same kind of clothes
You dyed your hair blonde
long beat as they look at each other
did dye my hair
It didn't have anything to do with her
was a redhead for a while, too
(after a beat) Did you know Noah Goldstein
had him in two classes
You saw all the reports, Beth
Phil had you copied
You never said anything
(after a beat) What do  say -- Hey, listen, guys, 'm not gay, but  did fuck your suspect
(she turns away) was embarrassed
It's the only time 've been with a woman
She turns to him
She's really sick you know
Don't you know what she's doing
She knows  went to Berkeley
She knows  knew Noah
She makes up that story about me
She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her
She didn't hand you to me
She doesn't even know who you are
She told me about Lisa Henderson
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is
You're a good cop -- what did she do
Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant
(she smiles) Did she tell you in bed, Nick
That's how 'd do it
Nick looks at her a long beat
Why did you change your name
got married
(a beat) He was on staff at the clinic was down in Salinas
It didn't
last long
He gets up
He looks at her a long beat
Nick -- Do you really think
that  could kill someone never even met Johnny Boz
What about Nilsen
What possible motive would  have to kill him
He turns to go
You should do something about this lock
She's evil
She's brilliant
Be careful, Nick
He looks at her
- He gets out of his Porsche
He walks toward the door
- He starts going up the dark stairway
There is a hand on his neck
He spins
(smiles) Do  scare you, Nick
He looks at her, doesn't say anything
(smiles) just thought 'd surprise you
(a beat) What's the matter
(after a beat) found Lisa Henderson
Did you
What's she doing
He looks at her, doesn't say anything
You're not going to tell me what she's doing
(a beat) thought we weren't playing games anymore
(after a beat) did, too
(a beat) She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did
Catherine looks at him a beat, then smiles
And you believed her
even went down to the campus  police and made out a report about her
He just looks at her
You still think  kill people, don't you
(after a beat) No
Liar
And she's gone
-  - He stands with an old
He is going through files
Who'd you say you were with
Homicide
San Francisco
He stops at a file, opens it
Don't you guys communicate over there
You must be the same way we are
Nick doesn't get it
There was a report about Lisa Henderson -- January, 1977 -- the file's not here
What do you mean it's not here
San Francisco
Detective Nilsen
Internal Affairs
You know him
Tell him we want it back
He's had it a whole year
Nick says nothing
- He and Gus sit there -- they look tired, upset
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what
You don't know what the hell was in it
Catherine told me what was in it
If she's telling  you the truth
Don't you get it, Gus
If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley
It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened
He was
He probably asked her about it
Gus thinks about it
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake
She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does
(irate) Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes
(a beat) There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened
know what happened
Catherine told me what happened
(after a beat, quietly) You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got
You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after
Oh, man
-    - He has his key out to open his door
He hears  inside
beat, and he opens the door
It is dark
We hear a Rolling Stones
He sees Catherine standing by a window, watching him
She wears black jeans and the black motorcycle jacket
They look at each other a long beat
How'd you get in here
decided to give you one more chance
(a beat) missed you
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me
Did you miss me
No
Come over here and tell me no
He walks up close to her
No
She unzips her motorcycle jacket slowly
She wears nothing underneath it
That's below the belt
She reaches for him
Not yet it isn't
She pulls him close
But we're getting there
- They sit in the window seat, naked
His back is against the wall
She sits against him
He has his legs around her
They don't look at each other
She is smoking

'm very good at research
'll help you
No thanks
What are you researching
'm writing a book
(smiles) Really
What are you writing about

He falls for the wrong girl
(smiles) What happens to them
(after a beat) They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after
(after a beat) It won't sell
Why not
(after a beat) Somebody has to die
Why
Somebody always does
- He walks in; it is a small valley hospital
He goes up to the desk
There are two women there
Hi, 'm looking for a Dr
Gardner
(after a beat) We don't have a Dr
Gardner on staff here
Dr
Joseph Gardner
(after a beat) Yeah
He died -- about five or six years ago

'  - Nick sits with a sheriff's
He was walking home from work
They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic
Somebody drove by and shot him
What was the weapon
38 revolver
Never recovered
Were there ever any suspects
No suspects, no motive
Unsolved
(after a beat) Was his wife ever a suspect
(after a beat) had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question
What's this about anyway
Routine
Yeah, he said it was routine too
Now it's two guys saying it's routine
Do you remember his name
(after a long beat) Nope, can't say that  do
Nilsen
That's him
long beat, then -- Was she ever a suspect
Nope
(a beat) There was some talk; it never panned
What kind of talk
The usual -- a girlfriend
He had a girlfriend
Nope
She did
(a beat) Like  say
It never panned
(after a beat, gets up) Thanks
hope  helped you out
(after a beat) You did
- He walks around the house; he sees her sitting out on the deck, a portable word-processor in front of her
She is smoking
He goes up to her
(smiles) Hi
missed you
finished my research
He moves toward her
She moves away, kills her cigarette
finished my book
How did it end
(after a beat) told you
She kills him
They look at each other a long beat
(quietly) Goodbye, Nick
He stares at her

(a beat) Didn't you hear me
* (a beat) Your character's dead
(a beat) Goodbye
He stares at her
He can't believe what she is saying
What do you want, Nick
Flowers
'll send you some flowers
(after a beat) What is this -- some kind of
Joke
(a beat; he almost smiles) Are we playing games again
(after a beat) The games are over
You were right
It was the fuck of the century, Shooter
He stares at her
Catherine
Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there
Catherine still has her eyes on him
Right there
beat, and then she turns to go inside
Hazel Dobkins smiles slowly at him
- He sits in his Porsche, staring ahead
He is parked next to Gus' Cadillac
Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car
(excited) Catherine Tramell's roommate her freshman year
got a call from her
've been calling people who were in her dorm all day
She must've heard  was trying to talk to her
She says she knows all about Catherine and Lisa Henderson
She's over in Oakland
You wanna come with me
Nick just stares ahead
You look like you seen a ghost, son
Nick looks at him
'  - Gus drives
(excited) Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an office on Van Ness
Guess who he shares office space with
Dr
Elizabeth Gardner
Nick doesn't even respond
Gus looks at him
What in hell's the matter with you
Nick doesn't say anything, stares ahead
-  - Gus gets out with Nick
It is an old building
Where the hell you goin'
(after a beat) 'm going with you
She said alone -- suite 405
It ain't gonna take long
beat, and Nick gets back in the car
- Gus is on the first floor
There is no one around
He hits the elevator button
beat, and it comes
He steps in
- He hits the button for the fourth floor
The elevator rises a floor, stops
The door opens
There is no one there
Then it starts going up again
It rises to the third floor
It stops
The door opens
There is no one there
Then it starts to rise again
'  - Nick sits there, staring ahead
(suddenly, screaming) Gus
As it goes up
It stops
The door starts to open
As it does -- a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the elevator
It happens very fast
We see blonde hair around the face
But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, the hood up
There is an icepick in the figure's hand
The figure explodes into Gus
The icepick goes into his neck
Nick tears desperately up the stairway -- he hits the fourth floor door
It explodes open
He stands there a beat, sees the elevator door open
He runs there,  He sees Gus, crumpled into the corner of the elevator
He goes into the elevator -- holds Gus
He is dead
long beat
He sees the gun in Gus' hand -- he takes the gun out of his hand
He runs out of the elevator
He hears something
Gun in hand, he runs towards the
He stops, gun in hand, listens again
He runs again, hears nothing
Behind him, we see a figure
He spins suddenly, gun, in hand
Beth Gardner is there
She wears a windbreaker
She has her hands in the pockets
What are you doing here
(screaming) Put your hands up
She stares at him
(screams) Put your fucking hands up
Don't move
got a message on my machine to meet Gus here
Where is he
She smiles a strange smile
She takes a step toward him
(screams) Don't
(a beat) know about your husband
You still like girls, Beth
What
She smiles strangely again, takes a step toward him
(screams) Take your hands out of your pockets
She moves a hand in a pocket and moves towards him fast -- What is wrong with you
And he  the gun
She is hit in the chest, goes down
long beat, and then he goes to her
He gets down on the ground
Her eyes are open
He empties the pockets of the windbreaker -- first one, then the other the pockets are empty
(in a whisper) loved you
And she dies
- lot of policemen, coroner's guys, photos being taken
Nick stands there with Lt
Walker, Harrigan, and some of the Internal Affairs guys
(upset) What made you think she had a gun
Nick says nothing; he looks like a zombie
What the hell was she doing here
What was Gus doing here
Andrews yells to them from the stairway door
Lieutenant
very carefully handles a hooded rain coat in a stair landing
He wears gloves
Nick is there with Lt
Walker
The Forensics Man picks the raincoat up -- a long blonde wig falls out of it
There are flecks of blood on it
He reaches into the pocket and pulls out an  icepick
It has a thin steel handle and is bloody
He hands the icepick to an assistant
He looks at the raincoat
It has blood on it
It's departmental issue
(quietly) Jesus
'  - Nick with Lt
Walker
Nick looks like a zombie
Andrews comes up to them
He has a gun in his hands
Thirty-eight caliber revolver
Bottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom
Have  ballistics check it for Nilsen
Harrigan comes out
Lieutenant, you'd better come in here
Lt
Walker goes into the kitchen
Nick follows him
There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet
drawer is open
Walker looks -- we look with him
We see a copy of Love hurts, Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine
Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy
He hands the photos to Nick
Nick stares at them
guess that's it
- Nick sits, his feet up
He looks like a zombie
With him are Lt
Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott
We see other plainclothesmen in the b
g
-- a flurry of activity, people on phones
long beat
She must've heard you on the stairway and dumped the stuff
Nick says nothing, stares off
comes over to them
There was no suite 405 in that building
Catherine Tramell's roommate in her freshman year is dead
She died of leukemia two years ago
An    comes over to them
Our files on Dr
Gardner show nothing about a police report in Berkeley -- nothing related to Salinas, either
long beat -- the phone
Andrews picks it up, listens
Thanks
He hangs up
Ballistics says the
38 we found in her apartment matches Nilsen
No registration
They're checking with Salinas
The icepick is the same brand and model as the Boz weapon
long beat -- Nick just stares
Harrigan comes up to them
We checked the tape machines at Dr
Gardner's apartment and at her office -- both here and the one on Van Ness
No message from Gus on any of 'em
The one at her apartment was broken
(a beat) Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he thinks he remembers Dr
Gardner and Boz meeting at a Christmas party at his house a year ago
long beat
(after a long beat, sadly) You just can't tell about people, can you
Even the ones you think you know inside-out
He and Nick look at each other a beat
Congratulations, Curran
Nick looks at him, expressionless
- He parks his car
It is dark
Foggy
He starts heading inside
- He goes in
He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps
He opens his door with his key
He walks in
The apartment is dark
(behind him) Hi
It is a whisper, almost a hiss
He spins, fast
Catherine stands there, pressing herself against a wall
They look at each other a long beat
She looks like she is almost in a trance
heard about it
on
He looks at her, expressionless
long beat, their eyes are into each other
She looks like she is almost shivering
can't allow myself to care about you --  can't allow myself to care --  can't --  can't -- She looks very emotional
He moves towards her, puts his arms around her, holds her very close
(in a whisper) don't want to do this -- please -- don't want to do this --  lose everybody --  don't want to lose you --  don't want to -- He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her
- It is dark; we can't see clearly
Atop her
he makes love to her
gently
tenderly
hardly moving inside her
there are tears in her eyes
: - Atop him
she is on her knees, straddling him
he is on his back, his eyes are closed
her head arches back
her breasts high
he strains toward her with his body
she holds her arms high
her right hand is in a fist
(we only see the back of her hand and arm)
it comes down suddenly
he bucks
writhes
then her whole body falls on top of him
very long beat
We can't see him
her body completely covers him
And then finally he moves
turns her to the side
kisses her
: - The Stones play "Sympathy For The Devil"  in the b
g
; the is low
They lie next to each other on the bed
The  faces them
He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, smoking a cigarette
She is curled away from him toward the right side of the bed
long beat, then -- What do we do now, Nick
(after a long beat) We fuck like minks
We raise rugrats
We live happily ever after
We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over
He stares at the ceiling
hate rugrats
(after a long beat) We fuck like minks
We forget the rugrats
We live happily ever after
We see from an  to the left side of the bed now Her face is expressionless
Her right arm dangles over the right side of the bed
Her right hand is clenched
Is she holding something in it against her arm
We see them from an  to the left side of the bed now: He turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette
We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the
beat, and he turns towards her
They look at each other
long beat as the  gets louder
We see them in
We don't see her right arm
(in a whisper) love you
beat, and he kisses her
The    from them slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we -- long beat, as the  keeps playing
and we
: We see them from the right side of the bedroom
And then the as they kiss with more and more passion
It keeps going
There is something under the bed
The towards it as "   " plays louder
We see it now in  as the bed rustles above
It is a thin, steel-handled icepick
