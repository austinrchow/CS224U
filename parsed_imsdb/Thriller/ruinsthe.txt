Written by Scott Smith : -   - The hotel is six stories high, a wall of glass and stucco
Beach chairs are arrayed around the pool's edge; sunbathers lie sprawled across them
short boardwalk leads toward the Gulf of Mexico: the white sand, the blue water
Four young Americans are encamped near the pool's edge; they're all in their early twenties
lies face down on a chaise, eyes shut, a cooler beside her
She's petite, with short blond hair, her skin pinkly sunburned
sits in the chair beside her, studying the Cliff Notes for The Canterbury Tales
He's leanly muscular, with dark curly hair
Other Cliff Notes lie scattered beneath his chair: Antigone,  Separate Peace, Hea rt of Darkness, 1984
and  sit on the far side of the cooler; they're playing gin
Stacy, too, is petite, with short hair, though hers,
is dark
She's wearing a pale blue bikini, and has a beer bottle in her hand
She looks a little bored
Jeff is tall, scrawny
Like Eric, he has a pair of swim trunks on, and is deeply tanned
He's very focused, frowning down at his cards
We should play War
It's more fun
Jeff takes a card from his hand, lays it down on the table
That's not even a game
Sure it is
'll teach you
She starts-to fold her hand,'but Jeff shakes his head
know how to play
mean it's just chance--there's no skill involved
Stacy frowns down at her hand, silenced
She picks a card from the deck, immediately discards it
Jeff snatches it up, lays down one of his own
Stacy stares at it in dismay
But  keep losing
2
'Cause you're not concentrating
wouldn't have to concentrate if we played War
Exactly
So where's the fun
'd win sometimes
It's not fun if we both can't win
But it's not winning if it's just chance
Of course it is
If we flipped a coin, and  called heads, and it-- Fuck
;this
shit
Eric throws the Canterbury Tales to the ground
Then he rises, steps to the cooler, pulls out a beer, carries it back to his chair
Stacy watches as he takes a long swallow
Maybe you should just be honest, sweetie
Eric doesn't even glance at her
He sips his beer again
(cont'd) You could say: look,  don't know anything about these either, so now we're gonna read them together and sort of teach each other as we go
(turning to Jeff) Wouldn't you have loved that
To have a teacher who-- Amy speaks without opening her eyes, cutting Stacy off: Why would they hire you if you haven't read the books
said  had
3
So maybe you should
(appalled by the idea) The Canterbury Tales
You ever look at that shit
've read it
Fuck off
It's not even English
Jeff watches Stacy take another card; she examines it, sets it on the discard pile
Then, : This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo, and we been pilgrymes, passing to and fro
Deeth is an ende of every worldly soore
Eric and Stacy stare at Jeff in astonishment
Amy doesn't react
Jeff glances toward her
(cont'd) Sunscreen, Amy
'm fine
've got a base
You're burning
can see it
She finally opens her eyes, lifts her head, peers at her shoulders
She presses at the pink skin
'm just flushed
It's too hot
Stacy leans forward, picks a second card off the deck
Jeff is focused on Amy; he doesn't notice
You're hot because you're burning
It's only been-- Stacy interrupts, speaking in a slightly  fashion: 4
So there was this king, who lived in a castle
Amy turns, gives her a pained look
Please don't
But what he really wanted was a beach house
Stop it
Both of you
Right now
They ignore her, ping-ponging quickly back and forth: So he decided to move
But the Queen didn't want to
So he left by himself
But he got lonely
Amy covers her ears with her hands, blocking out their voices, but then inmiediately reaches to feel for her earrings: one of them is missing
Shit
So he bought a dog
But it had fleas
lost my earring
So he gave it a bath
But the dog caught
cold
Amy sits up, glancing about
Stacy and Eric keep going: 5
So he gave it some medicine
But it was the wrong kind
So the dog died
Amy rises, steps toward the pool
Jeff lays down his cards, joins her beside the water
They both peer into it
-  - young man is approaching down the boardwalk from the beach, carrying fins, a mask, a snorkel
He's in his early twenties: blond, crew-cut, very tall
His name is
As he nears the pool, he stops, staring
'  - Eric and Stacy have risen to join Jeff and Amy; they're all peering into the water
Amy holds her remaining earring out to Eric and Stacy, showing them what it looks like
- He stands there, hesitating
Then he starts forward
'  -    -  - We glide just above the pool's pale blue bottom
silver earring comes into view
Mathias's hand reaches for it
-  - The two couples have spread out around the pool's edge, searching for the earring
Mathias surfaces in front of Amy
He holds out his hand, with the earring-in it; she stares, startled, then crouches to take it
Thank you so much
Mathias nods
He starts to turn, as if to swim off, but Jeff stops him: 6
Wait
want a beer
He waves toward their chairs, the cooler beside them
-  - Mathias and the two couples sit together, with their beers
Amy's skin has turned deep red; Stacy is behind her, applying lotion to her shoulders
Eric is talking to Mathias: We went sailing yesterday
Out toward Cozumel
And there were these seven foot fish, these huge-- Nurse sharks
(he nods) Like thirty of them
whole, you know, flock
School
The water was,  don't know, ten feet deep
And they were lying on the bottom, just waiting for somebody to come swimming by-- They're not dangerous
Eric turns, stares at Jeff
You said they're sharks
But they're not dangerous
They eat lobsters
Sea urchins
That sort of thing
Eric considers this, frowning
Then he takes a sip of beer
He shrugs, turns back toward Mathias
wouldn't be snorkeling on my own
' That's all 'm saying
7
When Mathias speaks, it's with a   : wasn't on my own
was with my brother
Jeff glances around the pool
He's here
Mathias shakes his head
He met a girl
They went away
To
It's a complicated story
They watch him, waiting for more, but nothing comes
Finally: You should hang with us, then
If you're on your own
(he glances at the others) Right
Everyone nods, smiling
Eric reaches into the cooler, pulls out another beer, holds it toward Mathias
- There's a , a dozen beer kegs
few young men and women are dancing beside a bonfire, but most of the crowd is scattered in small groups across the sand, , drinking, the firelight flickering off their faces
Stacy, Amy, Eric, Jeff and Mathias are sitting together; they all have cups of beer
Stacy is between Eric's legs, leaning against his chest
Amy, Jeff and Mathias sit cross-legged
Everyone but Jeff and Mathias is a little drunk, and you can hear it in their voices
Amy drains her cup, stands up, very unsteadily
She holds out her hand to Jeff
Dance
Eric smiles, as if the idea of Jeff dancing were absurd
8
Jeff doesn't dance, Amy--he has no rhythm
Of all his many gifts, rhythm is not one
That's not true
He played the trombone in high school
He won a prize
Eric seems startled by this, amused
Seriously
Amy nods
She drains her beer, tosses the cup aside
Jeff's won prizes for everything
His Mom has a whole room built just for them
Trophies and ribbons and plaques
He's a very accomplished young man
(she holds out her hand-to ) You
(he shakes his head) don't dance on sand
Stacy makes a  sound
Or grass
Or cement
Or carpet
dance on teak
Teak
It's a type of wood
Very rare
Find me a teak floor and 'll be a dancing fool
Amy shifts toward Mathias, holds out her hand
He stares at it, then glances at Jeff
Before he can speak, Stacy pushes herself to her feet; she's almost as wobbly as Amy
'll dance
9
They lurch off across the sand toward the bonfire
The boys watch them go
beat, then Jeff glances at his watch
'm gonna head back
Eric gives him a look of disappointment, You're kidding
Jeff seems  by this: What
How long is med school
Four years
Jeff nods
(cont'd) And then you got, whaddya call it, residency
Another nod
Eric turns toward Mathias
(cont'd) He's gonna be grinding away all that time
Sleepless
Fucking miserable
And know what
He's gonna look back on this night, us right here, and he's gonna say to himself, shit,  wish 'd-- Gone to bed earlier
Eric stares at him; this wasn't the direction he was heading
(cont'd) If 'm gonna be so short on sleep, should get as
much as  can now, don't you think
He stands up, brushes the sand from his shorts
Eric shrugs, lifts his cup toward him
All work and no play-- 10
Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
With that, Jeff nods good night to them, then starts off toward the hotel
Eric and Mathias turn back toward the bonfire
They sit in silence, watching the girls dance
After a moment, Amy staggers away from the other dancers, toward a group of young men, drinking together in the shadows
She reaches down, pulls one of them to his feet, starts to drag him back toward the bonfire
The young man is tall, with long blond hair
He , tries to free himself, but Amy is insistent; she keeps pulling at him, and finally he surrenders
They begin to dance
Stacy is dancing on her own, eyes shut, oblivious
Mathias glances toward Eric
Eric shrugs
Amy drifts sometimes, when she drinks
Drifts
Like a boat--she bumps into other boats
They continue to watch
Amy and her partner's dancing is becoming steadily more intimate, the gap between their bodies narrowing, then disappearing altogether
Finally, Eric pushes himself to his feet
' (cont'd) Come on
Let's save everyone some grief
He starts
forward, followed by Mathias
They join Stacy and Amy, and Eric subtly interrupts Amy's pas de deux
The blond- haired young man disengages, drifts back toward his friends
- It's quiet, the sun just breaking the horizon; the beach is nearly empty
handful of hotel employees are tidying up after the bonfire: carrying off the empty kegs, raking clean the rubbish-strewn sand
Gulls hover overhead,
11
Jeff appears, running along the beach, his -shirt soaked with sweat
He stops as he nears us, stands for a moment just above the line of surf, catching his breath, watching the sun rise
Then he turns, starts toward the hotel
-  - breakfast buffet: trays of pancakes, eggs, fresh fruit
There are a dozen tables beneath brightly colored umbrellas
Mathias is the only diner at this hour; he's dressed in jeans and a -shirt
He studies a piece of paper as he eats
(
) You're up early
Mathias lifts his head: Jeff is standing there in his sweaty shirt, smiling down at him
have to catch a bus
To
Mathias slides the sheet of paper toward him
Jeff bends to look
There's a paragraph in German scrawled above a hand- drawn map, with four place names: Cancun, Valladolid, Tizimin, Coba
large  has been drawn to the west of Coba
The girl my brother met was on her way to this place, to work
(he waves at the map) It's a dig--an archaeological dig
And he went with her
He left the map, saying  could come, too, if got bored on my own
beat; he watches Jeff examine the map
Then: (cont'd) Our flight leaves the day after tomorrow
can wait and hope he returns in time
Or  can go get him
It's a question of trusting him to do the right thing
And you don't
12
Henrich doesn't think things through
He runs at them
He's
(he searches, shakes his ) There's a word in English, but can't remember it
impetuous
(he nods) So  have to be-- Responsible
All our lives, the same story
Jeff
slides the map back toward him
It's what
One of those pyramids
(he shakes his head) An old mining camp
De oro
0 plata
Mathias just stares at him
(cont'd) You don't speak Spanish
Mathias shakes his head
(cont'd) So how will you find this place
(he smiles, shrugs) Follow the m ap
Jeff frowns down at the map for a long beat
It seems as if he's going to question the feasibility of this, but
then he disengages instead, wiping at the sweat on his face
Well, good luck
13
Mathias nods his thanks, and Jeff turns, starts away from the table
with him, across the terrace, into the: - It's completely empty at this hour, and eerily silent
Chairs are stacked on the tables
As Jeff enters, a waiter moves past ham, carrying a pitcher of orange juice
Jeff stops, turns to watch through the window beside the door
'  - The waiter refills Mathias's glass
Mathias smiles, nods
Jeff hesitates, wavering
Then he pushes open the door again, steps outside
We watch-- --as he approaches Mathias
There's the sound of someone ,
This carries over into: -   '  - rack with towels on it, a sink, a tub
Amy is crouched over the toilet, in underwear and a -shirt,
Her skin is bright red
Jeff is standing in the tub, freshly showered, drying himself, watching
her
His running clothes hang from a hook beside the door
You okay
Amy doesn't answer
She , spits
(cont'd) You don't have to come, you know
'm fine
You don't look fine
Thank you
That's very helpful
14
She pushes herself to her feet, flushes the toilet, steps to the sink, squeezes some toothpaste onto a toothbrush
We'll be back by nightfall
You can just-- Amy is raising the brush to her mouth, but she stops, gives Jeff a look in the mirror
You don't want me to come
That's not what 'm saying
So what're you saying
You're hungover, under slept, -- 'm not sunburned
Jeff stares at her, the deep red of her face
Then he shrugs, steps out of the tub, the towel around his waist
All right
My mistake
Amy bends over the sink, starts to brush her teeth
-   '  - king-sized bed, a bureau, two night tables, a mini-fridge
Jeff emerges from-the bathroom, steps toward the bureau, starts to dress: boxers, jeans, -shirt
beat, then Amy shuffles out of the bathroom
She sits on the edge of the bed, starts to pull on a pair of shorts
Pants
Amy stops, the shorts around her ankles
'll get too sweaty
15
Jeff pulls a pair of khakis from the bureau, tosses them onto the bed beside her
There's gonna be mosquitoes
He picks up a knapsack, steps to the mini-fridge, opens its door
Amy stares down at the khakis for a beat, then drops back onto the bed
She lies there, looking up at the ceiling, her shorts still caught around her ankles
We don't even know this guy
Jeff slides two bottles of iced tea into the knapsack
There's a plastic shopping bag beside the fridge, and he starts to dig through it
And
just don't see why we have to go with him
If you and  were traveling together, somewhere you didn't speak the language, and 'd vanished somehow, wouldn't you want someone to help find me
Why would you vanish
Jeff turns, looks at her: this isn't the point
Aren't you getting bored
Honestly
The beach, the pool, the beach, the pool
This'll be fun
An adventure
Jeff pulls two protein bars from the bag, a box of raisins, a plastic bag full of grapes; he drops them into the knapsack
(cont'd) You said you wanted to go;hiking, didn't you
See the ruins
Amy is silent, unmoving, clearly not swayed
16
(cont'd) Stay here, then
Seriously
There's no-- Why do you keep saying that
-- It's like you'd rather  didn't-- at the door, and she falls silent
Jeff rises, zipping shut the knapsack
He steps to the door, opens it
Stacy and Eric are in the hall
Ready
The both answer at the same time: Amy's having second thoughts
Jeff doesn't want me to go
Stacy and Eric are silent; neither wants to get involved in this
beat, then Jeff , glances at his watch
Now or never, Any
We're gonna miss the bus
Amy gives a loud , sits up, reaches for her khakis
- Only half the seats are occupied: tourists with their packs and cameras-and hats
Little TVs hang from the ceiling
We  slowly down the aisle, passing Jeff and Amy first
Amy is sound asleep, a camera hanging from her neck, a Panama hat in her lap
Jeff is beside her, bent low over a tour book, comparing its much more detailed map with the one Mathias's brother left behind
Next come Eric and Stacy, hunched together in their seats, watching a Mexican soap opera on the little  above them
Stacy mimics the actors' exaggerated gestures,
Eric has the Cliff Notes for Hamlet in his lap, unopened
Finally, there's Mathias
The seat beside him is empty
He's staring out the window, his expression perfectly blank
17
- The town is very small: a dirt road lined with one- and two- story buildings, some with thatched roofs
There's a gravel turnaround, with a bus idling in it
Its door  open
dozen tourists emerge from the bus, blinking in the sunlight
Jeff, Amy, Stacy, Eric, and Mathias are among them
The boys have the knapsacks; the girls are wearing matching hats
Amy rubs at her face, stretching, waking up
- There's a souvenir stand at the town's entrance, with brightly colored blankets hanging from its walls
The tourists start toward it, leaving Jeff and the others beside
the idling bus
They peer about, getting their bearings
Now what
Mathias has his brother's note
He holds it out, pointing, and they gather around him to look
We take a cab
To here
the map: there's a line drawn from Cancun to Coba, where another, shorter line moves westward
Mathias's finger moves along this shorter line, toward the  on the map
How far
Eighteen kilometers
How many miles is that
They all glance at Jeff
He shrugs
Eleven
little more
Then there'll be a path
Which we hike--four kilometers
The others look to Jeff again
He slings his pack
Two and a half miles
18
The tourists are vanishing into the town
The bus's door shut
don't see any cabs
The bus eases into motion,  across the gravel, pulling out onto the road
Behind it, a yellow pickup truck is revealed
"" is hand-painted in black on its side
They start toward the truck
Its  is Mayan: short and heavy-set, with thick glasses
His eyes are shut; he's dozing behind the wheel
The truck's engine
is running, the windows shut tight against the heat
Jeff  the window, and there's a burst of movement from the truck's rear, as a dog springs up,  and
They all leap back, the girls
The dog is a mutt--small, but muscular
He's attached to a cinder block by a short chain, which he throws himself against, slobbering, snapping at the air
They all stare at the dog; the girls  nervously, clutching each other
The driver has roused himself; he leans forward, rolls down his window, stares out at them
Hola
The man gives him a somber nod; the dog keeps
Jeff takes the map from Mathias, then steps warily forward
(cont'd) Habla ingles usted
The man half-nods, half-shrugs
(cont'd) How much to drive us to here
He offers the map to the driver, who reaches to take it
The man frowns at it
Then, in   : Why you go this place
Jeff struggles for a simple way to explain their mission
in the back of the truck, the dog continues its frantic
There are these ruins
This old mining camp
() 19
(cont'd) (he points toward Mathias) And his brother--- Fifteen dollar,  take you ruins
To here
Jeff points at the map
The driver shakes his head
This place no good
He holds the map back out toward Jeff
Jeff takes it, gives the man a puzzled look
No good
No good you go
Fifteen dollar take you good place
You like, promise
Jeff glances toward the others, as if for help
They all just stand there, watching
The dog won't stop
(cont'd) take you pyramid
Huy grande
Everyone happy
He smiles at Jeff; his teeth are large and thick-looking,
and black along the gums
Jeff pulls out his wallet
He removes a ten and a five, then points at the map
How about we pay you fifteen dollars to go here
He holds the money out
The man doesn't even look at it
tell you no good
Still you go
His smile has disappeared; he seems angry suddenly, as if Jeff has somehow insulted him
Jeff hesitates, glancing toward the others again
Then, in a  : We're looking for his brother
(he points toward Mathias) Su hermano
20
The driver wrenches the door open, making Jeff and the others flinch
He climbs out, still with that angry expression on his face, then leans into the back of the truck, grabs the dog's chain, unhooks it from the cinder block
He lifts the dog from the truck by the chain
Even dangling by its neck, the mutt continues to  and snap at Jeff and the others
They back away, and the man tosses the dog into the truck's cab, pushing the door shut
The dog throws its body against the window, slobbering and
The man turns toward Jeff, wiping his hands on his pants
Jeff tries again: (cont'd) 'm sure your ruins are better than these
It's just that we-- The driver cuts him off, holding out his hand, with that same air of enraged disgust
El dinero
Jeff gives him the money
Then the driver  the side of the truck, gestures for them to climb into the back
-    - Below us, the yellow truck travels along a single-lane road
Jeff and the others are in its rear
There are fields on either side of the road, bordered by thick jungle
The truck reaches a fork in the road, bears left, angling toward the wall of jungle, into which it vanishes, the overhanging foliage blocking it from sight
-    - The road is dirt, heavily rutted
There's a small clearing beside it, with a path opening off it
The trees grow over the path, forming a shady tunnel
birds calling, a steady throb of insect life, but otherwise all is silent
beat, then there's the sound of the  approaching, along with the dog's  and
The pickup appears, moving slowly, bouncing and swaying across the ruts
The truck pulls into the little clearing, stops
Jeff and the others clamber out over its tailgate
21
The dog is still lunging at them from behind the truck's rear window
Jeff gives the driver a wave
Gracias, senor
The driver doesn't even look at him; he just pulls out onto the road, heading back in the direction from which they came
There are mosquitoes; Stacy starts to slap at herself
Jeff unslings his pack, pulls out a can of insect repellent
(cont'd) Here
He begins to spray her, then Eric
Amy is peering off after the truck
They can still hear the dog's , but very faintly now
Jeff finishes with Eric, starts in on Mathias
How do we get back
She points back down the road, toward the vanished truck
Jeff pauses in his spraying, considers for a moment
Then: The guidebook said you can always flag down a passing bus
So -- There aren't going to be any buses on that road
Jeff nods; this seems obvious
He resumes spraying Mathias
Eric and Stacy stand there, watching
(cont'd) bus couldn't even fit
It also said you can hitch-- See any cars pass, Jeff
Jeff doesn't answer
He steps toward her, starts to spray her, too
She holds out her arms
(cont'd) The whole time we were driving, you see even one
Eric has his phone
Can't we just call someone
22
He's not gonna get a signal
Not way out here
They all turn to watch as Eric reaches into
his pack, pulls out his cell phone, flips it open
He stares at it for a beat, then shakes his head, snaps it shut
Jeff finishes spraying Amy, starts in on himself
They must-have a way to get supplies in
Who
The archaeologists
They must have a truck
Or access to a truck
When we find Mathias's brother, we can just ask them to take us all back to Coba
(turning to Mathias) Right
Mathias seems startled by the question
guess
mean, -- He shrugs; he has no idea
Amy is still focused on Jeff: We're stranded, aren't we
That's, like, a twenty mile walk we're gonna have to do
Through the jungle
Eleven
What
Jeff finishes with the insect repellent, crouches to slide the can back into his pack
It's eleven miles
There's no way that was eleven miles
23
Jeff rises, slings his pack
He gives Amy a tired look
Let's just find this place, okay
Then we can figure out how to get back
Amy is silent
Jeff turns to the others
(cont'd) Ready
Mathias and Eric nod, and the boys start down the path
Amy stands there, watching them go
Stacy steps toward her
' Just go with it, honey
You'll see--it'll all work out
She hooks arms with her, pulls her into motion
-  - They hike in single file: first Jeff, then Eric, Mathias, Stacy, and Amy
The path is six feet wide, hard-packed dirt
All around and above is the jungle: big-leafed plants, vines and creepers, immense trees
The path moves in snakelike curves; we can't see-very far in either direction
They're all sweating, their shirts clinging to their bodies
The bugs continue to harass them
So-there was this girl who bought a piano
Amy gives a loud
But she didn't know how to play
So she signed up for lessons
But she couldn't afford them
Stacy reaches, taps Mathias's shoulder
You can play, too
If you want
24
Mathias glances back at her
(cont'd) It's easy
Someone says So, then you say But
It's like catch, only without a ball
(to Eric) So she got a job in a factory
But was fired for being late
Amy takes off her hat, wipes the sweat from her face
It's annoying
So she became a prostitute
It's tedious and boring
And once they start, it's impossible to get them to stop
But she fell in love with her first client
Amy puts her hat back on
She looks hot, sweaty, tired
How much farther
Mathias peers down at his brother's note
Stacy and Eric continue with their game
We cross a stream
Then So she asked him to marry there'll be a path, branching her
off to our left
If we see a village, we've gone too far
(cont'd) village
But he was already married
Mayan village
So she begged him to get a divorce
(cont'd) Will they have air But he was in love with his conditioning
wife
25
Mathias shrugs, returns the note to his pocket
It just says there's a So she decided to kill her
village
(cont'd) think we should go see it
Me, too
think we should--- Jeff stops suddenly, pointing
The stream
Thirty feet in front of them, the trail dips toward a small stream, studded with boulders
It resumes on the far bank, rising gradually uphill in a long straightaway
The stream is slow moving, the water dark brown
Eric  the air
Fucking smells
They must use it as a latrine
Who
The village
The Mayans
They start toward it, gingerly, the girls covering their noses
Jeff crosses the stream, hopping from boulder to boulder, and the others follow
Stacy almost falls in; she only catches her balance at the final instant,
Jeff is already starting up the trail, searching for the turnoff
There's no sign of it; the dense foliage extends unbroken as far as the eye can see
He turns to Mathias
(cont'd) How far past the stream
Right after, it says
26
They stand there in a loose group, staring at the trees
Eric pulls a bottle of water from his pack, takes a swallow, then passes it to Stacy
Amy lifts her arm, points
Look
Up the trail, sixty feet away, stand two small Mayan boys; they seem to have materialized out of the air
They're ten years old, shirtless, scrawny, dark-haired
one of them is holding a bicycle by its handlebars; it doesn't have a seat
(cont'd) Maybe they can guide us
Stacy smiles toward the boys; she waves,  : The boys just stand there, staring at them, silent, their expressions wary, even frightened
One of them leans to whisper something to the other, who nods
Why don't we-- He stops, noticing Mathias
The German is staring toward the edge of the trail, where a large bush sits
one of its fronds is very slowly dropping toward them, pulling itself free of the soil
Mathias steps forward, tugs at a second frond, which slips easily from the dirt
He tosses it aside, reaches for another frond: this, too, slips free
Someone has pushed them into the earth, arranging them to look like a bush
Mathias pulls a fourth frond free, then a fifth, and an opening is revealed in the brush, a narrow path winding its way off through the trees
They stand there a beat, staring at it
Then there's a  , and they all turn
'  - one of the boys is hurriedly pedaling off, bent low over the bicycle's handlebars
His companion remains behind, staring toward us with a look of obvious anxiety
Amy turns to Jeff; so do the others
27
Why was it covered
Jeff lifts his hands: how should he know
Maybe it's not the right path
one speaks
They keep staring from the boy to the newly revealed path, trying to make sense of it
can still the squeaking of the bicycle, growing steadily fainter
It's on the map
It's a hand-drawn map, Jeff
And it was hidden
Why would it be hidden
Jeff steps forward, shields his eyes, tries to peer into the dimness of the narrow path
Then he glances back toward the little boy, who continues to stand there, watching them
Maybe the archaeologists don't want people to find the mine
Because
Jeff has to think
Finally: Maybe they've dug up something valuable
Emeralds or something
Or silver
Whatever they were mining in the first place
And they don't want anyone to come rob them
So they've asked the Mayans to help keep people away
He falls into silence, staring at the boy
No one appears very convinced by his theory, not even Jeff
He shrugs
(cont'd) How much farther is it
Mathias takes the map from his pocket again, glances at it
28
Not far
Be silly to stop now, don't you think
No one answers; no one moves
This just feels weird, Jeff
Jeff , fighting to suppress his impatience with her
So we what
Turn around
Walk all the way back to Coba
Silence
They all turn to stare back down the trail, then toward the Mayan boy, who's still watching them
Stacy a mosquito, leaving a bloody smear on her bare arm
Jeff lifts his hand, gestures at the path
leading into the trees
(cont'd) Come on
We're almost there
The others glance at one another, waiting for someone to argue; no one does
Finally, Mathias steps forward, slipping through the narrow opening
Eric follows him, and then, with just the slightest hesitation, so do Amy and Stacy
Jeff throws one last glance toward the boy--who's still standing there, sixty feet away, watching with his anxious expression--and then he, too, vanishes into the trees
-  - They make their way along the winding path, one after another, all of them sweating, slapping at the mosquitoes
Maybe the ruins are sacred
You know
And they don't want people digging them up
He glances about, off into the trees, a little spooked
(cont'd) We could be walking through some sort of ancient graveyard right now
And they've-- 29
It's a mine
An old mining camp
So
There's nothing sacred about it
Eric considers this as they walk
The others are also quiet: too hot to speak
The sunlight falls through the trees in thin, shifting columns, hazed with mosquitoes
Maybe it leads to a marijuana field, then
Maybe the village is growing pot, and that boy rode off to get them, and they're gonna come with guns and-- Eric
What
Shut up, okay
Eric falls silent
They follow the path as it curves first right, then left, moving gradually uphill all the while, and suddenly there's sunlight in front of them, bright and intense: a clearing
They hesitate at its edge, staring
/    - The clearing is twenty yards wide, and extends in either direction as far as the eye can see, finally curving out of sight
Its soil is a deep black, flecked with white, like frost rime
It's completely free of vegetation
The path resumes on the far side of the clearing, winding its way up asmall hill
The hill is rocky, oddly treeless, and covered with a vinelike growth--a vivid green, with hand- shaped leaves and tiny red flowers
Jeff and the others step warily out onto the cleared ground, peering about, squinting in the sudden sunlight
They stare up at the flower-covered-hill
30
There are hints of ruins among the thick foliage: giant boulders with faint carvings etched onto their surfaces, the crumbling remains of a fallen pillar, everything half-buried beneath the vine
It's beautiful
So beautiful
And the mosquitoes are gone
You realize that
They've stopped biting
She smiles at the others, delighted by this development
Amy removes the cap from her camera, starts to take pictures
'  - a click as she takes each photo, and the image freezes for an instant
There's the hillside, covered in its vine, its red flowers: There's Eric pulling the water bottle from his pack: There's Stacy smiling at us, waving:
There's Mathias shading his eyes, peering up the hill
(
} Smile, Mathias
Is that a tent
He points
Amy lowers her camera, turns to look
'  - An orange square of fabric is just visible, at the very top of the hill, billowing, sail-like, in the breeze
From this distance, with the rise of the hill partly blocking the view, its hard to tell what it is
31
They all stand there, peering up the hill
Faintly, but growing steadily louder, a  noise comes from the jungle
The five of them turn, heads cocked, listening
horse
It's true:  are approaching at a gallop
Instinctively, Jeff and the others back a handful of steps toward the hill
long
beat, then a horseman bursts into the clearing, rearing to a halt
Amy lifts her camera
'  - bald Mayan man is on the horse; he's broad-shouldered, short, in his early forties, dressed in a white shirt and pants
The horse rears a second time, and the image for an instant, with a , as Amy snaps another picture
The bald man  at them in
His horse is lathered, , rolling its eyes
It rears yet again, and the man half-falls, half-jumps to-the ground
Jeff and the others back a few more steps into the clearing
'  - The bald man is still holding the reins; the horse is backing away from him, jerking its head, trying to break free, pulling him, step-by-step, back toward the trail
The man can't gain control of the horse
Finally, he drops the reins, and the horse gallops into the jungle, through the trees, its hoofbeats gradually diminishing
The man turns toward them, starts  in  again, pointing back down the trail
Sweat shines on his forehead
There's a gun on his belt, a black pistol in a brown holster
Stacy is clutching Eric's arm, looking frightened
What's he saying
32
Maybe he wants money
toll or something
The Mayan continues , waving his arm
Jeff reaches into his pocket, pulls out his wallet, removes a twenty
Dinero
The man ignores the proffered bill, makes a shooing motion, waving them from the clearing
Mathias turns toward the hill, cups his hands around his mouth, : There's no response, just the orange fabric gently billowing
Why don't you hike up, see if you can find him
We'll try to sort this out
Mathias nods, starts across the clearing
The bald man at him in Mayan, and then, when Mathias doesn't stop, pulls his pistol from its holster,  into the sky
Everyone flinches, half-ducking
Stacy
Mathias goes still
The man waves at him,  in Mayan, and Mathias comes back, his hands raised, to join the others
are approaching from the jungle again
They come closer and closer, and suddenly two more horsemen burst into the clearing
They're younger than the bald mans in their twenties, dark-haired, muscular
One has a mustache
Their mounts are white-eyed, , rearing, just like the bald man's
The two men jump to the ground, dropping their reins, and the horses immediately turn and gallop back into the jungle
Amy lifts her camera again
'  - The young men have bows slung across their chest, and quivers of thin, fragile-looking arrows
They question the bald man in , very rapidly
He's still aiming his pistol at Mathias
, and the image freezes for an instant
33
As they continue to interrogate the bald man in , the young men unsling their bows, each of them nocking an arrow
Reflexively, Jeff and the others retreat another handful of steps into the clearing
Mathias still has his hands raised
What the fuck
Quiet
'-- Wait
Wait and see
Amy is a bit farther into the clearing than Jeff and the others
She keeps swinging her camera from them to the Mayans, trying to capture the whole scene in one shot
She's too close, though,-and she retreats another handful of steps
'  - Still backing up toward the hill; all of them but Stacy and Eric are in the frame now
The bald Mayan is still answering the young men's questions
He turns toward us suddenly, points his pistol directly at us,
starts to
Jeff and the others turn, too, staring at Amy in surprise
She's nearly at the far edge of the clearing, peering through her camera; she retreats another step
The young Mayans raise their bows, drawing them; the bald man keeps
-- She takes another step; she's right up against the vines
'  - Stacy is in the frame now
We retreat one more step, and so is Eric, and the Mayans with their raised weapons, the bald man still : everything  on the
34
Amy lowers her camera
The Mayan with the mustache turns to the other two, points toward her feet,
The bald Mayan slowly lowers his pistol, looking dismayed
Amy glances down
'  - She's stepped out of the clearing, into the flowering vine
Both of the younger Mayans are speaking now, their voices The bald Mayan is shaking his head, protesting, but they talk right over him
Amy steps clear of the vine, starts back toward Jeff, and the younger Mayans draw their bows taut again, aiming at her chest
She freezes
--- Jeff lifts his hand, without looking, his eyes on the Mayans
Don't move
The bald man continues to frown and shake his head
He points to Amy, then the others; he waves toward the jungle
But the young men are implacable--they keep arguing, gesturing--and finally the bald man gives in, falls
beat, then the bald man raises his pistol, aims it at Jeff's chest
He makes a shooing motion with his other hand, but now it's toward Amy, and the hill beyond her
He begins to ; the other men do, too
Then the bald man a bullet into the dirt at Jeff's feet
Everyone jumps, starts to retreat
The men with the bows are swinging them back and forth, herding them toward the hill
When Jeff and the others reach Amy, the bald man points toward the trail, waves them up it
He watches--his expression looking stricken, close to tears--as the five of them obediently begin to climb the vine-covered hill
- Midway up the hill, they pause to catch their breath
35
Check your phone, Eric
Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, stares at it
Nothing
He snaps it shut
They stand there: sweating, scared looking
Mathias cups his hands to his mouth again, : Henrich They all peer up the hill, waiting for a response
'  -- It is a tent: bright orange, looking a bit worse for wear
The vine is growing up its aluminum poles as if on a trellis
The tent faces away from us; its doorway is hidden
There's no sign or sound of any people
Eric turns, glances back down the hill, shielding his eyes
There's another one
He points toward the clearing below them
' fourth man has arrived, on a bicycle
He's dressed in white, like the others, with a straw hat on his head beat, then two more Mayans appear, also on bicycles
They all have bows slung over their shoulders
The bald man addresses these newcomers
He waves in either direction, and the other men start off along the clearing, two one way, three the other, leaving him alone at the base of the hill
beat, then a little boy appears from the jungle--the one who'd watched them discover the camouflaged path
He and the bald man stand there, peering up at us
36
Eric turns to the others, : Let's run back down
Quick
While there's just him and the kid
We can rush them
He's got a gun, Eric
This silences Eric--silences all of them
Mathias turns, toward the tent again
Henrich
1 There's no answer
They wait another beat, then Jeff waves them back into motion
- The hill is flat on top, forming a wide plateau
Beyond the orange tent is a small clearing of rocky ground
blue tent sits on the far side of the clearing, looking just as weathered as the orange one, the vine growing up its poles
The five of them pause, peering about
Jeff  : Hello
The vine covers everything but the trail and the clearing
We glimpse more rubble beneath its greenery: time- worn stelae, a low stone wall
In some places the vine folds back upon itself, forming waist- high mounds, tangled knoll-like profusions of green
And everywhere, hanging off it, are those bright red flowers
Mathias moves toward the orange tent, and Jeff follows him
They  its flap, stoop to peer inside
'  - - The vine has taken root in here, too, growing on some things, leaving others untouched
There are three sleeping bags unrolled on the floor
An oil lamp
Two backpacks
roll of duct tape
bottle of tequila
metal canteen
37
Jeff and Mathias  the flap back shut
Eric, Stacy and Amy are fifteen feet away, watching
What's inside
Nothing
Some camping supplies
Mathias starts across the clearing toward the blue tent, followed by Jeff and the others
He  its flap, sticks his head inside
Jeff leans to look, too
'  - The same thing: sleeping bags, backpacks, camping supplies
The vine is growing on some things, but not on
others
Ten yards beyond the tent, there's a hole cut into the dirt
Stacy, Amy, and Eric have gathered at its edge; Jeff and Mathias join them
The hole is rectangular--ten feet by six feet--and very deep; we can't see its bottom
windlass has been constructed beside the hole, a horizontal barrel with a hand crank welded to its base
Rope is coiled around the barrel
From there, it passes over a small wheel, which hangs from a sawhorse straddling the hole's mouth
Then it drops straight into the earth
The mine
Jeff nods
draft is rising from the hole, and it lifts off Amy's hat
She tries to catch it, but fumbles: the hat falls away from her
They all watch it vanish into the dark
Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, almost absentmindedly: a nervous gesture
There's still no signal
He closes it, turns to survey the clearing, the empty tents
Now what
Jeff shrugs, waves past the shaft
The clearing ends just a few yards from them; 38
then the vines resume, and in the midst of the vines is the path
It winds its way to the edge of the hilltop, vanishes over it
Keep going,  guess
Saying this, he slings his pack onto his shoulder
Then he starts forward, the others falling in behind him
- They pick their way down the trail
It's much steeper on this side; there are short stretches where they have to drop onto their rear ends and slide, one after another
It's after one of these that Jeff suddenly stops, staring
'  - It looks as if the jungle has been chopped down all the way around the base of the hill, isolating it in a ring of barren soil
One of the Mayans has made his way along this cleared ground to the base of the trail
He's staring up at them
(
) Fuck
The man slides his bow off his shoulder, nocks an arrow
He shakes his head at them,   in , waves them away
The five of them stand there, staring down at the man
What do we do
Jeff shrugs, starts forward again
We'll see
The others hesitate, and then, one after another, resume their downward march
- As they approach the clearing, the Mayan man  what sounds like someone's name
39
beat, then another bowman comes jogging into view
Jeff and the others stop at the bottom of the trail
They stand there, staring
The vine has invaded the clearing here
Ten feet in front of the path is one of those odd, knoll-like growths, knee-high, thick with flowers
The two Mayans are another twenty feet beyond it, in the center of the clearing, bows drawn
So
Her skin is slick with sweat, and she's winded from the hike down
third Mayan comes jogging toward them
He stops beside the other two, draws his bow
We should rush them
All at once
Shut Up, Eric
Or go make shields
If we had some shields, we could-- He falls silent as another Mayan comes running toward them
along the clearing
This one is bearded, heavier than the others
And he's carrying a rifle
Oh my god
Jeff is staring at the little isolated island of vines, ten feet in front of them--peering intently at it
Let's go back up
Jeff takes a step forward into the clearing--slowly, warily
(cont'd) wanna go back
Jeff takes another step, edging toward the mound, his eyes on the Mayans, their raised weapons
They just watch him
-- He ignores her, takes a third step, then a forth, which brings him to the mound of vines
He crouches, reaches into the tendrils, parting them
He grasps a stalk, tugs, pulls it free
a tennis shoe, a sock, a man's shin
40
Jeff turns, stares at Mathias, who steps forward, crouches beside him, starts to pull at the vines, gently at first, then more aggressively, tearing them, the plant's sap shining on his skin, a low  rising from his chest
Another shoe is revealed, another leg, a pair of jeans, a belt buckle, a black -shirt
And then, finally: a young man's face, the flesh oddly eaten away, so that his cheekbone is visible, the white socket of his left eye
(cont'd) Oh, no
Oh, Jesus
Jeff holds up his hand, silencing her
The Mayans stand there, in the center of the clearing, watching
Mathias has begun to rock slightly, that  coming and going
Jeff touches his shoulder, : Easy
All right
Easy and slow
We'll stand up and we'll walk away
We'll walk back up the hill
The young man's -shirt is stiff with dried blood
There are
three slender arrows impaled in his chest
It's my brother
know
They killed him
Jeff nods, his hand still on Mathias's
shoulder; he squeezes
Shh
Not here
Up the hill, okay
Mathias is struggling to control his breathing; the keep coming
Finally, he manages a nod, and they both stand up
Stacy and Amy are holding hands, looking stricken
Stacy has started to
Eric has his arm around her
The Mayans keep their weapons raised
They watch in silence as Jeff and the others turn to start back up the hill
- Jeff and Mathias are at the top of the trail, staring down toward the clearing
41
'  - More Mayans are appearing from the jungle
They're all armed
The bald man sends them out along the clearing, some in one direction, some 'the other
Jeff and Mathias stand there, grim-faced, watching
Mathias lifts his hands, stares at them
They've turned a deep, raw- meat red, as if scarred
He flexes his fingers, wincing
-   - Amy, Stacy, and Eric sit in the clearing, beside the shaft, passing a bottle of water among themselves
Eric is struggling to calm the girls: We can sneak past once the sun
-' sets,  bet
You know
Just reep by them in the dark
Stacy and Amy hardly seem to hear him; they look dazed, distraught
Eric passes the bottle to Stacy
beat, then: (cont'd) And then there's the girl
The girl
The one his brother met
What happened to her
Amy and Stacy are silent
Stacy lifts the water bottle to her lips, but immediately lowers it, and starts to  again
Amy takes her hand
Eric watches them, silent
Then: (cont'd) And the archaeologists
You think-- Stacy's crying deepens toward a
Amy gives Eric a look
Stop it, Eric
What
42
Just stop, okay
Stop talking
Stacy struggles to collect herself, breathing deep
She wipes at her face
Amy keeps stroking her hand
Jeff and Mathias are approaching across the hilltop
Mathias holding his burned-looking hands out in front of him
He 9 a nd Jeff crouch beside the others
What happened
Jeff takes the bottle from Stacy
He pours a tiny bit of water on Mathias's hands
There's something in the plants
The sap--it burned his skin
Mathias rubs at his hands with his shirt, grimacing
Amy reaches to take the water back from Jeff
She starts to lift the bottle to her mouth, but
Teff leans forward, grabs it
(cont'd) Don't
We need to save it
But 'm thirsty
We all are
So let's drink
Jeff shakes his head, capping the bottle
We don't have that much
We need to ration it
(he glances up at the sky) We'll have to figure out a way to catch the rain
Everyone but Amy peers up at the sky: it's a perfect, cloudless blue
Amy remains focused on Jeff
'm hungover
'm sunburned lost my hat
need some water
43
-- Why do you get to decide
Jeff stares at her, considering this
Then he shrugs
Fine
Let's vote
(he glances at the others) But first you should understand that each of us is gonna need half a gallon of water a day, at a minimum, to survive here
That's two and a half gallons total, every day
And right now, until it rains, we don't have it
Okay
Not even one day's worth
(a beat) Now who wants to give Amy more water
long moment of silence
No one can meet Amy's eyes
Finally,  : Maybe we should just wait, honey
Till
Everyone looks toward Jeff
Another hour or so
Then we'll all have a sip
Okay
Amy can see that she has no choice
She gives a grudging nod, and Jeff slides the bottle into his knapsack
(cont'd) We have to get organized
Now
While we're still fresh
We'll have to stay out of the sun, spend as much time as possible in the tents
We'll have to-- Can't we sneak away when it gets dark
Eric said we-- 44
Jeff shakes his head, cutting her off
He waves across the hilltop, toward where he and Mathias had been standing
They keep coming
More and more of them
They're all armed, and the bald one sends them out along the clearing
They're surrounding us
Amy, Stacy and Eric struggle to absorb this
Finally: Why don't they just kill us
It's got something to do with the hill,  think
Once you step on it, you're not allowed off
Something like that
They won't step on it themselves, but now that we're here, they won't let us leave
So we have to figure out a way to survive till someone comes and finds-us
Who
Jeff lifts one hand, palm-up, half a shrug
People'll start to worry when we don't return home
Right
And '-- We're not supposed to leave till Friday
Jeff nods
(cont'd) And they'll have to come searching
Again, he nods
(cont'd) So you're talking--what, a week
Something like that
Amy looks appalled; her voice : 45
We can't live here for a week, Jeff
If we try to leave, they'll shoot us
That's the one thing we know for certain
An electronic  comes from the shaft: it sounds like a cell phone ringing
Mathias turns his head, listening
No one else notices it
But what will we eat
How will we-- The  comes again, silencing her
She glances toward the shaft, not quite believing what she's hearing
It comes a  , and they all stand up, step to the hole, peer into its darkness
The  comes yet again
cell phone
It can't be-- That's a cell phone, Amy
Definitely
But there's no signal out here
Eric can't get a signal
Reflexively, Eric pulls out his phone, checks again: nothing
There's another
It could be a different network
Something local
Way down in that hole
How could it pick it up
Still another
What else can it be
46
The  falls
They all stand there, staring into the hole
long beat, then it
Eric  his hands, ecstatic
The others are starting to smile, too
Mathias moves to the windlass
He unrolls some of the rope, starts to wrap it around his chest
Jeff watches him
Another
The vine has taken root on the windlass:- the sawhorse, the barrel, the rope
Jeff steps forward, begins to yank it off, careful not to get the sap on his hands
He turns to Amy
There's a lamp in the orange tent
See if you can find some matches, too
Amy hurries off toward the orange tent, vanishing inside
There's a final , and then  again
Mathias is knotting the rope tightly around his chest
Amy returns, carrying an oil lamp, a box of matches
Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light the lamp
Then he rises, turns toward Mathias, looks at him closely
(cont'd) You sure
Mathias nods, takes the lamp, steps to the edge of the hole
Jeff and Eric move to the windlass; they position themselves at the hand crank, leaning into it, so the rope goes taut
Mathias girds himself, steps out over the hole
He dangles there for a moment, hanging beneath the sawhorse, the windlass  on its mount
Then Jeff and Eric begin to reverse the crank, letting the rope slowly spool out
Stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft, peering into it, watching as Mathias begins his descent--ten feet, twenty feet, thirty feet down, and still only darkness beneath him, with no sign of the shaft's bottom
The windlass  as it turns; Jeff and Eric strain against it, sweating, muscles taut
Amy has turned from the shaft, is watching: the rope as it slowly unspools from the barrel
Jeff
He turns to look, and she points at the rope, where it comes off the windlass and angles up toward the little wheel hanging from the sawhorse
47
(cont'd) The sap
They'd cleared off most of the vine from the rope, but not all of it
Some of these remaining tendrils have been crushed as the windlass slowly unspools
Their sap is darkening the rope in spots, eating into it
(cont'd) think it's-- Jeff immediately turns back to the crank, his voice : Pull him up
Eric hasn't grasped what's happening
He hesitates
(cont'd) Amy jumps forward to help, all three of them pushing at the crank, getting in each other's way, the windlass  as it begins to turn again, slowly reclaiming the rope
Stacy remains beside the shaft, peering anxiously into it
'  - Mathias is twenty-five feet beneath us, just beginning to bump his way upward, swaying back and forth
He stares up at us, : What is it
The rope beneath the sawhorse is being visibly eaten away, its hemp unraveling
Stacy turns toward the others, pointing, terrified
'-- The rope
Jeff, Eric and Amy fall forward, the windlass spinning wildly behind them, free'of its weight long beat, then there's a distant, hollow-sounding , followed instantly by the  of the lamp shattering
Stacy leans to peer into the shaft, her hand over her mouth
48
'  - Darkness
Silence
(
) Mathias
Her voice  back at us
There's no response
Jeff, Eric, and Amy join Stacy at the edge of the shaft, all of them staring down into the darkness, looking horrified
Oh, Jesus
Oh, fuck
Is he-- There's a  from below, very faint, almost inaudible
He's moaning
They listen for a beat, but there's only silence
(cont'd) heard him moan
The others don't seem so certain; Jeff turns to the girls
(cont'd) One of you will have to go
Go
Jeff nods, waving into the shaft
Down
We'll clear the vine off the rope
And you can-- Why can't you
Or Eric
We have to work the crank
You won't be strong enough
49
Amy and Stacy stare at each other; it's obvious neither of them wants to go
Stacy is the one who finally gives in
can do it
() You sure
Stacy nods, but she doesn't look sure
She's hugging herself; it seems as if she might start trembling
Before anyone can speak, that  comes from the shaft again, louder this time, unmistakable
Jeff cups his hands, : Mathias
More
Jeff turns to the girls
(cont'd) See if you can find a knife
And another lamp
' He waves them toward the tents; then he and Eric begin to unspool the rope from the windlass, laying it out across the clearing in long, looping circles
/    - The Mayans keep coming: women now, too, bearing bundles on their backs
They're setting up a campsite along the edge of the jungle
The bald man stands in their midst, his hands on his hips, staring silently up the hillside
- The  of a match being lit: Amy's hand comes into frame, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, fires the wick
(0
) Just help him into the sling
Then we'll pull him up
The chimney is carefully replaced, as     : -   - Amy is crouched, adjusting the lamp's flame
Jeff and Eric have mended the rope
50
the excised lengths of spoiled hemp, and the ragged- looking knots on the rope itself, which has been spooled once more around the windlass
They've fashioned a sling at the rope's end
Jeff and Eric are helping Stacy into it, pulling it over her head, adjusting it under her armpits
Once we get him out, we'll drop the rope back down and pull you up, too
Amy offers Stacy the lamp
Stacy is scared, yet struggling not to show it
Her hands are trembling, and the lamp rattles as she takes it
The boys are stepping toward the windlass; Eric stops, glances back at her
You okay
Stacy nods, but without much conviction
Eric steps toward her, gives her a tight hug
He holds her eyes for a moment, kisses her
Then he joins Jeff at the hand crank
They lean against it, and the rope goes taut
Stacy steps out into the open air over the shaft, the lamp in her right hand
With her left hand, she lunges, grabs at the sawhorse, clings tightly to it
Jeff glances toward her from the hand crank
Ready
She nods, but doesn't relinquish her grip on the sawhorse
(cont'd) You have to let go, Stacy
For a moment, it doesn't seem like she'll be able to, but then--with a visible act of will--she does, and they slowly
begin to let the rope out, dropping her into the shaft
- She grips the sling with one hand, the lamp with the other
Wooden supports have been hammered into the walls of the shaft, buttressing the dirt
The vine clings to them, its leaves and flowers paler than on the hillside above
Stacy begins to swing, pendulum-like, as she descends
She tries unsuccessfully to steady herself, then glances up
51
'  - We're steadily dropping: thirty feet down, then forty
Amy is at the edge of the shaft, peering in at us
She waves
Stacy smiles up at her
She starts to wave back, but is too scared to let go of the sling
She glances down
'  - The light is swaying back and forth with Stacy, and it causes the shadows beneath us to jump and lurch
There's still no sign of the bottom; the windlass continues to
beat, and then, very faintly, Mathias's dim shape starts to emerge: his white tennis shoes, his pale blue -shirt
The lamp picks up bits of broken glass around his body
Stacy lifts the lamp, peering downward, struggling to see more clearly, and the sling suddenly jerks to a halt, making her
She looks up
'  - The  has stopped
We're swinging slowly back and forth
Amy peering down toward us: a long way up, almost seventy feet
beat, then Jeff appears, too
Stacy
His voice has an  to it
- Her face is slick with sweat; it shines-in the lamp light
What
(
)
It's the end of the rope
52
'm not at the bottom
(
) Can you see him
Stacy looks down again, holding up the lamp, peering toward Mathias's motionless body
She lifts her head
little
(
) Is he conscious
can't tell
don't think so
(
) How far are you above him
Stacy glances down once more, trying to quess,the distance
Fifteen feet
(a beat) He's just lying there
She lifts her head again, peers upward
'  - The top of the shaft is empty
Very faintly,   Jeff and the others talking, just their voices, not their words
(
) Jeff
Jeff's head reappears
We have to figure out a way to lengthen the rope
We're gonna pull you up
He pulls his head away
- She's staring upward
53
Wait
The rope has almost stopped its swaying
- Jeff steps back to the hole, peers into it
So does Amy
Eric waits by the windlass
The rope is completely played out
Stacy , her voice  slightly: (
) want to stay with him
You can't
We have to-- (
) 'll jump
Jeff glances at the others
Eric shakes his head
Jeff down to her:
We might not be able to make it longer
You'll be trapped
(
) What about him
We can't just leave him
We'll pull you up
Then we'll see
He starts toward the windlass again
- The rope jerks, and she begins to rise
She kicks her legs, lifts her left arm over head, wrenches it free of the sling, so that only her right arm remains hooked
She switches the lamp from her right hand to her left, then slips completely free of,the sling, the lamp fluttering out as she drops
Almost totally dark, just a faint fall of light from above
Mathias is a dim shape on the floor of the shaft
Stacy lands beside him--heavily, awkwardly--the glass from his shattered lamp  beneath her
54
She loses her balance, pitches forward, onto his body
makes a terrible  sound, pure pain, flailing his arms
Stacy struggles to right herself
'm sorry
Oh, God
'm so sorry
She pulls herself into a crouch, staring down at him through the dimness, his  fading to a steady
- Jeff, Amy, and Eric have rushed to the shaft; they're peering into it
There's only darkness beneath them
Eric : Stacy
Stacy's voice rises toward them, sounding
very  : (
) didn't want him to be alone
What happened to the lamp
(
) It blew out
Jeff turns from the shaft, picks up the box of matches
He yanks off his shirt, ties the box inside it, then steps back to the edge of the hole
He  down to Stacy: 'm dropping the matches
Okay
(
) Okay
Jeff holds the knotted bundle over the shaft, lets it go
It falls into the darkness
long beat, and then, very softly, the thump as it lands
(
) (cont'd) Got it
The three of them stare into the hole, waiting for the light
55
There's the  of a match, its flickering flame, then the stronger illumination of the lamp as Stacy lights its wick
Mathias lies on his back before her, silent now, motionless, his eyes shut
Stacy bends toward him, : Mathias
He doesn't respond; it's hard to tell if he's conscious
Stacy lifts the lamp, peers about the shaft
The vine has taken root even at this depth, its flowers and leaves pale to the point of translucence
Beyond Mathias, there's an opening in the dirt wall, another shaft cutting perpendicularly into the earth
Its roof is supported by a stone archway, intricately carved
Stacy rises, as if to investigate, but then winces, nearly falls
She peers down at her right leg
large piece of glass is imbedded there, just beneath her knee
it's the size of a playing card, gently concave,'dark with her blood
She reaches and, grimacing, pulls it from her body
- Jeff is at the windlass, hurriedly cranking the rope back up
Eric and Amy stand watching
We need fifteen feet
Twenty to be safe
No one speaks
The windlass turns with that steady , but it's higher-pitched now, with no weight on the rope
(cont'd) Come on
Think
How can we-- The clothes
From the backpacks
We could knot them together
Would they hold
Eric frowns, uncertain
Jeff finishes with the rope, stands there, catching his breath
Stacy's,voice rises toward them from the shaft: 56
(
) cut my knee
Eric hurries to the shaft, followed by Jeff and Amy
They peer over its edge, toward Stacy, so far beneath them, in her flickering circle of lamp light
Bad
My shoe's full of blood
Put pressure on it
Use my shirt
They all stare down at her, waiting
Stacy is crouched beside Mathias, pressing Jeff's -shirt to her wound
Her khakis and tennis shoe are dark with blood; there's a lot of it
She isn't watching Mathias; he startles her when he opens his eyes and speaks: My
legs
His voice is faint and ; we can hear his pain in it
Stacy leans toward him, tries to smile reassuringly
Hey
Can't
move
my
legs
Stacy turns to look: his legs are lying at an odd angle, as if he were a doll that had been carelessly tossed there
- Jeff, Eric and Amy, still watching; Jeff turns to the others
What about the tents
We could take one down, cut the nylon into strips
Eric and Amy glance toward the tents, debating
57
Would it be strong enough
we can braid them--three strips for each section
Then knot the sections together, for strength
Before either of them can respond, Stacy's voice emerges from the shaft, sounding : (
) think he broke his back
They fall silent, staring down at her
(
) (cont'd) He can't move his legs
And it smells
Smells
(
) Like he lost his bowels
His bladder
(very quietly) Oh no
Please no
Jeff turns to her
How can we make a backboard
Amy starts to shake her head, looking horrified
No, Jeff
No way
We can't move him
One of the frames from the backpacks
And the tent poles
There's tape in the orange tent
He doesn't wait for a response; he leans over the shaft, : (cont'd) We have to builda backboard, Stacy
It might take a while
58
There's a long hesitation, as if Stacy is searching for some alternative
Then, still sounding  and : (
) Okay
Amy is shaking her head, growing : We'll make it worse
Well jostle him, and he'll-- Jeff turns toward her, with a hint of : We can't just leave him down there
You know that, don't you
She starts to back away, toward the edge of the clearing
we have to tell them
Who
The Mayans
We have to tell them what's happened
Jeff gives her an incredulous look
She keeps retreating; she's almost at the path
(cont'd) They can send for help
They're not gonna--- We have to may
We have to-- She spins, starts off at a run, vanishing down the trail
Jeff calls after her, : Amy
But she's gone
Jeff turns to Eric
(cont'd) Stay here
59
And then he, too, is running
/    - The Mayans have established their campsite on the edge of the jungle
Two women are beside a campfire, plucking a pair of chickens
other campsites in the distance, other campfires, hugging the jungle's margin, surrounding the hill
Three men sit in the center of the clearing, facing the hillside, their bows in their laps
They rise suddenly, peering up the trail
The women pause in their labor, also staring
The campsite goes
'  - Amy is sprinting toward us down the trail
Jeff is ten yards behind her, also running
The three Mayans nock arrows
Two other men step forward to join them
One has a bow; the other is the bald Mayan, with the pistol
He unholsters it, and--as Amy reaches the bottom of the trail--raises it, aiming at her chest
Amy stops just short of the clearing: sweating, breathless, scared-looking
She lifts her hands, palms-up, beseeching
Help us
Please
Someone's been hurt
He-- Jeff comes to a halt, five feet behind her
They can't understand you
She turns, her voice quickened with : Say it in Spanish
Tell them he-- They don't speak Spanish
Try it
You have to try
60
She spins back toward the Mayans, takes a step into the clearing
The bald man  at her, a single short sentence in
Amy holds out her hands to him
(cont'd) Espanol
Habla Espanol
Jeff steps forward, grabs her elbow
They killed Henrich
Why would- Amy tries to tug free, but he won't let her
She starts to at the Mayans: Help usi We need help
The Mayans just stare at her, their weapons raised, their faces expressionless
one of them is much younger than the others, almost a boy
He says something in  to the bald man, and the bald man shakes his head
Amy begins to
Jeff pulls at her elbow
We have to get back
Amy turns toward him, her face smeared with tears
didn't want to come
told you we shouldn't
said-- Jeff tightens his grip on her arm, gives her a little shake, as if to wake her up
Listen to me
Mathias needs our help
Right now
He-- We shouldn't even be here
Why did you say we'd come
(she wipes at her tears) You have to do something
(rising toward a shout) You have to
It's your fault
It's all your-- Jeff shakes her again, more roughly, his voice like a slap: 61
-q stepped onto the hill
Amy stares at him, startled into silence
(cont'd) They wouldn't have forced us up it if you hadn't
He holds her eyes, making sure she understands
Then: (cont'd) Now let's go, okay
He starts to pull her back toward the trail
She allows herself to be led; she's begun to  again: didn't know
just-- She's growing increasingly upset, almost
She tries to turn back toward the Mayans again, but Jeff won't let her
(cont'd) They have to help us
They're not going to
They have to
She wrenches herself free, stumbles, falls into the vines beside the trail
Jeff reaches for her, but she kicks away from him, grabbing at the vines, scrambling to her feet
As she rises, she yanks up a tendril, a clot of earth hanging from its roots
She , spinning toward the clearing--- (cont'd) '
--and throws the tendril at the Mayans
They scramble backward, with surprising panic,
The youngest of them is too slow: the length of vine hits him in the leg
He stares down at the tendril in shock
The others back hurriedly away from him
Two of them continue to point their weapons at Amy, but the bald man and one of the other bowmen are aiming at the young Mayan now
There's  from the tree line
The entire campsite is on its feet; a woman begins to
62
She's in her,forties, short and stout, and she starts forward into the clearing, arms stretched toward the young Mayan
Two of the other women grab her, hold her back
The bald Mayan starts to  the young man, pointing up the hillside
The short woman keeps , flailing, trying to break free
The young Mayan looks at her, then at the bald man
He speaks in , a brief burst of words
The bald man shakes his head, points up the hill again, his pistol aimed at the young man's chest
The short woman is , eyes shut
The young Mayan takes a step toward her, what seems to be her name
The bald man  at him, but the young Mayan ignores him, takes a second step, then a third
The bowmen are all aiming at him now, and suddenly, everyone seems to be
The young Mayan takes a fifth step, holding out his arms toward the  woman,  to her
The bald man , shooting him in the head
At the same instant, the bowmen let their arrows fly, the shafts  into the young man's chest, burying themselves to the fletches
The clearing goes still; the only sound is the woman's steady Then the bald man swings his pistol toward Amy and Jeffs he  in  at them
The other Mayans nock fresh arrows, draw their bows
Jeff takes a step backward, half-raising his hands
Amy just stands there, her eyes on the young Mayan's motionless body
(no reaction) She turns, finally
She looks horrified, stupefied; her hands are burned a deep red from the vine's sap
Jeff waves her up the hill
She stares at him for another beat, and then, without a word, starts to climb the trail
Jeff hesitates, watching the Mayans: the bloodied corpse, the raised weapons, the  woman
Then he, too, turns and hurries off up the trail
-   - Amy, Jeff, and Eric have taken down the blue tent; its contents lie tumbled in a pile in the little clearing
All three of them look sun struck, sweat-stained, worn out
63
Eric is using a knife to cut long strips from the blue nylon
Amy is braiding three of the strips together
Jeff has one of the backpack frames, the roll of duct tape, and some of the poles from the tent; he's making a backboard
Maybe we could use it as a weapon, you know
Wrap it around some stones or something
And throw them, like grenades
mean, if they're that scared of it-- Jeff tears off a piece of tape with his teeth
They have guns, Eric
And bows
What do you think they'll do if we start throwing the vine at them
Eric is silenced by this
He cuts another long strip of nylon, passes it to Amy
But he can't seem to stop himself from talking: So you figure it's, what
Sacred or something
Like, you touch it and you have to die
Amy begins to cry suddenly--a , quickly suppressed
Jeff and Eric both turn to look at her
The vine's sap has scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows
She wipes her eyes, takes a deep breath, shakes her head
'm okay
But she doesn't look it
Jeff removes his hat, holds it out
Amy just stares at it; he nods for her to take it
Come on
You're burning
She reaches for the hat, puts it on, then wipes at her eyes again
Jeff leans forward, touches her
(cont'd) We're gonna get through this
All right
We'll pull them up
And then
don't know--we'll figure things out
it has to rain at some point
And maybe we can snare some birds
Or-- 64
The electronic  sounds once more from the bottom of the shaft
They all turn to stare
The oil lamp has begun to smoke, adding a haze to the light
Stacy is beside Mathias, holding his hand
She's still pressing Jeff's shirt to her wound
The  sounds again
Mathias turns his head, peers toward the shaft cut into the dirt wall to his left: that's where it's coming from
Stacy reaches to pick up the lamp, rises to her feet
Another Jeff  down from above: (
) Stacy
Stacy ignores him; she limps around Mathias, starts toward the opening
She hesitates at the mouth of the shaft, lifting her lamp to see better
There's another
-'  -- The lamp's light doesn't penetrate very far, but  can that the vine has taken root here with great avidity: it grows thickly on the walls, floor and roof
There's a steady draft coming toward us, and the plant shifts in it,
Stacy stands there, looking scared
There's another
(
) Can you see it
Stacy lifts her head, : No
She keeps peering into the shadows, not moving
The ringing falls
Stacy turns, hobbles back toward Mathias, and the light shudders, dims for a moment
She squints at it: the oil is nearly gone
She  up to the others: (cont'd) The lamp's almost out of oil
(
) Then blow it out
65
Stacy seems terrified by this
Blow it out
(0
5
) We'll need it when we come down
To get him on the backboard
Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias, sets the lamp down before her, stares at it
She clearly doesn't want to blow it out
Mathias watches her, silent
(
) (cont'd) All right
Stacy leans forward, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, blows out the flame, dropping the shaft into darkness
-   - The
sun is just touching the horizon, the sky turning red
Th ey've tied the braids of nylon onto the rope, attached the finished backboard to them
It rests beside the shaft, padded with one-of the archaeologist's sleeping bags
Jeff and Eric remove their belts, drop them onto the backboard
They step to the windlass, lean against its hand crank, the rope going taut
Amy stands by the shaft, gathering her courage
Then she reaches for the backboard
Mathias and Stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness
The windlass begins its
long beat, and then: (
) Stacy
What
-(0
5
) Light the lamp
Stacy shifts; once again, there's the  of a match, then the stronger illumination of the lamp as she lights its wick
Mathias's eyes are shut; there's a deep  to his breathing
Stacy looks upward
66
'  - The backboard is dropping toward us
Above it, the light is already fading from the sky
Stacy rises to her feet, lifting the lamp
- She's dropping slowly down the shaft, clenching the nylon braids, her eyes tightly shut: terrified
The backboard sways, pendulum-like, as it descends, almost touching the vine-covered walls
When the backboard comes within reach, Stacy grabs it, pulling it to the-right, so that it will come to rest at Mathias's side
But then, with three feet still to go, it jerks to a halt, almost toppling Amy from her perch
beat, and Jeff's voice comes toward them from above: (
) Have you reached them
Almost
few more feet
(
} How many
Amy leans, peers down at Mathias's broken body
don't know
Three
(
} we're out of rope
(a beat) Can you still do it
Amy looks at Stacy; neither speaks
Finally, : We'll have to send it back up, guess
67
Amy doesn't answer
She shifts her weight, and the backboard starts to swing
Stacy reaches to steady it
(cont'd) Blow out the lamp
Wait here in the dark
Amy is silent, staring down at Mathias's still form; it's obvious she doesn't want to do this
(cont'd) Or we could try to lift him, maybe
More silence
Stacy persists: (cont'd) One of us at his shoulders
The other his feet
If he twists-- It's only a few feet
/"- Once more, Amy is silent
Stacy lifts the lamp, examining it, the diminishing pool of oil
(cont'
d) We have to decide
The light's not going to last
Jeff's voice comes toward them from above again: (
) Amy
They both look up; the sky has grown too dark to see him
Amy hesitates one beat more, then : We're gonna try itt She climbs off the backboard, crouches beside Mathias
Stacy sets down the lamp
(cont'd) Mathias
She touches his shoulder, and he opens his eyes, stares at her
He looks haggard, ashen
10111
68
(cont'd) We're going to lift you, okay
We're going to hoist you up and out
Mathias stares from her to the backboard to Stacy
He shuts his eyes
Amy stands up, drags the belts off the backboard, drops them next to the lamp
She positions herself behind Mathias's head; Stacy hobbles to his feet, limping
(cont'd) His hips
Stacy hesitates, looking doubtful
You sure
If you lift from his feet, he'll bend at the waist
But if  lift at his hips, won't he arch his back
They both stare down at Mathis, imagining these two different scenarios
Amy glances toward the lamp, its dwindling oil
His knees
Stacy crouches by Mathias's knees, a little off balance, favoring her wounded leg
Amy bends, sliding her hands under his shoulders
Mathias , and Stacy starts to pull away, but Amy shakes her head
(cont'd) Quickly
On three
They count together: One
two
-,
three
They lift, and Mathias immediately starts to
His body sags at the waist; he begins to thrash his arms
Stacy starts to set him down, but Amy shakes her head, : No
69
Stacy's wounded leg is hindering her; she can't keep up with Amy
Mathias's shoulders are level with the backboard, but his knees are still a good foot beneath it
He keeps The bend at his waist increases
(cont'd) Lift Stacy tries to hoist him higher, lunging, his torso twisting, his  going
His right arm, hits the backboard, sends it swinging
The girls toss him toward it
-   - The sun has set
There's a half moon, giving us just enough light to dimly see Eric and Jeff peering into the shaft
Mathias's  echo up toward them
- Mathias has fallen silent
He lies on the backboard, eyes clenched, sweat beading his forehead
Stacy is trying not to cry
She watches Amy buckle the two belts together, then drape them over Mathias's chest, knot them tight
Amy strips off her own belt, gestures for Stacy to do the same
She buckles these together, too
have to pee
She limps toward the wall, lowers her pants, gingerly crouches
She stares toward the other shaft as she pees: its stone archway, the shifting shadows, the vine rustling softly in the steady draught
Amy binds Mathias at his thighs
She  to him: You okay
She waits, but he doesn't respond
His eyes remain shut
Stacy rises, buttoning her pants, limps back toward Amy
She's on the edge of tears, is working hard to fight them off
Amy lifts her head,  up to Jeff: (cont'd) Pull him up
70
moment's pause, then the windlass begins to  once more
The backboard slowly rises, swaying gently
They watch it climb away from them
Amy holds out her-hand
(cont'd) Here
Stacy just stares at her, not understanding
Amy nods at the lamp: the oil is gone
(cont'd) It's gonna go out
And it's true: as Stacy reaches for Amy's hand, the light suddenly flickers, dims, drops them into darkness
/    - The Mayans are settling into sleep at their campsite
Three of the men remain on guard duty in the clearing, facing the hillside, their backs to the fire
The young Mayan's corpse still lies in the dirt, fifteen feet in front of them
The firelight throws shadows across his bloodied body
-   - ' The windlass  loudly as Eric and Jeff work to wind in the rope
Stacy has already been pulled up from the hole
She's sitting beside Mathias, who's lying on the backboard, on the edge of the clearing, by the orange tent
Amy emerges from the shaft, dangling beneath the sawhorse
Jeff holds the rope taut while Eric steps to the hole, pulls Amy toward him
Stacy watches from beside the backboard
Mathias's eyes are shut, his breathing  with phlegm
No one speaks
Once Amy is free of the sling, they all move to the backboard
Eric takes Stacy's-hand; Jeff crouches, starts to undo the belts
Shouldn't we carry him into the tent first
Jeff pulls free the first belt, shifts to the second one
We can't
Because
71
He's gonna keep leaking urine
But we can't just leave him out in the open
We'll rig a shelter
With what's left of the blue tent
Jeff pulls the second belt free
Mathias's eyes remain shut
(cont'd) One of us should stay on watch while the others sleep
Two hour shifts
He reaches for his knapsack, unzips it
He pulls out a liter bottle of water
(cont'd) Once it's light, we'll figure out how much water we have, and how to ration it
Food, too
For now, think we should each just take a single swig
He uncaps the bottle, hands it to Amy
He watches her drink from it
When she's done, she passes it to Stacy
(cont'd) Eric and 'll build the shelter,
then 'll take the first shift
You two should try to sleep
Stacy takes her single sip, passes the bottle to Eric
- Stacy and Amy have pushed the camping supplies into a pile along the tent's rear wall
Stacy pulls off her pants, bends to examine her wound in the darkness
Amy is beside her, lying on her side
beat of silence
Then, : Amy
what
72
We shouldn't have lifted him, should we
Amy reaches, pats Stacy's hand
Shh
He's never gonna walk again
He's-- Don't, Stacy
Don't talk
It'll only make things worse
Stacy falls silent
(cont'd) Just go to sleep, okay
Let's try to go to sleep
Stacy lies down next to Amy, in her-underwear and -shirt
They huddle close together in the darkness
-   - Eric is building a tiny lean-to for Mathias, using the duct tape, the leftover nylon and poles from the blue tent
Jeff crouches over the backboard
He starts to cut Mathias's jeans off him with the knife
Mathias's eyes remain shut
What're you doing
We have to keep him clean
He slices the jeans, from ankle to hip, first one leg, then the other, struggling not to jostle Mathias's body
(cont'd) That's how it'll happen,  think
if it does
If what does
Jeff slides the soiled strips of-denim out from under Mathias's body, tosses them aside
He  his voice:
73
If he dies here
infection
Blood poisoning--something like that
Eric seems startled by this
You think he's gonna die
(he shrugs) His back is broken
Who knows what else
Eric is silent, motionless, the tape in his hand
Mathias's seems to be getting steadily worse
Jeff bends to cut off his boxers, first one leg, then the other
He tosses the soiled fabric aside
(cont'd) We should go back down in the morning
Down
Into the shaft
Try to find the phone again
There's no oil for the lamp
Jeff waves toward the orange tent
There's tequila
We could pour it on some of the clothes, tie them around one of these poles, make a torch
sleeping bag is lying in the clearing among the strips of nylon and aluminum poles
Jeff steps over to pick it up
(cont'd) Without the phone, he's dead
If we have to wait for someone to come searching
He shakes his head
Then he leans forward and carefully drapes the sleeping bag across Mathias's broken body
74
- The orange nylon is just starting to glow with the sun's arrival
Stacy and Eric lie beneath one of the sleeping bags, Eric's head on her shoulder
Jeff lies curled on his side, a few feet away, still shirtless
Jeff's eyes open
He sits up, stares about, then reaches for one of the backpacks
He quietly digs through it till he finds a -shirt
He sniffs at it, then pulls it on
-   - Mathias lies on his backboard, eyes shut, his breathing still sounding
Amy sits beside him, hunched into herself, half drowsing
She lifts her head as Jeff emerges from the tent, stares at him
How is he
The same
And you
(she shrugs) Tired
Thirsty
Hungry
Once the others are up, we'll have some water
His face is stubbled, sweat-stained
He looks ragged; they both do
He steps to the opposite side of the clearing, unzips, begins to urinate, with his back to Amy
'  - The vine covers everything, tangled and matted, with those odd, knoll-like growths scattered among it
The nearest-is thirty feet away
its leaves are swaying slightly in a faint breeze, and   a flash of yellowish white beneath them
75
Jeff finishes, shakes, zips, then steps out into the vine, wading toward the tiny mound
Amy remains beside the backboard; she watches him crouch, part the tendrils, stare
What is it
Jeff gestures for her to approach
When she reaches him, he leans forward, pulls aside the vines
a man's skull, a loose tumble of bones
Amy  sharply, recoiling
Bodies
All of them
He waves across the hilltop, at the other mounds: there are more than a dozen
Amy takes them in
The light is gaining strength, the green leaves seeming to shine in it, the red flowers to glow
Jeff's face assumes a puzzled expression
(cont'd) Where are the birds
Birds
it's dawn--there should be birds
They both stare off across the hillside: so quiet, so still
- Stacy opens her eyes
She lies there, struggling to orient herself, with Eric on her shoulder
She starts to roll onto her side, then stops, looking confused
She reaches under the sleeping bag, toward her leg, her confusion changing to alarm
She site up, jarring Eric awake, and throws back the sleeping bag
() What
The vine has grown dramatically during the night, reaching out from the pile of supplies at the rear of the tent to spread across Stacy's right leg, almost to her waist
She sits up, tries to push it off her
76
Oh my god
The vine is clinging to her; she has to tear it, the sap shining slickly on her hands, visibly beginning to burn the skin
She yanks at the tendrils, tossing them aside
(cont'd) Help me
Eric sits up, still only half-awake
He just stares
(cont'd)
It's inside me
It's true: one of the tendrils has pushed its way into the wound on her leg, widening it, thrusting itself a full three inches into her body, like a thick finger
(cont
'd) Oh, Jesus--it's fucking inside me
She tries to pull the tendril out, but she's too panicky, too quick, and the vine breaks, leaving a piece of itself snagged under her skin
Stacy starts to : (cont'd) Get the knifes Eric is too shocked to stir
He's staring down at her leg, at the bulge beneath her skin: it looks as if it's moving
-   - Stacy's  continues
Jeff and Amy are on their feet, hurrying across the clearing
Mathias has opened his eyes
(
) Get the knife
Jeff bends, scoops up the knife, starts toward the tent
He waves toward Mathias
Stay with him
Then he ducks in through the tent's flap
77
- Eric is beside Stacy, trying to calm her; she's started to Her hands and wrists have turned a dark red, and the tendril is inside her leg, just to the left of her shin, running parallel to it
Jeff steps
toward them
What is it
The vine
It's inside her
Stacy points to her wound,  now: Cut it out
You gotta cut it out
The blade's dirty
We should-- Stacy starts shaking her head, : It's moving
Can't you see
Jeff stares at the bulge, hesitating
Then it moves, unquestionably: contracting and expanding, like a worm
Stacy : (cont'd) Jeff
Be gives in, crouching over her leg
It's gonna hurt
Please
Hurry
He leans forward, slices into the skin above the bulge
Stacy  , starts to jerk away, but Jeff presses down on her leg, holding her still
He reaches into her wound with his finger, digs out the piece of vine, tosses it aside
Get me a shirt or something
He gestures toward the backpacks, and Eric unzips one of them, starts to dig through it
78
He pulls out a -shirt, hands it to Jeff
Jeff wads it up, uses it to put pressure on the incision, staunching the flow of blood
-   - Amy is crouched by the backboard, watching the tent, trying to grasp what's happening
Mathias startles her by speaking: Something's
wrong
His voice is thick-sounding, very faint
Amy tries to soothe him; she puts her hand on his shoulder
It's okay
It's just-- my-legs
know
You're hurt
But we're
, gonna get you-- Show
me
He's struggling to rise, straining upward
Amy tries to stop him, pressing down on his shoulder
Shh
But he fights her; he won't be quieted: Show-me
So she leans, lifts the sleeping bag off him
His lower legs are completely covered by the flowering vine, from the knees down
Amy and Mathias both stare in surprise
Then Amy reaches, starts to yank the tendrils free
- Jeff is leaning forward, pressing the balled-up -shirt against Stacy's wound, the blood darkening the fabric
Stacy is lying there, her eyes shut, fists clenched
can still feel it
79
Jeff shakes his head
got it out
can feel it moving
That's just your body
Your muscle twitching
It's on our clothes
Stacy and Jeff both glance at him
There's a faint, almost fungus-like green growing on his shirt, an infantile version of the vine covering the hillside all around them
It's on all of them: their shirts, their pants, their shoes
Before any of them can respond to this development, Amy starts to  from the clearing, sounding : (
) Jeff
They all turn toward the flap
Mathias begins to
Amy's voice  in volume: (
) (cont'd) of Jeff rises, moves toward the flap
-   - Amy is crouched over Mathias, frantically yanking the vines off him
Mathias is struggling impotently to sit up
He continues to , staring down at his legs
Jeff emerges-from the tent, hurries to help Amy, both of them tearing at the vine, a flash of white appearing beneath the green, shiny and bright: bones
Mathias's legs have been stripped completely clean of flesh from the knee down
As they keep pulling the tendrils free, blood starts to drip from Mathias's knees, slowly at first, but then suddenly spurting, spraying them: their chests, their faces
Amy jerks backward, ,
80
She jumps up, takes three steps into the center of the clearing, and , her hands on her knees
She wipes at the blood on her face, , spits, then bends again, another long ribbon of puke slipping free of her
Mathias continues to  and thrash
Jeff reaches for the belts, lying in the dirt beside the backboard
He quickly ties first one then another around Mathias's legs, twisting them into tourniquets, cutting off the flow of blood
Stacy and Eric stoop out through the tent's flap: they stand there staring, struggling to grasp what's happened
Stacy is in her underwear and -shirt, blood still seeping down her leg
Amy turns to face them
Mathias is  now, his eyes shut
The hemorrhaging has stopped; blood lies in puddles across the backboard
Jeff is covered with it
And then there are the bones: so white, so wet-looking, from the knees down, nothing but bone
Suddenly, Stacy starts to , pointing past Amy, at the dirt beyond her
They all turn to look
The vine is in motion, a long tendril slipping into the clearing, moving snakelike toward the puddle of vomit at Amy's feet
Amy backs quickly away
second tendril emerges from the low wall of green around the clearing, then a third
They move rapidly, as if racing each other; both of them slipping alongside the first into the little pool of vomit
The tendrils absorb the puke, draining it, until all that's left is a damp shadow on the rocky soil
Then they withdraw back across the clearing, silently retreating into the larger mass of green
Stacy keeps
/    - Faintly, from up the hill,   Stacy's screams
The Mayans are finishing their morning meal
They eat in silence, showing no reaction to the sound
In the clearing, the young Mayan's corpse is buried beneath a thick growth of vine
-   - The four of them are sitting by the orange tent
Jeff and Amy are still spattered and smeared with Mathias's blood; Stacy is still in her underwear
81
e
- Jeff is inventorying their food and water
The others watch as he puts the perishables in a separate pile: two bananas, a plastic bag ofgrapes going brown, an orange, a soggy tuna fish sandwich
They must've dug it up
Who
He arranges the rest of the food in a second pile: a bag of pretzels, a can of nuts, two protein bars, a box of raisins
The miners
He puts the liquids in a third pile: three bottles of water, two of iced tea, a can of Coke
That's all there is
(cont'd) And then the Mayans cleared the jungle around the hill,  guess
To keep it quarantined
That's why they won't let us leave, don't you think
They're afraid we'll spread it
The others are silent
Jeff reaches for the tuna fish sandwich
He carefully unwraps it
(cont'd) Or else
don't know
Maybe it's something religious
And we're some sort of sacrifice
He glances at the others, but once again no one responds
They all look dazed: knocked back into themselves
Jeff picks up the knife, wipes it on his jeans
(cont'd) They must've done the same thing with the archaeologists
And Henrich
Trapped them here
Like us
He cuts the sandwich into four equal sections
(cont'd) And then somehow it killed them off
All of them
one by one
This is too much for Eric; he
leaps up, looking panicky
82
J011 We have to find the phone
We have to go back down and-- Jeff makes a calming motion
We'll eat first
Drink some water
We have to stay calm
Not rush at things
He holds out one of the tiny squares of sandwich
Eric hesitates, then accepts it, dropping back into a crouch
Jeff hands Amy her square
What about Mathias
She nods toward him, and they all turn to look
From his knees down, Mathias's legs are nothing but bone, tendon, and ropy clots of blackened blood
His face looks gray
His eyes are shut, and his breathing sounds terribly
He wouldn't be able to stomach it
Jeff offers Stacy her ration
She takes it, but almost absentmindedly
She seems distracted; she keeps prodding at her wound with her fingertip
(cont'd) Stop it, Stacy
It's still in there
can feel it
She keeps probing
Jeff shakes his head, a little it' : told you
got it out
Jeff pops his square of sandwich into his mouth; Eric and Amy eat theirs, too
Stacy's ration remains in her hand; she seems to have forgotten it
She's sunburned, sweat-stained, glassy-eyed
Eric leans toward her, looking worried
Eat, Stacy
You have to eat
She places the tiny sandwich into her mouth, chews, swallows, staring at her wound the whole time
Then: 83
See
How puffy it is
That's just swelling
It's natural
(he turns toward Jeff) Right
(he nods) It's what happens when you get hurt
Jeff picks up one of the water bottles, twists off its-cap
He offers the bottle to Stacy
(cont'd) one swallow apiece
The bottle makes its way around their little circle
When it returns to Jeff, he takes his sip, caps the bottle
Eric is watching Stacy, her anxious probing; he looks increasingly distressed by it
He jumps up again
The phone
Let's find the phone
Jeff doesn't move
Stacy's bloodied khakis
are lying in the dirt beside him, and he reaches for them, starts to cut off their legs with the knife, just above the knee
We need to take care of Mathias, first
He won't last much longer like that
Amy looks appalled; she makes a shushing motion
Shh
They all glance toward Mathias again
He lies there, eyes shut, breathing in and out with that fluid-filled
He seems to be unconscious, but Jeff still  his voice: We have to cut them off
Cut what off
84
His legs
He's finished with Stacy's khakis; they've been transformed into a pair of shorts
He tosses them toward her
Eric and Amy are staring at him, shocked into silence
Then: You're joking
He'll die if we don't
Without anaesthesia
There won't be any pain
He has no feeling beneath his waist
He'll lose too much blood
The tourniquets are already in place
We'll cut below them
With what
Jeff holds up the knife
Eric  at the idea: (cont'd) That wouldn't do a thing
You'd need a bone saw
We could break the bones
Then cut
Amy is shaking her head; she looks mortified
No, Jeff
No way
What about infection
Cutting into him with a dirty knife
We'll sterilize it
Build a fire
Heat the blade in the flames
It'll cauterize as it cuts
85
You'll kill him
Or save him
One or the other
We can't just-- Cut me first
Right here
Stacy has stood up, pulled on the shorts Jeff has fashioned for her
She's bent over, pointing at a spot on her leg, a few inches below the last incision
(cent'd) Sterilize the knife and-- Eric steps toward her, tries to soothe her
There's nothing there, Stacy
It's -- She hardly seems to hear him
She's frightened, growing a little wild with it
Her voice comes   : It's moving
can feel it moving
You're imagining it
You're scared, and you-- gotta get out of here
gotta get to a hospital
gotta-- Eric takes her hand, squeezing it
Stacy blinks at him, close to tears
You have to calm down
Can you do that
Can you try to calm down
Stacy pulls free of him, drops into a crouch, hugging her knees to her chest, her eyes shut
See if there's a signal
what
86
Your phone
Check your phone
Eric doesn't move: he knows there's no point
(cont'd) Check it
Eric , steps to his pack, crouches to remove his phone
He flips it open, holds it out to Stacy
She stares down at it: there's no signal
Eric drops it back into his pack
Then he turns to Jeff
We go back down
We find the other phone
We call for help
That's how we get out of here
That's how we save him
It'11 take too long
One call, Jeff
They'll be here by sundown
And Mathias will already be dying
You understand
There's no flesh covering his bones
They're-- Mathias's voice interrupts him, from the backboard
Very , barely audible: Do
it
They all turn, stare toward him
His eyes are open
(cont'd) Please
(a beat) Cut
them
off
He slowly, painfully, extends his left hand toward them, a beseeching gesture
- pair of shorts, a woman's blouse, two black socks
87
(
) 'll have to break the bones first
An amber liquid is being poured onto the clothes, very slowly
: -   - Eric is crouched, dribbling the tequila onto the clothes, pausing to let it soak in, saturating the fabric
Jeff is kneeling by the backboard, talking to Mathias
With the stone
Then 'll use the knife to cut
large stone sits beside the pile of clothes, shaped like an ax head
There's the knife, too, and the metal canteen from the orange tent
(cont'd) We'll heat the canteen, and cauterize the wounds with it
To stop the bleeding
Eric strikes a match: the clothes catch instantly, burning with a low blue flame
He sets the knife in the fire, then the stone, and splashes more tequila on them
The girls stand in the center of the clearing, watching
(cont'd) You shouldn't be able to feel a thing
But you can bite this if you want
Just in case
He holds up one of the belts
Mathias hesitates, then opens his mouth, and Jeff sets it carefully inside
Mathias clamps down, gripping it between his teeth
Jeff glances at Eric
(cont'd) Ready
Eric nods
- The stone is making a cracking sound in the fire, glowing a
deep red
Jeff turns back to Mathias
(cont'd) You
Mathias also nods, shutting his eyes
There's a small towel in the dirt beside Jeff, and he
picks it up, wrapping it around his hand
He looks over his shoulder at the girls
They both seem terrified, shaky with it
88
(cont'd) You should wait in the tent
Amy starts to shake her head, but then Stacy is in motion, grabbing her hand, pulling her across the clearing, and she lets herself be led
Jeff watches them vanish through the flap, then reaches toward the fire with his towel-swathed hand
He scoops up the stone, raises it over his head,  it down with all his strength against the exposed bones of Mathias's left leg
Mathias bucks, ; his eyes jump open
Jeff drops the stone back into the fire,
snatches out the knife
Mathias is trying to rise onto his elbow, straining to see what's happening
(cont'd) Hold him
Eric sets the canteen into the flames, sloshes some tequila on it, then shifts
to the backboard
He presses down on Mathias''s shoulders
Mathias is , twisting his head back and forth, gripping the belt tightly in his teeth
Jeff starts to saw with the knife, chopping and cutting the splintered bones
Bloody marrow spills wetly out, and then Mathias's
lower leg comes free of his body, the foot and ankle and shin bones completely separate now
Jeff lifts the bones away, drops them into the dirt beside the backboard
Then he turns, uses the towel to pluck the canteen out of the fire: it, too, is glowing red
He presses the canteen flat against Mathias's stump, the flesh  and
Mathias bucks even more forcefully; he spits out the belt,  : Stop
stop
Jeff ignores him, dropping the canteen back into the fire, lifting out the stone
Eric looks increasingly mortified; he seems close to tears
-- Reep him still
He turns,  the stone into Mathias's right leg
Mathias begins to , bucking against Eric's grip
89
- Mathias's  fill the tent
Amy and Stacy are sitting together, clutching each other; Stacy is
Amy is staring toward the flap with a look of horror
-   - Jeff saws and chops at the shattered bones with the knife
Mathias continues'to
Eric is using all his weight to hold him still, his head averted, his eyes clenched shut
Jeff lifts the severed bones
away from the backboard, drops them at his side
Then he scoops up the canteen again
As he presses it to Mathias's stump, Mathias finally passes out, his body going slack, his screams falling
For a long beat, there's just the ,  sound of Mathias's flesh being seared
Then Eric pulls back into a crouch, shaking his head, looking utterly depleted
Oh, Jesus
Jesus Christ
Amy emerges from the tent, then Stacy
They stand staring
He felt it, didn't he
The whole thing
Jeff lifts the canteen away
He couldn't have
He was screaming
Be was telling you to stop
It was just seeing it
Looking down, and-- Amy is shaking her head, staring at Mathias with that appalled expression: his slack face, his burned stumps
This is bad, Jeff
So bad
Jeff leans to loosen first one tourniquet, then the other
90
We've bought him some time
He wouldn't have-- You cut off his legs
You-- Stacy , pointing toward Mathias's amputated limbs
They're lying in the dirt at the base of the backboard, the bloodstained bones held together with a few remaining cords of flesh
vine has come snaking into the clearing: it's wrapping itself around one of the feet
As the tendril begins to drag
the bones away, a
second one slithers forward and lays claim to the other foot
Eric grabs the knife, jumps up, steps on the first tendril, bends to slash at it with the blade
He swoops toward the second one
Even as he does so, though, a third tendril slithers into the clearing, then a fourth
Stacy  again, short and loud, and backs toward the tent; Eric bends and slashes, bends and slashes, and the'vine keeps coming, from all directions, reaching for the bones
Leave it
Eric ignores him, cutting and stomping and tearing at the tendrils, faster and faster, but still too slow, the vine fighting back, wrapping itself around his legs
(cont'd) Eric
He steps toward him, grabs his arm, pulls him away
They stand side by side, watching as the vine pulls the severed limbs into itself, the white of the bones vanishing into the larger mass of green
Stacy has begun to  again
There's a beat of stillness, and then, once more, echoing up toward them from the shaft, comes that faint electronic of the cell phone
- Spinning, the rope spooling quickly off the barrel
(
) don't know how long it'11 burn-- : 91
-   - Eric is pulling the rope off the windlass, laying it out in a long zigzag across the clearing
Jeff is crouched by the shaft, making a torch
The girls stand over him, watching
So you'll have to be quick
He has one of the aluminum poles from the blue tent
He's wrapped duct tape around its bottom for a grip, tied some of the archaeologists' clothes around the top
He's dribbling tequila on the knot of fabric, saturating it
(cont'd) Wait to light it till you're both down there
Then-- Who
Jeff looks up at her, startled by the question
Eric is moving along the length of rope, bent low, checking its hemp for signs of weakness
Who what
Who's going
You and Amy
They all look bad, but Stacy looks the worst: her wounded leg,, -her greasy hair, a panicky edge to every gesture
She shakes her head, with vehemence
No, Jeff
No way
Not me
Jeff caps the tequila bottle, gives Stacy a tired look
We've already been through this
Eric and  need to work the winch
You're not strong enough
Eric has reached the end of the rope; he stands up, wiping his hands on his pants
92
It's clear
He moves to the windlass, starts to wind the rope back onto the barrel
They've tied a sling on the rope's end again
Stacy is pressing her right hand against the bottom of her rib cage: massaging, probing Why can't Amy go on her own
The torch won't last that long
We need you both there, searching
Stacy starts shaking her head again, : 'm not going
can't
You don't have a choice, Stacy
Amy can see where this is headed; she tries to divert it
It's okay
'll go alone
Jeff ignores this
He rises to his feet, still focused on Stacy
can  his growing anger in his voice: if we don't find the phone, Mathias will die
Understand
Stacy is silent, hugging herself, staring at the ground
Eric has finished winding the rope onto the windlass
He tries to intervene: -- Jeff ignores him, his gaze on Stacy
So that's what you're saying
Just to be clear
That you're not willing to help him live
Come on, man
She's too scared
93
don't give a fuck
'm scared, too
We all are
it was inside her
And we got it out
Now she needs to stop being such a fucking baby, stop being so selfish, and-- Eric is stepping toward him suddenly, right up against him, forcing him back a step
,hut Up
Okay
He's bigger than Jeff, stronger, and this is suddenly very palpable
Their faces are three inches apart
tense beat, and then, more : (cont'd) You're being too hard
Jeff gives him a look of incredulity, almost disgust
Hard
Just leave her be
Jeff turns away from him, from all three of them
He stares off across the hill for a beat, then shakes his head
'm the only one thinking
'm carrying the whole fucking load
So stop
Lay it down
Jeff turns back to him, gives him a look of pure contempt; can  his fury rising again as he speaks: This isn't just going to work out on its own, Eric
You know
Magically
'm not saying-- 94
We could end up dead here
All of us
Is that what you want
Of course not
Then get the fuck out of my way, and start helping me
He holds Eric's eyes long enough to confirm that Eric isn't going to protest, then he glances past him at Stacy
(cont'd) You going or not
Stacy-is still staring at the ground, her hand probing at her chest
It's clear she doesn't want to go, but Jeff has shamed her into silence
Amy reaches, touches her arm
'-11 be right there
Okay
We'll be together the whole time
long beat, then Stacy manages a nod
It's enough for Jeff; he pushes past Eric, moving toward the windlass
Get in the sling, Amy
Amy turns, reaching for the sling
- faint fall of light from above
There's the  of the windlass: Amy is dropping slowly toward us
When her feet touch the bottom of the shaft, she scrambles out of the sling
Then she lifts her head, : Pull it up
The  resumes
She stands there in the dimness, watching the sling rise away from her
She has the makeshift torch in one hand, the box of matches in the other
95
- Eric is helping Stacy into the sling, pulling it over her head; Stacy's hands are shaking badly
Eric hugs her, trying to calm her
Jeff waits beside the hand crank
Amy is in a crouch
She keeps glancing toward the stone arch cut into the shaft's wall, and the passageway beyond it: the vine dangles from
the low ceiling, like streamers at a party
The  resumes, and Amy looks up
'  - Stacy is dropping slowly toward us
Amy glances toward the arch again
slight draft blows steadily from it, and the vine shifts and trembles in it beat, then the  starts up once more
It's coming from within the shadowed passageway
Amy opens the box of matches, plucks one out
She's too jumpy, though; her hands are-trembling so much that she shakes the match out as soon as it's lit
There's a second
Stacy has nearly reached us
Amy digs another match from the box
Stacy's feet touch the bottom of the shaft; she yanks off the sling
There's a third
Hurry
Amy strikes the match, holds it to the knot of clothing at the end of the aluminum pole
The alcohol catches with a sound, a cloud of pale blue fire materializing around the torch
Amy lifts it, and they start into: Stacy is in front, with Amy right behind her
The torch shudders weakly in the steady draft; the shaft's ceiling is low enough that they have to crouch as they move forward
There's a fourth , drawing them deeper down the passage
96
The tendrils hanging from the ceiling brush against them
The vine is growing on the floor, too--knee-deep--and from the walls on either side
Amy is moving cautiously, squinting into the darkness, and Stacy starts to pull ahead
Wait
She pauses, lifting the torch, but Stacy keeps going
Amy peers at the vine hanging from the wall
There's a fifth , echoing eerily, and the flowers move in exact unison with the sound, their stamens vibrating, like so many miniature tuning forks: the plant is making the noise
(cont'd) Stacy
The shaft dead-ends at a blank wall, which is just materializing out of the darkness, fifteen feet in front of them
There's a sixth
Stacy points at the wall, quickening her pace
It's right here
can-- Amy jumps forward, reaching for her
'-- But there's another , and Stacy keeps going: she's nearly at the wall
'-- Stop
Amy grabs her arm, hard, jerks her back a step, pulling her close, the torchlight flickering over them
She : (cont'd) There's no phone
What
seventh  sounds, seeming to come from beneath the vines on the floor of the shaft, directly in front of them
Stacy tries to pull free, to bend and reach toward the sound
97
(cont'd) can-- Amy jerks her back again,  straight into her ear: It's the vine
The flowers
They're making the noise
No
It's-- She pulls free, steps forward, and her foot seems to punch straight through the shaft's floor
She , losing her balances Amy throws down the torch, lunges for her
The torch flutters, pales, but remains lit
The vines growing across the floor fall away, revealing an opening, another shaft, dropping into the earth
Stacy is slowly sliding into it, scrambling to stop herself
Amy grabs Stacy arm
Stacy is dangling, from the waist down, over the hole's edge
There are vines in the hole, too, and
they begin to coil around her legs, pulling at her, dragging her downward
Stacy  again, kicking to free herself, scrambling upward, monkey-like, while Amy pulls at her, and finally they manage to drag her to safety
beat, then Amy retrieves the torch, holds it out over the hole
The bottom is twenty feet down, almost lost in shadow
Dimly,   a woman, lying curled against the wall--she has long dark hair
(cont'd) Oh my God
The woman stirs, her body rolling, as if to turn and look at us, and   her face: she's a corpse
The vine has invaded her flesh--it's in her eye sockets, the hollow of her mouth, writhing and churning
Stacy and Amy
There's a  sound, like a whip, and a tendril lashes out from the shaft's wall, wraps itself around the torch's handle, yanks it from Amy's grip
The torch falls into the hole, still burning
When it hits bottom, a mass of vine surges across it, smothering its flame
It's very dark after this: Amy and Stacy are barely discernible
beat of silence, then an odd, high-pitched rises all around them; it sounds like laughter-- eerie, childlike, full of echoes
98
As it steadily increases in volume, that  comes once more: the vines  at them from the floor, the ceiling, the walls, coiling around their bodies, pulling them toward the open shaft
They both  again, scrambling backward, while the vine keeps coming, more and more of it, grabbing at their arms, their legs, their necks
They stumble over each other, falling onto their hands and knees
amid the
tendrils
The vine catches at them, tries to hold them down
It's not strong enough, though; they yank it off, and thrash their way, foot by foot, back toward the sling, the vine lashing at them, grabbing, tearing, sap leaking onto their skin
The laughter grows still louder, the whole shaft  with it
Amy reaches the sling first, with Stacy right behind her
Even here, the vine continues to attack them, whipping and and
Amy holds the sling toward Stacy
You
But Stacy is too hysterical: she just stands there, , Jeff's voice comes toward them from above, : (0
) Amoy
Amy pulls the sling over her own head
: Pull us up
(
) Did you find it
She reaches out, grabs Stacy, wrapping her arms and legs around her
Stacy returns the embrace, both of them clutching at each other, as the windlass finally begins to , lifting the two of them into the air
- The vines hanging from the shaft's walls whip at the girls as they rise, coiling around their bodies, pulling at them, that strange  growing ever louder, seeming to buffet their bodies
Stacy and Amy grip each other with all their strength, eyes shut tight
Stacy
99
/
- The  comes faintly toward us
The Mayans are arrayed about their campsite, all of them motionless, silent, staring up the hill with their impassive expressions
-   - The weather has shifted; a wind has risen
The sun is setting, a red smudge behind a dark gray wall of clouds
Mathias lies
on his backboard, unconscious, his breathing coming in that ragged , a thread of brown liquid leaking from the corner of his mouth
Amy is crouched beside him; she leans forward, wipes away the liquid
Stacy sits in the clearing behind her, leaning against Eric
They're both slick with sweat, but Stacy keeps shivering, as if cold
Eric's arms are around her, and her eyes are shut
Jeff is peeling the orange
Like Amy, he's still spattered and stained with Mathias's blood
The vine has continued to grow on everyone's clothes, weblike, eating away at the fabric
Jeff reaches, tugs free a strand of it, and a six- inch tear appears in his -shirt
Stacy opens her eyes; she leans forward, peers down at the wounds on her leg, her right hand moving to her chest, probing at her rib cage
She turns to Eric: Check your phone
Eric pushes himself to his feet, steps toward his pack
He pulls out his phone, flips it open
He shakes his head
(cont'd) Let me see
Eric carries the phone to her, then stands over her while she opens it, stares down at it
She shuts it, opens it again
Then again, and again, and suddenly she's , bent into herself
Eric drops to a crouch, rests his hand on her knee
Shh
But her crying increases; she begins to
Jeff is bent' over the orange, dividing it into four equal piles--its peel, too--concentrating
He lifts his head, stares
Amy stands up, hurries over
, kneels in front of Stacy, takes her hand
100
It's okay, sweetie
You're okay
Stacy keeps , uncontrollably, shaking her head
wanner go home
wanna leave
Shh
She's , rocking back and forth; she can't seem to stop
Amy struggles to calm her
Stacy
Stacy keeps , rocking, eyes shut
Amy leans in close
(cont'd) Let's play the game
can you do that
Huh
Can you give me a "So"
Stacy continues to
(cont'd) Come on
Just try
Can you try
(a beat) So there was this girl who wanted to be a pilot
Stacy's tears keep coming
Amy looks at Eric, gives him a nod,'prodding him into speech
He hesitates, then: But she was scared of heights
So she became a lifeguard instead
(she squeezes Stacy's ) Come on
Your turn
More
Amy glances across the clearing at Jeff, wanting him to join in, too
It seems as if he might refuse, but then her look hardens, and he relents
But she couldn't swim
101
So she wore a life vest
(she squeezes Stacy's hand ) Come on
Now you
beat, then Stacy takes a deep, ragged breath
She wipes at her face, struggles for words
But everyone
She trails off,  again
Amy nods, encouraging her
Yeah
Everyone what
They laughed at her
Good
That's good
So she-- Very suddenly, it starts to rain--a dozen large, heavy drops
They all glance skyward
He springs to his feet
And then: a downpour, a deluge, as if a trap door has swung open in the clouds
The rain falls in a loud, drumming rush, turning the clearing to mud
Eric jumps up, too
He and Jeff start digging through the backpacks from the
blue tent, searching for something-- anything--in which to catch the water
They find a small plastic bag, a nylon toiletry kit, a Frisbee
Jeff sets these in a row on the ground, open to the rain
Eric rushes to the orange tent, vanishes inside
Amy tilts back her head, tries to catch the rain in her open mouth
Stacy just sits there, hugging herself, shivering, still half- crying
They're all drenched, back-spattered with mud
And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the rain starts to slacken
Eric reemerges from the orange tent, carrying a thermos, a plastic cup
He sets them next to the other containers, but it's pointless; the rain is already stopping
They all stare at these meager receptacles: they've managed to catch less than half an inch of muddy-looking water
Jeff
; he's  with himself: 102
(cont'd) We should've been ready
We '- He kicks the Frisbee across the clearing
Amy jumps up
She steps forward, as if to guard the other containers
It doesn't fucking matter
There was water in it
He spins toward her, turning his fury with himself on her: How much, Amy
Two and a half gallons
'Cause that's what we need
For today--just to make it through today
And then tomorrow the same all over again
And for how long
Another week before our parents start searching
And then what
How long till they track us to Coba
Or to this fucking hill
How long will it take, Amy
You said-- It's not gonna happen
We're not gonna make it
The others stare at him in astonishment, too 'stunned to speak
He gives them all a look of disgust: (cont'd) And you're fucking playing games
(mimicking Amy's voice) So there were these people trapped in the jungle
Don't, Jeff
But they didn't have any water
103
Amy looks as if she might start crying
Please, don't
So they're gonna die of thirst
Amy covers her ears with her hands
Shut up
But this fucking vine might kill them first
() Jeff paces away, struggling to regain control of himself long beat, and then, very : 'm sorry
'm sorry
He steps back toward the dismembered orange, crouches over it
The fruit and peels are muddy now, spoiled looking
He waves for the others to approach
(cont'd) Come on
We need to eat
No one moves
They're all staring at him with their shocked expressions
He can't seem to meet their eyes
He gestures at the orange again
(cont'd) The peel, too
Everything
Abeat, then the others step forward to claim their portions: first Eric, then Stacy, then Amy
They eat without speaking
Finally, almost     : (cont'd) It'll rain again
It has to
And we'll figure out a way to catch it
(he nods to himself) We'll be fine
We'll ration the -food
And then, you know, we'll just
we'll tough it out
() 104
(cont'd) People have survived for weeks with nothing
Just water, a little bit of water
So why not us
No one responds
They continue to eat: the fruit, the peels
Their torn clothes cling wetly to them
Jeff uncaps the water bottle, offers it to Amy
She drinks, passes it on
It moves around the circle, back to Jeff
What about the vine
Jeff takes his sip, caps the bottle
He's reclaiming himself, his voice strengthening, his confidence returning
don't think it can hurt us
Not directly
if it could, it already would've, wouldn't it
Why would it wait
The others are silent, considering this
Then: (cont'd) It's not strong enough to overpower us
And it-- Mathias  suddenly, his entire body spasming for a moment, before the watery  of his breathing resumes
He doesn't regain consciousness; his eyes remain shut
Everyone watches him for a beat: he, also, is spattered with mud
He's gonna die, isn't he
if there's no phone, then there's no-- Me, too
They all turn to look at her
She's massaging that spot on her rib cage again, digging into it with her fingers
(cont'd) It's eating me
Just like him
And her
She waves toward the shaft
Jeff gives her a weary look
Don't, Stacy
Don't start
She jumps up, begins to pace, agitated
105
It's inside me
In my leg
My chest
can feel it
Right here
She stops pacing, lifts her shirt
She points to the base of her rib cage
(cont'd) See
Jeff stares; there's nothing there
He shakes his head
The knife is lying in the mud beside him, and Stacy steps forward, snatches it up
Jeff reaches to stop her, but he's too slow
She stands before him, hefting it
in her hand
Put it down
'll show you
She lifts her
shirt again, pressing at her rib cage with her fingertips
Jeff stands up, holds out his hand
Give it to me
Right now
Amy and Eric stand, too
-- But she's already cutting: a four inch slit along the base of her rib cage
Amy
horizontal line of blood crests the wound, sweeps down across Stacy's stomach, soaking into the waistband of her shorts
She watches it, frowning
thought it would just come tumbling out
She probes at the cut with the point of the knife, prying it farther open, the bleeding increasing
Jeff reaches, grabs the knife from her
He looks furious: Sit down
It's hiding
It's right-- She pokes her finger into the wound, digging
Jeff slaps her hand away
He : 106
a il hi12 f down i He shoves her down, onto her back, then picks up the towel he'd used to hold the heated stone
He balls it up, presses it to Stacy's wound
Eric retrieves the bottle of tequila from the mud, uncaps it
He crouches beside Stacy
Don't yell
she's just scared
'-- what're you doing
He's lifting the bottle toward Stacy's mouth, but he hesitates now, turning toward Jeff
Just a sip
To calm her
It'll dehydrate-her
sip, Jeff
He starts to lift the bottle again
Jeff shoves it aside
said
Leave him alone
She tries to sit up, but Jeff pushes her back down, hard
You realize how stupid you're being
Sticking that dirty knife -- It's growing
of ina's
inside you
You're imagining it, and you just-- 'm gonna end up like her
That girl
'm gonna-- 107
r - Get infected
Understand
You're gonna get yourself killed
You're not listening
-- (shouting, very loud) '
beat of startled silence, and then her voice comes again, from across the hilltop, sounding exactly like her, only slightly fuzzed, a rasping quality just beneath the words: ' '
They all turn to look, but there's nothing there, just the vine, its green leaves, its bright red flowers
Stacy's voice comes once more, from the
opposite direction now: '  (cont'd) '
What the-- Stacy's voice keeps coming, switching locations, seeming to float across the hilltop; they turn, tracking it
' '
' ' Amy steps toward Jeff, looking frightened
The Mayans
(shaking his head) No--it's the vine
It's mimicking her
Stacy has started to ; she covers her ears with her hands
Make it stop
108
' '
' ' Please
Make it stop
' '
' ' Stacy tries to sit up, but Jeff pushes her back down
Se's still crouched over her, pressing the towel to her wound; it's completely soaked through with blood now
Stacy : Shut up
Stacy's voice continues, but now that high-pitched is coming, too, a chorus of it, growing in volume: ' '
' ' Stacy's weeping has deepened to
She keeps : Shut up
Shut up
The  grows steadily , obscuring Stacy's voice: the flowers trembling, visibly vibrating as they sculpt the sound
/    - The light is fading fast
One of the Mayan women is cleaning a pot with a handful of leaves
Three of the men sit facing the hillside, their bows in their laps
The others are bedding down beneath the trees
The  echoes down the hill, eerie and ghoulish, yet the Mayans betray no reaction to it, as if it were no more worthy of note to them than the steady  of the locusts in the jungle at their backs
109
- Jeff, Stacy and Amy lie side-by-side in the darkness
The liquid  of Mathias's breathing comes from the clearing, sounding as if someone were sawing at a tin can
Jeff and Stacy are asleep; Amy is stirring restlessly, shifting first onto one side, then the other
Finally, she rises, moves toward the flap, slips quietly through it
-   - The moon is out, dropping its faint light upon us
Mathias is on his backboard beneath the little lean-to, more audible than visible, with his - breathing
Eric is beside him
He looks up as Amy emerges from the tent
Now is he
Eric shrugs, waves toward the backboard: it seems clear enough
Amy stares-for a moment, then sits beside him
(cont'd) You can go lie down if you want
Eric lifts his hand, pushes a button on his watch, makes it glow
He squints at it
still have forty minutes
don't mind
can't sleep
Eric checks his watch again, its glow briefly illuminating his face
He gestures toward the tent
Is Stacy
They both are
There's a slight breeze, and the tent makes a in it
They both turn to stare at it
Then: (cont'd) Do you think it's inside her
110
(he shakes his head) Jeff cut it out
saw him
But she says she can feel it
Moving
Shifting about
Eric waves this aside
You know how Stacy is
She's just scared
She gets things in her head, and--- Mathias makes a  sound--loud, wet, painful--and they both turn,apeering at his gaunt form through the darkness
He falls ; his eyes don't open
beat, then: (cont'd) 've been sitting here, you know, making all these deals in my head with God
You ever do that
Amy just stares at him
He has his arms wrapped around his knees, hugging them to his chest
(cont'd) Like  say, okay, you can fire me on the first day teaching if that's what you want--just let us make it home
But that doesn't mean shit, 'cause  don't even really want the job, and He has to know that, doesn't He
So  say, all right, Stacy can leave me, you know, or even,  don't know, 'll give up a finger, okay
Or two fingers
Or fuck it, take a hand, take my left hand, but let us just get home, all of us
(a beat) And then  look at him-- (he nods toward Mathias) --and  can't help it, 'm, like, take him if you need to, take Mathias, and let the rest of us go
That's fucking horrible, isn't it
And once 've said it,  feel like can't take it back, you know
() (cont'd) Like the words have gone up into the sky and God's sort of thinking about them now, making his choice, and if Mathias dies and we don't, it'll be
like  killed him, won't it
Like -- Amy starts to ; she covers her mouth with her hand
Eric stares at her in surprise
(cont'd) What
What is it
Amy shakes her head
She struggles to stop, but she can't
'm sorry
'm so sorry
(a beat) It's my fault
what is
If  hadn't stepped onto the hill-- Her crying
Eric leans, touches her hand
That's stupid, Amy
That's-- Jeff said it
He said-- Eric reaches, puts his arm around her, trying to quiet her
He didn't mean it
There's no way
He was just-- We might not have
Shh
Don't
She rests her head on his shoulder, , her body shaking with it, while he pats her, stroking her hair
112
- Stacy and Jeff, eyes shut, sleeping
Very , there comes a faint , rhythmic, furtive sounding
Stacy's eyes open; she lies there, listening
There's a , and the
Stacy rises to a sitting position
She listens for another beat, then leans, prods at Jeff
He awakes with a jerk, blinking up at her
Wh--
Stacy holds her finger to her lips, silencing him
From outside, there's another
Jeff sits up, listening
The is  toward a climax
Jeff leans toward the pile of supplies at the tent's rear, squinting at the tangle of vine growing across it
He points, : (cont'd) It's the-- But Stacy is already pushing herself to her feet
She moves quickly to the tent's flap,  it, crouches out into: -   - Mathias's breathing continues its  course
Amy is still leaning into Eric, her head on his shoulder
He has his arm around her
He looks up, blinking, as Stacy emerges from the tent into the moonlight
What the fuck, Eric
Amy lifts her head, wipes at her face; Eric drops his arm from her shoulder
They both stare at Stacy, startled by her anger
Jeff appears behind her, stepping through the flap
What
We heard you
Heard me what
Fucking her
113
Eric looks from Stacy to Jeff, completely perplexed
What're you talking about
The vine
it made it sound as if you two-- Stacy turns toward him, , shaking her head
You're so blind
could hear it
At the back of the tent
It was-- It doesn't make things up
It mimics things
Things it's heard
Then it's heard someone having sex at some point
Slowly, quietly, a tendril has begun to slither forward through the darkness, creeping in beneath the lean-to, snaking toward Mathias, toward his head
Jeff and the others are all too focused on one another to notice
That was Ay, Jeff
Moaning
What
Jeff reaches, touches Stacy's arm, struggling to calm her, but she flinches from him
it's doing this on purpose
' Can't you see
It thinks you're the weakest--because you're hurt
So it's trying to upset you
Trying -- You're not upset
He had his arm around her
He-- Amy leans forward, hands out, : 114
Nothing happened, Stacy
was crying
And Eric-- We he-ar you
The vine starts to push its way in between Mathias's lips, into his mouth
Mathias makes a  sound, but doesn't regain consciousness: once more, no one notices
We heard the vine
It-- You're such a fool, Jeff
You think she's never cheated on you
Perfect little angelic Amy
Stacy
could tell you secrets
could open your eyes
Shi i up
Right now
second tendril has slithered under the lean-to
It covers Mathias's nose, drawing itself tight
The steady rasping of his breathing is
Yet again, no one notices
Spring break
Senior year
You bitch
You stupid cunt
Stacy spins on her, : Fuck you
Slut
(back to Jeff) Twice, Jeff
Two different guys
And one of them-- Jeff grabs her arm, grips it, silencing hers Enough, Stacy
Stoll
115
Stacy falls ; she seems as astonished by what she's said as everyone else
(cont'd) Where do you think you are
Huh
Why would you even care--at this point, if they were out here fucking
We're trapped
We don't have any food
Or water
And -- He turns, stares: sees
He darts forward, starts to yank away the tendrils
They resist him, writhing, clinging to Mathias's face
Eric and Amy both jump up
Stacy has started to , shaking her head, : Oh, god
oh please no
Jeff bends close to Mathias's face, listening; he checks Mathias's neck for a pulse
beat, then he turns toward the others, shakes his head
Stacy begins to : (cont'd) 'm sorry
'm so sorry
Eric reaches, takes her into his arms, hugging her
/    --     - The hillside falls away from us, the narrow trail winding down its face to the clearing and the wall of jungle beyond
The sun is just rising, and the vine seems to shimmer in it
Three of the Mayan encampments are visible from here: one directly beneath us, one to the left, another to the right
Thin ribbons of smoke rise from their campfires
-     - Jeff stands there, staring down toward the jungle
Eric and Stacy are sitting together in the clearing behind him, holding hands; Stacy is still  softly
Amy approaches across the hilltop, stops beside Jeff
They must've salted the soil
That's the only way  can think
He turns, glances at Amy
She has no idea what he's talking about
He waves down toward the Mayans
116
(cont'd) To keep the ground clear
It grows so quickly
He gestures at their clothes, upon which that green webbing of vine continues to spread, eating away at the fabric
(cont'd) It's old, too--has to be
Really old
Because the birds, the insects
somehow they've evolved
They've learned not to land here
(he peers about them, at the vine-covered hill) And the horses
Remember
How frightened they were
They knew, too
They stand in silence for a beat, staring down the hill toward the Mayans
Then Amy reaches, touches Jeff's arm
It didn't happen
Jeff turns, stares at her
she waves back toward the tent
(cont'd) Eric and , we were just--- know
And what she said
About spring break
-- Jeff reaches, presses his finger to her lips
Shh
Amy falls silent, watching him
He lowers his finger
(cont'd) Have you made it up with her
Amy half-nods, half-shrugs
(cont'd) Good
But  want to tell you-- 117
He presses his finger to her lips again, stopping her
He waits a beat, and then: wish it mattered
Amy gives him a confused look
Jeff throws out his hand,
gesturing at the hilltop, the vine, their tattered clothes
(cont'd) Look at us
(a beat) Would it matter to you
Amy hesitates, considering
Then she shakes her head
And with that, Jeff turns, starts back toward the orange tent
a zipping sound, which carries over into: -   - Jeff is crouched beside the backboard,  the sleeping bag
Eric tosses the flimsy lean-to aside, exposing Mathias's corpse-to the sun
Amy and Stacy stand watching
Head first
Eric considers this, staring down at Mathias's body
Mathias's face is burned red from the vine's sap; his legs are two blackened stumps
Eric shrugs
guess
You'll have to lift him
Eric hesitates; he seems reluctant to touch the corpse
Finally, he girds himself, straddles the backboard, grabs Mathias under his armpits, lifting him
Jeff leans forward, starts to pull the sleeping bag over Mathias's head
The corpse seems intent upon resisting them; its arms keep getting tangled, catching and snagging
Jeff and Eric have to wrestle with it, both of them , sweating, before they manage to shove it into the bag
Jeff  the bag shut, and they stand over it, catching their breath, wiping the perspiration from their faces
Should we say something
118
Jeff gives him a blank stare
(cont'd) Like, you know
a prayer
Jeff frowns down at the bag, searching for words
Before he can find them, Stacy speaks: Where's the knife
They all turn
Her hand is under her tattered shirt, pressing at her lower back
Jeff : -- She lifts her shirt, twisting to show him
it looks as if a large starfish has been implanted just beneath her skin
It's moving, too, inching slowly but visibly downward
They all stare in astonishment
Amy , points at Stacy's leg
Stacy bends to see: there's more vine here, a snakelike lump winding its way upward from the top of her shin to her inner thigh
- Another small pile of clothes, burning with that blue, alcohol-fueled flame
(
) Can  give her some
The knife is placed in the fire, and     : -   - Amy holds up the bottle of tequila
Jeff is crouching over the fire, heating the knife's blade
Be glances toward her, nods
Stacy is sitting down, staring at the bulge in her leg with a dazed expression
Eric is beside her
Amy offers the bottle to Stacy;-they all watch as she takes a long swallow
Then she hands the bottle back to Amy, and Jeff pulls the knife from the fire, carries it toward her
He gestures to Eric and Amy
Hold her hands
119
They each take one of her hands
Jeff crouches over her leg
(cont'd) You might want to shut your eyes
Stacy shakes her head
want to see
Jeff hesitates; for a moment it seems-as if he might argue
But then, very quickly, he leans forward and draws the knife in one smooth movement up and around Stacy's leg
Stacy , her body tensing, but she doesn't cry out
The incision reveals the vine, a foot long, its leaves and flowers clotted with Stacy's blood, which is oozing from the wound
Jeff reaches in, pries the tendril from her flesh
Stacy  again, arching backward, as the vine emerges: writhing and twisting
The blood comes more thickly now, pumping from the wound, running down her leg
Jeff drops the tendril into the dirt, steps on it, grinding it into stillness
Stacy is breathing , almost hyperventilating
She's shut her eyes
Should  stop
Stacy shakes her head, vehemently
Jeff glances at the others
Eric shakes his head, too
Amy's eyes, like Stacy's, are tightly shut
(cont'd) You'll have to roll over
Stacy lets go of the others' hands, rolls onto her stomach
She hitches up her shirt, revealing the small of her back, the starfish-shaped bulge
Jeff crouches at her side
(cont'd) Ready
She nods, and he leans, makes five quick incisions, in the shape of an asterisk, directly above the bulge
Stacy's body goes rigid, and Eric takes her hand again
Once more, we can see the tendril through the incision: dark with her blood
Jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body
There's an astonishing amount of it; he has to drop the knife and use both hands to drag the slimy mass free
120
As the plant emerges from her body--thrashing, coiling and uncoiling, covered in half-clotted blood, like a newborn-- Stacy starts to
/    - The Mayans at their campsite: three of them on guard duty, the others napping in the shade beneath the trees
Stacy's echoes down the hill toward us
-   - They've pulled a shirt from one of the backpacks, torn it into strips, and used these to bandage Stacy's wounds, tying them around her leg and torso
She's lying on her side, eyes shut, her head in Eric's lap
He's stroking her hair
Jeff is counting the grapes into four separate piles
Amy sits watching him
When he finishes, he gestures for her to take a pile
Then he scoops Stacy and Eric's rations up, carries them over
Can you eat
Stacy sits up, wincing; her bandages are soaked through with blood
She takes the grapes from him; Eric does, too
They- all begin to eat, in silence
When they're done, Jeff passes the water bottle around their circle
Then: (cont'd) We should try to rest,  guess
(he waves toward the tent) Get out of the sun
We're losing moisture out-- There's more of it
She leans forward, probes at her right thigh, prodding the skin
The others watch her; there's no bulge visible, no sign of the vine-at all
Eric gives her a pained look
There's nothing there, Stacy
It's under the muscle
Down by the bone
121
She keeps pushing at her leg
She glances from Eric to Amy to Jeff
No one says anything
(cont'd) Cut me and see
Right here
She uses her finger to draw a line up her thigh
You're losing too much blood
And if any of these get infected--- My calf, too
she lifts her right leg, turning it to show the others
Jeff bends to look
Again, there's no visible sign of the vine
He shakes his head
No more cutting
Not unless--- The knife is in the dirt beside him, and Stacy leans forward, tries to grab it
Jeff is too quick for her, though: he snatches it up, tucks it into his belt
Stacy is becoming more and more upset
She holds out her hands, : Please, Jeff
You can't
You can't keep-- Stacy is starting to ; her mouth is trembling
It's everywhere
She's prodding at her body: her legs, her chest and stomach
Amy scoots toward her, grasps her hand
-- Stacy yanks her hand free, clutches her scalp, : It's in my head
can feel it in my head
Amy takes Stacy in her arms, hugging her tight
122
Shh
Stacy  into Amy's shoulder, her body jumping
Amy strokes her
Eric steps across the clearing, picks up the bottle of tequila
He glances at Jeff, and Jeff nods
(cont'd) You're scared, honey
You're just scared
You know
Stacy nods; she's still , but it's growing quieter
Eric crouches beside her, holds out the bottle of tequila
Stacy just stares at it
Amy encourages her: (cont'd) It'll help
Stacy accepts the bottle, takes a long swallow
Then another
The others watch her in silence
Finally: (cont'd) Can you rest some
In the tent
Stacy is silent
She wipes the tears from her face
That girl-- (she waves at the shaft) keep seeing her
When  shut my eyes
() know
know
(she stands up, holds out her hand) Let's just lie down for a bit
Okay
Stacy hesitates, staring up at Amy
Then she reaches, grasps her hand
Amy pulls her to her feet, helps her hobble across the clearing to the tent
Jeff and Eric sit-there, watching in silence as they vanish through the flap
- Sunlight filters through the orange nylon; all four of them lie sleeping in a row, sweating
The vine has shredded their clothes to tatters; they look like castaways
The tent's flap hangs open, billowing gently in a slight breeze
123
Stacy open her eyes
She lies there, staring up toward the orange nylon above her
The blood on her bandages has dried to a dark red, bordering on black
She sits up, stares about the tent
Eric is on one side of her, then Amy, then Jeff
Jeff is on his back, the knife still tucked into his belt
Stacy rises quietly, steps over Amy, crouches above him, staring down at the knife
She reaches, tries to slip it free, but then jerks back when Jeff shifts in his sleep
She hesitates, watching him
She seems as if she's about to try again, but then the tent flap billows in the breeze, drawing her gaze
beat, and she rises, steps carefully over Jeff, ducks outside into the clearing
-   - Stacy stands just beyond the tent's
flap
All is still, quiet
- She moves to Eric's pack, crouches over it, pulls out his phone
She flips it open, stares down at its screen: there's still no signal
She drops it back into the pack
She turns-to examine the clearing, her eyes falling upon the two backpacks from the blue tent
Their pockets are zippered open: Jeff and Eric's hurried pillaging during the downpour has scattered their contents across the dirt
Stacy rises, steps toward this tangled mound
She starts to dig through it, casually at first, but then with growing intensity, throwing -shirts and jeans and shorts aside, probing deeply into the pile
Suddenly she goes still
Staring
Amid the sodden mass of clothing sits a knife in a small scabbard
As Stacy crouches there, the vines start to , a rippling motion passing across them, as
if a wind were sweeping the hillside
Stacy watches with a look of horror: it looks like the pelt of some giant animal, shaking itself
When it finally stops, she bends, reaching for the knife
- Jeff, Eric, and Amy, still sleeping
The tent's flap continues to billow in the breeze
Very faintly, from the clearing,   a moan
Then the sound of
Eric opens his eyes, listening
An instant later, very abruptly, there comes a sharp, rending  of pure pain
Eric jumps up, starts for the flap; Jeff is right behind him
124
-   - Eric emerges from the tent, then Jeff, then Amy
They stand there, staring, too horrified to move
Oh my God
Stacy is on the far side of the clearing
She's pulled off her shirt, her shorts, and has cut much of the skin from her body
She doesn't notice them
She's bent over, slicing into her left thigh, peeling the skin back from the muscle
-- She turns, blood-streaked, wild-eyed, the knife in her hand; her skin is hanging from her in shreds
We can see her leg muscles, her abdominals, a glint of bone at her left elbow
Jeff starts forward, holding out his hand, very : Give it
Now
Eric follows him
Amy stays by the tent; she's begun to
Please, honey
Just-- Stacy shakes her head; she's , too, her whole body shaking
Her hair is matted with blood; she looks terrified
have to get it out
It's-- Jeff darts forward, tries to grab the knife from her, and she slashes at him, : (coat'd) Leave me alonel The blade slices into his palm
Jeff jumps back, cradling his hand at his chest
(cont'd) have to-- Eric steps toward her, from behind, reaching around her body for the knife, and she spins, reflexively, trying to fend him off
But the knife is in her hand, and it punches into his chest, just to the right of his sternum, sticking there
125
Eric looks at the knife in surprise
It's twitching back and forth with the beating of his heart
He starts to reach for it, but then his legs give out
He collapses, dropping to the dirt, which has grown muddy with Stacy's blood
Amy
Stacy's  deepens; she takes a step toward Eric, but then her own body fails her
She falls to her knees in the bloody puddle, reaching toward him
(cont'd) Oh, no
no
no
'm-- Eric is on his back; he struggles up onto one elbow
He tries to speak, but only a  sound emerges, blood frothing at his mouth
It's pumping thickly from his wound, too, saturating his shirt
(cont'd) didn't
Eric drops back again
He struggles  for breath
Jeff lowers himself to his knees beside him, hesitating impotently over him, uncertain what to do
Stacy is , shaking her head
There's blood everywhere
(cont'd) Kill me
Jeff turns, stares at her
Amy steps forward, crouches beside her
She takes Stacy's hand
Shh
Please
Just-- Shh
It hurts
It hurts so much
Eric tries to rise again
The blood surges from his wound when he moves
Jeff presses him back down
Easy
Try to-- Stacy clutches at Amy, begging, her voice  with pain: 126
Kill me
can't She stops in mid-sentence, staring
Jeff and Amy follow her gaze
half dozen tendrils are snaking into the clearing, reaching toward Eric's body
Jeff jumps to his feet
The tendrils begin to wrap themselves around Eric's limbs, and Jeff bends to tear them away
More and more keep coming, though
Eric has started to convulse, , his head cocked back
Jeff keeps yanking the tendrils away, but there are far too many of them; they coil around Eric's legs, pulling at him
The blood has stopped pumping from his wound; his body has gone still
Jeff She points toward the tent
Jeff turns to see
'  - The sleeping bag in which they'd enshrouded Mathias is moving: he's thrashing about within it, struggling to sit up
And he's , too, his voice  by the bag: ' He seems to be tearing at the bag with his arms
Jeff hesitates just for an instant, staring in astonishment, then he's sprinting across the clearing
He bends, struggles for the zipper
It's okay
'm right here
'm-- He  the bag, and an immense tangle of vine cascades out onto the dirt
Its flowers are a pale pink; they're opening and closing, still calling, louder now: ' The thick clot of tendrils writhes spasmodically, coiling and uncoiling
127
Entwined within it are Mathias's bones, already stripped clean of flesh
The vine falls
beat, then it starts to laugh, a low mocking
On the opposite side of the little clearing, Stacy begins to , shaking her head,
Jeff stands there, perfectly still
Amy is holding Stacy, struggling unsuccessfully to quiet her: Shh
Shh
The vine's laughter grows steadily
, punctuated by Stacy's : : Amy turns, stares at Jeff
Blood is running off Stacy's body in strings
The vine has dragged Eric to the edge of the clearing; only his head and torso are still visible
Jeff strides toward him
(cont'd) Jeff bends, yanks the knife from Eric's chest
Then he starts across the clearing toward Stacy
/    - The Mayans in their campsite
They're all staring up the hill, listening
Stacy's voice  toward us: (
) -- And then, abruptly, it goes
-   - Amy sits beside Stacy, who lies on her back in the puddle of blood, arms thrown out, the knife stuck hilt-deep in her chest
Eric's body is barely visible at the edge of the clearing; the vine  softly as it consumes him
128
Jeff is pulling their remaining supplies from his knapsack: the bananas, the raisins, the pretzels, the protein bars, the nuts, the water, iced tea, and Coke
He has a bloody strip of fabric tied around the wound on his hand
Amy watches as he arranges the food in front of her
She's silently, tears running down her dirt-smeared cheeks
Jeff peels one of the bananas: it's dark brown, far too ripe
He holds it out to her
She just stares at it
Come on
You'll need the energy
He reaches for her hand, puts the banana in it
She holds the fruit, but makes no move to eat
Finally,  : still think we should wait
Jeff : it's clear they've already been through this
You'll only get weaker
They'll come looking
You said '-- Nobody's coming
Our parents-- All they'll find are our bones
Amy is silent, staring down at the banana
(cont'd) We don't have time for this, Amy
You'll need as much daylight as possible
He waves upward, toward the sun, which has passed its peak, begun its slow slide westward
Amy squints toward it for a beat, and then, almost despite herself, lifts the banana to her mouth
She bites, chews, swallows, still mutely crying
Jeff peels the second banana; he hands it to her as soon as she finishes the first
Be watches her eat,
silent
He's tearing open the bag of pretzels when another tendril snakes into the clearing
129
They both watch it, neither of them moving
It's joined by a second tendril, then a third, a fourth;
the vines coil around Stacy's body, begin to drag it from the clearing
Amy's grows more forceful, her body shaking
(cont'd) Shh
Jeff reaches, strokes her
The vine pulls Stacy's body into itself, burying it
Amy watches, struggling to control
herself
Her voice emerges as little more than a : don't want to
don't
She shakes her head, wipes at her face: the tears, the snot, the sweat, the dirt
Her clothes are falling off her body, eaten to shreds
Jeff's, too
(cont'd) Why can't we both
Jeff hesitates a
beat
Then, clearly not believing it: We might
He hands her the pretzels; she takes them, watching his face
How
It'll take them a moment to react
If  can make it to the trees
He trails off, shrugs
Amy keeps staring at him; she doesn't believe this either
He  again, holds up his hand, pulls the bandage from his wound: it's three inches long, a deep gash into his palm
(cont'd) How long till it's inside me
Amy is silent
He flexes his hand, and the wound opens, mouthlike, blood oozing thickly from it
(cont'd) It already is, probably
'll be just like Stacy soon
He turns, glances toward the spot where her body has disappeared
Amy looks, too
130
(cont'd) Then what
You, all alone on this hill
you know how that would end, don't you
Once more, Amy is silent
He waves for her to keep eating, and she starts in on the pretzels, mechanically
He opens the can of Coke, hands it to her; she takes a long sip
(cont'd) Once you're in the jungle, you drop and hide
Another tendril slithers forward
It slips into the immense puddle of blood beside Jeff and Amy, begins to drink it
(cont'd) They'll never find you--it's too thick in there
Just burrow down, and they'll run right past
Jeff opens the can of nuts, sets it in front of Amy
Then he gets up, crouches over the puddle of blood
He cups
his hands, dips them into the puddle
He steps toward Amy, smears the blood across her -shirt
Amy keeps eating
(cont'd) It's sudden movements that'll get you caught
So take your time
You step, then listen
Then another step, and listen again
He moves back to the puddle, which the lone tendril continues' to drain
He cups his hands, scoops up more blood, smears it on her tattered khakis
Amy has finished the pretzels; she reaches for the nuts, looking numb
(cont'd) East, always east--keep the sun at your back
He scoops up more blood from the puddle
(cont'd)' Arms
Amy holds out her arms, and he smears the blood on them
(cont'd) You'll hear me yell
'll yell your name
131
He returns yet again to the puddle, then stands over her, the blood cupped in his hands, dripping
(cont'd) And you can't hesitate
Understand
Not for an instant
Amy nods, and he uncups his hands over her head
She shuts her eyes as the blood runs into her hair, down her forehead, her neck, her face
/    - Three of the Mayan men, as usual, sit in the clearing, bows in their laps, facing the hill
The others are sheltering from the sun in the line of shade along the jungle's margin, some sleeping, some talking quietly together
One of the men in the clearing suddenly rises to his feet, nocking an arrow
The other two also rise
The Mayans along the clearing fall silent, staring up the hill
'  - Jeff is approaching down the trail, carrying Amy, pieta-like, in his arms
Her body is limp, apparently lifeless, and dripping with blood
The bald Mayan emerges from the tree line, followed by yet another man with a bow
They join the other three Mayans in the center of the clearing
They all watch as Jeff reaches the base of the trail, where he carefully lays Amy down
Jeff crouches over Amy, laying her arms across her chest, pushing the hair from her face
He bends, kisses her blood- smeared forehead
Then he glances up at the Mayans
You don't even know her name
The Mayans just stare at him
He rises to his feet, pulling the knife from his belt: it's darkly stained with
blood
(cont'd) You should
You should know who you're killing
132
He steps out into the clearing
The bald Mayan pulls his pistol from its holster, raises it, aiming at Jeff's chest
The others draw their bows
Jeff smiles, taps his sternum
(cont'd) Jeff
Understand
My name's Jeff
He edges along the clearing's margin, keeping close to the vines, moving away from Amy's body
The Mayans follow him, weapons raised
After a handful of steps, he stops again, turns toward them
(cont'd) Can you say it
Huh
Again, the Mayans just stare
He  at his chest
(cont'd) Jeff
beat, then he suddenly , waving the knife at the men
(cont'd) Silence
The Mayans stand there with their weapons raised, waiting to see what he might do
beat, then he starts walking once more, along the clearing's edge, away from Amy
Another ten yards and he stops again, waves up the hill
(cont'd) There's Stacy, too
And Eric
Mathias
And Henrich
You've killed them all
He steps toward them
The bald man raises his hand, holds it up, palm out, next to his pistol
Jeff smiles at him again
(cont'd) But not everyone
He , a little wildly, and shakes his head
(cont'd) Look at you, you stupid fucks
You have no idea what 'm saying, do you
He takes another step into the clearing
The bald man his pistol, loudly
Several of the other Mayans have emerged from the jungle; they stand there watching
133
(cont'd) One of us is gonna survive
You should know that name, too
You fuckers
You bastards
He takes yet another step forward
The bald man speaks a string of words  , with an edge of warning
More Mayans emerge from-the jungle, shielding their eyes against the sun, staring
No one is looking in Amy's direction
(cont'd) It's not Jeff
He shakes his head, his voice dropping, almost to a : (cont'd) It's not me
He takes another step
And then, still : (cont'd) It's Amy
You hear
He takes a deep breath, gathering himself
Then he -- (cont'd) ; --and starts to run, straight at the Mayans
He only manages three steps before the bald man  his pistol, and the others let their arrows fly
The bullet hits Jeff in the chest, just beneath his throat
One of the arrows misses; the other three strike his stomach, his left arm, his right thigh
Before he even hits the ground, there's a  from the Mayans along the treeline
The bald man turns
Amy is on her feet, sprinting for the jungle
The bald man raises
his pistol, , but the shot is too hurried; it goes wide
The others are still scrambling for fresh arrows as she vanishes into the trees
The bowmen sprint after her, disappearing into the jungle, leaving the bald man alone in the clearing with Jeff
The Mayan women stand motionless along the treeline, staring
after Amy: they look mortified, grief-stricken
Jeff is bleeding heavily from his wounds, struggling to crawl forward, his breath frothing pinkly at his lips
half dozen tendrils slither into the clearing
They coil around his legs, start to drag him back toward the hill
Jeff fights them, kicking, , bleeding
134
The bald man watches
He, too, looks grief-stricken
He steps forward, aims at Jeff's head
As he , : footsteps, moving quickly down a tiled floor
(
) (a slight Spanish accent) She flagged down a tour bus, just west of Coba-- The voice   into: -  - Mexican , in his late fifties, balding, a little stooped, his white jacket buttoned over a shirt and tie, is hurrying down the corridor, accompanied by , a dark- haired woman in beige slacks, a blue blouse
Teresa has- a leather briefcase, a Blackberry on her belt
She's holding Amy's passport,
which she examines as they walk
It's smeared with dried blood
--and collapsed before the driver even managed to open the door
The corridor is brightly lit, very clean
Rooms open off it on either side, and we glimpse the still
forms of sleeping patients as we pass, IVs hanging from metal stands beside their beds
It's very quiet
(cont'd) She revived briefly, just after they brought her in
She was in bad shape--severely dehydrated, traumatized, in shock
And terribly frightened
It was impossible to make any sense of what she was saying
She was sobbing, hysterical
We had to sedate her
The doctor has a manila folder under his arm; he opens it, pulls out a piece of paper: a color printout of a digital photo
He hands it to Teresa
(cont'd) Her clothes were torn; she was covered in blood
But not her own
135
Teresa stares down at the photo: it shows Amy on a gurney, unconscious, blood-smeared, corpse-like
Now do you know
She has no wounds
uniformed policeman sits on a chair outside one of the rooms at the end of the corridor, reading a newspaper
He rises as they approach
Teresa hands the printout back to the doctor; she keeps the passport
That's it
That's all you have
'm afraid so
Be nods to the policeman, and leads Teresa into: - bed, a night stand, a curtained window
Amy lies with a sheet pulled to her chin, unconscious, an  dripping into her arm
They've cleaned the blood off her
sits in a chair beside the bed
She's in her early twenties, with long dark hair tied in a bun
She stands up, stepping back from the bed, as the doctor and Teresa enter
The doctor addresses her in  : Has she stirred
The nurse shakes her head
The doctor moves to the bed
He takes Amy's wrist, feeling for her-pulse
Amy's eyes open at his touch
She stares at him, her arm hanging limply in his grasp
He smiles down at her
(cont'd) There you are
Teresa steps forward, and Amy's gaze shifts to her
(cont'd) My name is Dr
Hernandez
Amy's eyes return to the doctor;
they fall on his face, then drift down to his chest
The doctor gestures toward Teresa: 136
(cont'd) And this is Ms
Bern, from the
Consulate
Amy is staring at his white coat, her expression going slack, almost catatonic, all the life draining from it
(cont'd) we were hoping you might be able to shed a little light on what you've been through
Amy is silent, still staring with that dead look in her eyes at the doctor's coat: a faint green web of vine has taken root there, spreading across the white fabric
