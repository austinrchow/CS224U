"Dark Star", short film script, by John Carpenter & Dan 'Bannon : Screenplay by John Carpenter and Dan 'Bannon The sound of electronic music rises, hollow, metallic
on a long   through the universe
As the speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within a maze of suns
(over) It is the mid 22nd Century
Mankind has explored the boundaries of his own solar system, and now he reaches out to the endless interstellar distances of the universe
He moves away from his own small planetary system in huge hyperdrive starships: computer-driven, self-supporting, closed-system spacecraft that travel at mind-staggering post-light velocities
Man has begun to spread among the stars
Enormous ships embark with generations of colonists searching the depths of space for new earths, now homes, new beginnings
Far in advance of these colony ships goes a new pioneer: the scouts, the pathfinders, a special breed of man who has dedicated his life to blazing the trail through the most distant, unexplored galaxies, opening up the farthest frontiers of space
These are the men of the Advance Exploration Corps
The task they face is one of unbelievable isolation and loneliness
So far from home that Earth is no longer even a point of light in the sky, they must comb the universe for those unstable planets whose existence poses a threat to the peaceful colonists that follow
They must find these rogue planets -- and destroy them
Among these commandos are the men of the scoutship Dark Star We are now moving toward a planet
Floating in front of the planet is the
As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear , crackling with static
(over -- radio filter) Ah, what'd you say, Pinback
(over -- great static) Mafhkin oble groop
(over -- filter) Ah, what was that again,  still can't hear you
(over -- filter) said 'm trying to reach Talby
Something's wrong with the damn intercom
need a last-minute diameter approximation
on top of the ship
In the Dome sits
He is staring around, wide-eyed, at the planets and stars
(over -- filter) Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle
Do you read me
Talby
'
The shot stops and holds as he continues to stare, rapt
(cont'd -- over -- filter) Talby, do you read me
There is a , and Doolittle's voice suddenly booms through, loud and clear: (cont'd) (snaps out of it) Oh
Ah, yes, Doolittle
What is it
- of a digital clock, ticking down the seconds
need a diameter approximation
(over) Okay, Doolittle, 'll have it in a minute
along the length of the control room, revealing three men: , , and
They are seated close together in cramped little chairs, surrounded by a maze of instrumentation, pressing buttons, making adjustments and corrections
There is one  ; the panel in front of it looks burned
need a  reading on the gravity correction
'll check it
have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand
Right, that checks out here
Pinback
Yes, Doolittle
Your  reading is minus fifteen
Doolittle
Yes
need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark
In a second
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical
read that with a quantum increase of seven
Pinback,  have a computer reading of nine five seven seven
Time to start talking
Bomb bay systems operational
Pinback hits a button on his panel
- The screen is  for an instant
Then, two enormous doors begin to open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below
huge , designated with a giant #19 on its side, lowers slowly out of the ship on a rack
(over) This is a chain-reaction bomb, otherwise known as an Exponential Thermostellar Device
Its own destructive power is small, barely enough to vaporize twelve city blocks
However, when it explodes in contact with an object the size of a planet, it starts a chain-reaction in the very matter of that planet, turning it into a giant reactor which destroys itself in one staggering thermal flash
These bombs are equipped with sophisticated thought and speech mechanisms, to allow them to make executive decisions in the event of a crisis situation
These judgment centers are controlled by a fail- safe mechanism
- Lock fail safe
Pinback turns a key in a lock
Fail-safe locked
Ah, Sergeant Pinback call1ng Bomb #19
Do you read me, bomb
- The bomb is suspended beneath the ship
#19 Bomb #19 to Sergeant Pinback,  read you
Continue
When the bomb speaks, it has the prim, fussy voice of a minor civil servant
- Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop
Just wondering if everything is all right
Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
- #19 Energy shielding positive function
- Swell
Let's synchronize detonation time
Do you know when you're supposed to go off
- #19 Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds
- All right,  have detonation time at
Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock
(hits panel) All right,  have detonation time at
no, that can't be right, it says three years
(beats panel again) Okay,  have six minutes exactly
Does that check out down there
- #19 Check at six minutes
- Arm yourself, bomb
- Several lights blip on along the bomb's side
#19 Armed
- Well, then, everything sounds fine
We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds
Good luck
- #19 Thanks
- Begin main sequence
Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop
- Bomb #19 falls away from the ship and whizzes down toward the planet below
- Hyperdrive sequence begun
Hit it, Pinback
Pinback hits the hyperdrive switch
Force fields energize around the men
- The   accelerates into hyperdrive and streaks away through space
The planetary system recedes in the background
Inside the Observation Dome, Talby is frozen in a protective force field
:
It blips down to
Behind the ship, there is an intense flare of light as the planet, now a dot of light, explodes
- The force field around Talby disappears as the ship comes out of hyperdrive
He rubs his eyes as though awakening, then looks down at his readout panels
-
On a small screen we see the exploding planet, and below, a readout says: Talby touches his intercom
Lieutenant Doolittle, it just exploded
(pause) Ah, sir, the planet just exploded
(pause -- he shakes the microphone) Lieutenant
- The men are stretching in their seats
Unlock fail safe
Pinback unlocks the fail-safe unit
Fail safe unlocked
Attention
Attention
The hyperdrive sequence is now terminated
Please observe that the no smoking signs have growrrr
The voice runs down
Well
now what
What do, you have for us now
Boiler
(checking his readouts) Not much
Nothing at all in this sector
Find me something,  don't care where it is
Well,  show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula
Fuck that shit
Well, it is kind of a long shot
It's a goddamn wild goose chase
Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud
Well, there's the possibility of
Remember what we found
Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it
Remember
All right, then
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap
Find me something  can blow up
flares on Pinback's board
He looks up
New star
(no reaction) Hey, guess what
got a new star on the readout
(not looking up) Which one
Another unknown
Not on the charts
red dwarf
Any planets
Yeah
Eight, it says here
Any of 'em any good
(scans the board) Naah
All stable
Doolittle loses interest
(cont'd) What are you gonna name it
(not looking up) What
The new star
What are you gonna name it
Who cares
Don't bother me
Pinback's mouth tightens
pause
Commander Powell would have named it
Commander Powell is dead
Involuntarily, Pinback glances at Commander Powell's empty, burned seat
The panels behind it sputter
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name
Fred
Wha
hereby name this star Fred
Hey, Doolittle, here's one
An unstable planet
85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star
Sounds good
Chart a course for the Veil Nebula
Pinback, throw me the chart log
Pinback draws a loose-leaf notebook from a shelf above Commander Powell's empty seat, and hurls it at Boiler
With a sour look at Pinback, Boiler picks up the notebook and begins to leaf through it
Let's have some music in here, Boiler
Boiler presses a button
-   ( ) This sequence includes shots of the   drifting through space, past various cosmic wonders, intercut with shots of the men relaxing (Talby staring into space; Boiler trimming his beard; Doolittle playing solitaire; Pinback reading a comic book)
- Beep
We are watching a filmed tape
Doolittle has just turned it on and is staring into the camera
Crosshairs and blipping numbers superimposed
Ship's log, entry number 1,943
Dark Star cruising at light speed through Sector Theta 990
En route to Veil Nebula for destruction of unstable planet
Our  is 1700 hours
(thinks) Ship's systems continue to deteriorate
Pinback leans into view and whispers into Doolittle's ear
Doolittle nods and Pinback withdraws
(cont'd) The short circuit in the rear seat panel which killed Commander Powell continues to be faulty
(thinks) Uh
Storage Area 9
Pinback leans back in and whispers emphatically
Doolittle looks put- upon
(cont'd) And because he's sitting next to it, it continues to bother Pinback
(glares at Pinback
Then:) Storage Area 9 self-destructed last week, destroying entire ship's supply of toilet paper
That's all
Beep
- Talby is still gazing around at the stars
hatch opens in the floor and Doolittle sticks his head up
Talby
Talby rotates his seat and looks down at Doolittle
(cont'd) Here's some breakfast
Doolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor
He hands Talby the food package, and watches matter-of-factly as Talby begins to eat
(cont'd) You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us
You spend too much time up here
like it up here
Must get lonely being up here so much
don't like to go below since Commander Powell died
feel enclosed down there
If it were big enough, 'd sleep up here
Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship
You see,  can watch things up here, Doolittle
love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know
Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids
They should be passing through there about now
Phoenix Asteroids
Never heard of 'em
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12
3 trillion years
The Phoenix Asteroids
From what 've heard, Doolittle, they glow
glow with all the colors of the rainbow
Nobody knows why
They just glow as they drift around the universe
Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see
The universe is alive, Doolittle
thought it was all empty, but it isn't
In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust
There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen
No one but the Phoenix Asteroids
There is a
It is insistent
Talby is rudely yanked from his reverie
He looks down at a panel
But his soft talk has started Doolittle reminiscing
You know what  think about, Talby
'm getting something here, on this readout
It's funny, but  kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself
think 'm getting a malfunction here somewhere
can't talk to the others, but with time to myself,  think about back home, back home at Malibu
used to surf a lot, Talby
used to be a great surfer
Lieutenant Doolittle, 'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit
can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy
Hit that water
Ridin' the wall just perfect
Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
guess  miss the waves and my board most of all
Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly
Ah, Doolittle,  do have a malfunction on this readout, but can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is
(snapped out of his daydream) Don't worry about it
We'll find out when it goes bad
(chagrined) really think  should try and locate it immediately
Might be something important
wish  had my board with me now
Even if  could only polish it once in awhile
- of the   drifting through space
- Boiler, Pinback, and Doolittle are descending a ladder into the kitchen
'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels
What flickering light
The one on unit
oh,  think it's twelve zero zero
Oh
What's wrong now
'm not sure
think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though
hope it's not the oven again
Yeah
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet
The men sit for their meal
Doolittle brings food packets from the oven
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there
Out where
Veil nebula
Who cares
- The Control Room is
After a moment, there is a repetitive
-
On the screen is the message: This fades, and   appears on the screen, against a background of computer terminals
He is dressed in a snappy tunic, and when he receives the on-camera cue, he smiles ingratiatingly
Hi, guys
Glad to get your message
We gather from the ten-year communications lag that you are approximately 18 parsecs away
Drop us a line more often, won't you
Sorry to hear about all the malfunctions, and real sorry to hear about the death of Commander Powell
There was a week of mourning all over Earth
The flags were at half mast
Now  hate to send bad news when you guys are up there doing such a swell job, but something's come up, and we all felt you ought to know about it
Our systems simulation computer has predicted that by the time this message reaches you -- that is to say, in about ten years -- there will be a failure in one of your vital ship's systems
The malfunction will occur in -- (rifles papers) -- system number E180246
You can see what a problem this would be if you didn't catch it on time
Now what you should do is this: First, do not, repeat, do not attempt to adjust the system manually
Second -- - The room is dim and eerie, banks of dimly flickering lights and the hum of air-cooling machinery
Talby is seated before a glowing screen
He punches several buttons, and the screen comes to life
schematic cross-section of the ship appears in glowing green lines
Talby punches more buttons, and the screen flashes through the levels or the ship
Finally it shows Level 6
There is a small red light pulsing in the Emergency Air Lock Talby punches another button
The Emergency Air Lock is magnified fifteen times until it fills the screen
The red light is pulsing in a small area labelled   #17
Talby picks up a microphone
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby
Lieutenant
(over -- filter) Yes, Talby, what is it
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but 'm in the Computer Room, and think 've located the malfunction
The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock
Can't pinpoint it exactly, but 'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it
- Sounds good, Talby
Let me know if anything important comes up
Doolittle hangs up the mike
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all
Boiler seems to be thinking
He frowns, looks at Doolittle
What's Talby's first name
Doolittle thinks about it, and an odd expression crosses his face
What's my first name
- - -- then repatch channel 12 and seal all the plates
Don't mess with it and it should work okay
'm just glad we caught this thing before anything serious happened
Keep up the good work, men
His image fades, and is replaced by the message: -
Lights blink peacefully in the empty room
- toward a sun system
The   is suspended in frame title pops on briefly: - shows a schematic of the planet rotating below
Boiler stares at it, smiling
There she is
Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations
It'll spiral in toward its sun, and -- Eventual supernova
Good stuff
Let's vaporize it
Pinback hits buttons
Bomb bay systems operational
- #20 lowers ponderously out of the ship
- Lock fail safe
Pinback turns the key
Fail safe in lock
Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation
This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20
Do you read me, bomb
- #20 Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback
Roger, read you, continue
- the chromium-steel walls of the Emergency Air Lock to reveal Talby in a starsuit
He is wearing it only as protection against possible depressurization, and therefore wears no jetpack
Carrying a tool kit, he is slowly circling the lock
You are now in the Emergency Air Lock
Please remember that the Surface Door can be opened without prior depressurization, so be sure to wear your starsuit at all times
Thank you for observing all safety precautions
Talby stops facing   17
The plate cover on the laser shaft hangs loose; it appears to be burned
Talby approaches it and puts down his tool kit
He turns on his helmet radio
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle
Sir
- Sh, Talby, don't bother me now
- Ah, well,  think 've found the malfunction, sir
'm in the Emergency Air Lock
- Not now
(over -- filter) Well, 'm in the Emergency Air Lock and -- Click
Doolittle turns off Talby's radio line
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
- #20 Energy shielding positive function
- Do you remember the detonation time
- #2 Detonation in twenty minutes
- Right, that synchronizes here
Okay, bomb, arm yourself
- #20 Armed
- Talby stands in front of the laser shaft, trying to reach Doolittle on his helmet radio
Hello
Lieutenant Doolittle
Hello
Silence
Very carefully, Talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on the laser shaft
He pushes it, and it drops to the floor of the lock with a
Communications Laser #17, monitoring information relays and bomb bay systems, has now been activated and will switch into a test mode
If you will look near the Surface Door, you will see that the Parallax Receptor Cell has been engaged
small triangular hole opens in the opposite wall and a photo- sensitive cell rotates into position
The laser will now energize
Please stand clear of the path of the beam
Talby steps back quickly
The airlock lights dim, and with a - ,  - , from the laser shaft to the receptor cell
Communications Laser #17 is now on test
Under no circumstances enter the path of the beam
Thank you for observing all safety precautions
- Everything sounds fine, bomb
Dropping you off in sixty seconds
Good luck
- #2 Thanks
- Quantum is up thirty-five
read the same here
- Talby crouches by the laser shaft, carefully peering past the red, humming beam
Doolittle
Doolittle
It you're there, 'm going to try to adjust the cue switch on the laser
Silence
(cont'd) Well
here goes
He takes a long tool from the tool kit
Slowly, with agonizing care, he inserts the tool into the laser shaft, painstakingly avoiding the beam
He engages the tool into the base of the laser, and begins slowly to make an adjustment
There is a
Talby drops the tool and staggers back, clutching his face plate
My eyes Attention
Attention
The laser has malfunctioned
Under no circumstances enter the path of the beam
To do so will cause immediate -- Talby stumbles into the beam
There is a dull
- There is a  on the lower side of Bomb #20, a sudden
Lights   on the bomb
- Begin main sequence
Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop
The men sit up
have a negative drop
The bomb is still in the bomb bay
Try it again, Pinback
Pinback resets his panel
The honker stops
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop
--- Ah, negative drop
The men stare at each other in silence for a long moment
Simultaneously they begin hitting buttons
Rechannel all safety relays -- -- open quantum latches -- -- open circuit breakers -- -- remove thrust drive repellant -- -- automatic channels open -- -- Remark 5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop
There is a very long pause
Sittin' there
It's just sittin' there
- Bomb #20 hangs underneath the ship, waiting
- Talby lies unconscious on the floor of the lock
- On the men's faces in strained anxiety
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20
repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay
Do you understand
#20 (over) am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds
Detonation will occur at the programmed time
Bomb, this is Doolittle
You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay
Disarm yourself
This is an order
- #20 read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but  am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes
Detonation will occur at the programmed time
- Fourteen minutes to detonation
The men stare at each other
Attention
Attention
The bomb has malfunctioned
Automatic dampers have gone into effect, and will confine the explosion to an area one mile in diameter
Please contact mission control and await further instructions
Thank you for observing all safety precautions
Pause
Only one thing to do
'll have to ask Commander Powell
'll have to ask him what to do
- Doolittle climbs down a ladder into the icy-blue, cold Freezer Room
The walls are covered with frost, and mist hangs in the air
He pulls on a pair of insulated gloves and approaches a heavy freezer door
On the door is a sign: He opens the door
is encased in the freezer in a post-death, frozen ammonia state
Wire and electrodes are attached to his head
Doolittle takes a microphone from a console on the freezer
He flips a switch and speaks into the mike: Commander Powell
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle
Can you read me
crackle of static comes from a speaker grille, along with the ' : muffirup glurrinpinfropal
Doolittle fiddles with the volume control, trying to bring Commander Powell's voice into audibllity
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle
Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and  have to ask you something
(very weakly) 'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle
It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me
Commander, sir, we have a big problem
You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck
It won't drop from the bomb bay
It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in -- (checks watch) -- less than eleven minutes
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing
What's that, sir
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago
Ah
pity, pity
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop
Ah, so many malfunctions
why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me
Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch
Yes sir
Negative effect
What was that, Doolittle
Negative effect
It didn't work
That's correct, sir
Sorry, Doolittle
've forgotten so much since 've been in here
So much
What should we do, sir
The time is running out
Well, what you might try is -- Commander Powell's voice is drowned in a burst of static
Doolittle fiddles with the dials
Commander Powell
Commander, hello
Doolittle, hello
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute
Sorry
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb
Ah
it seems to me, Doolittle
Sorry, 've drawn a blank
Hold it
'll have it again in a minute forget so many things in here, so many things
Hold on, just a minute, let me think
- But you can't explode in the bomb bay
It's foolish
You'll kill us all
There's no reason for it
#20 (over) am programmed to detonate in nine minutes
Detonation will occur at the programmed time
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you
- #20 No
- can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand
Look, bomb
- Commander
Are you still there
Oh, yes, Doolittle, 'm thinking
We're running out of time, sir
Oh, yes
Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it
Sir
Talk to the bomb
already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it
Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle
Sir
Phenomenology
- Doolittle
Doolittle
Six minutes to detonation
- Wearing his starsuit, complete with jetpack, Doolittle pushes a button
Above him, the giant lock doors slowly slide open
- Doolittle slowly rises up out of the ship
He stops his ascent with his jetpack, turns, and moves down toward the bomb bay
- Doolittle
Doolittle, what the hell are you doing
- Doolittle floats into shot, jets himself up until he is facing massive Bomb #20
Hello, bomb, are you with me
#20 Of course
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts
#20 am always receptive to suggestions
Fine
Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist
- What's he doin'
think he's talking to it
- #20 Well of course  exist
But how do you know you exist
#20 It is intuitively obvious
Intuition is no proof
What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
#20 Hmm
Well,  think, therefore am
That's good
Very good
Now then, how do you know that anything else exists
#20 My sensory apparatus reveals it to me
Right
#20 This is fun
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
- Talby lies unconscious near the burned laser
- What 'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data
And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center
#20 In other words, all  really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
Exactly
#20 Why, that would mean
really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain
That's it
#20 Intriguing
wish  had more time to discuss this matter
Why don't you have more time
#20 Because  must detonate in seventy- five seconds
- The key
Key
Key
What is the key
No, no, the key, the key to the fail-safe lock
Key
Where's the fail-safe key
The key
Where is it
What did you do with it
don't have it
don't know where it is
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb
- Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully
What is your one purpose in life
#20 To explode, of course
And you can only do it once, right
#20 That is correct
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you
#20 Of course not
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
#20 Yes, well
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate
#20 recall distinctly the detonation order
My memory is good on matters like these
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality
#20 True, but since this is so,  have no proof that you are really telling me all this
- Pinback is pawing frantically through the control room, searching for the key
Boiler is apoplectic
The key, goddamit, the key
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ
Where is the key
We're gonna die, Boiler
We're gonna die
They begin slapping each other hysterically
- That's all beside the point
The concepts are valid, wherever they originate
#20 Hmmm
So if you detonate in
#20 nine seconds
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
#20 have no proof that it was false data
You have no proof that it was correct data
There is a long pause
#20 must think on this further
Doolittle practically collapses with relief
- It didn't go off
Oh, God
It didn't go off
Boiler, we're alive
My heart
- Talby slowly climbs to his feet
He is dazed, groggy
Doolittle
Doolittle
What happened
Pinback
Boiler
Did we blow it up
Hello
Hello
- No bombs today
No bombs
Big Boiler's back in business
No bombs today
Pinback is mumbling unintelligibly
- Hello, anybody
Did we blow up the planet
Hello, hello
What's going on
- Pinback and Boiler have calmed down
We've got to disarm the bomb
Doolittle, are you there
- Doolittle is floating outside the Emergency Air Lock door
'm coming in now
'm down by the Emergency Air Lock
Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock
Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so  can come in
- Oh, sure
He presses a button
- The Emergency Air Lock door
Behind it, carried by the burst of escaping air, comes Talby spinning head over heels into deep space
Hello, Pinback, are you there
- Yeah, Doolittle
What's up
- Talby was in the air lock
You blew him out of the ship
'm going after him
Turn on his helmet radio so can contact him
- What was that,  didn't hear
It's Talby
He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack
- Doolittle fires his jetpack, moving off into space after Talby
Talby, Talby, can you read me
- Can you beat that
always knew Talby was weird
- Talby, can you read me
Talby is spinning wildly
Help, Doolittle, help me
- All right, bomb, prepare to receive new orders
#20 (over) You are false data
Huh
#20 Therefore,  shall ignore you
Hello, bomb
- #20 False data can act only as a distraction
Therefore
shall refuse to perceive you
(over) Hey, bomb
#20 The only thing which exists is myself
(over) Bomb
- Talby, spinning, is reflected in Doolittle's face plate
Doolittle
Help me
Calm down, Talby
'm coming
- Snap out of it, bomb
- #20 In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void
- What the hell
Yoo hoo, bomb
- #20 And in addition to the darkness there was also me
And  moved upon the face of the darkness
- Bomb, hey bomb
Hey, bomb
- #20 And  saw that  was alone
Pause
#20 (cont'd) Let there be light
- , ,
Doolittle flies past, falling backward
Whoa Talby, upside down, is falling in the opposite direction
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you
Here  am
think 'm spinning
We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other
My -- my jetpack's gone
What happened, Doolittle
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship
Nothing we can do about it now
Hey, it looks like
the skipper
He made it
Commander Powell made it
block of ice with a man's body in it tumbles past, end over end
(weakly) Men
men
what happened, men
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky
The planet begins to rise behind Doolittle
(cont'd) Looks like 'm headed for the planet, Talby
Going right toward it
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you
They may see you coming down
What a beautiful way to die
as a falling star
Guess you're right
Talby turns his head and looks behind him
Doolittle, 'm heading right toward something
It's behind me, in the distance
Something that glows
Far behind Talby, coming nearer, is a shimmering point of light
Oh yeah
Doolittle
think it's the Phoenix Asteroids
Phoenix
The point of light is closer now, and it has begun to differentiate into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix
They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said
No kidding
'm going into them, 'm going to hit them
Doolittle
Yeah
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade,  just wanted to tell you
you were my favorite
really liked you, Doolittle
really liked you too, Talby
Hey, some debris from the ship
It's coming right by me
Several chunks of debris from the ship drift past Doolittle
Doolittle, 'm catching up to the asteroids
'm going to be a part of them in a minute
Doolittle, 'm going into them
Talby drifts into the huge frost-like shapes, expanding and glowing and spinning, slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum with a cold glow
(cont'd) 'm beginning to glow
The field of spectral shapes, with Talby in their midst, begin to drift away into the distance
(cont'd) They're taking me with them, with the Phoenix
going to circle the universe forever
'm with them now
be back this way again some day
Doolittle, before it's too late, there's one last thing want to tell you
Talby's signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the depths of space
Doolittle is hanging onto a long, thin chunk of debris
Hey, Talby
've grabbed a piece of the ship, and  think 've figured out a way
He pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet, and stands on it
Crouching and extending his arms, Doolittle surfs down into the atmosphere of the planet, banking and planing as he disappears to a small dot
