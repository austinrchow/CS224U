: Sick, cutting out early
The hell you are
Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered
(') Get back to work or your ass is fired
Aaa n
You say that every time
Blaze kicks-starts the bike
It  thunderously
(over the noise) Well  mean it this time
(gunning the throttle) See you tomorrow, Little Mike
The bike , hauls up on its back wheel
Screams out the shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears

Clearly, they're friends with Blaze
() Skin of your teeth, man
(tapping his watch) Yeah, we're on a tight schedule
So what are you waiting for
Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust
: 3
- thunders across the landscape
To the East Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course
Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to the tracks
Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted container car
He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his saddles bags -- -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand
The heavy iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia
Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away -- -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max
He jams the front brake on at the last possible moment -- The bike cartwheels
Tail over head
Pulls a complete three- sixty up into the car -- -- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt
Blaze his exhilaration
And if you don't believe this, watch extreme motocross as we  : being wrenched aside, revealing Coop's pickup holding steady alongside the train
Jed and Murphy ride the cargo bed like surfers
Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck
Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em
We get glimpses of the loot:  Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage -- Christ, Mickey was right on the money
Car twenty-two
() Candy from a baby
The boxes keep coming, like baggage at the airport
Some boxes miss the mark, fall short, get mangled
box bursts against Murphy's chest, engulfs him in an explosion of paper and polystyrene beads
The others howl with , riding high on this Great Train Robbery as - - (      ) 4

He  a , far in the distance, burning towards them
Thank you gentlemen, that's it for today
Jed bangs on the cab roof
Coop waves
Jed and Murphy salute
The pickup peels away
Blaze retrieves his bike
Stands it back up, kicks it alive, guns the throttle and -- -- cold jumps straight out of the car
Seconds later he's powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards the horizon
Far, far behind, the police are still coming
: -   - (50s) are eating Chinese food with their daughter,  (20s) and Blaze
Roxanne is beautiful, easygoing
She's also seven months pregnant
The Simpsons are simple, working-class folk
Judging by the strained atmosphere, it's evident that they don't care too much for Blaze
( ) Hon, would you pass me the vegetables
Chuck obliges, takes a drink of his beer, nods to Blaze
So how're things going at the shop, John
(scarfing down his food) Good, good
(not buying it) Yeah
Cause Mike says you've been slacking off, horsing around
(annoyed, protective) __ ( ) It's okay, Rox
() : Blaze sets his fork down, wipes his mouth with his napkin
Conjures up his best earnest look
(') Truth is, Mr
Simpson, 've been thinking about clearing out of there
Maybe opening up a shop of my own -- Roxanne raises an eyebrow at this
News to her
(' ) See, 've been saving up
You know, for the baby and all
And -- Roxanne rises to get it
You were saying
(distracted, looking to the ) Right, so anyway -- (
) -- Blaze looks over
Two Sheriff's Deputies,   and , are standing in the doorway
Roxanne looks pissed -- like this isn't the first time this has happened
Blaze stands, approaches
Clearly, he knows them both
(cocky, wary) Lucas
Rick
Johnny
We'd like you to come down the station
Their demeanor is hard
Won't take "no" for an answer
() Can  finish eating
Nope
Blaze squirms, feels Roxanne's eyes on him
He turns to her, tries to explain
() 6
: (2) (') Don't worry, hon
It's just routine -- () It is by now
Just let me know if you're staying overnight
She goes back to her dinner
: -   - Blaze enters
The apartment is dark-  flickers
Roxanne is sleeping on the couch
On the coffee table: Chinese leftovers, fortune cookies
Hey
She's sound asleep
He crouches, touches her face
(' ) Hey
Roxanne barely stirs, deeply groggy
(') Everything's cool
() You're going to jail
No
No
Everything's okay
Jed and Murph just got a little boisterous at The Prairie Dog last night
Cops wanted to read us the riot act, that's all -- She yawns, curls up, starts to drift away again
was worried about you
And  don't like your friends
But Blaze won't let her go back to sleep
He jostles her
Listen,  want to show you something -- () : 'm sure you do
But 'm half-asleep and you're an ass-hole
'm serious, Rox
This is important
He drags her up off the couch
Makes her stand up
She , scowls, but he gets her on her feet
John,  have to go to work tomorrow (offers her coat) Put your coat on
You'll be glad you did
Promise
It'll be an adventure mystery tour
This better be good
She stomps to the bathroom
Blaze chuckles inwardly
Steals a fortune cookie from the left-overs, snaps it open -- The fortune is blank
Both sides
He tosses it away
: glittering black, watching
(
) (') Alright, 'm here
Now what
- Blaze and Roxanne creep through a hole in the outer fence, making their way to -- Keep going
It's just up there
- Must have been magnificent in its day
'm not riding one of those stupid horses
() 8
: You don't have to ride, just climb up
She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him
You're going to have to grow up one day, Johnny Blaze
Not if  can help it
He follows her up onto the ride
She weaves through the wooden animals
Starting to enjoy this secret adventure
(') Keep going, keep going -- She comes around the other side, catches her breath
The whole valley is spread out before her -- a glorious scatter of diamonds on velvet
(') Uh-oh
( ) What
Ever hear of a carnival wedding
Roxanne shakes her head
Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new dollar bill, folding it, making something
(' ) If a man and a woman walk around a carousel going backwards, they're considered hitched
You made that up
Swear to God
He finishes folding the bill
The "one" is now neatly set on top of an    like a paper jewel
(' ) You want this
() : (2) She nods, offering her hand
He slips the ring onto her finger and she examines it, lit up inside
It's beautiful
He smiles at her joy, wrestles with what he's about to say
How'd  ever find you
() Fate
don't believe in fate
Maybe it believes in you
They hug each other fiercely
long, soulful embrace
Blaze looks to the city lights beneath them once more
( ' ) Here's the thing, John
We're having a baby
You can't keep acting like everything's a game
need you with me
need to know 'll be able to wake up in the morning and see your face next to mine
Not have to worry that you spent the night in jail
() That's not a life
At least not one 'm interested in living
know
'm gonna get my shit together
For Leal, this time, () promise you, Rox
'll always be there for you
She takes his hand and places it on her belly
Don't promise me, promise her

from the next scene prelaps as we : 10
'  - Blaze enters, drenched from head to toe, frantic
Roxanne's arms are filled with laundry
We gotta go
Get your stuff together
What happened
What's wrong
Roxanne follows Blaze into the bedroom
(') What did you do
fucked up
The police are coming
Grab your things
We have to go
She sags, clearly been through this before
He tosses a suitcase onto the bed, looks back at her
(') Just do it, Rox
as he storms into the bathroom
Reaches behind the high cistern, retrieves a hidden
He jumps down
Tears the side panel off the old bath tub
There's a stack of hidden within
Blaze drags them out, drops one - It pops open, spilling   all over the floor
Blaze , struggles to gather up the loot
(
) Jesus, Johnny -- standing in the doorway
She sawit all
'  -   - Rain hammers down
whine
Blaze shoves Roxanne and the suitcase into a beat-up El Camino
- Blaze climbs behind the wheel, guns the engine even before Roxanne has buckled in
He gnashes into reverse, grinds the car into a backwards spin -- 11
- -- nearly clipping another car pulling in
He jumps the curb and races off into the rain -- - -- passing a   coming the other way
Roxanne glances at Blaze, angry and disappointed
Blaze struggles
The rain
The wipers
The fogging windshield
It's a bad time to be Johnny Blaze
Fuck
' -  : The cop car is turning, heading back in their direction
-- Blaze floors the gas
The speedometer leaps
- The  Camino screams through the rain, with the cop car in dogged pursuit
fall in behind them
- Blaze fights to keep it together
The road ahead is dangerously winding
Tires  as he hauls a sketchy turn
Roxanne gasps, fearful, bracing herself
The police are gaining
flood the interior
Slow down, John -- Another sketchy turn
Blaze spins the wheel, brakes, hard
Too hard
The car hydroplanes, finds purchase -- ( '  ) flashes, and suddenly, there's a or, the road, right in their path
() 12
: Blaze jerks the wheel
Roxanne
The car skids, slews off the road,  through a guard rail -- It plunges down a washout, flips end over end, shedding glass and wreckage, finally  to a dead stop at the bottom of a rocky arroyo
Blaze stirs, blood streaming down his face
The windshield is blown open
Rain pours in
Roxanne --
He struggles to free himself from his seat,  a torn seat belt hanging beside him -- the passenger seat mr)ty
(') Roxanne
- Blaze scrambles out through the broken windshield
Falls off the wreck onto the steep, muddy incline
He tries to stand, can barely manage to crawl
(terror seizing him) lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe dead
Blaze scrambles to her, rolls her over
He hauls her into his arms, , the two of them covered in mud and glass and God knows what
are coming down the incline, guns drawn,  beaming
They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of Roxanne
(
) (') Let me see her
God-Dammit
have a right to see her -- : - Blaze, grief-struck, handcuffed, thrashing about as Troopers try cc restrain him
() 13
: Get your fucking hands off me
Lucas Cole, the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier, approaches
Blaze  him and calms down a little
(' ) Please
Just let me see her
Cole nods to his men, who ease up on Blaze
He guides Blaze over to an observation window -- Roxanne lays in a surgery bay,  and  milling around her
(
) Mr
Blaze --
Blaze turns,  a nervous  standing behind him
Is she going to make it
(blinks, stutters) Mr
Blaze,  -- )_a ch= going r4 make i r
We don't know
She's critical
Her injuries are grave
There's a real chance she won't -- What about the baby
The doctor hesitates, glances at Cole
'm so sorry
We did everything we could
Blaze's will shatters as the full realization of what he's done slams into him
Tears sting his cheeks
Cole gives him space
Whatever punishment awaits Blaze can't be any worse than the hell he's living through now
14
- Roxanne, on life support, hooked up to an array of monitors
Sleeping Beauty, still as death
Blaze sits beside her bed
Handcuffed
Numb
Rain streams against a nearby window
Tree limbs tap against the glass, like ghosts scratching to get in
stand guard at a respectable distance, to each other
Elsewhere -- walk purposefully on linoleum
Passing bay after bay
Beyond the Troopers,  is approaching, half seen through layers of glass
Blaze  the footsteps, lifts his weary head
The shadow keeps coming, half-glimpsed between partitions as it draws near
flicker and weaken as if some unseen force were sapping their intensity
Blaze glances at the machines
Still ticking -- ( 60S) steps into view
Duster-coat
wide-brimmed cowboy hat smiling stone face
Blue eyes flecked with silver grey
He steps between the Troopers
They keep talking, don't even seem to notice him
You look like you could use some help
Blaze glances at the troopers
They're still completely unaware of Starke's presence
It's as if Starke and Blaze have somehow stepped a split-second sideways in time
The lights around them continue to dim
The second hand on the wall clock stops
An eerie, dreamlike moment -- the wind, the rain, the tree branches tapping against the window pane
() She's dying
Starke nods, places a  in Blaze's palm
If  could help her, would you be willing co make a deal
() 15, : Blaze looks at the coin -- gleaming, golden, embossed with a soaring eagle on one side, a coyote on the obverse
What kind of deal
She lives
You work for me
Something about Starke's eyes
Commanding and haunting at the same time
What kind of work
Starke just keeps smiling
Lays a comforting hand on Blaze's shoulder as we drift towards Roxanne's beeping
(
) When  was young,  was told that our souls wander while we sleep
Sometimes they get lost
Sometimes they never make it back -- : : "  " -  - on John Blaze as he switches on the light, looks in the mirror
Those five years of work have taken their toll
haggard reflection gazes back at him, He stares
And stares
Right into his pain
(
) -- but if they dQ return, they bring messages
And  guess thhat's how the dead speak to us -- in memories that may be dreams, and dreams that feel like memories
Blaze turns off the light
: - The store is empty
The  prices cigarette packs, eyes a suspicious Native American woman,  (30s), as she loads a basket with basics
Nomi sets the basket down on the counter
The clerk starts scanning the bar codes
[  ) 16
: Just passing through
Nomi nods, uneasy
She glances over her shoulder, searches out her half-breed daughter -- (8) , who is sorting intently through a rack of cheap toys
The kid is quiet, soulful, old beyond her years
( `  ) Where you headed
() What
Where are you headed
Late night, storm like this -- What do you care
(shrugging, defensive) Just asking
He keeps packing
But he knows she's trouble
(
) like this
Nomi turns,  Rain clutching a toy -- a glow-in-the-dark Halloween skeleton
It's too much, baby
Put it back don't have enough money for that
Rain stares right at Nomi -- and brazenly slips the doll into her coat pocket
Nomi glances at the Clerk
He didn't notice
/   - It's pouring rain
Nomi and Rain hurry across the muddy lot towards a ratty pickup
(
) Yeah,  found her
Came back to be with her dying grandpappy
() 17 : -  (30s) paces under an tire bay awning, talking on a cell-phone
He's handsome, charming, but there's evil lurking within that slick exterior
pencil- thin scar runs just under one eye
(') Don't worry
She's got the kid with her
Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup
The pickup chokes to life, carves out of the lot
Carrigan nods -- --  ( 40s), a stone-faced criminal, who motions to five other thugs lounging nearby -- , , ,  and
(') (listening, impatient) remember the deal
Just make sure you bring the money
He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting nearby -- a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan
Carrigan pulls a Glock from his waistband, chambers a round
(') Who wants to be a millionaire
Landsdale smiles back, an awful smile
(
) Some people are born bad
That's just the way they come into the world
Something goes wrong
Something breaks inside of them -- The trucks pull away, tires ploughing muddy tracks, passing two   fighting over a bloody road-kill carcass
-  - Blaze sweeps aside a curtain, studies the slowly darkening landscape outside with tired resignation
(

) -- and they spend the rest of their lives trying to make up for it
' Blaze Curns on the , watches a weather snippet
() 18
: Blaze's belongings on the bureau -- a duffle bag, old photographs of his previous life with Roxanne, a collection of blank postcards
Tucked amidst the photos is a sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child
-- scattered thunderstorms firing along a stalled frontal boundary
Damaging winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes will be possible across the Dakotas and Upper -- Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it
The map is crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city, along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations
Blaze traces his finger down to his present location:
- lonesome service road threads through bleak wild-grass prairie
Nomi's pickup appears on the horizon
'  - Nomi glances at Rain, who clutches her new skeleton toy
Seatbelt
Rain dutifully fastens herself in
(') Hey, bug
You hungry
Rain shakes her head- (') Want to listen to music
(off Rain's sullen shrug) Look, we won't have to keep moving around forever, okay
'll figure something out
promise
Rain looks at her mother
She's heard it all before- Somebody rams the truck from behind
Rain
- Blaze reaches for a pack of cigarettes, lights a match
He stares at the match flame for a moment -- for the flame is behaving strangely, bending towards Blaze as if it were drawn -o >; m
Blaze shakes out the match, then retrieves -- () 19
: / He stares at it ruefully, then places it on the map and sets it spinning
We get the sense that this is a ritual he has performed many times before
As we   on the coin -- - The Tundra rams Nomi's pickup again
Nomi fights to keep control
Aims for a turn-off up ahead
She hauls the truck into the turn, fights the roll-over, barely makes it -- -- but it's not fast enough
The Tundra and the Bronco make the turn too
Their  blaze into the cab
Nomi floors the gas
The pickup judders
The road here is bumpier, cracked and pocked
The Bronco swings out, pulls up alongside Nomi
She glimpses Landsdale, , urging Carrigan on
Carrigan cuts right,  the Bronco into Nomi's side
- On Blaze, watching the coin with a growing sense of fatalism
Spinning
Spinning
But starting to slow now -- EXT_  - The Bronco collides with Nomi's door again
Glass shatters- Rain , terrified
Wind and rain rush in -- Front offside tire
Nomi loses it, careens right, carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert,  over rocks, sagebrush, fence posts and barbed wire -- After a few dozen tortured yards, the pickup shudders to a stop
The Bronco and the Tundra haul up nearby, engines like hungry beasts
Nomi angrily drags her seatbelt off, snatches a revolver from the glove box
She looks to Rain: Stay here
And lock the doors
Nomi climbs out into the rain,  the door
Rain works the locks, but the driver's side is all bent up and twisted -- 20
- Nomi approaches the trucks, blinded by halogen high-beams
are coming towards her
She raises the revolver -- Back the fuck off
comes from left of nowhere, twists the gun from her hands in one unexpected move
She spins,  Carrigan approaching -- and recognizes him instantly
(' ) Billy-Ray --
-- On Blaze, watching the spinning coin
He shuts his eyes, as if he could stave off what he knows is coming next
As if he could contain the thing that is, even now, clawing its way into his body from some dark circle of hell
- Nomi falls to her knees, dimly aware of her daughter Carrigan stands over her, massaging his fist
Well, if it isn't Little Miss Running Bear
He grabs her by her hair, shoves the Glock beneath her chin
(') Gentlemen, you are looking at one of the finest pieces of ass  have ever had the good fortune of defiling
Fuck you, Billy -- Now  might just take you up on that, Nome
Old Billy-Ray's been getting a little tired shaking hands with the governor, know what 'm saying
Landsdale and his men are trying to get the doors open
Rain scoots to the driver's side, tries to start the engine
But the driver's door is wrenched open and the men are on her - - (        ) 21 : Careful with her
Rain is dragged kicking and screaming from the cab
, struggling to free herself, desperate to help her child
Leave her alone
Rain fights like a hellion, rakes her fingernails across Odell's face
Fuck
Landsdale back-hands the little girl
As she reels, he binds her hands with duct tape, then picks her up and throws into the Bronco
- The coin slows
Blaze opens his eyes, a look of dread washing over his face
He stares at his hands -- they're shaking, emitting a

flashes
The men gather round to watch Carrigan beat Nomi unmercifully
He knocks her back into the mud
She tries to crawl away, blinded by the rain
- The coin comes to a stop, coyote-side up
Blaze , his body wracked with pain
He begins to violently shake, his muscles twisting in unnatural contortions
With a combustive  his face abruptly and -- - Carrigan delivers the coup-de-grace
Pistol whips Nomi with the Glock
Her head snaps back
Blood sprays in deep slow-motion, spatters the bronco's headlights -- () 22
: Nomi struggles backwards through rivulets of mud
Carrigan looms over her
All she can do is stare up at him, glassy and unfocused as rain spatters her face
Tell you what, Hon
You want your goddamned divorce so much
He aims the Glock at her face, about to pull the trigger as -- (') You can fucking have it

Carrigan and his cronies take a beat, staring through sheets of rain
Silence
Just the relentless downpour
The hell was that
The men glance at each other, nervous

The men look around, frightened
Rocks fall from the surrounding butte
Odell looks down
The  is deafening, vibra tine: the very earth
And that's when it happens: - - leaps from atop a wedged outcrop, ridden by  that and
Silent
Heat haze, glowing manifolds
The bike catches twenty feet of air, trailing fire like a comet's tail as it passes right over their disbelieving heads

Touchdown

The men shield themselves, stumbling backwards
The bike hauls a deep carving turn, peeling mud, slides to a dead stop, hissing in the driving rain
Time stands still
Carrigan and his men gape
The monster cycle throbs

: (2) Alive
Evil
Aflame
man but not a man -- an impossible spectre, engulfed in fire, its skullish head deeply bowed
Clinking coils of red-hot chain slip link by link through its skeletal, flickering fingers
Then it lifts his terrible -- Skeletal, aflame, but somehow still Johnny, his tortured visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white
His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an  , at once predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal damnation
Time speeds up again
The men run
The Ghost Rider accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat
Lloyd runs fast as he can
Talk about pointless
The Ghost Rider seizes his head, drags him seventy yards, burning him black, discarding him -- The other men let rip
Guns blaze
punch through the Ghost Rider, coming out his back as red hot slag
The demon hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his rear wheel -- What the fuck
Albright  his shotgun
past like an Amtrak train, the Ghost Rider  a flaming fist right through Albright'-, face
That's it for the others
They scramble for the trucks
The Ghost Rider lashes out with his chains, lassos Chudacoff
He  as the metal sears his body, falls heavily, burning -- The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons something internal and lets it loose -- a blast of   that courses down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him
The men make the trucks, pile in
Landsdale slams the Tundra into drive
The big truck hauls away
Carrigan fights to get the Bronco into gear
Rain peeks out from the back, eyes bugging -- () 24

He raising his skeletal hand, clenches it, and suddenly we are -- ' series of   as we move amongst the pistons, cylinders, and intake manifolds
The mixture of vaporized fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite, but then the miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon themselves and we are -- with Carrigan
His truck won't start
Somehow, the
host Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine
The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers white-hot now, throbbing with heat
He slices through the Bronco's door like a human oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the vehicle apart
Carrigan panics, drags Rain out the passenger door
But Fusco is still trapped inside
Can't get his seatbelt off
The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the vehicle and the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted back seat
The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a skeletal claw -- Oh God, please,  ain't nothing to do with nothin'
ain't nothin'
Please, tugging Rain away from the horror, trying to ignore Fusco's terrible
He looks back, wishes he hadn't -- The Ghost Rider has Fusco snatched up nose-to-nose, forcing the man to look right into -- ' Hungry black sockets that suck the fire from the air
() 25, : (4) shudders, eyes bulging
All he can do is stare into those awful pits, fall into them, as grisly  from his evil past spark and shred into his melting mind
Every act of violence, every crime he ever committed -- beatings, murders, acts of torture and revenge -- are now revisited upon Fusco tenfold
This is the  , and Fusco is feeling it's full, hellish force
The Ghost Rider and Fusco  in sync
Carrigan and Rain can't look away
They stand transfixed -- Then it's over
The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud
He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but still alive, his brain irrevocably overloaded
And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too
Immobile
Internal
Then he looks up, past Carrigan

Rain
Rain stares back
But it's -- ' she
An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment
And Rain's terror is forgotten for just that moment, replaced with something best described as empathy
to the Ghost Rider's left
He turns -- the Tundra screams out of nowhere, slamming into him at sixty plus
ducks the shattering windshield, leaps from the truck as it fills with fire -- The Tundra keeps moving, pile-drives the howling spectre square into a massive boulder
The truck compresses like an accordion, , engulfs the rock with fire -- Landsdale picks himself up, ready for anything
Carrigan tugs Rain over
The wreckage burns out of control
Did you kill it --
Fuck if  know
Just then, Nomi's pickup backs into view
Odell is driving
Ca___gan snatches Rain up like baggage, starts forward

: (5) dazed, in a muddy gully
She scrambles up to the lip, the burning Tundra nearby,  her pickup hauling away into the night
She , tries to drags herself to her feet -- The burning wreckage moves
Moves again
Nomi ducks down, watches, uncomprehending
The crumpled truck is hurled aside
Two tons
Tipped over like a packing crate
Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with fear and   draw near -- Nomi dares to look up
The Ghost Rider stares down at her
Like Death itself
Imagine yourself face to face with a Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable force of nature -- Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you
The world exhales
After a moment Nomi dares to look again: '  (   ) All she sees is a , in tattered clothes, rolling a busted up motorcycle away into the darkness

Blaze ducks into the curtained bay
Quinlan follows
(') Sir,  can't help you if you don't cooperate
(beat, pointedly) Are you on something

Blaze pulls at his jacket, easing it over his battered body
No, no
Do  look like troub-unghhh -- He grimaces as the jacket comes off
Bullet wounds, shotgun damage, torn flesh, and a lot of
( ) Oh -- my
What happened to you
Blaze sits back on the bed, sets about cleaning his wounds with tools laid out on a tray nearby
Motorcycle accident
Couple abrasions, maybe some rib fractures -- (Quinlan tries to help) Just step back, 'll handle it -- Those are bullet holes
Blaze cleans the wounds she's referring to, grits his teeth as he swabs gauze deep into his flesh
Nah
They're just -- gouges
Surface damage
They'll heal up fine

Somebody has cauterized your wounds Blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound

Fills his pockets

He pops the cap of a pill bottle, dry-swallows a half-dozen painkillers -- To his right, a   works on the shrieking burn victim we saw earlier
Blaze stops, horrified -- It's , eyes rolling wildly, charred nearly beyond recognition
Flailing and convulsing, fingers nothing but exposed, blackened bone -- , backing into a quiet corner
He suppresses a sob, fumbling a hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine
He jabs the spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect
After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that he's leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned -- , helpfully illustrated with a mug-shot of Blaze's own face
Blaze tears the poster down, stuffs it in his pocket, then realizes that  is watching him

She recognizes him

He writes the date, checks the time on his watch and jots that down too
He addresses it, drops it in the slot
Then he turns around and  -- -- Nomi standing behin him, Ji12Iorkina his way
You were there last night
Excuse me
when they took my daughter
don't know what you're talking about Yes you do
Blaze tries to pass off his unease with an ill-conjured smile
He pushes past her, moving to his battered motorcycle
Nomi follows
('  ) The Ghost Rider
It walked right past me
It let me live

Blaze stares at Nomi, shaken
Lady, you don't know shit

But Blaze's landscape is deep within and dark, dominated by the thunderheads of last night's horror
He notches the throttle up a little, cruises at ninety
Rolls his head back, lets the wind stream over his face
Then he hears
Blaze looks back -- pulls alongside Blaze, riding a monster bike of her own
Blaze burns away

She matches his speed and is back beside him moments later

Nomi smiles
Blaze just slipped up and they both know it

After a long beat, Blaze reappears
Stops far away on the crest of the rise

Every corner crammed with bric-a-brac
On the : the football game
Blaze sits on a collapsing couch
Nomi hovers nearby
Her grandfather   (80s, emphysemic), rambles on in Dakotan, pausing only to suck on his oxygen mask
He keeps his eyes on the game the whole time, never once looking at Blaze
(aside, to Nomi) Does your grandfather understand English
(:i12,=NLE_-) 32, : He understands
He just refuses to speak it
Laforte continues to ramble intermittently
Blaze shifts, impatient, finally sits forward
Listen,  don't want to be an ass-hole, but can we just fast-forward the whole Yoda routine
The home team scores
Laforte  wildly, loses his mask, uncontrollably
Blaze stands
He's out of there
(') Feel better, old man
(rasping, in English) Give me the coin
Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi
She shrugs
Blaze hands over the coin
Laforte studies it, starts speaking in Dakota again
Nomi translates: The man you're looking for goes by lots of names
Coyote, Black Dog
In Dakota, he's Waka Sica
The Trickster
Look at him straight on, you might see a human
Look at him out of the corner of your eye at one of the in-between times -- dusk or dawn, you might see something else
What does he want
Wacokico
Vengeance
Why
Because it's his nature
Laforte elaborates
Nomi continues to translate
('  ) Long ago, Coyote could change his shape, chop his body into little pieces, causing all sorts of mischief

: (2) (') But Eagle, he had a clear eye
And he saw Coyote for what he really was
So he swooped down, scattered those pieces to the winds
(beat, drawing a breath) The first men, they found the pieces, and not knowing what they were, they ate them
And that's, how all men came to have a little piece of Coyote in their hearts
Now Coyote, he'll promise anything to get those pieces back
There it is
Blaze exhales
He studies Laforte, those ancient, wise eyes
've been looking for this man for five years now, storm-chasing -- (pulls out his map) Tracked him halfway across the country
How do  make him lift the curse

My grandfather says you've been looking in the wrong place
You need to look inward
The Ghost Rider is Starke's weapon
An extension of his rage
But it can't ride people unless it has something to latch onto in the first place
You understand
Blaze nods
He thinks he does
Laforte hands the coin back, returns his attention to the game
But as Blaze starts to rise, Laforte says one final thing: Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay
Nomi pauses, deciding how to phrase what the old man said
What
What'd he say
He wants to know if you're a bad man
If the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you, would you burn

What about the Cadillac Deville noticed you had one in your lot outside
Sorry, already spoken for
How `bout a full-size car

Outside, the storm seems to grow stronger

Another beat as Starke stares Petrowsky down
Gradually, the lights in the office begin to dim
The Taurus, then
Great

Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license
Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him

He doesn't take it
Instead, he pulls out a pair of bifocals

Were you trying to cheat me, Jim
No, no, not at all -- Then 'd like a new contract specifying the appropriate rate
Petrowsky squirms, uncomfortable
For in that pregnant moment, without either participant uttering at word, the entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed
Look, can't we just go with the contract we've got here
'll make a note of it and knock a day's rental off the total when you return it

The  still come, sporadic and terrible
Rodenburg's mind is racing
He motions to Pennebaker, who drags Nomi off the bed and strong-arms her to the door

'  -  - Rodenburg leads, gun ready
Doyle
Smoke and   are building rapidly
The persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere
Then -- --- movement in the living room
Rodenburg draws a bead but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting, fearful, eyes darting
He speaks in a strained whisper
What's going on, man
Where's Oswalt
Outside
Something hits the house
Then more , more , and a  so deep it's deadly
Pennebaker panics, pushing past Rodenburg
want out of here, 'm getting out
Keep your fucking voices down
He's burning the house, man
He's -- -  whip viciously around Weingrod's head and torso
Then he's wrenched backwards, hauled straight through the plastic sheeting -- bursts through the melting plastic, hauls his red-hot monster bike up on its back wheel -- Rodenburg and Pennebaker run for their lives, falling into the fire-lit passage
The Ghost Rider screeches across the living room, setting the place aflame as he passes through
Nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where she was, the fiery monster crash straight through the wall -- Rodenburg and Pennebaker run through the flames, stumbling over Doyle's charred body -- 55
'  - They burst out the front door, clothes alight, racing across the yard towards their vehicles
Rodenburg looks back -- The Ghost Rider  through the front of the house, skids to a halt, flicks out a chain -- and snags Rode burgs ankle
He falls,
The chain retracts -- Pennebaker reaches his vehicle, struggles with the door - TheGhost Rider thrusts a clawed hand outwards,clenchesthe air and hauls it back in
Like an explosion in reverse, 4,11 fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being
frozen moment
All terrified eyes on the Ghost Rider Then he lets rip
Hurls the energy back out as a torus of white hot fire that expands across the yard, Rodenburg's shirt from his back,  Pennebaker against his vehicle -- The vehicles , gas tanks rupturing
Pennebaker is blown to pieces
Rodenburg , shields his face
Fire and debris rain down in every direction
The Ghost Rider looms over him
More accurately, it's -- Half man, half monster, his pitiless skull-face hazing and flickering between human and inhuman states
Where are they taking the girl
Rodenburg whimpers
Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg's hair, wrenches his head back
(') Where
Are_ They
Taking
Her
( ) North
They're headed North, into Oregon, oh, god, fuck -- Where
don't know exactly, Jesus,  don't know
() 56
: Blue-white fire floods down Blaze's arm and engulfs Rodenburg
The poor man screams, struggles to break free -- aze simply crrows Otte ana ac and the Ghost Rider's evil countenance submerges every trace of Blaze's humanity
Then it's over
The flames evaporate
Rodenburg's corpse crumbles to dust
Wind
The Ghost Rider is gone
He  the corpses, the burning vehicles, tries to deny the horror
But it's always the same -- another swath of destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity
He told you everything he knew
She's ten yards away, shaking
Not going to come any closer
(') Told you everything -- () -- you didn't have to do that
You asked for my help

Blaze starts walking towards the pickup
: - sub-par motel 6
Nomi's battered pickup is parked outside
We  Blaze's tortured  coming from within
- Blaze sits in a chair, shirt off, Nomi at his side
She's trying to help him patch up his wounds, but the enormity of the damage and the sheer amount of blood is daunting
don't --  don't know what else to do for you -- () 57
: 'okay -- just need to rest now -- () -- wounds'11 be healed by morning
Nomi stands, still shaken
She retrieves a cigarette from her purse, lights it
thought you were dead
(considering his wounds) don't even know if it's that's an option anymore
Every time  get close, feel myself being dragged back -- (breathing through the pain) --it's like being born all over again
Like every law in the universe is being broken
Blaze sits forward, gritting his teeth against the pain
(') See, the Ghost Rider -- it's drawn to darkness like a bloodhound
If it thinks you've sinned, it'll find you
What if you're innocent
Nobody's innocent
(beat, staring at her) Think about it
Everyone's done somethincr
You
Me -- Blaze lifts up the coyote coin, flipping it over his fingers
(') Every night  spin this fucking coin -- and it always lands the same side up keep thinking -- ona time, one time 'm going to spin it and 'll see the other face
Sleep through the night without getting blood on my hands
But it never happens
() There's always some sad motherfucker out there that needs retribution, vengeance -- () 58
: (2) Blaze flings the coin away in disgust
It spins, wobbles, lands coyote side up
He laughs tiredly, then looks away, lost, suddenly overcome with emotion
(' ) 'm just so fucking tired -- Nomi moves to his side, struggles to help him up
Here, why don't you lie down for a little while
Blaze nods, too tired to argue
Nomi half carries him to the bed, lowers him down
Blaze settles back, exhausted
Nomi watches him, holding vigil
His eyes grow heavy
He shuts them a moment, opens them again -- -- and it's Roxanne who is laying beside him now
She rolls over to face him, smiles sleepily
Blaze reaches for her, touches her face -- and the moment shatters into violence
-- the El Camino sliding, spinning over
Metal rending
-- rain pattering on broken, bloody wreckage
Roxanne's torn seat belt hanging loosely
-- climbing out through the blown-out windshield
Crawling in mud, Blaze's face reflected in broken glass
-- cradling Roxanne's body in his arms, rocking her and -- Blaze bolts up in bed, disoriented, shaken
Clearly, some time has passed
Nomi sits across the room now, holding Blaze's tattered photographs in her hands, looking a little guilty
She's got the paper wedding band which Blaze made for Roxanne too
' What are you doing
'm sorry,  just -- () 59
: ( 3) As Blaze stands, we  that his wounds have healed
-He shrugs on a shirt, approaches
Nomi nods to the paper wedding band
(') You must've loved her a lot
Blaze doesn't answer
Just takes the photos and wedding band from her, shoves them back in his pack
He pulls out one of the postcards, scribbles an address on it
What time is it
little after three
What time, exactly
3:27
Why
Blaze ignores her, jots down the time
Licks a stamp and puts it on the postcard
Leaves it on the dresser
(') What is it with you and those postcards, anyway
They're just a kind of record
(hauling up his pack) Let's go
-  - Blaze and Nomi drive
Outside, the landscape passes, bugs twirling and spattering against the windshield like snowflakes
Roxanne in the hospital, serene and beautiful
Starke handing Blaze the coin
You made a deal
Blaze nods
(') So what happened
Did she live
() 60
: Roxanne
Yeah, she's alive
She just doesn't know it
(off Nomi' s look) Coma
Probably never wake up
So he tricked you
(a tired laugh) That's what he does, doesn't he
She nods
That's what he does
(almost afraid to ask) What about the baby
Blaze just shakes his head
It's funny
That kid was supposed to be my second chance
Rox and  used to talk about it -- how things'd be different after she was born
Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability
Maybe that's why we have them What, kids
() So we can make amends for all the royal fuck-ups we've perpetrated on the world
God knows 've had my share
(beat, pained) just don't want her to have to pay for the things 've done
You know
Blaze nods
He knows all too well
He and Nomi drive on in silence for a beat, their thoughts turning inwards
(') Can  ask you something
Honestly
(off Blaze's nod) What're you going to do when you find Starke
() 61
: (2) Make him pay, somehow -- () don't know
How do you beat the Devil
Walk up and bitch-slap him
Pretend you're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka up his hind ass

Carrigan flips it open -- Yeah
Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good
He sighs, disconnects the call
Landsdale cocks an eyebrow

Oswalt, Weingrod, all those other inbred losers too

Her voice makes Odell jump
He thought she was asleep (fretful, pleading) - -- (to Rain, leans forwards) Hey, kiddo, you're worrying my boy here
So shut your goddamn mouth -- You can't tell me what to do
You're not my father
Wow
The truck collectively holds its breath
Carrigan settles back, but he's pissed
You better believe that, sweetheart
'm just the dumb-ass that financed your whole fucking life
You and your mother both
And what did  get for that selfless act of stupidity
She burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by
He's referring to the scar under his eye
Rain turns away
Huddles against the door
Believe me,  could care less what Starke wants with you
Make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to
It's not like you came springing out of my loins
Only thing  care about now is getting what's mine, and that's -- () () 63

Without missing a beat, Rain is out and away, plunging into the cornfield
Carrigan and Landsdale bolt after her, guns drawn -- , weaving between the stalks
She reaches an old farm implement, uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her taped bindings
Then she's up again, running -- searching high and low
Carrigan  movement to his right, surges forward -- -- but Rain jigs left and Carrigan misses her, tripping over the farm implement instead
He cuts himself, curses -- Rain continues, straight ahead now
Carrigan motions to Landsdale

He searches for it, desperate
Then he  it
But as he reaches for it -- -- Rain extends her hand, concentrating, eyes fluttering -- The gun spins away from Carrigan, into Rain's hands
She doesn't hesitate for a second -
- First shot wings Carrigan, knocks Rain on her ass
Carrigan for cover
She  wildly ------ but then the gun is spent and -- -- Landsdale emerges through the corn, bagging Rain with his coat
As a shaken Carrigan gets to his feet, Landsdale slips his belt out of his pants and binds Rain tightly
- Carrigan and Landsdale return to the Hummer, which is still nose down in the culvert
Landsdale carries Rain under his arm, tightly wrapped, no longer struggling
Odell sits on the hood, daubing the bloody wound in his leg with a handkerchief
He  Carrigan's wound
Man, she shot you
(off Carrigan's nod, disbelief) Jesus
Lucky she didn't perforate my ballsack with that fucking pen
(: ) What's the damage
Mounts are cracked, trans-axle's shot to -- (shaking his head) -- this baby ain't goin' nowhere

Carrigan fumes, glances at Rain -- then he just snaps, starts angrily kicking at the door
After a few futile moments, he stops, paces, looks to Landsdale
(') We're going to need a place where we can hole up `til tomorrow
Wait for those boys of yours

: How `bout up there
Landsdale points past Carrigan at a squat group of buildings and machinery -- a shut-down   in the distance

Landsdale pistol-whips him, drags his limp body in through the gate
INT_   - The Guard slouches in a corner, bound and gagged
Landsdale and Odell lounge nearby, keeping a watchful eye on Rain
Carrigan paces by a window, nervously cutting his deck of cards one-handed
He's watching the shadows lengthen outside, the setting sun
He looks to Rain, who matches his gaze -- creepy eyes penetrating his brain

Blaze is driving, cranes to see the passing wreck
He pulls over onto the shoulder
Blaze and Nomi climb out, approach the vehicle
Nomi shines a flashlight,  blood on the front seat
She Blaze reaches past her, touches the blood stain -- Chaotic and violent
Rain attacking Odell
The Hummer crashing
The desperate race through the cornfield
() 66
: as Blaze steps away from the Hummer, into the field
She's alive
How do you know ---
But Blaze isn't listening
His gaze is now fixated on the distant lights of the rock quarry
- Blaze and Nomi crest a rise in the field, hunker down: : We can see the main compound of the quarry from here
Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the guardhouse
You think she's in there
Blaze nods
(') Then let's go -- Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back
No
We'll wait
() Dawn's less than an hour away
(taking out her gun) You wait
'm heading in
Look, they're not going anywhere
You don't know that
This is probably the best chance we'll get
They're sitting ducks
We can do this if you -- If  what
Burn them alive
Eat their spirits

The Ghost Rider whales on whoever's got it coming, but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to remember their faces
And  Lb remember them
Every last one
Just then, we hear the  of approaching
Lots of them
Blaze turns,  a line of  chugging up the service road on ratted-out Harleys
They know we're coming, don't they
Blaze nods
Once again, Fate is royally fucking him

You with me or not

They hug the shadows
At least a dozen of the Gargoyles are in view, lounging around, shooting the shit

You stay here
Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her

: (') If things go South and the Ghost Rider takes over,  can't guarantee he won't -- know

That's all care about
() Start disabling the bikes
Last thing we need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks on our tail
Rip out all the coil wires --- Blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him
Nomi rolls her eyes and pulls out a switchblade, deftly slicing through a fuel line
Gasoline leaks onto the ground
(') () -- or you could do that
As Blaze creeps away: -- (as he turns back) Whatever happens -- You're welcome
Blaze leaves
Nomi starts in on the other bikes
- Arlo enters, accompanied by the Pulsifer Brothers
Carrigan and Landsdale are waiting to meet them
So you need some contract work
An escort
We're making a delivery first thing tomorrow morning
And will there be mayhem involved
() 69
: Yeah, 'd say a certain amount of hijinx are likely to ensue

Up ahead, are lingering by a side entrance
-  - Arlo takes out a nail clipper, starts trimming his fingernails
Well, 'll tell you,  got nineteen brothers out there willing to go the distance and enough firepower to give a small Balkan nation a fucking titty- twister
But we don't come cheap
So how many men we going up against
One
-   - Blaze elbows Gargoyle #2 in the face
As the biker drops, we  that Blaze has already disabled Gargoyle #1
Blaze quietly slips in through the door
- Nomi has worked her way through a half-dozen bikes now and a fair amount of gasoline has pooled on the ground around her
-  - Arlo looks at Carrigan, incredulous
One man
One man
You trying to diddle my nutpurse, Mister
Absolutely not
Lemme clarify things -- 70
-  - Blaze sidles down the hallway, moving as quietly as he can
We can  the men talking in the office just next door
(
) See, this guy's not really a "guy"
He's more like a demon or something
(0
) demon
(
) That's right
(
) What, exactly, do you mean by demon
Blaze winces, lifting a hand before his face -- dance over his fingertips
He leans against the wall for support
When he removes his hand, he leaves a singed palm- print on the drywall
-  - Arlo puts the clipper away, starts arranging the fingernails on the desk before him into a neat little pile
Like his head's on fire and shit
Arlo , the Pulsifers follow suit
Then Arlo turns to Landsdale, icy now
Brotherman, what in fuck's name is this smooth faggot talking about

More than anything, he wants to step inside, fully aflame
But he forces himself to simply take a peek -- ' ; The room, the men -- but no Rain
He's telling the truth, Arlo
The guy ain't human
Saw him torch Albright and Chudacoff with my own eyes

- : Blaze presses against the wall, desperately trying to rein the Ghost Rider in -- but  are coming
Gargoyle is round; c the corner

Well,  say bring him on
You see this ink
That's a hundred hours under the needle
motherfucking canvas of pain
He and Chester here, we're not afraid of fuck-diddly
-  - The Gargoyle passes the doorway, lights up a smoke
Or tries to
The flame from his Zippo is bending sideways
He tries a couple more times
Same thing
Weird
hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to contain himself
If the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him
The Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an nearby
He shuts it, lights his cigarette, turns back -- b= Blaze has moved on
- Arlo settles back in his chair
If this guy's as lethal as you say he is, want fifty for me, another fifty for the club
Only you can't let the boys know we're takin' a 50K rake off the top, see
How `bout sixty and 'll throw in a kilo of coke
() Coke
That's like selling snow to Eskimos
You think 'm some kind of crack-smoking foolio or something

: () Seventy, then
Arlo reaches into his shoulder-holster, whipping out a mean looking nickel-plated Colt 44 Anaconda
Ninety, and not a nickel less, you fucking pillow-biter

Where the fuck is the kid
He looks through a doorway,  -- brutish gargoyles drinking beer and cleaning their weapons
Blaze drops back
His snarling face contorts, starts to assume that awful skullish quality
The Ghost Rider wants out

But Blaze fights, shoves it back down and deep

He zips up his jeans, starts towards her -- - Carrigan grins, trying to calm the situation
a sy, gentlemen
No need to get all truculent on me
Truculent
You get that out of a Scrabble dictionary or something
What the fuck does "truculent" mean
(grabbing Carrigan by his shirt) 'll tell you what it means
It means 73

The tiny figure is Rain's , held upright, unsteady, by some unseen force

Temples pounding
Her eyes are fluttering, rolled to white
as he starts towards the toy skeleton
He's in agony now, each breath a cough of fire, each footstep igniting the floorboards

Okay, alright -- how about seventy-five and we'll smoke the old peace pipe
(cocking the Anaconda) How `bout eighty or you're gonna be smoking my dick

He extends a hand to her -- and Odell steps out from behind the door where he'd been hiding, shotgun in hand
Shit

The Gargoyle has spotted her
He draws a Taurus pistol -- -  - -- and we hear a high-pitched

Bullets turn-to slag, vaporizing as they enter the Ghost Rider's aura of hellfire
Rain drops from the Ghost Rider's arm, runs
The Ghost Rider advances
The Gargoyle nearest him empties a machine pistol into the Ghost Rider
The Ghost Rider reaches for the weapon
At his touch, the pistol becomes   -- The Gargoyle
The Ghost Rider takes the pistol, and The Gargoyles stumble, clawing at their smoking wounds
In seconds, the entire weapon turns  , melting apart in the demon's hand,  away into nothing -- The Ghost Rider keeps coming
Men are  aside, incinerated
Bravado turns to terror, to chaotic scramble -- 75

Panic-stricken Gargoyles try to start their bikes -- and the bikes detonate

She slaloms through a gauntlet of flames, skidding to a halt
She Rain running towards her, throws open the passenger door -- " Rain makes for the pickup, scrambles inside even as -- strides from the burning ruins of the compound
With a wave of his hand, the wall of flame parts like the Red Sea

Carrigan, Landsdale, and Arlo fall in behind
The Ghost Rider moves, whipping his red hot chains
Left, he lassos a passing gargoyle,  him
Right, another Gargoyle, dragged from his bike and reduced to ash
Then two more lashes to either side of the brothers
Two more victims reeled in -- charred corpses falling at the Ghost Rider's feet
The whole thing took three seconds
(to Gunt, nerves failing) Forget it, bro, live to fight another day
The Ghost Rider slams his skeletal hand on the tank of a nearby bike
The bike glows   and  , getting bigger, nastier, demonically slouched -- No fucking way

Arlo, Carrigan, Chester, and the others instinctively shield their faces, falling back from the infernal glow -- Gunt

Tears stream down his cheeks as his body ignites
His corneas are burning, melting
The Ghost Rider starts to accelerate now, from zero to sixty in an eye-blink, hauling Gunt's writhing body along with him - straight into the burning building
- juggernaut trajectory crashing through wall after blazing wall
The Ghost Rider skids to a halt,  Gunt to the floor
Senses  behind him -- , blasting the Ghost Rider's head
The Ghost Rider and for a split-second, the demon's flames are actually snuffed out

Oh

Nomi floors the gas
But the pickup is already maxed out
The Ghost Rider easily gains on the truck, leaving a wake of burning asphalt
He lashes out with his chains, snags the back bumper
The chain-links slice deep into the steel bodywork
The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel -- Nomi slams on the brakes

Carrigan swerves, Chester under the Mack's mighty wheels

Carrigan veers hard, forcing it into the opposing lane
Up ahead: The highway narrows to a single lane -- Gaining on the pickup, trading shots with Blaze at ninety miles and hour

Arlo rides against Nomi's door, lets rip with his Uzi
Glass Rain and Nomi duck -- Arlo tries again, sticks his Uzi right into the cab
But Nomi forces the gun upwards
Bullets puncture the roof, shell casings ricochet- In desperation, Nomi reaches for the door latch, kicks her foot against the door
The door swings outward, taking Arlo along with it

Nomi abruptly veers right, clipping Arlo against the divider, killing him instantly
hauling himself back into the pickup bed even as -- bears down on them
Landsdale jumps from the cab, landing alongside Blaze
The two men struggle in the cargo bed, hand to hand, exchanging a volley of vicious blows
Nomi is desperate, doesn't know what to do
Landsdalp is getting the upper hand
He grips Blaze by the throat, forcing him over the side of the pickup bed, shoving Blaze's head towards the churning wheels of the Mack -- () 81

Carrigan also brakes, struggling to keep the Mack under control
Then the Mack catches a rim, flips, rolls -- The rolling Mack plows into the roadblock, seven tons of iron crushing cruisers and barricades alike
The pickup careens off the road, plunges into a cornfield, hits a rut, grinds to a halt -- The aftermath
Trooper cars sliding to a halt
Carrigan being dragged from the Mack at gun point, handcuffed
Armed  plunging into the cornfield,
Nomi falling out of the cab, finding Rain, unhurt, alive
She drags Rain into the sea of corn
Rain looks back,  -- being surrounded by Troopers, wrestled to the ground

You have to put me someplace else -- #1 Should've thought of that before you pulled that "Dukes of Hazzard" stunt
Please, just listen to me
Put me in solitary, anywhere but here

You don't understand, people will die -- baton blow to the knee
Blaze  , staggers -- Easy on the threats, big guy -- (shouts to door control) The cell door opens
Blaze struggles even more violently now
Do not put me in here

Nomi and Rain step off a bus, each carrying a bag of supplies
- Simple and clean
Rain locks the door, goes to the window and opens it wide -- a beautiful day outside, hills rolling down to a busy town a mile distant
Nomi drops her bag, sits wearily on the bed, peels her jacket open -- revealing a nasty shoulder wound
Burned to the bone, the impression of fingers clearly evident
Rain hurries to help, rummages antiseptics and bandages from Nomi's bag
Together, they clean the wound
Nomi's pain is clear, but she keeps it quiet
Are we safe now
Nomi regards her sadly
She's never been one to tell lies
Honey,  don't know if we'll ever be safe
Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively
Something about her look -- far too fatalistic for a child her age
He talks to me sometimes
Who
My father -- (beat, hesitant) -- when 'm dreaming
() What does he say
Rain starts to cry now, suddenly overwhelmed
Despite her eerily calm demeanor, she's still a child
And a frightened one at that

He moves forward, melting the cell bars, stepping into -- The prisoners are frantic, leaping about like frightened lab animals
The Ghost Rider's heavy  ring out as it strides down the corridor, turning his awful gaze on the first cell
The Ghost Rider extends a hand, sending a coursing over the prisoner within
The Ghost Rider moves on, to the second and third cells, swiveling his gaze back and forth,  the occupants within
Like shooting fish in a barrel
The Ghost Rider continues its rampage
Murderers, rapists, malefactors
Some curse, others plead, others simply drop to their knees and pray
For they know, instinctively, that the universe is not an arbitrary place, that their Day of Judgement has come
The entire jail is ablaze now, a roiling extension of the Ghost Rider's fury, drowning out the

Big, melancholy eyes
They stare at each other for a long time, not knowing what to say
My mother is dead
The statement hangs
Another death
Another failure of Blaze's part
How--
My father found us, just like she knew he would
Rain looks down at Blaze's hand -- the gun resting there
Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed
The wind picks up
Rain looks to the graves

Do you think there's a heaven

Blaze studies Rain
This kid is hurting
What she needs now, is reassurance
And try as he might, Blaze just can' t seem to harden his heart against her
Yeah,  think there's something
Maybe not angels playing harps and stuff, but () -- something
Rain wipes her nose with her sleeve, wanting to believe it
He'll keep coming, you know
Unless you stop him

Blaze regards her curiously
Even in grief, she's a consummate negotiator

Rain follows

She said  could trust you
You can't

Like fate

Blaze and rain jump out in a cloud of dust

Mision de Sante Lupia
High up the mountain: an old adobe building perched on stilts, precariously overhung
On top of its bell tower, a crucifix stands clear and proud
We're going to a church
It's not a church
It's a mission
They take people in
Blaze pays the driver
The truck roars away
Rain looks back to the mission, doubtful
Are you going to dump me there
: - 18th Century Spanish adobe
Chapel and dormitory, currently under renovation

Picks and hoes clink in the dirt
Blaze and Rain make their way towards the main building

Can  help you

: Our car broke down a few miles back and my daughter and  were wondering if we could crash here for the night
Tolbein sizes them up -- doesn't like what he sees
Don't think so
What about a ride, then
Is there a town somewhere you could take us to
Other men have gathered behind Tolbein -- ,
One of them, , nods to the South
Why don't you head back to Dawson
They got motels there
That's not really an option
Then 'd say you're out of luck
Look, you must have a cot, something
The kid's hungry -- (

This is Rain

That's a pretty name

Would you like something to eat

There's something wrong with those two
Especially the kid
Duly noted, Richard
() And overruled

Blaze pauses at the threshold of the chapel, looks back, uneasy -- but it's just a  being buffeted about by the wind
-  - Rhymer leads Blaze down the central aisle
The chapel is dark, lit by candle-light, crowded with scaffolding and drop- sheets
As Blaze walks, the flames of the candles bend in his direction -- as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force
Those men outside -- Most of them are on a work-release program
We're a halfway house for ex- offenders
We try to get people on their feet, reintegrate them into society
Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive
(') (misreading Blaze's look) Don't worry, you're perfectly safe here
But of course, that's not what Blaze is thinking

Tolbein, Nunez and a few others watch them
Blaze watches them back, nonchalant in the face of their obvious hostility

Men carrying provisions
There's a small vegetable garden in the center of the courtyard
Rain helps the  pull carrots

It's turned out beautiful, hasn't it
We try to be as self sufficient as we can, back to the earth and all that
He notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun
(') You any good with diesel engines
know my way around a flywheel housing
Well 've got a generator out back that's been on life support the last few weeks
Mind helping me try to resuscitate it
Blaze looks at him curiously
Sure
- Blaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old generator
There are a number of vehicles stored around them, including a pair of dusty motorcycles
So how long have you been running
What do you mean
You know what  mean
You spend as much time around lost souls as  have, you learn how to read a man's face
() You want to hand me that crescent wrench
Blaze hands Rhymer the wrench, who then makes an adjustment
(') Take the girl, for instance
She's not your daughter, is she
No
() 96
: So what happened to her mother
She's dead
Did you kill her
No
Rhymer studies Blaze, decides he believes him
(' ) () She doesn't have anyone else

And who's protecting you

Listen,  appreciate what you're trying to do, but 've never really been a come to Jesus kind of guy
wasn't talking about Jesus,  was talking about a little healthy introspection
Working here, staying in one place for a while, seeing what surfaces
've found that people tend to arrive on our doorstep for a reason
Blaze considers this formidable man, a yearning moment then he shakes his head
can't stay
'm sorry
What about the girl, then
Whatever you're involved in,  can't imagine it's good for her well-being
(beat, gentle) We can find a home for her

Black, with gold pin-striping
You can take the Norton

So send us some when you do
Blaze is moved by this man's simple humanity -- but he's also wrestling with the idea of abandoning Rain

The lonely scarecrow stares button-eyed and blank

Been here so many times before

He bows his head, studies the coin, turning it over in his shaking fingers
The malicious coyote, the soaring eagle
Still the  come, stronger, more insistent -- Cars
Police  wailing
Blaze looks up once more
His eyes are shadowed sockets
This is the real  , and Blaze is feeling its awful, mournful ache
' He wants to know if you're a bad man
He wants to know -- if the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you, would you burn
Blaze clenches his fist around the coin, spins on his heels

Blaze sets the coyote coin on the bed table next to her, turns and leaves
We   Rain's sleeping face for a beat, then she stirs, opening her eyes

coyotes are hurling themselves repeatedly against the windows, cracking the panes
Get away from the windows

All the men are giving Rain a wide berth now
Another snarling coyote hits the glass
One of you, please, just take the kid to the chapel
Father, that's the last place she should be
Something strikes the room a massive blow
Something   than a coyote
Viscott starts praying
Quiet, Viscott
More heavy blows
Like the Fist of God
Making the floorboards beneath their feet vibrate shambles past the window
What in God's name was that
(looking at Rain, accusing) knEw we should've sent them away
Another impact
Plaster cracks
Dust falls
Viscott wails, praying even more stridently
Nunez is losing it_ ,
She's the one they want, 'm telling you

Rain shrinks away from the insidious mewling

: (2) (to Rhymer, hissing) told you -- Even Rhymer is shaken now
He moves to investigate, presses up against a cracked window -- '  ( ) Carrigan stands outside, lurching between patterns of moonlight and shadow
But the movement is all wrong
And in our momentary glimpses of him, we get the sense that he's been horribly changed -- as if his body had been torn apart, then haphazardly reassembled into something else
The wall fractures
Rhymer staggers back
row of impacts moves along the wall -- Tolbein and Nunez scramble to reach the dining room door
They close it, turning the locks
Carrigan slams against the other side of the heavy, steel door
Again and again and again
The men are terrified,  at each other
The door is buckling inward, the hinges bending and  -- Then the pummelling stops
Just the sound of , halting and phlegmatic
No one moves, not a whisper
starts to spread across the metal door
What the fuck --
Rhymer edges close to the decaying door, peering through a gap in the frame -- Carrigan peers back, moonlight illuminating his face
There are buttons where his eyes should 12P

Rain is terrified
Do what he says
Put her out
Get back with the others

Rhymer steps in front of Rain, levels his shotgun at Tolbein's chest
God as my witness, Richard, lay a hand on that girl and  will pull this trigger
Tolbein hesitates -- then grabs at the shotgun
He twists it from Rhymer's hands,  the butt across Rhymer's jaw
Rhymer sinks to the floor
Tolbein grabs Rain, drags her  to the door
He waves the shotgun at the others -- Open the fucking door
Nunez fumbles with the lock
Rhymer recovers, throws himself at Nunez, tries stop him from opening it
The pounding ceases
All eyes sweep to the door -- roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, coming to rest at Rhymer's feet -- immediately oottina the floorboards beneath them

Now he's -- golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and razor wire
Button-socket eyes
Jagged bone teeth
Beetle-black chitin for fingers and nails
His very existence is an affront to nature
Everything the Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays
Floorboards rot, metal rusts
Every movement, every spastic shudder and twitch is a source of incalculable pain

The men are trapped
Some try to flee
Others fight back, swinging chairs and planks -- stalks into their midst, snaring victims left and right, bodies or pulling them apart -- He snatches Viscott up by his throat
Bugs swarm over the parolee's face as it rots and decays
In seconds, Viscott's entire body decomposes, putrefies, falls apart -- back up towards the kitchen
crow-thing comes flapping

The creature  and flops -- Nunez claws another from his face,  it's not a crow at all, but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a deformed razor beak, matted feathers, bony talons -- Wilson, trapped under a bench,  desperately at a gnashing coyote
Lands a real blow
The beast falls back then stands up like a man

Rhymer, Rain, Nunez and Tolbein struggle to repel the monsters, beating them back with whatever is at hand -- -- but the jaw-beasts and razor birds are winning, forcing their way into the kitchen -- Nunz is snagged
Slashing claws swarm all over him

Jaw-beasts fall in behind him
Razor birds whirl around his head

The bike changes too, red heat spreading throughout
Tortured metal
Straining machinery pops and bulges
Shafts lengthen into skeletal "bones"

Realizing what's about to happen, the Scarecrow lets loose a and -- erupts through the wall in   , sending forth a majestic tsunami of fire and debris
The monster bike skids, carves floorboards like matchwood -- - hurl themselves out of its scorching path -- The Ghost Rider vaults from the saddle, sends the bike spinning at the scurrying monsters
It ninepins a few, takes out the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke -- - are vanquished, squealing and flopping like living cinders
- , still aflame but very much alive
If anything, they seem emboldened by the fire
They circle the Ghost Rider, more and more of them joining the pack

: readies his chains
The jaw-beasts attack
Three dozen horrors pouncing and
The Ghost Rider takes them
- Chains, flames, sheer power and force -- Spines snap
Lupine skulls burn
The Ghost Rider tears the monsters limb from limb
The room becomes the Seventh Circle of Hell, and at the heart of the Inferno, the Ghost Rider exults in the slaughter -- The whole mission is ablaze now, fire and churning smoke consuming everything in its path
Rhymer, Rain, and Tolbein run for their lives
-  - Rain, Rhymer and Tolbein are trapped
Fire has cut them off
They back their way towards the rear of the building, peer out the windows -- : a hundred foot drop straight down to the highway
There's no way down from here
The door behind them splinters
The Scarecrow's found them once again
-   - The Ghost Rider is having difficulty with the jaw-beasts
His fire burns them but they just keep coming -- blackened skeletal demons, possessed of an unstoppable ferocity -- For every one he throws aside, two more seem to take its place
He can wound them, sear the flesh from their bones, but still they pile on, sinking their teeth into his skeletal flesh,  through his hollow rib-cage -- The Ghost Rider  in pain,  one from his back, another's spine,  a fist through a third's gnashing muzzle
He falls back through a doorway, onto -- And still, they attack
And now the Ghost Rider is weakening
He stumbles on the steps, falls to his knees
The fiends pile atop his back -- () 109
: Summoning all his power, the Ghost Rider emits a , a - that blasts the creatures clean off him
-  - The  shakes the room
belches through the splintered doorway -- -- but the Scarecrow scarcely notices
He's flinging dorm beds left and right,  and  as he hunts for -- huddled beneath a flimsy bed-frame
The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds Tolbein
He reaches for the man, sinking his spindly finger's into Tolbein's chest
Tolbein , instantly shrivelling, corroding into dust -- The Scarecrow hurls aside yet another bed and finds -- aiming his shotgun, point-blank range
The Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrow's face
-   - All Hell breaks loose
The Ghost Rider unleashes wave after wave of , incinerating the hounds as they leap towards him, fighting his way up and up the steps -- -  - Another  chews apart the Scarecrow's neck
The monstrosity staggers, then lurches forward, grabbing the barrel of the shotgun, instantly corroding it -- The wave of corrosion swarms up the stock while towards Rhymer's hands and he drops the gun, rolling away, scooping up Rain as he runs towards the bathroom -- , recovering, his makeshift flesh knitting itself back together
Flames kiss his body, causing sodden particles on his frame to and  -- but because his decayed flesh is so wet, he never ignites

: Enkindled  bug-ember things swirl around the Scarecrow's head in a halo, impossibly alive- He stumbles after Rhymer and Rain into claustrophobic box of stalls and urinals
Rhymer and Rain are nowhere to be seen
Enraged, the Scarecrow tears into the stalls, ripping them aside one by one -- -   - The Ghost Rider advances, hurling jaw-beasts left and right -- -  - The Scarecrow rends the last stall asunder, finds Rain and Rhymer cowering like bugs
He looms above Rain, beetle- fingers clutching, flashing a rotted rictus-grin -- --  '
- whip viciously around the Scarecrow's sodden head and torso
He's wrenched backwards, hauled out of the bathroom and across the dormitory into the opposite wall -- - The wall fractures
Debris falls, tumbling hundreds of feet down to the highway below
-  - The Scarecrow recovers,  the room ablaze
a swathe of blackened, twitching jaw-beast skeletons leading from the doorway to -- At the other end of the chains
More accurately, , battered and weakened, staggering
His flames are barely flickering, his bony flesh has become chalky and brittle
He's holding a jaw-beast skeleton, drops it to the floor -- The Scarecrow attacks
Hand-to-hand combat
Massive blows and blocks
The burning room  with each impact -- () : Ghost Blaze uses his chains, but he's weak, and Scarecrow turns them back on him,  him against the walls
More structural fractures, more dust -- - The whole mission quakes
huge hole in the wall falls open, the Scarecrow barely manages to stop himself falling The stilt-like support columns bearing the weight of the overhanging mission begin to  and bend
Some snap -- -  - The dormitory drops alarmingly, ten feet or more, the flooring canting precariously
Ghost Blaze stumbles, falls -- Scarecrow grabs Ghost Blaze's neck
Squeezes tight
spreads over Ghost Blaze
He , his flesh putrefying, but Scarecrow will not let go -- Desperate for escape, the flames closing in on them
There's nowhere to go
Except a small , high up in the ceiling -- Ghost Blaze , in agony as the Scarecrow's superior evil dominates
He feebly extends a hand towards the flames nearby, trying to compel the fire to him
The flames twist, briefly bend in his direction
The Ghost Rider  with frustration
He needs the flames
He will die without them
He tries again, reaching, reaching -- surrounding the two foes are starting to bend in earnest now, streaming towards Ghost Blaze's bony, begging fingertips The Scarecrow is oblivious
Just keeps pouring more misery into Ghost Blaze's body as -- - -- the entire mission, which was only moments ago completely aflame, is now extinguishing itself
An inferno in retrograde, roiling inward -- -  - -- raging flames bend and draw long -- () 112
: -- clouds of embers are pulled into coursing streams-
-- -- roiling fireballs are dragged wildly from walls, floors and ceilings -- -- flame and fury funneling thunderously into  - that cyclone up and up and up into -- -  - -- Ghost Blaze from every direction
Suddenly Scarecrow finds himself at the heart of a back- drafting firestorm, a sustained implosion feeding straight into Ghost Blaze
Then -- Nuclear silence
An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch -- An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom -- Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now he's more than the Ghost Rider
He's a white-hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating with volcanic heat
And he
An apocalyptic release that -- obliterates Scarecrow -- sends Rhymer ducking for cover -- bulges the dormitory's fractured walls and ceiling, lifting the   mightily
Rain into the air
steamrollers through every room and passage, destroying everything in its path, consuming itself
-  - Ghost Blaze lies  at blackened ground zero
He's almost human now, spent
Charred timbers  and around him
The entire structure is on the verge of collapse
emerging from the smouldering bathroom, ghostly white
She picks her way cautiously across the teetering floor
Kneels alongside Ghost Blaze -- () 113
: Blaze's eyes are black pits, gaunt and skullish_ Rain casts --- - about, finds a  , cups it in her hands, holds the flame close to his mouth -- Ghost Blaze senses the fire, breathes it in like a drowning man
Draws the flame deep into his lungs, keeps drawing until the ember is gone, internalized
Their eyes meet
Are you going to die
() Not today
He pushes up on his elbows, tiredly rises to his feet and -- Topples
Ghost Blaze and Rain run -- but they're not going to make it
The whole room is dropging away at their heels
Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain,  through a widening split in the wall even as -- - -- the dormitory folds up and slides away from them, pitching over the hillside
Breaking into that   onto the highway far below
, clutching precariously to a muddy hillside
Ghost Blaze looks up,  -- , first light bleeding in over the distant mountains
-   - Ghost Blaze strides over the smoking ruins
Finds what he was looking for -- , back to human, hopelessly trapped deep in the wreckage
He's barely alive, just a face in the rubble
Carrigan blinks
(a ragged whisper) who -- the fuck -- are you, anyway
() 114
: Vengeance
And Ghost Blaze raises his hand,  trickling down the length of his arm, swirling around his hand like a building static charge even as -- (terrified, yet defiant) Do it, fucker -- dQ it
appears on a ridge just before them, eyes locking onto him
It's now or never
Ghost Blaze hesitates, hesitates -- then abruptly reins the flame back in
Metabolizes the fury
Pushes it down deep through sheer, agony-inducing willpower
Ghost Blaze , struggles -- -- and forces the Demon away, Now he's just Blaze, weak with exertion, but triumphant for the first time in years
He turns away and we -- : EXT_   - -- Blaze and Rain walking, working their way across the scorched grounds
Rain kicks at a carbonized jaw-beast skull
It rolls,  against a tree, crumbles to dust
Blaze looks up just then,  the sound of --- ' It slows to a stop at the end of the drive,
Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey
Blaze braces himself
silent inhalation of breath
Rain stares, paralyzed by fear -- The driver's door opens
hulking silhouette steps out
The Beast, backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking over the horizon
Sunlight  outward, briefly blinding us
And when it subsides -- is standing there
Human
Windblown
He raises a hand, shielding his gaze from the light
Steps cowards them -- () 115
: Blaze moves in front of Rain, blocking Starke's path
They stand there in silence
And Starke smiles, eyes alight with mischief
Looks like we've come to the end of the road, haven't we
Guess so
After a long beat: Give me the girl and 'll lift the curse
Blaze looks down at Rain
This was all he ever wanted
The only thing that has kept him going all these years
He reaches into his jacket, retrieving a crumpled pack of cigarettes
Plucks one out -- She's all yours, Starke -- -- and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame from within himself
He takes a long drag
In the pits of his eyes, something glows there -- a kind of lambent darkness
(') -- but you'll have to go through me if you want her
Starke stares into Blaze's eyes
Doesn't like what he
Don't be a fool, Blaze
'm offering you your life back
That's not a life
And least now one 'm interested in living
You think you can control it
You can't
Guess 'm willing to take my chances
Starke nods, accepting defeat
For now
He looks down at Rain, a bitter smile creeping across his face -- () 116
: (2) You have your mother's eyes
-- and walks away
Blaze and Rain watch him retreat
Presently, a coyote slips from shadows, joining him on the road
It--lopes along beside him
We watch them disappear over a rise
Then they're gone
Beat
Rain studies Blaze, reaches for his hand
He'll be back
Yeah
We pass broken concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake constricting a mouse, an industry of beetles dissecting a bird's carcass
Finally, we come to a small, deep cavity -- and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find -- (

) And that's how it ended
With another beginning
kind of balance struck between the flame and the fury
' balanced perfectly on it's edge
How it fell like that, at the heart of the wreckage, is a mystery that will probably never be solved
: - brings a postcard to a sleeping patient's bedside
The patient is , sleeping peacefully, bathed in sunlight
The nurse tacks the card to a wall filled with many -- dozens and dozens of postcards charting Blaze's journey back and forth across the country
And we realize now, that Roxanne is the woman who has been narrating our tale
() 117
: (
) And me
still sleep
Wandering
Waiting
Listening to the whispers of the dead
: - / On Blaze, riding hard, as a scorching desert noon - into night
(
) The world turns around without me
There are sharks
And there are doves
And nighttime holds far darker terrors than death
But  am never afraid because know that he is out there, somewhere
And that someday, somehow -- Blaze ignites, , hurls back his head -- (
) (') -- he will return to me
-- and the Ghost Rider rockets headlong into black
