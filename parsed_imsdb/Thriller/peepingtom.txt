Screenplay by Leo Marks Shooting Draft, 1959 Copyright, 1959, Michael Powell (Theatres Ltd
) Copyright, 1959 1988 & 1998 Leo Marks The screen remains dark for a moment
In the darkness   the film's   - a gentle whirring purring noise
Nothing to be alarmed about
It might be a small contented motor
: - of the solitary figure of a  standing professionally alone at the end of the street
It is a bright, still night
We can  the Woman whistling 'Stardust' merrily to herself
around her
Man's footsteps are overlaid
We  the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman
As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then turns round for a better look
Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the man's
of  - a plump, attractive brunette - still young enough to need two glances at the customers
She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception
She hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully
and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed at
It'll be two quid
Evidently we have two quid
She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, jerks her head towards the right - and sets off
after her
Overlaid is the sound of the man's footsteps
Dora resumes her whistling
So, under his breath, does the man who is following her
- wider street than the last - but just as empty
Dora sways her way towards a small house at a respectful distance
from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin
of a man's hand throwing something into the dustbin
It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film to Dora's house
It stands next to a chemist shop
Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door
'  - She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs
after her
She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'
and so - under his breath - does the Man who is following her
woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great curiosity
winks
then passes out of camera
Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her
'  - Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside
'  - She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, lights the gas fire  then turns round
of Dora
She holds out her hand-smiling
And suddenly
There is a gentle whirring purring sound
Dora - she is staring at something with great curiosity
It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to fear
She steps back from  - but  won't have it
Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face
The sound purrs on
: : The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone at the end of a street
her turn towards  - and smile at us
We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in to show the surround in natural colour
'  - darkened room in natural
The movie screen images are in
We can  the back of a Man's head as he bends intently over a projector
He is watching Dora on the screen
He is breathing quickly
We see Dora's hips waggling their way home
The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen
When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two- toned hair winking at Dora
then we see Dora throwing her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us
her staring at something in bewilderment
then backing away from  in fear
the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long race
As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across her face - the title: Blots out what is happening to her
behind them we can see Dora's hands pushing something away
Before the ' : : - It is very dark
of a stack of deck chairs
Two forms behind it - a ' and a '
They are intertwined and motionless
suddenly a brilliant shaft of light is trained onto them
Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound
quickly to a nearby tree
of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor purring
a blinding spotlight
to the couple - the whirring of the camera is overlaid
The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light
He advances towards the tree
Hey, you peeping
The spotlight goes out
There is the sound of footsteps running away  and the night is at peace again
And now   who  the picture
: - It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house
it through the finder of a small cine-camera
'  - crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching them from a corner of the street (   - )
several Policemen holding back the crowd as two Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty stretcher
Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid
children staring curiously into the empty ambulance - and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter
of a   looking at us curiously as he approaches (     )
What paper are you from
The finder is lowered
of a Young Man () sighting a cine-camera
He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his interrogator
He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words
beg your pardon
What paper are you from
Mark smiles at him pleasantly
The Observer
The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the stretcher
there is a body on it covered by a sheet
Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them
He photographs the ambulance as it drives off
He photographs the Policemen dispersing the crowd
He photographs his Interrogator, who gladly poses for him
Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls away
: of Dora, smiling happily
Her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper
Above it is a caption:
- to show sexy magazines alongside the newspaper
'  - Mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small newsagent's shop
He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines - showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into the shop
'  - plump, bald-headed Man stares at Mark
You're late
Sorry, sir
He turns towards a small door at the end of the shop
(quietly) Hold on, Mark
Mark turns round
Mr
Peters hesitates, drumming his fingers on the counter
of Mark
He starts to drum his fingers on a shelf
Mark
've a question for you
He stops drumming his fingers
So, at that moment, does Mark
Which magazines sell the most copies
Those with girls on the front covers - and no front covers on the girls
Exactly
And it's just the same with the work you do for me
Overlaid is the sound of the door opening
Look busy
Mark busies himself sorting some newspapers
whole row of Doras smile up at him
to doorway of the shop
An   is standing there
The Times, please
Certainly, sir
And The Telegraph
Certainly, sir - anything else
The Elderly Gentleman hesitates - glancing at Mark's back
Then: er
have been told by a friend that you
er
have some views for sale
What sort of views, sir
Well, er
This sort, sir
From under the counter he produces a thick book
Mark turns round
From his    the Elderly Gentleman open the book
He - er- seems - er - more than a little interested
, er
how much each
Five shillings, sir
'll take this one
and, er
this one
and, er
how much would the lot be
To you - five pounds, sir
The Elderly Gentleman hesitates
Mr
Peters turns over a page
and the Elderly Gentleman almost turns over with it
Tell you what, sir
Four pounds ten - and 'll throw in The Times and Telegraph
how's that
Well, er
thank you very much
Let me wrap it for you, sir
He puts it in a wrapper which says 'Educational Books'
Shall  put you on our mailing list
Oh no
But 'll look in again
By all means, sir
He holds open the door for the Elderly Gentleman, and watches him leave
He won't be doing the crossword tonight
He turns triumphantly to Mark
(counting out money from wallet) Those pictures he chose
were all yours
(handing notes) This is yours
Mark pockets them without counting them
of Mark
(in a very different tone) And this is yours too
He picks up a postcard - holds it towards Mark
And that's what  want to talk to you about
It's a clever picture - because you're a clever lad
but, Mark
(pathetically) It's all face
Mark looks at the postcard in silence
don't want to hurt your feelings, son - but if people want the Mona Lisa they go to the National Gallery
The Louvre
Well, wherever they go, they don't come here
so no more of this fancy stuff
He pats Mark's arm
now get upstairs - the girls are waiting
and so is a bonus if you give me what  want
Thank you, sir
(amused) What do you do with all your money
Buy cameras
He opens a door at the far end of the room
We catch a glimpse of a winding staircase
He starts to climb it
'  - At the top of the staircase is a door
Mark and his camera trudge towards it
The door opens suddenly
vivacious young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round
She has a towel round her shoulders
Well look who's here
Cecil Beaton
From     Mark venture a shy smile at Milly
Milly opens the door impatiently
Come on, sonny
make us famous
Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second Girl ()
She is staring out of a window, her back to camera
She is naked except for a shawl draped round her shoulders
Mark enters the room
the door begins to close towards the door
On the threshold of the room, a hood is thrown over our faces
In the darkness   Milly's voice
(
) Did you read about that girl who was murdered last night
' - We are with Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera
Through the ground-glass of the camera   a of Milly
(
) The same thing nearly happened to me
We hear Lorraine's voice - muffled, and very far away
(
) When
(
) Last night
went out with my boyfriend
We're getting married next month
trouble was my fiance saw us
The    of Milly peers anxiously into the camera
can you fix it so the bruises don't show
The ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down Milly's back
of Milly
She is on a couch, lying on her stomach at a slightly oblique angle
All that    are her face and naked shoulders
From Milly's    Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera
Well, can you
Mark's voice is  under the hood
think so, Milly
Then be quick about it, sonny
'm freezing
of her naked toes
They start to wriggle
of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod of the camera
They start to wriggle
of Lorraine
We watch her in profile as she stares out of the window - clutching her shawl
She has outstandingly beautiful features
of Mark
He is standing by the side of the camera, studying us thoughtfully
He is holding a remote- control switch panel in his hand
He clicks off several lights and then switches several others on
then he ducks back under the hood
There he goes again
What have you got under there
girlfriend
We join Mark under the hood
a small   of Milly on the ground-glass
Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine caressed by shadows
She is staring into the camera
suppose you have a girlfriend
He adjusts the focus
We can see more clearly the contempt on Milly's face
No, Milly
Hear that, Lorraine
He's available
From Milly's    Mark come round to the front of the camera, and insert a dark slide
Raise your head, please - and look at the sea
(
) What sea
Mark presses a rubber bulb - the shutter clicks
What sea
Mark inserts another dark slide
just wanted that puzzled look
(
) Oh, did you
Well if you want it again, 'll think of you
from Milly's viewpoint,   Mark holding the rubber bulb
cine-camera is on a ledge behind him
You're a puzzle and a half
Mark presses the rubber bulb - the shutters click
This is a spare time job for you, isn't it
Yes, Milly
He inserts another slide
Well, what do you do for a living
Take pictures
He presses the bulb - the shutters click
This sort
No, Milly
He inserts another slide
Don't you like this sort
No, Milly
He presses the bulb - the shutters click
Well what sort do you like
Mark looks at her thoughtfully for a long moment
may show you - one day
That'll be a treat, 'm sure
Mark smiles at her shyly
That's all, Milly
Oh no, sonny
Now take one  can show my mother
Mark inserts another slide
Think of her then
There is a gentle  at the door, and Mr
Peters enters
He carries a tray of coffee
He keeps his eyes modestly lowered
On the house
He lays the tray on a table, still keeping his eyes lowered, and goes out
Some house
Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole
She glances over her shoulder
It's your turn now, love
of Lorraine staring out of the window
She stiffens
Milly's voice is overlaid
(
) (in a whisper) it's her first time
Lorraine clutches her shawl tightly
Come on, love
Don't be shy
Lorraine turns round
The left side of her face is classical in its beauty
She has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the right side
Her eyes are large - and beautiful - and defiant
of Mark looking at her
of Lorraine
He said
you needn't photograph my face
of Mark
want to
of Lorraine
Beautiful in profile
suppose you'll fix my bruises too
want to
What about the customers
of the shawl round Lorraine's shoulders
of Mark
You needn't be shy
of me
it's my first time too
of Lorraine's eyes - puzzled
Yours
In front of eyes
like
He tries to go on - but words are a foreign language to him
eyes
as full of
In a sudden rush: Lorraine - let my camera tell you
of Lorraine standing very still  looking at him in silence
Milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot
Overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera
on the dark liquid being poured into a cup
: Whisky being poured into a glass
'   -  - The hand filling the glass is a woman's (
)
She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see her face
Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress
group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom they are singing: (singing) Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, towards them
of  , a well-built youngster in his middle twenties
Happy birthday
dear Helen He obviously means it
happy birthday to you
of 'dear '
sensitive, intelligent, and extremely attractive girl, who  as the encircling youngsters now inform us in song - is: Twenty-one today, She's twenty-one today, She's got the key of the door, She's never been twenty-one before
of the glass by Mrs
Stephens' side
It is half empty
An elderly lady leans across to her
She is Mrs
Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry
You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs
Stephens
Mrs
Stephens grunts
Someone switches on a gramophone and the young couples start dancing at once
Tony hurries up to Helen
May
Helen goes towards him
calls out sharply: Look
He is pointing at something out of camera
All heads - except Mrs
Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze
Mrs
Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed chair
to the window
Mark is standing there
of Helen looking at Mark
We watch him over her shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it
(
) It's that chap from upstairs
'  -  - The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window
From his    Helen's eyes looking at him - the key of the door in them - looking at him, not staring
Suddenly the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's shoulder
the high-backed chair in the foreground with the back of that motionless head
a young couple giggling as they stare at him
Mark steps away, and the with him
We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious street
Mark hurries towards a side entrance
'   - of Helen looking at the empty window
'll ask him in
of Tony - frowning
to Mrs
Stephens' glass
the hand which refills it has begun to tremble
- The lights are on
Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which leads to the hall
The sound of a dance record can be heard
Mark starts to whistle it under his breath
- Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the door of Helen's sitting room
The sound of Helen's party fills the hall
Mark reaches the staircase
There is the sound of a door opening
Helen's voice is overlaid: (
) Excuse me
Mark hesitates, then turns round
of Helen - smiling at him
don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs
Mark looks at her as if he does
but tonight 'm determined at least to say hello to you
So hello
Her directness is natural, consistent and very hard to resist
of Mark - smiling
'm Helen Stephens
She glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over his shoulder
'm having a party - and the other tenants are there
And a few friends
We'd like you to join us
Mark
Pardon
'm Mark
Hallo, Mark
She holds out her hand
he takes it gently
Please come in
you'll meet the others who live here, and
Thank you, but
work
Oh
She glances again at his camera
Well,  hope to keep it going for hours yet
so when you've finished why not look in
She realizes that this is not the happiest of phrases
Mark
He hesitates
to Helen's door
Tony stands there
Darling, your cake - everyone's waiting
of Mark - looking at her
Thank you
He turns away
Happy Birthday
He hurries up the stairs
of Helen
She stares after him for a moment
Then returns thoughtfully to her party
: The screen remains dark for a moment
We are with Mark in a darkened room
He is giving a film show - and we are the screen
' - - His cine-projector points straight at us
flickering light shines in our eyes
We can see him crouching behind the projector
Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently
Perspiration trickles down his forehead
He is breathing very quickly
The sounds of the party seep up from downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp
There is a knock on the door
Mark does not hear it
to the door of the room
It is blacked-out like a photographic dark-room
The knock is repeated
of Mark
He switches off the projector instantly
to an open cupboard in the corner
of the shelves
They are stacked with spools of film
travels slowly over these spools
Mark's hand add two more to the collection; his Voice is overlaid
(
) minute
He closes the cupboard door
'   - Mark comes out of the dark-room behind him - the light is kept out by a baffle and a curtain
He has a pleasant, normally untidy bedsitting room
He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries to the door
He opens it - Helen is standing there
hope 'm not disturbing you
of Mark - shaking his head, smiling shyly
of Helen
knew you wouldn't come down
so 've brought you this
She holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake
Thank you
He takes the plate
very much
mustn't keep you from your work She turns to go
'd like to offer you a drink
She turns round
Thank you, Mark
haven't one
'd adore some water
She smiles
a hostess can't drink water at her own party, it looks like a hint to the guests
Will you
would you
like to come in
Yes, Mark
She steps over the threshold
The door closes behind her
'   - of Helen looking round the room
Mark's voice is overlaid
(
) There's milk
if you'd like some
Very much
if you can spare it
(
) Yes
Helen glances towards the inner room
He holds out a glass of milk to her
Thank you, Mark
She drinks it with relish
He watches her in silence
This is a pleasant room
and you've another inside
Yes
How long have you lived here
All my life
She looks at him in surprise
was born in this house Oh
of Mark
It's my father's
Do you mean 've at last found out who our landlord is
Your father
Well - no
he's dead
He hesitates
'm the landlord
She looks at him in astonishment
Yes
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent
haven't
meant
know
of Mark
It's his house - and 'll never sell it
but  can't afford the upkeep, so  let rooms
He looks at her anxiously
if  charge too much, tell me and 'll tell the agents
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others or you'll have no peace
Peace
of Helen
Mark, what do you do
(slowly) Most of the time,  work in a film studio
On the photographic side, 'll bet
hope to be a film director
very soon
How exciting
have some spare time jobs
as well
To do with photography
More milk
No thank you
to do with photography
Yes
to do with photography
When  came in were you looking at some films
Yes
Of yours
Yes
'd like to see them
He looks at her in silence
Know 'm being rude
but  really would like to see them
(she smiles
) it would be a birthday present
from you to me
Would it
Yes, Mark
Oh
But  suppose you're too busy
She puts down the glass, turns to the door
Will you
would you
like to see them now
She turns round
He is standing by the entrance to the inner room
Thank you
'll
go first
He leads the way - she follows
For a moment the screen is in darkness
dark-room darkness
- We can  - faintly  the dance music from downstairs
There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow
of Helen looking round in amazement
As certain events of possible interest are to take place in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen
The room is the product of three rooms which have been knocked into one
It is very large and extremely well constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a laboratory)
One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows
The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting in the light
In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls
There are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of equipment above the 'dry'
This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning in the ceiling above the benches
The other part of the room has a window at the far end of it
Heavy drapes are putted across it
Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 16mm screen
Two banks of floods and a variety of spots light this part of the room
There is a small control panel on the wall
Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old
All of it glistens with the affection of its owner
There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone except an adult
the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all
of Mark
He stands by the lighting panel, watching Helen
From his    her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round
He brushes the hair out of his
For a moment she turns her back to him
He presses a switch on the wall
gentle light ripples through the back of Helen's hair
of Helen
She turns to him
She is very nearly at a loss for words
This is so
well - so many things
but above all - it's so
She takes a final look round
completely unexpected
She looks at him searchingly
Is all of it yours
Yes
mean
is it designed by you
Furnished by you
Tell me about this room
of Mark
It belonged to my father What was he
Scientist
Then this equipment was his
No
He hesitates
Sold his to buy it
But it seems to be so
technical
She looks at him with renewed interest
If this is where you work,  can't wait to see what you work at
of Mark - in difficulties
Don't know what to show you
Well
what were you looking at when  interrupted you
He looks at her thoughtfully
All right
He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door
of the cupboard
Mark's hand reach for a spool of film
then hesitate, poised above another spool
of Helen - watching with interest
of Mark
He closes the cupboard, and turns round
there is a spool of film in his hand
He walks slowly towards his projector
he seems  for the moment  to have forgotten she is there
of Helen - watching him thread the film into the projector
This is the first
twenty-first birthday present
'll ever have given
It's the first 've ever asked for
He places a chair a few feet away from the screen - and, with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it
She sits down
of Mark
He looks at her intently for a moment - then turns off the lights
Over Helen's shoulder We can just make out the empty screen
Mark switches on the projector
of Helen - the light flickering on her face
of Mark staring at Helen's face
of Helen
her expression of surprise
Over Mark's shoulder   the surprise growing
Over Helen's shoulder we see the screen
We are looking at a small boy
He is lying in his bed asleep
Although the print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome boy
Mark, what a beautiful child
The boy turns restlessly in his sleep
one of his pillows falls to the floor
Who is he
Me Of course it is
Then who took this film
(quietly) My Father
light - as if from a small torch  starts to shine on the child's eyes
He moves restlessly
What a wonderful idea
The light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right
It is growing brighter
You'll be able to show it to your own chi
The child wakes up suddenly
He stares at something
then starts to scream
You must have had a bad dream
of Mark watching her in silence
but what was that light
The camera,  suppose
Mark does not answer
The small screen is filled with the face of the screaming, terrified child
(Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful dissolve:) the little boy standing in front of a garden wall
He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but falls over
Helen laughs
Mark watches her in silence
Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall
At last he succeeds
Whatever are you after
the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at something
rapt, motionless
The cine-camera which is taking this picture now tracks rather clumsily towards the wall
over the wall of what is fascinating young Mark -  man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing
The -  - again rather clumsily - to young Mark
staring intently
Naughty boy  hope you were spanked
of Helen
It suddenly occurs to her
but, Mark
what a strange thing for your father to photograph
Switch off
No
She stares again at that lonely figure perched on the wall
No
The small screen begins to dissolve
so does the large one
: '   - Over Mrs
Stephens' shoulder   the party in progress
The glass by her side is full again
Tony is dancing with an attractive blonde
Tony
He turns round
Me, Mrs
Stephens
The head nods
Tony advances reluctantly towards her
of Mrs
Stephens
Over Tony's shoulder   a powerfully built and once lovely woman
She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober
The few movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing away
The voice articulates so carefully that the slur scarcely shows
The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the fact that she is drunk
Her sightless eyes stare out the camera as Tony reaches her
want a word with you
: of Helen's eyes
The light from the projector flickering into them
hate people who chatter in films - but there's so much  want to ask
- She is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, watching the small screen intently
of Mark
His face is cupped in his hand as he watches her intently
Over Helen's shoulder   Mark in the making
The child is again asleep
this time he is being photographed from the head of the bed - the beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto the left, then onto the right
(in a whisper) Again
Mark looks at her in silence
The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, pulling the bedclothes round him
His right hand is limp on the pillow
The light shines for a moment on this hand, then goes out
Helen half turns towards Mark
Mark, this isn't some kind of jo
Her attention is suddenly riveted on the screen
(in a whisper) No, Helen
Over Helen's shoulder   something drop onto the child's bed
something which stays quite still for a moment, then starts crawling towards the counterpane
It is a small lizard
Mark, whatever is that
Her voice trails away
She stares - repelled and fascinated - at the screen
Mark reach for his cine-camera
Over Helen's shoulder   the lizard reach the counterpane
It stretches itself out on the floral design - its body is pointed towards the child's hand
a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto Helen's face
is the   of Mark's cine-camera
She wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen
What are you
wanted to photograph you
watching
No, Mark
The camera purrs on
No
He switches off the spot
the purring of the camera dies away
She turns towards the small screen
help me to understand this
this nightmare
The small boy is sitting upright
screaming with terror
there is no sign of the lizard
handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed
He continues crying - looking up into someone's face
of Mark watching the screen
We hear a man's deep voice overlaid
'   (
) That'll do Mark
dry your eyes and stop being silly
Small Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his eyes
his hands are trembling
The small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve
Helen turns to Mark
All right
now look
Mark - what was all that about
He looks at her helplessly
that was a lizard, wasn't it
Or a
Liz
Well how did it get there
How did it get there Mark
Was it a pet
Not mine
Won't you try to explain
of Mark staring at the screen
You'd better go
like to understand what 'm shown
She turns to the screen
What was your father trying to do
Photographing you at nigh
Her voice trails away
better go
From Helen's    the screen
Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie
He is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring at something in horror and disbelief
his hands clasp the bedrail tightly
Slowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the bed, staring
His lips begin to quiver
He bends forward over the bed
the back of his bowed head
Mark
what is this
am saying
goodbye
my mother
We catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of her
of Helen
(in a whisper) He
photographed
that
of Mark
Yes
Suddenly - and healthily - his temper snaps
and this
He pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it will go
The film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a glimpse of a long line of cars
her funeral
It speeds by
and this
confused picture of earth and flowers
her burial
The briefest glimpse of a little boy with a spade
and this
a girl in a bikini by sand-dunes
Mark offers no comment
Mark, who is that
Her successor
of Helen
Suc-
He married her
six weeks after
the previous sequence
He pulls back the lever of his projector
the film returns to its normal speed
the same attractive young woman standing in a garden
She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand
Suddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark standing alone
She filmed
what comes now
of Helen watching intently
It's out of focus
From Helen's    a tall man in a black coat walking away from camera
He hurries towards small Mark - who watches him anxiously
Is that your father
The morning that he left for his honeymoon
The back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of small Mark
all we can see is that tall figure looking downwards standing very still
Camera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing
What is he doing
Giving me a present
What was it
Mark stares at the blurred screen, perspiration trickling down his forehead
Can't you guess
The small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our camera rushes towards it
a   of a   - and at the moment we see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid
whisper which echoes round the room
(
) camera
We are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's hands
There is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track
of the shelf which encircles Mark's room
We are looking at the very same camera which the small boy is holding
of the camera in small Mark's hands
His father's finger points lo the view-finder
Small Mark stares into it
Small Mark begins to smile
of Mark watching himself being born
of Helen watching Mark
Switch it off
He continues to stare at the screen
Switch it off, Mark
She turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch
Small Mark and his father go rapidly backwards
Mark turns off the projector abruptly
The room is in darkness
both of them breathing quickly
The light goes on
Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps his face averted
Helen walks slowly towards the exit
She glances round once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room
Mark stares after her
'   - She walks towards the door
turns round suddenly - almost in anger
So he was a scientist
He keeps his face averted
What kind of scientist, Mark
Biologist
What was he trying to do to you
He doesn't answer
Mark
He turns round slowly
From his    the willingness to understand on her face
What was he trying to do to you
Watch me
grow up
She walks towards him
takes his handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wipes his forehead
He wanted a record of a growing child
complete in every detail - if such a thing were possible - and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me
at all times
of Mark
never knew
the whole of my childhood
one moment's privacy
And those lights in your eyes
and that - thing
He was interested
in the reactions of the nervous system
to fear
Fear
Fear
Fear
of the word 'fear'
We are looking at the spine of a book on Mark's shelf
The full title reads: The Physiology of Fear by Professor
Lewis
'   : (
) Especially fear in children - and how they react to it
of the word 'fear' on the next book
The full title reads:     ,
There is a row of such books all by Professor Lewis
of Mark
think he learned a lot
from me
'd wake up
screaming
sometimes
and he'd be there
taking notes
and pictures
and 'm sure good came of it
for some people
He was brilliant
scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed - and good comes of it
don't know
if he did
but if he did
he'll have learned something of value
If only about lizards
Mark - it sounds to me as if your father was
He founded clinics
He sounds completely
He was famous
Professor
Lewis
three clinics
Why do you still live in his house
and watch his films
They helped make me
what  am
photographer
It's no wonder, is it
But you still haven't shown me anything you've photographed
He looks at her in silence
Will you
There is a knock on the door
One day
He hurries to the door, and opens it
Tony is standing there
Excuse me, but
From Tony's    Helen looking at the door of the dark room
Oh, there you are, Helen
She turns towards him
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if
'm coming
She turns to Mark
wish you'd join us
Mark shakes his head
Thanks
work
hope that you
She is suddenly aware of Tony watching her
She glances at the birthday cake on the table
have a sweet tooth
She smiles at him
Thank you
for my present
She goes into the passage
Good night, old boy
He puts his arm round Helen, and closes the door
Mark stares after them, motionless
The   on the birthday cake
As the light fades, a voice yells: Cut
: - of a set showing part of a large West End store
blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a crowd of extras surround her
As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the blonde ( ) props herself onto her elbow, looking towards the Director
of the Director ( ) standing beside the camera
Print that one
He glances at the   ( ), who nods his head in agreement
of Mark standing at the back of the camera crew
He shakes his head in disagreement
The Chief Cameraman spots Mark's small mutiny and wags his finger at him
As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's finger automatically wags back
of Baden looking at his watch
He sighs, then nods to the Assistant Director who stands beside him
All right, everyone
Back at two
Baden walks out without a word to anyone
hubbub of chatter breaks out
The unit downs tools and begins to disperse
of one of the extras () - a small, vivacious, brunette with delicate, attractive features
She edges towards the camera crew
of Mark watching her
Over his shoulder   Vivian glance towards him
He nods almost imperceptibly
Vivian hurries towards the exit
Mark turns to a shelf behind him - picks up his cine-camera and a little full string bag containing his lunch
: - of Vivian munching a sandwich
She is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior set - a Chinese temple or a medieval castle (or a combination of each like a Pinewood drawing-room)
Beside her she has a small tape-recorder, or record-player
We hear music - modem rhythms
There are several people strolling about - but no one in the immediate vicinity
No one
except Mark
of Mark - settling down on the other side of the wall (where they can talk without being seen together)
Mark
Hallo
Were you spotted
Don't think so
(switches off music) Is it tonight
of Mark
Yes
of Vivian
Mark
Yes
You're sure we won't be caught
Not if you do as  tell you
will,  promise
You haven't
said anything
to anyone
Of course not
Good
like some cake
Thank you
We see him break off a piece of birthday cake, and pass it over to her
Mark
want to be quite clear about this
of Mark staring at his cake
Tonight, when the studio's empty
'm to come back-and you're going to give me a film test
right
Right
You'll then print the film - so can show it to my agent and anyone else who matters - right
Right
Mark
She hesitates
've been offered film tests before
but  haven't liked the terms
There aren't any
Then why are you doing this
Risking your job and
Not just for you
Viv
have an agent too - and  want to show him what  can do
want to direct
(switching on music again) There's someone coming
Mark lies motionless behind the wall
young male comes towards Vivian
Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't it
Yes
Thought  saw you talking to somebody
was learning my lines
Didn't know you had any
He glances at his watch
Want a drink
Dutch
Later
perhaps
Be seeing you He wanders off
Mark
Yes
(switching off music again) You didn't mind me asking
No, more cake
No
you want to direct
more badly than anything don't you
Mark is silent, staring at the sky
Don't you, Mark
want
to photograph
the impossible
What is impossible
Something
that has never been photographed before
What
You really want to know
Very much, especially if there's a part for me
want
to photograph a murder
while it's being committed
No part for me then
But that
isn't enough
Is this a new script
want
to frighten
someone
to death
and photograph
their expression of fear
Mark
What's this story called
That is something
he never photographed
Who
Mark is silent
Who is he, Mark
Anyone
No one could
they'd be caught
wouldn't care
if  had my picture
Besides, how would you frighten anyone to death
There's a way
Well, what
There's a way
You'd better not tell me
'll be scared to death tonight as it is
hooter
Back on the set - shall  go first
Please
She rises to her feet
From behind the wall comes a gentle whirring purring sound
What are you doing
Getting into practice
She smiles down at him
See you tonight
See you tonight
She walks away
And the gentle purring continues to the sun beating down on the lot
: An arc lamp beating down on the set
- Baden bears down on the Assistant Director
Would you enquire if our leading lady is ready to start leading
cry goes up, (
) Miss Diane Ashley, please
Miss Diane Ashley, please
of Baden turning towards the entrance
of Mark turning towards the entrance
of entrance
- Miss
appears
among the many qualities she radiates is goodwill - especially towards Miss Diane Ashley
How are you, Sparks
Chippy
Bob
Hallo, Diane
How are you, Tom
Roger
Hallo, Diane
And so on, until: How are you, Phil
Mark
of Mark
Hallo, Miss Ashley
(to a figure high in the scaffolding) How are you, Pete
Hi, Di
She reaches Baden - and completely ignores him
Darling, you've only been playing this part for three weeks, so in case you haven't yet had a chance to read the script
She ignores this
may  remind you that you're a girl with an irresistible impulse
She looks at him - then at her hand - and nods
a kleptomaniac
Who cannot help stealing
Get inside her, Diane
What - in all the world - do you most want to steal
The limelight
Baden sighs
We'll run the scene where you catch sight of the store detective and faint
Where's the girl who plays the bystander
Vivian steps forward
How are you
Hallo, Diane
1ST Positions, everyone
of Vivian taking her position in front of the lift
She glances at her watch
of Mark standing by the side of the studio camera
He glances at his watch
towards the lift
From Mark's    Diane catch sight of the Store Detective - and crumple in a faint
Hit that floor with a thud
of door marked:   -
(
) insists on realism
timid knock is overlaid before we dare enter
- of a pile of scripts on a great man's desk
is immersed in reading a script
his eyes race across the page
Over his shoulder   what he is reading
a sheet of figures attached to the script
At the same time Mr
Jarvis is holding a telephone receiver to his ear - and we hear an enthusiastic :  (-) (
) it's a wonderful subject,
Paramount wants it,
wants it, Columbia wants it
But is it commercial
(
) Danny Angel wants it
Still reading the script, Mr
Jarvis lays the receiver on his desk and picks up another
Are those budgets ready
Well bring 'em in
He replaces this receiver and picks up the original
The voice is still talking - something about 'a wonderful part for Kenny or Alec'
(
) Send me a memo - we'll discuss it next week
He replaces the receiver
enters
She hands him some folders
her smile curtsies
of Mr
Jarvis opening a folder
Over his shoulder   a page covered with row upon row of figures
The great man's finger skims along the figures like a tailor feeling cloth
There's an error
The total should be a hundred and fifty thousand pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence - not thirteen and ninepence
That could mean the difference between profit and loss on a first feature
Sorry,
He glowers at her - but his day is made
Any units working late tonight
Only one, sir
Night exteriors on the lot
The Elephant with two
That animal needs a stick of dynamite
of Jarvis
Remind me to pay them a visit tonight
Yes,
She makes a note in her little book
Now, Miss Simpson
take a memo to all department heads
Over his shoulder   an open window towards it
(
) In light of the new economy drive
: of Clapper Boy's board
It reads: Take 49
- Again, please
and, darling
He turns to Diane, who is wearily picking herself up off the floor
just this once
will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and try to look as if you're stunned
Say one kind word - and  would be
(hastily) Positions, everyone
: : Camera crew on a tracking shot
Mark is operating the Selsen motor
Baden - shaking his head
Diane - picking herself up off the floor
Clapper Boy's board  reading: Take 57
Vivian - glancing at her watch
Mark - glancing at his
Diane - picking herself up off the floor
If  have to faint once more shall faint
: of Baden - triumphant at last
Cut
How was that
(thumbs up all round - with one exception) Mark
Mark nods perfunctorily
Print it
He glances at his watch - then nods to the Assistant Director
That's it, boys and girls
wrap it up
Night-night everyone
Baden puts his arm round Diane's shoulder
How are you, darling
She makes a hobbling exit
of Vivian hurrying towards the exit carrying her little recorder
In a burst of chatter, the unit starts to disperse
of Mark picking up his cine-camera and his lunch bag
The   comes up to him
Catching the bus
Not tonight
meeting someone
for a drink
Wanted to discuss the film at the Everyman
Tomorrow then
hope so
Good night, Mark
Good night
: of Vivian
She is sitting at a dressing-room table
making-up with care
- Three other girls share the dressing room with her
There is a knock at the door - and the Young Extra who spoke to Vivian in the grounds pokes his head round
Greetings
lousy afternoon's work, wasn't it
Who wants a lift to town
1ST In what
colleague's car
there's room for two on my lap - three at a pinch
1ST Which is what we'd get
2ND You, Viv
No, thanks
've a date
at the Local
1ST Us two then
2ND 'm game
might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a tube
- The cars are streaming towards the gate
of Baden driving a small new car
of the Chief Cameraman driving a large old one
'  - He is still immersed in his figures
Miss Simpson is walking to the door
She glances at her little book
'm to remind you to pay a surprise visit tonight to The Elephant with
He grunts
Good night,
Jarvis goes on reading
: of Vivian
Music playing
Vivian moves about nervously in front of a mirror in the deserted dressing room
She wears slacks and a shirt
She glances at her watch - her hands are trembling - looks at watch, hears the fireman coming, then switches off the music and hides in the big cupboard - Fireman making his rounds, turning off lights
- Only a few cars now remain
It is beginning to grow dark
- The long corridors are dim and deserted
- The fireman is making his rounds
- Vivian is standing in the cupboard - the lights are on
- Fireman opening the dressing-room doors - and glancing inside
- Two electricians are smoking
- Fireman opens the door of Vivian's dressing room
- From Vivian's    the lights go out
the sound of the door closing - and the Fireman's footsteps disappearing down the corridor
'  - The great man closing up his folder
glancing at his watch
turning out the light
: - Vivian is hurrying along a deserted corridor
and the little recorder
She pauses - and glances out of a door
She carries her case Over her shoulder   the studio lot - in a blaze of light we can see a crowd of people hanging about in solar topees and tropical kit
of Vivian watching anxiously
She turns away - and hurries down the corridor
Don Jarvis strides across the courtyard
We can almost hear - and perhaps we do - a cash register ringing up
One of the white-clad figures lounging indolently in the doorway glances round, sees the Inquisition approaching and freezes
His degree of terror might satisfy Mark
The great man strides on
: - Vivian pauses in front of the entrance to the set
Above the note is a notice: ' '
The light is out
Vivian looks round - there is no one in sight
Vivian slips in quietly, and closes the door behind her
- The set is in darkness
of Vivian looking round
(in a whisper) Mark
No reply
Vivian hesitates
then edges slowly forward
Ahead of her are shadowy counters full of merchandise
Beyond them is the door of the lift
of the studio camera and the Director's empty chair beside it
of Vivian edging forward
Mark
She reaches one of the counters - and leans against it, looking around
shot of Vivian
She is leaning against the counter of the trunk department
Trunks and suitcases at 'greatly reduced prices' are piled behind her
of Vivian
She starts whistling nervously under her breath
Very faintly overlaid is the sound of Mark whistling under his
Vivian stops whistling - and so does Mark
She listens intently for a moment - then peers at her watch
of the watch on Mark's wrist
of Vivian
She shivers suddenly
then looks at her watch again
She hesitates
then turns towards the exit, and starts to edge back
She trips over a cable and almost falls
Suddenly she is bathed in light
She wheels round
One of the big spots is beating down on her
Mark
No sign of him
Overlaid is a gentle purring sound
Where are another light comes on, shining through her hair
Mark
The sound of his steps is overlaid
Listen
we must
His footsteps stop
she looks round
Where are you
His voice is quietly overlaid
(
) Here, Viv
She wheels round
of Mark sitting in the Director's chair
He is holding in his lap his cine-camera, and a black bag
of Vivian breathing quickly
You frightened me
He looks at her in silence
Now listen
they're working late on the lot
know
They're branched off this stage - 'm using their juice
He nods, staring at her intently
We must call it off
someone's bound to see us
They might
(rising slowly) but they won't interrupt us while we're filming
've put the red light on
- of the red light - burning
of Vivian
- You've what
Put the
Then they'll know someone's here
They won't come in
They'll wait outside
what's the difference
The difference is
a perfect film
Over his shoulder   the studio camera
have waited
a long time
for this
and so have you
no one
must interrupt it
She glances round at the brazenly burning lights; shakes her head despairingly
We'll be caught
What does that matter
Matter
You stand to lose
a job as an extra
stand to lose
nothing
She looks at him in silence
the results must be so perfect
that the risks don't count
of Mark
So perfect
that even he
(he hesitates) even he
would say
Who Don Jarvis
He looks at her, then nods
Oh
He'd say: (imitating the great man's voice) Sign on the dotted line, kiddies
You can use my pen, but bring your own ink
(her excitement is growing) Mark
if you're sure it's worth it
It's time to find out, Viv
He walks slowly towards the studio camera
She prepares for the test by switching on music and warming up with dance movements
Come on
Get hot
(she accents the rhythm) Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and swings the camera
We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of the studio, from the Director's chair
And finally from Vivian's
She stops dancing but the music continues
You belong there
He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away
then bends and looks into the finder
There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen goes dark
It remains dark for a moment
Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the centre   Vivian's face in the finder of the studio camera
(Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, we see everything the right way up and in perfect perspective
) Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it on
He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's delicate features a radiant miniature
The miniature smiles shyly at him
She has stopped dancing and is looking directly at the camera
Music continues
do feel alone in front of it
(she hesitates) suppose stars never do
They feel alone without it
(he looks in the eyepiece) Through the film, we can see only her eyes - large and wistful
and the great ones
feel alone
all the time
She becomes the uninhibited Vivian again
Then 'm great, boy
What is it you want me to act
(she strikes an attitude a, la Rabbins) He looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping time to the rhythm again
Being frightened to death
You remembered
Yes - and 'll have a go
We hear his quick breathing
've been wondering all the afternoon how you'd do it
'll bet you've thought of a wonderful twist
(she does a wonderful twist) of Mark
He looks down - a little sadly - and peers into the finder
(The camera dolly is on tracks - he tracks forward
) Music continues - piano
In the finder   a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced prices'  on the shelf behind Vivian
From Vivian's    Mark leave the studio camera and hurry towards the trunks
She watches him wide-eyed
What are you doing
Building us a set
He reaches for the largest trunk
Why not pull the studio down while you're about it
They can only hang you once
Exactly
He carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays it carefully on the floor
Music continues
Vivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera as if it were a mirror
The rhythm of the music changes
If only Don Jarvis could see me now
She jumps onto the trunk and taps
If only  could see Don Jarvis now
She giggles again
warn you, Mark - 'm hysterical
'd rather act dying of laughter, if it's all the same to you
She jumps off the trunk onto the floor
He opens the trunk
she jumps into it
Her laughter echoes round the deserted studio
: - The two electricians are roaring with laughter
One of them is making tea
1ST So he did it again
Now you tell one
to a dial on the wall
one of the needles flickers slightly
2ND Half a mo
1ST  (
) One lump or two
2ND As the starlet said to the casting director
He turns away from the dials, and grasps at the outstretched mug
: of Vivian recording - her little recorder is twittering back at great speed
(to Mark, over her shoulder) What are you doing
She restarts music
- She is watching Mark curiously as he arranges the lighting
Be patient, Viv
it's going to be worth it
of the studio camera
In front of it - fixed on a small hook - is a tape measure
Mark reaches for it
then carefully measures the distance between the trunk and the camera
then he takes apiece of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the floor
The music continues
Oh well
've stood alone in front of a studio camera
That's more than most have
Ever stood
behind one
He glances at a nearby dial - only a few feet away from the one which is flickering
No
Help yourself
She goes around the camera out of sight - and he is out of hers
He glances into the trunk - it is deep, and very empty
(accenting the rhythm) can see you, Mark
perfectly
Good
Yes, sir
'll bet 'm the best camerawoman in the business
(beating time with her feet) Mark hurries to the side of the studio camera and picks up his cine-camera
(
) 've lost you
'll be back
Suddenly Mark's face appears in the finder
Welcome, stranger
We see Mark raise his cine-camera
He seems to be pointing it straight at us
We hear a gentle purring
What are you doing
Photographing you photographing me
High angle shot of Mark standing in front of the studio camera - photographing her photographing him
(in mock awe) Mark, you're brilliant
He walks slowly towards her, holding his cine-camera to his eyes
In the finder of Mark's cine-camera   Vivian at the studio camera
She comes closer and closer
Lost you again
(
) Never mind
We see him standing almost on top of her - his cine-camera trained on her
'm ready now, Viv
She looks up slowly - and a little hesitantly
Music, all drums
Go and stand on that cross, will you
(solemnly) Yes, sir, Mr
Director, sir
He watches her in silence as she walks to the front of the studio camera and takes up her position
while the drum- beat continues
: - Don Jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot
It is now bustling with activity
girl comes up to him
She raises her cigarette for a light - and looks into his eyes
He hands her a box of matches
and walks away
Over his shoulder we see the other stages - apparently empty
Don Jarvis hesitates, then strides towards one
- of a dial - the needle flickering slightly
Overlaid is the voice of the 1st Electrician
1ST  (
) and here's one of the wife and nipper
: - of Vivian staring at the trunk on the floor behind her
The recorded rhythm continues
Am  supposed to imagine someone is going to put me in there
Mark is watching her over the top of the studio camera
Yes, Viv
He peers into the viewfinder
In the finder we see Vivian looking rather pathetically into camera
Mark -  hope  won't let you down
know you're trying to create atmosphere for me - but
just don't feel frightened
Wouldn't it be better if  just did my number
(shaking head) Later
Oh all right
could do anything - feel so relaxed - and that's due to you
You're so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too
you have it in you, boy
From her    see him raise his head slightly
Ready, Viv
(great effort) Well-'ll try - In the finder we see her wrinkling her brow
But what
would
frighten me to death
(looking appealingly into camera) Set the mood for me, Mark
Well
He goes and switches off the recorder
The sudden silence is startling
Imagine someone
coming towards you
who's going to kill you - regardless of consequences
madman
Yes - but he knows it
and you don't
and just to kill you
isn't enough for him
But how would he frighten me to
She stares into focusing screen - intrigued, but not frightened, not even by the silence and shadowy vastness around her
Stay there, Viv
you're
just right
She stands motionless - staring into camera
- of Don Jarvis
He is standing motionless, staring down a corridor
What he is staring at is out of camera - and it is puzzling the great man
He walks quietly along the corridor
of Vivian
can't imagine what you've thought of
- of Mark
He raises his head slowly - and locks the studio camera off
Then he walks slowly towards her
of Mark walking towards Vivian
to the trunk behind her
Mark's voice is overlaid: (
) Suppose this
were one of his weapons
of Don Jarvis
- The great man is poised for the kill
He is moving forward stealthily
and suddenly breaks into a run
- and   the object of his attentions wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove
of a Fireman - smoking a cigarette
of Don Jarvis - smoking
of the Fireman's terror as he sees Don Jarvis
Smoking on duty
The Fireman opens his mouth to explain  and smoke exudes
Come with me
The Fireman follows him meekly
So near - yet a lifetime away - a red light is burning above a closed door
of Vivian - puzzled
That
- of Mark
He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible tripod
Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out
that a very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it
From Mark's    Vivian looking at the spike
He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches from her throat
Yes
that would be frightening
But
there's something else
We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it
Well
What is it
Just for a moment Mark's arm moves
His back hides what he is doing
Suddenly   Vivian turn her head sharply - she is looking at something out of camera
(in a whisper) That
The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores it, staring out of camera
Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face
(in a whisper) Mark
take it
The fear on her face is rapidly growing
away
She tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her
-
It is almost a scream
We can hear Mark breathing quickly
Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her
Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes
them dilating with terror
There is a sudden crash as the big power switches go out in the roof
The lights go out
There is a scream in the darkness
Then silence
The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of Mrs
Stephens
bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against our eyelids
It looms closer and stronger
'  (
) And that, darling, is the end of the news
Unless you want the football results
of Mrs
Stephens, a large glass of whisky - and the bottle - beside her
It is night
No thank you
of Helen
'She's Got the Key of the Door' is overlaid
What else can  read you
The label on this whisky bottle
Are you sure it says seventy per cent proof
Certain
They're bigger liars than the press
From Helen's    her reach for her glass with a steady hand
Is that your last tonight
doubt it
Your last but one
Don't haggle
(producing a coin) Toss me double or nothing
Done
Helen spins the coin on the table Mrs
Stephens listens intently
the coin stops spinning
Heads
Her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin
Bad luck, darling
Huh
She turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side
Helen watches her with a smile - then looks thoughtfully at the ceiling
What are you looking at
The ceiling
Wondering if that young man is home
Yes
Well he is
heard him come in
four paragraphs ago
From Helen's    the sightless eyes staring at her
Do you like him
of Helen
Yes, darling
Why
He has a quality
(sipping her glass) Wish this had
and  think he could help me
With your photographs
Yes
of Mrs
Stephens
Helen
Yes
Mrs
Stephens hesitates - which is rare
(abruptly) It doesn't matter
(quickly) Mummy, what's worrying you
The price of whisky
What else
What else matters
Don't you like Mark
Haven't met him
You don't like him
Now why not
of Mrs
Stephens
Again she hesitates
distrust a man who walks quietly
He's shy
His footsteps aren't
They're stealthy
Now darling
Are you going up to him
May
We both have the key of the door
Mine needs oiling - and yours needs exercise
Off you go
Thank you
She kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass
remember that you lost the toss
She walks to the door
Helen
Yes, darling
If you're back in five minutes
won't even finish this
Done
She hurries out
Mrs
Stephens instantly refills her glass
of her hand
It has begun to tremble
' - of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark- room
He is busy unloading and winding film onto a developing rack
He puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts the time clock
of the time clock ticking
knock is heard off
Mark looks up
Who is it
(
) Helen
of Mark
Faintly overlaid is 'She's Got the Key of the Door'
He looks down at the clock
(calling) Come in, Helen
- Helen opens the door of Mark's sitting room
We hear Mark call out from the inner room: (
) Would you
please
wait in there
Developing
Helen goes in, closing the door behind her
'   - Helen enters
She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark- room
Mother heard you come in - so guessed you wouldn't be in bed
No reply from the inner room
Are you sure this is conven
(
) Won't be long
Helen glances at her watch
then looks curiously round the room
of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair
of Helen
She picks it up and looks at it, curiously, fingering the stops
(
) Hallo
Helen turns round
Mark is standing on the threshold of the dark-room
Hallo, Mark
He walks towards her
he stops suddenly
He is staring at the recorder in her hand
hope you don't mind - is it a tape-recorder
Yes
Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf
of Helen
'm sure 'm being a nuisance
but, Mark,  very much want to
Her voice trails away
of Mark
He is holding out a small package
Happy birthday
Mark
That's very sweet of you - but really
It isn't much
don't know anything about
presents for twenty-one
but  saw it this morning
so
please
(gently) Thank you
She takes the package, and unwraps it
Inside is a slender brooch It's beautiful
like the design
More milk
More
No, thank you, Mark
and  really appreciate this
'm going to put it on now
He watches her hold it against her dress
There
Or there
The first place
think so too
of Helen pinning it on
of Mark touching his lapel
of Helen glancing at her watch
of Mark glancing at his
He thinks of the ticking clock in the dark-room
Helen looks up, and sees him
am keeping you
No
promise
Mark, 'm here for some advice
From me
Please
He looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman of the year (unanimously) - and the two films he directed have both won Oscars (though Don Jarvis understood them)
His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile
work in a public library - in the children's section
'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me
She takes a deep breath
In my spare time
write
What's embar
write stories for children
but so did Grimm
Hans Andersen
Lewis Carroll
Had any published
Some short stories
'd like to read
learned today
that my first book
has been accepted
For publication in the spring
But that's wonderful
what's it about
magic camera - and what it photographs
of Mark
Whatever made you
think of that
'll tell you one day -  promise
Well what does it photograph
'll tell you that too - but, Mark
this is the problem
The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes - but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings
but  don't agree
No - nothing's impossible
was hoping you'd say that
There must be photographs - however difficult to take - and  was wondering, Mark - if you'd
Oh yes
discuss it with me
take them
Mark -  can't ask you to do that
They have cancelled his Oscar
mean
the publisher's mightn't agree
'd take them
for you
Yes but
the money
There are some things
which photograph
for nothing
didn't mean to offend you
Offend
of Mark
Helen
if you knew what it meant
for something to happen to me
that  don't have to make happen
it's like
you've given me a twenty-first birthday
of Helen looking at him
What does your camera photograph
Mark -  must go
just wanted to know
if you'd talk it over with me
When please
That's up to you
Helen
don't know much about
dinner out
but would you come with me
Thank you
Thank you
When
Oh
What's the matter
It had better be soon
Are you going away
Almost for certain
Oh
well you suggest when
Are you free
tomorrow night
Yes
hope  am
'll understand if you're not
'll try to be - 'll try my hardest to be
Thank you for listening
and for my present
and for mine
They look at each other in silence
Good night, Mark
(turning to the door) Good night
Helen
He watches her leave, standing very still
Offstage, the time clock explodes
- the excited clock
Mark's hand silences it
- - Mark opens the developing tank, lifts out the rack of film, drops it into the fixing bath
He switches light from green to red
- green to red dark-room lamp
Mark lifts the rack of glistening film out of the fixing bath and scans the image
- Mark's face and the tell-tale black and white images
- the film
pile of trunks
In the darkness we hear a man enquire softly: ' Looking for a trunk
of a Tall Man with a severe face
He is standing in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at 'Specially Reduced Prices'
- and   whom he is addressing
It is Diane
and   that we are in a small theatre watching rushes
- across Baden's disgruntled face
the Chief Cameraman's bored face
the Script Girl's puzzled face
to Diane's expression of rapture as she watches herself on the screen
(
) 'd like to see that one
From Diane's    the screen
We see the Tall Man ( ) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the counter
He opens it with a flourish
Vivian passes across the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders off
No - no - no - we must get some comedy into this
The Assistant Director nods
We'll retake it this morning
for a moment on the screen as Diane (on- screen) smiles at the Assistant
(she pockets a small item) 'll take it
The Assistant bows and closes the trunk
We dissolve to the set itself - : - The Assistant is leaning over the counter, listening intently
Diane stands in front of the counter, receiving the attentions of the Make-up Man
Baden's voice is overlaid: want some comedy in this scene
The unit is busy preparing for a retake
The studio camera (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden briefing his artistes
He is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might be indecent exposure
Instead of taking the first trunk you see,  want you, darling
to ask for a blue trunk - and when he brings it to you, to ask for a red one - and when he brings that, to ask for a white one
(turns to the Assistant) And you, Michael
get the trunks one by one - growing more and more fed up - and we'll end on a gag which 'll think of in a minute - all right
don't feel it
Don't feel it
Do it
(hastily) Positions, everyone
Over Mark's shoulder - behind the camera -   the Unit taking up positions
Anyone seen Vivian
Who
The red-headed bystander - Viv
(impatiently) Never mind - 'm cutting her out of this scene
Let's run it
(shouting) Quiet, everyone
From Mark's    the scene being rehearsed
Diane approaches the trunk counter and the Assistant smiles at her
Can  interest you in a trunk
Thank you
(pointing) 'd like to see that one
Certainly, madam
He turns away
She pockets a small item from the counter
He heaves a trunk forward
It's beautifully fitted - (he opens it) She takes a perfunctory glance - 'd like to see one in red
Certainly, madam
She pockets another item
He turns and wrestles with another trunk
brings it forward and opens it do you have one in white
Certainly, madam
Mark walks away quietly from the back of the Camera Crew
He hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine-camera and a lunch basket
He reaches for his camera
Diane's voice is overlaid
(
) Do you have one in blue
(
) Certainly, madam
Mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera
the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half collapse with the weight of it
of Baden - beaming
The Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward
He leans over it - exhausted - then starts to open it
Mark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder
As the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes above the rim of the lid
her scream
of Baden - freezing
There is the sound of a body falling to the ground
The silly bitch
She's fainted in the wrong scene
: In the darkness   a telephone ringing
and then another
and then another
then they all merge into one big blast
: quickly towards a door marked - The Head of publicity has a receiver to his ear
is this a gag
girl in a trunk
Who is she
Well, which unit
The walls are closing in
What a break for them mean what a heartbreak
(he is already speaking into another telephone) call a press conference
(he turns to the original telephone) 'm on my way down
- police car
There are two men seated at the back
- is reading a file
plain-clothes () is seated next to him
The Sergeant glances at his Chief apprehensively
Excuse me, Chief
Mm
We pass my house when we reach the bypass
Would you mind if  drop off for a minute
(without raising his eyes) To collect your kid's autograph book
Yes, Chief
If the nipper hears where 've been
(turns to the driver) All right, Dawson - anything to help the Sergeant
(stares down at the folder) and it's about time the Sergeant helped me - we're getting nowhere with this
Over his shoulder   what he is looking at - it is a photograph of Dora in her furs and finery
What about that man the landlady passed
She couldn't describe him - except to say that he was carrying something that she couldn't see
That's a help
of the Inspector staring at the folder
Sergeant, 've been on the force thirty odd years
and  have never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's
(almost to himself) What was it she saw
Surely, Chief
a man coming at her - with a sharp weapon
'm familiar with that kind of terror
This is something new to me
but what
The Sergeant glances at Dora's photograph
now take a look at how we found her
He starts to turn the page : door with a sign on it:
it
- Mark is sitting by an open window at the far end of the canteen
His cine-camera and lunch basket are by his side
From Mark's    that the unit (with the exception of Diane and Baden) is crowded into the canteen
They have formed themselves into small groups and are talking in whispers
The Assistant Director is standing with his back to the door
calls out: (
) How much longer must we wait in here
Till the police arrive
's orders
Mark glances at a group in the comer
The Trunk Assistant is encircled by eager listeners
and when she opened that trunk
and  saw what was inside
my dears -  nearly fainted with her - (he runs a delicate hand across a delicate forehead) and do you know what horrified me most
says not to discuss it
Any more sauce from
and shall refuse to sign for seven years
My dears
that poor girl's expression
Mark glances out of the window
From his    a police car driving across the courtyard
Mark watches with great interest - then reaches for his cine-camera
He photographs the police, then puts his cine-camera on to the table and sits back
waiting
for a moment on the folded tripod
: - The set is completely deserted
It is lit by a single lamp
solitary trunk stands on the counter, its lid closed
Don Jarvis enter, followed by the two Policemen
Baden and the Publicity man bring up the rear
Don Jarvis points towards the trunks department
The Chief Inspector nods, then he and the Sergeant approach the counter
Carefully the Inspector raises the lid of the trunk - he looks inside
of the Inspector - over the top of the lid
His expression is mainly one of surprise
of the Sergeant staring into the trunk
He is also surprised - but there is nausea in his face
They look up at almost the same moment
their eyes meet
(in a whisper) Chief, it's exactly the
know
(he closes the trunk quickly
Quietly) don't say anything
(he faces Don Jarvis) Well, sir
we shall probably have to interview everyone at the studio, so we'd better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions
(warming to him at once) Thank you, Chief Inspector
if you knew what even a single day's delay could cost
Oh, we do sir
(his eyes are on the trunk) : of Mark
- He is looking out of the window - his camera at the ready
Overlaid is the sound of a door opening
the buzz of conversation dies away
We hear Don Jarvis' voice
(
) If  may have your attention, please
hand tugs at Mark's elbow
He turns round
The Clapper Boy looks at him waringly
From Mark's    Don Jarvis standing in the doorway - facing a suddenly hushed room
The great man's hands are folded in front of him - The police wish to interview each of you individually
after which you will be at liberty to leave
From
's    the upturned faces - the light from the window falls upon Mark, listening to him with rapt attention
Mark's hands are folded in front of him
There will, of course, be no shooting today
but work will be resumed, as usual, tomorrow
with,  hope, all of you present
of Don Jarvis
look to you to give the police your fullest cooperation
(he turns abruptly and leaves') Sergeant Miller enters with a smile
Well now
let's get ourselves organized
(taking a piece of paper from his pocket) We don't want to keep you cooped up in here, so we've worked out a timetable
We'll talk to the artists first, then the technicians in this order
Mark reaches for his cine-camera
: of the unit being interviewed by the police
- The Young Extra who spoke to Vivian in the exterior set points excitedly to the wall where Vivian and Mark lay
The Inspector and Sergeant carefully examine both sides of the wall
The Inspector stoops, picks up something with a pair of tweezers and puts it in an envelope
few passers-by look on from a distance
One of them is watching through his cine-camera
: - The Young Extra who shared Vivian's dressing room is talking to the Chief Inspector and Sergeant
she said she didn't want a lift - because she had a call to make locally
Did she say where
No, sir
and when  left, she was still in the dressing room
see
let's have a look at this dressing room, shall we
Yes, sir
- The Policemen and the Extra are walking away from camera down a passage
few members of other units pass them by without a glance
One of these ( ) smiles into camera
Hallo, Mark
(
) Hallo
The girl walks out of picture
(and Mark) after the Policemen
- As the Inspector opens the door of the dressing room, Mark hurries past
He raises his cine-camera and photographs the Sergeant
The Sergeant turns to close the door
He sees Mark
straightens his tie and looks as severe as he can
Hey,  don't think you ought to do that
Sorry, sir
He hurries down the passage
(turning round) Do what
Make me famous
Some chap was giving me a screen test The Extra's voice is overlaid - a hint of hysteria in it
(
) That's where she sat
Inspector
The Inspector turns away, and the Sergeant closes the door
: - The door of the small office opens - and the Chief Cameraman comes out
- On a bench at the end of the passage Mark, the Clapper Boy, and a member of the camera-crew are waiting
And whoever did it must be
You're next
The Crew-member hurries into the office, and closes the door
The Chief Cameraman wanders off thoughtfully
Mark and the Clapper Boy are left sitting side by side
've been watching you
Oh
Have you been filming those policemen
Yes, 've a few quite interesting shots of them - it's a chance never expected
chance for what
To photograph
an investigation
or as much of it as  can
What on earth for
It will complete a documentary 'm making
documentary
Mark nods
What's it about
'd rather not tell you till it's finished
And it soon will be
But suppose they catch you
Oh they will - they look very efficient
Don't you mind
No
But they might confiscate your camera
'm afraid they will
But by then
'll have finished with it
don't
The door of the small room opens, and the Crew-member comes out
- You, Mark
Thanks
He rises slowly
the cine-camera is over his shoulder
Mark, hadn't you better leave that with me
No, John
'd look after it
'm sure of that - but 'd like to photograph them while they're questioning me
The Clapper Boy looks at him in amazement
don't suppose they'll let me
Mark, are you potty
Yes, do you think they'll notice
The Clapper Boy laughs
Don't get into any trouble for heaven's sake   want to discuss that film at the Everyman
Yes
'd like that
He walks slowly towards the door
The Clapper Boy takes out a copy of Sight and Sound and starts to read it
- The Inspector is seated at a desk, reading some notes
The Sergeant is seated by the side of the desk, a pile of papers in front of him
There is a gentle knock on the door
The Sergeant glances at a list
Mark Lewis - focus-puller
Whatever that may be
The Inspector nods
Come in
He puts a tick on the list
There is the sound of a door opening
The Inspector looks up
From his    a young man with a camera over his shoulder advancing shyly towards him
Mr
Lewis
Yes, sir
'm Chief Inspector Gregg and this is Sergeant Miller
Grab a chair
The Sergeant glances up
Ah
My photographer
've brought the camera in case you want to take the film away
He holds out his camera
The Sergeant glances enquiringly at the Inspector
That's all right, Mr
Lewis - as long as we don't appear at the Odeon next week in place of the cartoon
Mark smiles
Thank you, sir
Well now; have you anything to tell us
Don't think so, sir
Did you know the girl
Yes, sir
How well
Mainly by sight
When did you see her last
He picks up a pencil  taps it idly on the desk
Yesterday afternoon - when we broke
Speak to her
Called out good night - don't know if she heard
of Mark's fingers
tapping on his knee in time to the pencil
What did you do then
Took sqme shots, sir - for a film 'm making
Oh
where
All over the place, sir
it's a documentary
Anyone with you
No, sir
Just my camera
What time did you arrive home, Mr
Lewis
About ten
ten-thirty
Anyone see you
Yes
the people downstairs
see
The telephone rings
The Sergeant promptly answers it
Sergeant Miller - Right, 'll tell him
He replaces the receiver, turns to the Inspector
The doctor's finished his examin
The Inspector rises at once
wants to see you - Right
(he glances at Mark) That'll be all for the moment, Mr
Lewis - thank you
(he turns to the door) Thank you, sir
Wait a minute
Mark stands very still
direct me to that set of yours, will you
'd probably end on location
'll take you there, sir
(he opens the door) Thanks
(he glances at the Sergeant) Carry on with the interviews, Sergeant
Yes, sir
From the Sergeant's    Mark turn to go into the passage
The Sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder
then the door closes
The Sergeant makes a note on a piece of paper
- The Inspector and Mark walk side by side along the passage
The Clapper Boy comes into view - still reading Sight and Sound
The Clapper Boy glances up - just in time to see the Inspector and Mark walk side by side to the end of the corridor
(staring after them) warned him to be careful
: - Constable is standing outside the entrance to the set
From his    the Inspector and Mark approach
The Constable stiffens
From Mark's    the Constable barring the entrance
think  can find my way now
Mark smiles
thanks for the escort The Inspector hurries towards the door of the set
The Constable opens it - and the Inspector goes inside
The Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it
Mark turns away quickly
: - The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone in sight
Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of Stage  - they are a few feet apart
He looks round carefully, then slips inside
- Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom
Beyond this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this yet another
Only in the far comer of the studio - in the furthermost set - is there a light burning
Voices can faintly be heard coming from this set
Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to the gantry
Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb the ladder
At the top of the ladder is a gallery
Mark moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above the Policemen
Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down
Far below    the Inspector standing next to the Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into an open trunk
Detectives are photographing the set
Mark raises his cine-camera
its gentle purring seems to echo round the studio
of Mark's jacket pocket
row of pencils is sticking out
As he leans forward the pencils tilt
Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera   the Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and nodding
faint echo of conversation is overlaid
(
) No doubt at all
wounds were caused by the same instrument
Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens)
The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the finder over the lid of the trunk
(
) both women
subjected to the most violent shock
(
) What sort of shock
still cannot determine - but look
He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's eye-line
of Mark
He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his head
As he leans forward, the pencils fall
them shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below
They make three separate landings
of the Inspector
Looking up
From his    tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow
Quiet, everyone
Please
The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete silence
Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing
And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own minds -   a purring sound from the shadows above
The Inspector listens intently
thought  heard a putty cat
There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns
don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands, and if we don't get him quickly there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the Commissioner
So let's hurry things up, shall we
Sorry, Chief
The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the trunk counter
In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high in the scaffolding
But then we are looking for it - no one else is
The flashlight dies away
The scene fades with it
of a knitting-needle held upwards
Another knitting-needle scales down it like a fireman descending a ladder
- Mrs
Stephens is doing her knitting
The inevitable glass stands on the table beside her
Helen is seated opposite, reading from a newspaper
she was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film The Walls Are Closing In, starring Diane Ashley
of Mrs
Stephens listening intently
a spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise, that her role was to have been built up
All work at the studio ceased today as a tribute to her memory
Mrs
Stephens sips from her glass
The Prime Minister to visit Athens
Mark is in films, isn't he
Yes, darling
It is reliably
wonder if he knew her
of Helen looking up
'll ask him tonight
Is he taking you out
If he's free
That's very chivalrous of him
Where's he taking you
've no idea - and  don't suppose he has
Which studio does he work at
'll ask him
If he's free
Behind her back we see that her fingers are crossed
'll bring him in and introduce you if
feel  know him
Now how can you
Mrs
Stephens stiffens suddenly
He's here
of the window
Mark is standing outside - looking in
Why don't we make him a present of the window
He practically lives there
Helen beckons to Mark to come in
We see him nod eagerly - and leave the window
How did you know where he was standing
The back of my neck told me
the part that  talk out of
Helen hurries to the door of the sitting room
- Mark closes the front door behind him
From his    the door of Helen's sitting room open - and she stands on the threshold
Hallo
Free
Yes
Good
So am
'd like you to come in for a moment - and meet my mother
Yes, please
She holds open the door
He goes inside
The screen suddenly greys out into the veiled images of Mrs
Stephens' world
We hear Helen's voice
(
) Darling, this is Mark
Mark, my mother
the sound of footsteps shuffling shyly forward - and then Mark's voice, every intake of breath magnified
(
) How do you do
Mrs
Stephens
the pounding of someone's heart - and then Mrs
Stephens' voice
(
) Hallo, Mark
As her voice dies away
: ' of Mark's hand clasping Mrs
Stephens'
of Mark looking at her, fascinated
From Mark's    the sightless eyes turned towards his
Mrs
Stephens' other hand gently feels the surface of his
Have you been running, young man
Yes
(he hesitates) didn't want to be late for Helen
Thank you, Mark - You deserve a drink for that
What would you like
Nothing - thank you
very much
Mrs
Stephens grunts, and reaches for her glass
Darling, 've left your supper in the
Tell me young man
Which studio do you work at
The screen greys out
Mark's tiny intake of breath
(
) Chipperfield Studio
And that poor girl
where did she work
Someone's heart is pounding fast
(
) At Brookwood
We were wondering if you knew her
No - No,  didn't
pity
do like first-hand information
We hear Mark's small attempt at a laugh
Oh, well -  mustn't keep you gossiping after you've run all the way from - Where
Again that little intake of breath
The station
: : Mrs
Stephens and Mark are staring at each other as if she has sight and he hasn't
From Helen's     only Mark's back and her mother's upturned face
Darling, may  tell you about your supper
No
go and be told about yours
(she takes Mark's hand) Goodbye, Mark
expect we shall meet again
hope so - Goodbye
(He turns to the door) of Helen kissing her mother and whispering into her ear
Darling, we forgot to toss
Mrs
Stephens grunts
Supper's laid out in the kitchen
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it
We'll be early
Good night, darling
Good night
Mark holds the door open for Helen and she goes into the passage
Mark turns and takes a long look at Mrs
Stephens
She is in the middle of raising her glass
She stops suddenly, the glass poised mid-air
He goes out - closing the door
She finishes her drink as if it is her last
- Helen is waiting by the door
From her    Mark coming eagerly towards her, his camera over his shoulder
Mark
Yes, Helen
want to ask you something rather personal
He looks at her anxiously
How long is it since you've gone out without that
Without what
Your camera
Oh
of Mark
don't think  know
Exactly
've never seen you without it
but are you going to need it tonight
He looks at her in silence
Well are you
And if so
shall bring some work with me too
'm not going to need it tonight
Good - then give it to me
She holds out her hand
He looks at her, appalled
It'll be quite safe - 'll put it away for you
(in a whisper) No
Then take it upstairs - if you can't trust me with it
of Mark
trust you
Then look
She opens the door of her bedroom - and turns on the light
let's put it in here
' She crosses to a cupboard and unlocks it, then turns round
He is standing hesitantly on the threshold
Come in - and see for yourself
He looks slowly round the room, stares for a moment at the bed in the comer, but he won't cross the threshold
He stays outside
We'll put it in here - and lock it
This
was my mother's room
Was it, Mark
Again he stares at the bed
am being tactless, aren't
It's just that
thought it was growing into an extra limb, and - but you bring it with you if you want to
He takes off his camera - and holds it out to her
Thank you
She takes it from him, puts it into the cupboard, and locks it
Then offers him the key
You
Thank you
of Mark
feel
Yes
Can't describe it
Could only photograph it - She laughs
Shall  tell you what  feel
Yes
Famished
Good
They hurry towards the door
: '  - They walk down the steps of the house
There's a small place round the corner
It's awfully good on Christmas Day
Is it
Yes
there aren't too many open then
No - it sounds fun
This way
of Mark and Helen walking along by the side of the house
adore new restaurants
Suddenly Mark stands motionless
He is staring at something off camera
Especially when - Her voice trails away
she is staring at Mark staring at something
In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple are kissing
Mark stands motionless, staring at them
Automatically his hand reaches for his camera
Helen starts to speak - then looks at him in silence
The man glances round
Mark hurries away and Helen stares after him
of Mark
He turns back - waiting for Helen
From his    Helen come slowly towards him
She looks at him searchingly for a long moment
He manages - but only just - to meet her eyes
Where is this restaurant
Round the corner
Know much about films
Come on then
of Mark
Thank you
They walk slowly down the street
: of Mrs
Stephens
Sorry, young man, Helen's out
- Tony is standing unhappily opposite Mrs
Stephens
Oh
With Mark - from upstairs
Oh
You can stay and talk to me - if you like
Well
Know much about films
Well
Or film studios
No,
Where's Chipperfield Studios
Chipperfield,  suppose
There's a phone book outside
Look up the number, will you
And see if you can get it
Certainly
and then  must go to my room
Granted
She lifts her glass, and sits, waiting as he crosses the room
: - small and very pleasant restaurant, almost full
Helen and Mark have a corner table
They are dining by candlelight, and there is a bottle of wine in the middle of the table
As    them, Helen is laughing
like this place
And this dinner
of Mark
He has again won the Academy Award
thank you, Mark
Are you ready to talk about your book
'm ready to talk about you
His face falls
It won't take a second - and it's best to have it said
Mark looks
Carrying a camera is only one of your habits, isn't it, Mark
He looks at her in silence
of Helen
when you stared at that couple, you were like the little boy on that film you showed me
looking over the wall at something he shouldn't see
But Mark - you're strong enough now to lift that child off the wall
aren't you
He hesitates
aren't you
'll try to be
Will you, Mark
Will you really
Yes
Lecture finished
pause
When your book's published - will you go on working in a library
Yes, Mark
in case, one day, a child comes in and asks for it
'll come in
'm not popular with my customers
They ask me for horror comics - and  take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books
of Helen
and do you know, Mark, waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books
is as exciting
as a horror comic
What does your magic camera photograph
People
Yes
It's owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown-ups
but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown-ups as they were when they were children
and he isn't frightened any longer
of Mark listening, engrossed
and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown-ups than he was - and do you know what he finds
The little boy opposite her shakes his head
that when he looks at grown- ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children
And that means that he's grown up himself
moment's pause
She drinks her wine - shy, awaiting his reaction
What made you think of this story
You did
of Mark
looked out of my window - and saw you going off to work carrying that camera like a little boy with a satchel
and an idea came
so thank you
'd like to think
was responsible
in some way
Now what do  do about the photographs
Take 'em
He slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks around
then reaches for his camera
Oh
Helen smiles
There isn't a single face that doesn't look like a child's - not a single one - if you catch it at the right moment
He turns around excitedly and sees her watching him
It would be a challenge
Unlike anything 've photographed
What have you photographed, Mark
Everything
But nothing 'd want children to see
She looks at him curiously
But this would belong to them - and they'd know if it wasn't right
Oh, Helen
would like to find those faces for you
with you
Very well
Let's try
He laughs excitedly
She looks regretfully at her watch
At once he looks at his
You made a promise to your mother - (gently) Yes, Mark
You'd better keep it
Thank you
He signals to the head waiter
and pays his first bill for two
: - They walk along the street very close together, but not quite touching
Above them a light is shining on a blind revealing a shadow of a woman undressing
Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly
He stares ahead of him
and continues to stare ahead of him
Suddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at him
they walk on in silence
: '  - Helen and Mark come in quietly, and close the door
She glances round the dimly lit hall
There is no light under any of the doors, except one at the end of the passage
Mother must have gone to bed
(she turns to find him looking at her) Mark, it was a wonderful evening
That's what  was going to say
a wonderful evening
(gently) And you made it wonderful
without your camera
shadow passes over his face
(gently) 'll get it for you
He stands motionless as she goes into her room
From his    the half-opened door - and the bed in the comer
of Mark forcing himself to look away
Helen reappears on the threshold - the camera in her hand
He looks down at it - then slowly stretches out his hand
wonder how this sees grown-ups
(she turns the camera round) me, for instance
now that am one
(she looks at herself in the lens) Not you
(he takes the camera from her) Mark
It never will
see you
Why not
He hesitates
Whatever  photograph - Yes
always - lose
don't understand
The door at the end of the passage opens and Tony emerges in his dressing-gown, carrying a towel
He avoids looking at them - goes into the bathroom opposite, and slams the door
He'll wake Mother
There is the sound of running water
thank you, again, for my evening
(she is standing very close to him, smiling up into his face) Will you go to bed now - and not stop up watching those films
Well
've a little work to do
then 'll go to bed
and think of how to find faces for you
He looks down at the face which he has found for himself
She raises her head slowly
faces which - are faces which
She kisses him very gently on the mouth
The bathroom begins to sound like a small waterfall
Good night, Mark
He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the door
light goes on beneath the door
He stands very still for a moment
then turns the camera round and points the lens towards his lips
Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs
The waterfall cascades on
The screen grows dark - and the dark-room grows out of it
- - The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into a box
small motor drives it
of the box
Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier
Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image
of Vivian's face, in the image
Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and hurries out with it
Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts the projector
He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen
Behind him something moves in the shadows of Mark
Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the shadows   Mark
His head obscures what he is watching on the screen
- From Mark's    the processing sinks deep in shadow
He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at the shadows at the back of the room
Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector
of Mark's hand - switching on the light
Mark turns round
he is as astonished at what he sees as he can be
in its own good time to the back of the room
Mrs
Stephens is standing in the shadows
a heavy hand rests on a heavy stick
the sightless eyes stare unerringly towards the light switch
Good evening, Mark
how did you
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door
managed the rest of the adventure alone
He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless
Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares at her
The only movement in the room is her smile
This is one room  expected to find locked
was never allowed a key
, can't get used to them
Mrs
Stephens' sightless eyes stare at him
brought her home early
of her hand - tightening on the heavy stick
Thank you
Is there something you
a talk
Next door would be more
'm at home here
visit this room every night
Visit
The blind always live in the rooms they live under
Mark nods
Every night you pace for hours above my head
Why
've no one to talk to
in the rooms  live over
Mrs
Stephens nods
Her hand touches the black cloth loading bag, lying on the table
'm told that you stare too much
so do
of her hand - touching the black cloth bag
of Mark - walking slowly towards her
At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards him
of the stick
It is a shooting stick - with a sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on Mark's camera
Mark stares at the stick, fascinated
of Mrs
Stephens - exploring the inside of the black cloth bag with her free hand
Cloth
with something hard inside it
It's a changing bag
we put films in it - so that the light won't spoil them
How odd - that the light can spoil anything
The screen greys out
In Mrs
Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself
Every night you switch on that film machine
We hear his tiny intake of breath
What are these films you can't wait to look at
The sound of his footsteps softly approaching
Like a chair
(
) Like a chair
(
) What is the film you're showing now
Very faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath
: The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal
Over Mark's shoulder   Mrs
Stephens holding her stick in front of her
Why don't you lie to me
'd never know
You'd know at once - Mrs
Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the 16mm screen
Take me to your cinema
Yes
He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us
Both of them stare at the 16mm screen
She leans forward - her face only inches from the screen - the light from the projector flickering on to her
of Mrs
Stephens
Slowly she stretches out her hands and touches the screen
What am  seeing, Mark
Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but between her outspread fingers     of a girl's terrified eyes
Why don't you answer
of Mark and Mrs
Stephens
(staring at the screen) It's no good -  was afraid it wouldn't be
What
The lights failed too soon
(pause) They always do
'll have to try again
He hurries to his cine-camera
've yet to meet an artist who could judge his own work
Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera
What do you think you've spoiled
An opportunity
now  must find another
He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch
spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes
He presses another switch, and then another, until the whole of her face is shining with light
Why are you putting those lights on my face
He walks towards her
She starts to back away
The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod
Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs
Stephens' world
the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than we have yet heard it
(There is the faint rasp of a cog which needs oiling
) The sound of footsteps approaching
the purring changes direction
(
) Mark
(
) It's almost over
The purring is on top of her
There is a sudden thud
: Mrs
Stephens is leaning against the wall
she has dropped her heavy stick
It lies on the floor a few feet away from her
Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly on the floor
The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her face
He peers excitedly into the viewfinder
Please let me finish
It's for Helen
She edges towards her stick
He hurries forward and picks it up
He looks at the spike on the end of it - then carefully gives it to her by the handle
She grasps it tightly
What do you mean
It's for Helen
She wants to see something 've photographed
He returns excitedly to his camera
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs
On Mark's focusing screen   the fear on her face
Her hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration
(
) Please
don't be frightened
Not frightened
Hot
But it is fear that we are looking at
So put that camera away
On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips nervously
Yes
He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the tripod
He turns away without looking at her - and hurries to the door
of Mrs
Stephens listening to his movements - puzzled
In rather a hurry, aren't you
He glances towards her
From his    the fear in her eyes
He looks away at once, staring into the darkened room
It's late
From her  (shooting over her shoulder with a large of her ear in the foreground)   Mark standing in the doorway - and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy breathing
You must be tired
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden
We hear his quick intake of breath
won't be selfish
You can take some more pictures - if you want to
No
thank you
(quietly) Why not, Mark
Run out of film
Can't you find some - to please Helen
He glances towards her - then hurries into the next room
You don't trust yourself to take any more, do you
'   - The tapping of her stick is overlaid
Mark hurries to the door and opens it - staring into the dimly lit passage
Over his shoulder   her tapping her way towards him from the dark-room
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it Mark
pity it can't be photographed
Over her shoulder we follow the stick towards him
if 'd listened to it years ago, might have kept my sight
(she approaches the door) wouldn't have let a man operate had no faith in
so 'm listening to it now
(she puts her face close to him) It says all this filming isn't healthy - and that you need help
His face is averted
his eyes are closed
get it, Mark
get it quickly
and until you've got it
don't want you and Helen to see each
'll never photograph her promise you that
'd rather you don't have the chance
He turns towards her - a small boy who suddenly understands what contagious means
mean it, Mark
And if you don't listen to me
one of us will move from this house - which would be a pity, because we'd never find a cheaper
You'll never have to move
because of me
promise you
Good boy
(she takes his hand) The stairs are the difficult part
They go into the passage
- He guides her gently down the stairs
Over their shoulders the door of Helen's room
Far enough, Mark
He stares at Helen's room - then looks quickly away
Suddenly she raises her hands - and runs them gently over his face
taking my picture
Yes
We can see his eyes through her outstretched fingers
It's been a long time
since anyone did
Mark
what's troubling you
Good night, Mrs
Stephens
He turns away abruptly and hurries up the stairs
you'll have to
She looks towards Helen's room - then turns slowly towards her own
of Mrs
Stephens opening the door of her room - and Mark opening the door of his
: of a bottle of whisky standing by a bedside
'  - She is lying in bed, staring at the ceiling footsteps moving overhead
to the window
It is dark
: of the same bottle of whisky - now almost empty
Mrs
Stephens' heavy breathing is overlaid
to the window
It is daybreak
The footsteps are still moving about above; things are being dragged across the floor
: of Helen in a dressing-gown looking out of a window
'  - From Helen's    Mark hurrying down the street, his camera over his shoulder
: of the Inspector looking out of a window
' From his    Mark hurrying along the studio quadrangle, his camera over his shoulder
He is one of a crowd of people scurrying towards their jobs
Camera pulls back - Don Jarvis is seated at his desk
Arthur Baden and the Chief Publicity Man are seated in front of him
The Sergeant stands by the door
Have you any suspicions, Chief Inspector
It could be any of them
That's the trouble with film people - they're all peculiar
(hastily) present company excepted
He catches a glare from the great man
Speaking of peculiar people
The Inspector turns round
We've a psychiatrist coming down today
Dr Rosen - know him
It's pure publicity - and  promise he won't do any work
What will he do
Get himself photographed
We're telling the press he's here to help the case - and to see if he can spot the murderer
And the best of luck
Do you object
Chief Inspector
No
The Publicity Man sighs with relief
'll be frank
'd welcome anyone's help
don't know how this maniac kills - or why he kills - or who he'll kill next, but if he isn't caught quickly
(he shrugs') Inspector, have you convinced yourself he's a member of my unit
No, sir
but a few things seem to point to it
No one outside your unit admits to knowing the girl
There was a trunk all ready for her
and with the risks he was running,  think he'd have to use surroundings he was familiar with
Where is your unit now
Waiting for me on the set
'd like to watch them at their jobs, sir
It may tell me more than a hundred interviews
But, Inspector, the strain on them is already
Come now, Arthur, if that's what the Inspector wants
'm afraid it is, sir
now where could  get the best view
(sulkily) On the dolly
the camera
You can watch everyone and everything from there
including me
Very well, sir
'll become a member of your camera crew
(to Don Jarvis) if the unions don't object
: member of the camera crew places his cine-camera and lunch bag on a shelf
Snatches of whispered conversations are overlaid
1 hear they're making an arrest today
2 hope it's
It's about time they caught up with him
Mark turns round and walks towards the small group of people assembled round the studio camera - : of a book entitled The Art of Fly Fishing
- Through the windscreen   the entrance to the studio
The driver glances round at his passenger whose face is completely obscured by the book
All    is a shock of white hair protruding above We're there, Doctor
(to Sergeant on gate) Dr Rosen
What a pity
He continues reading
The car enters the studio
: - The (studio) camera is ready for a tracking shot
The set is redressed as the Hat Department of the store
The Inspector stands on the dolly, looking round with interest
The Doctor is sitting in a chair watching everything like an excited schoolboy
The Sergeant has positioned himself near the sound crew
Baden walks on to the set, his arm round Diane's shoulder
He is talking to her softly
She keeps her eyes on the floor; he leads her to the front of the studio camera
Try it, darling
We'll all be with you
He pats her arm reassuringly
The Chief Cameraman nods to Mark
From the Inspector's    Mark pull a tape measure from the front of the camera and hold it to Diane's forehead
From Mark's    the Inspector watching him over the top of the studio camera
man with a shock of white hair is also watching him
and the Sergeant stares at him from the other side of the set
The tape measure in Mark's hand remains steady
From the Inspector's    Mark replace the tape measure and take up his position on a small stool by the side of the camera
(shouting) Quiet, everyone
Let's run it
The Doctor sneezes violently - and all heads turn towards him
Terribly sorry
In the nervous laughter that follows, the Assistant Cameraman whispers to the Chief Cameraman
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist
Heard it on the grapevine
of Mark turning round to look at the Doctor - a hint of hope in his face
of the Inspector following Mark's glance
(shouting) All right, everyone - let's run it
Over the Inspector's shoulder   towards the rehearsal
Mark swing out into space on his stool, turning the handle of the focus-puller
Diane approaches the hat counter
The Assistant smiles at her
'd like to see
that one
The Assistant hands her a hat
Diane tries it on
have you it
in red
Certainly, madam
in
red (suddenly she covers her face in her hands') can't
can't, Arthur
She bursts into tears and runs off the set
From the Inspector's    Baden whisper to the Assistant Director - then hurry after Diane
Ten minutes break, everyone
The unit dissolves into small, chattering groups
The Assistant Director hurries up to the Doctor
Can you suggest anything, Doctor
No
It looked jolly interesting to me
mean to help her psychologically
Yes
Give the girl a proper rest
Ten minutes is useless
(hastily) Thank you, Doctor
He bustles off and the Doctor is left alone
He glances round thoughtfully
From the Doctor's    the small, chattering groups
Then we see Mark standing a few yards away, watching him
The Doctor smiles at him pleasantly
What's your job
'm a focus-puller
Oh
so am , in a way
was wondering if you knew my father - Professor Lewis
Professor
but of course  knew him
He lectured to me
He looks at Mark with renewed interest
So does the Inspector
From his    Mark and the Doctor talking
The Doctor is fidgeting with his watch chain
Mark fidgets with his jacket button
The Inspector then glances towards the Hat Salesman, who is holding court in the comer
We return to Mark and the Doctor
He was an extraordinary man - quite brilliant
You know what he was interested in before he died
No
Tell me
Mark puts his hands behind his back
don't remember what he called it
It was something to do with what causes people to be
peeping Toms
Scoptophilia
That would interest him
most fertile mind
Scopto
philia
The morbid urge to gaze
Coined since his day
Have you any manuscripts of his which could
He thought
it could be cured
Usually
Now about his manuscripts - Quickly
The cure
Very quick
couple of years analysis - three times a week - an hour a time - and it's soon up-rooted
of Mark - his last hope gone
if you've any of his papers on the subject
Yes, Doctor
'd like to see them - 'll give you my address, young man
From the Sergeant's    the Doctor hand Mark a card, and pat him jovially on the shoulder
The Sergeant edges up to the Inspector
Wonder what all that's about
We'll find out afterwards
Now, listen
want you to watch who brings their own lunches
Someone ate homemade cakes and sandwiches by the side of those bushes - and we may get a lead
Right, sir
to a shelf in the comer
lunch basket stands next to a cine-camera
: the Assistant Director call out: We're stopping at four today - so have a quick lunch, everyone
Back at two sharp
on the lunch basket
Overlaid is the noise of the unit dispersing
Mark picks up his camera - then reaches for the lunch basket
An urgent voice whispers behind him
Hey, Mark
He turns round
The Clapper Boy is standing there
The Clapper Boy glances round carefully
The Inspector and Sergeant are wandering casually towards the door
Can't wait to show you this
(bringing out a small postcard) ought to charge you
He winks at Mark, gives him the postcard
of the postcard
We see Milly's face and naked shoulders framed between Mark's hands
(
) You don't get that in Sight and Sound - Isn't she terrific
Got some more - if you're interested
Mark hands it back
You've given me
an idea
'll bet  have
Mark turns towards the exit
Hey
Where are you going
Phone - may be my last chance - and
thanks
But your lunch
You have it
He hurries excitedly towards the exit
of the Clapper Boy staring at his photograph
some photograph
Well lit too
He reaches for the lunch basket, then walks towards the exit where the Sergeant is waiting casually
: Mark is talking at a coin-box telephone
Can't manage Saturday, sir, but they're letting us off early today
This afternoon - after work - may be my last chance
While Mark is talking he is scribbling on a form
He has some more pennies ready for the coin-box
: '  - be here at six o'clock
Milly'll be waiting
Six o'clock
On the dot, Mark, or she'll go
'll be there, sir
You'd better be
Mark rings off
He is smiling
He puts in another 4d (Four Pence) and dials a number
His pen is poised over the form he is filling in
Hallo
Is that the Public Library
You have a Miss Helen Stephens employed there
Yes
can you tell me if her name is spelt with a  or a ,  want to send her a tic-
Thank you
We see the form is a last will and testament
, Mark Lewis, etc
, etc
, leave, etc
, etc
, to Miss Helen Ste- ens all my worldly goods, etc
He fills in
The door bursts open and the Clapper Boy appears
They're waiting
: - of Dr
Rosen smiling
He asked if  knew his father
which  did
a brilliant man
- The Inspector and Doctor are standing by the bushes where Mark and Vivian met
Is that all he wanted
think so
we had a little chat about scoptophilia - and he's going to show me
About what
Voyeurism
Eh
What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, apparently
(slowly) Peeping Toms
An interesting boy
he has his father's eyes
you don't suspect him, do you
suspect 'em all - what about you
'm interested in that chap with the bald head and hatchet face
there's something on his mind
No wonder
he's the director
He turns away thoughtfully
: of Mark glancing impatiently at his watch
- of Baden glancing at his watch
He whispers to the Assistant Director
All right, everyone
This is the last shot
Make it a good one
to a comer of the studio
The Inspector and Sergeant stand in the shadows
(quietly) Got your list, Sergeant
(he produces if) ,
want to see how some of them spend their spare time
Which ones, sir
Exactly, Sergeant
(he looks round thoughtfully) which ones
: of sign:
- of very modern, glass-walled building
Helen comes out with a manuscript in a parcel under her arm
- Mark watches her
Beyond him stands an insignificant-looking man in a raincoat
Helen looks at her watch
Mark looks at his
: 5
45
Helen hurries homeward
Mark slowly turns his back and walks away, gradually gathering speed
The man in the raincoat follows him
' Mark hurries towards the shop
ahead of him a street clock stands at just on six
Mark unslings his cine-camera and photographs this clock
then he hurries into the shop
The man in the raincoat walks into camera
He looks at the clock, puzzled, then glances at the newsagent's window
He gazes with interest at Mark's photograph of Milly, then walks thoughtfully down the street
All the clocks in the kingdom chime the hour of six
'  - Mr
Peters is behind the counter
Don't make a habit of this
won't, sir
Milly's upstairs
Right, sir
He turns to the door
've got to go out
If you finish before 'm back, lock up and put this through the letter-box
(he holds out a key) of Mark staring at the key
What's the matter
Haven't you ever seen a key before
Mark takes the key
He starts to smile
The till will be empty - if that's what you're smiling about
Mark turns to the door
You know what  want now
No fancy stuff
Mark goes into the inner room; he is still smiling
: '  - From the opposite side of the street, we see Mr
Peters locking the door of the shop, and hurrying down the road
The man in the raincoat watches him, puzzled
of Milly - very angry, in a dressing-gown
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have
'  - Mark closes the door behind him
Sorry, Milly
What's the idea
shan't be here tomorrow
(he hurries to the window) Why
Going on manoeuvres with the boy scouts
He starts to draw the curtains - and stops suddenly
Over his shoulder   the man in the raincoat standing on the opposite side of the street
thought so
Mark raises his cine-camera and carefully photographs the Detective through a chink in the curtains
Have you gone absolutely
'm just
completing a documentary
You're a document and a half, you are
Is it safe to be alone with you
He draws the curtains - and turns round
might be more fun if it wasn't
He turns round and walks slowly - and a little sadly - towards her : The screen remains dark for a moment
: - From the Detective's ,   the chink of light between the curtains of a window above the newsagent's shop go out
the door of the shop
Mark comes out, his cine-camera over his shoulder
He has a key in his hand
He closes the door of the shop
then looks at the key
He fits it into the lock - then slips it through the letter-box
He turns and hails a taxi
of the Detective
He looks at the shop, hesitates, decides to follow Mark - hails another cab
Mark gets into his taxi
As the driver pulls down the flag
: Mrs
Stephens' head falling on to her chest
'  - She is lying in bed - completely drunk - snoring lustily
hand smooths her forehead
Helen is leaning over the bed
She has her coat on
Darling
She shakes her mother's shoulders
Mrs
Stephens snores on
Darling
She shakes her again  but it is hopeless
Helen pulls the bedclothes round her mother, then turns away
She picks up a large envelope and her handbag, and hurries to the door
'  - Helen walks towards the stairs
The door of Tony's room opens, and he pokes his head round
Hallo
Hallo, Tony
Where are you going
To leave something for Mark
You haven't much time for me these days
Tony
It's all right - 'll be here - if you want me
(he turns to his room) by the way
your mother was yelling out something before you came in
about Mark photographing her
Photographing Mother
You must be mistaken
Of course
See you sometime
He goes into his room, closing the door
She stares after him for a moment, then hurries up the stairs
'  - Helen knocks on the door
Mark
No answer
She knocks again, then opens the door and goes inside
'   - Helen enters and glances towards the door of the dark-room
Mark
No answer
She looks thoughtfully at the envelope in her hand - then goes in to the dark-room
' - Helen fumbles for a switch
she finds one and presses it
spotlight falls on Mark's projector, throwing its shadow on to the dazzling white screen
Helen smiles, and walks towards the projector
- Taxi arrives and Mark gets out
- don't know what to make of it, sir
He went to a library, a solicitor's office, and a newsagent's shop - private photography there, if you ask me
Shall  hang around outside the house, sir
Don't think so, either
All right, sir, 'll give you the details when  get back
Bye, sir
(he replaces the receiver) of Helen
She is standing by the projector, holding her envelope thoughtfully
' - She smiles suddenly and opens her envelope
She takes out a bound manuscript
We see a label on the manuscript: The Magic Camera by Helen Stephens
She takes a pencil from her pocket, and opens the manuscript
Then she sits at Mark's table and writes a note on the flyleaf
The projector is at her elbow
: telephone by a man's elbow
It rings
- The Chief Inspector snatches up the telephone
Chief Inspector Gregg
What
Put him on the line
: Mr
Peters - looking very sick - on the telephone
went up to look around - found her
of the Chief Inspector
Yes, yes
What's the address
Newsagent's shop
Did you say news
He slams down the receiver, and jumps to his feet
: - An empty taxi cruising down the street
It passes the Detective in the raincoat walking away from Mark's house
: of a note on a flyleaf which reads 'From one Magic Camera - which needs the help of Another'
' - - Helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the side of the projector
She turns to leave - then looks curiously at the projector
of Helen - hesitating
Like a small girl in front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch beam of light shoots out
We watch Helen's face as she looks at the screen
Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - then something starts to happen to the comers of her mouth
and then her eyes become locked
and cannot stop watching
Some kind of sound comes from the back of her throat
Her hands dig into the table and she tries to stand up
She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards the door
of Mark standing there - watching her
of Helen staring at him
again we hear that sound from the back of her throat
He looks away from her at once
Don't let me see you
frightened
(he pushes the door wide open
) Leave
(he looks at her - then looks quickly away) Hurry, Helen
Not
Leave
Not
(she turns away from him and forces the words out) till  know
Now
She stands with her back to him
From   we see her struggling for breath
Over her shoulder   him staring at the 16mm screen
That film
Over her shoulder we see him hurry towards the projector
That film
The sound of him switching it off
is
just a film
She wheels round towards him
isn't it
From   we see her looking at him
horrible
horrible
but
just a film
isn't it
of Mark
No
(he walks towards the door) killed them
(he locks the door with a hint of sadness) And now that you know
want you with me
a while
of Helen  not enough breath to scream
hardly enough to breathe
You'll be safe - as long as  can't see you frightened - so stand in the shadows, Helen
please
She stands motionless
please
From her    him standing in front of the door, looking ahead of him
She backs slowly away into the shadows at the back of the room
She's right
your mother
must tell someone everything
sorry
has to be you
of Helen standing in the shadows where her mother stood
This was his laboratory
and you know some of what he did
but not all
The room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming of a small boy
Helen wheels round
The screaming seems to be coming from the walls
Mark's hand is on a switch - one of a number on a panel
aged five
He presses another switch
There is a click, and the screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing
aged seven
He presses another switch
There is a moment's silence
All the rooms were wired for sound
and
still are
the ticking of a clock
Your room
of Helen - listening
Your mother's
The click of a switch - and we hear a loud snoring
Tony's
The click of a switch - and we hear Tony's voice
(
) No one will come in
honestly, darling
'  (
) don't care
But darling
'  (
) Stop it, Tony
Mark listens with interest
(quietly) Turn it off
He does so - at once
She walks towards him
He turns away from her
Look at me, Mark
Not if you're frightened
Look at me
Slowly he faces her
What did you do
to those girls
No
What did you do, Mark
He tries to turn away - but she follows him
If you want to torment me
for the rest of my life
then make me imagine
of Mark - his eyes closed
What did you do
to those girls
Can't
Show me, Mark
But if you're frightened
Show me - or 'll remain frightened
for the rest of my life
Show me
He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up
He releases the tripod
on Helen
She stands very still against the wall
Mark's voice is overlaid
(
) Do you know
what the most frightening thing in the world is
She is looking at something, puzzled
It's fear
The sound of his footsteps approaching
So  did something
very simple
a look of fear spring into her eyes
Very simple
the spike approaching her throat
but she is looking at something else
When they felt the spike
touching their throats
and knew  was going to kill them
The spike is touching her throat
made them - watch their own deaths
of Helen's face several times its natural size
She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face
The mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera
There is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of the camera winks
As Helen looks at her terrified distorted face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle of her forehead
Made them see their own terror as the spike went in
and if death has a face, they saw that too
of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat pouring down his forehead
his finger on the trigger of the camera
Not you
Not you
'll never photograph you
promised - promised - Not you
Helen's eyes are closed
The spike is still touching her throat
of Mark  his face turned away from the viewfinder
frightened
for you
There's the sound of a car pulling up
He hurries to the other room
- The Police arrive: three cars
Mark appears at an upstairs window with his camera
Look out
He thinks Mark has a gun
They all duck
Mark raises his camera and photographs them
The Police recover and charge for the house
Mark disappears
- - Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera
He knows exactly what he has to do
Mark
Mark
Give yourself up
've been ready for this
for such a long time
Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall
Then he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards him
What are you
It'll be all right
He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, then switches on all the floodlights
the Policemen pounding on the door
can beat that
He crosses to a switch - presses it
The room is filled with a small boy's screaming
Give yourself up
Mark
He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of cameras
that each one of them has been fitted with a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of the older cameras have flashlights attached
Watch them, Helen
Watch them say goodbye - one by one - (he presses a master switch on the wait) 've timed this
so often
Slowly he walks past his cameras
As he does, the metallic disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye of each camera winks once as if in salute
Some go off with flashlights on either side of the room
The sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs
Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer  are the spikes of the tripod
The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the approach - and Helen's terrified face
No - No
The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches the spikes
Ahead of him, on the small table where his projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera
wish
could have found your faces for you
The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door
Helen - 'm afraid
We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror
The spikes are against his throat
The eye of the camera is winking rapidly
'm glad 'm afraid
Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door
as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes
The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls back
He crashes against the small table, which falls over
He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face like a canopy
his face in the lens of the cine- camera
and   his hand - lying limp on the cover of The Magic Camera
The Policemen hurry into the room
They stare motionless at what they see
of Helen - her face buried in her hands
The child's screaming stops suddenly
and in the absolute silence which follows   the voice of Mark's father: '  (
) Don't be a silly boy
there's nothing to be afraid of
And a small voice answers
'  (
) Good night, Daddy
The spotlights begin to dim
The dazzling white of the 16mm screen fades slowly into greyness
The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small child
