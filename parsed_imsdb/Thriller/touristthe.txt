Written by Julian Fellows Based on "Anthony Zimmer" by Jerome Salle June 9 2008 - from a view of Paris on a misty day
Cool, gray and beautiful
taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street
All around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people hurrying about their business
The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out
',  - the legs up the steps, across the concourse, through the station
Men turn and stare
(30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing
She wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one hand, a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the other
,   ' - wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart
An   approaches her
They exchange a few words and he walks toward the bar
She's waiting for someone
Probably waiting for me
The door's waiting for you if you don't get back to work
clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet, enters the cafe and looks around
He consults a photograph
His eyes land on Cara
He walks over and holds out a document-sized envelope
'est vous, Mademoiselle
2
Oui
As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents
There is a ticket for the Orient Express and a handwritten letter
She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map
Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads
'  (
) (English accent) They are following you Cara
She looks up
Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds it in front of her face to glance around behind her
'  (
) (') They think you'll lead them to me
But if you follow my instructions closely, there is a way for us to get away
Cara scans the rest of the letter
glides down to see the signature at the bottom: "Love, Alexander
" We barely have time to read this before Cara's perfectly manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer and sets fire to it
The   hurries over, alarmed
Mademoiselle
Je vous en prie-- Cara is already gathering her things and walking away
'  - As Cara walks toward the platform
'  (
) Take the 4:25 Orient Express to Venice
En route select a man my approximate height and weight
Her eyes scan the platform
3
'  (
) (') Have faith Cara
'll be with you soon
' Men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "The Orient Express
" She pauses only long enough to assess and discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight
Her gaze comes to rest on a -
Medium height, medium build
Standing alone
Examining his ticket
Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished glass window of the train
Adjusts her hair and dress
Satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward the -   like a cat stalking prey
The  admiringly  her silky approach
The   hears the click of her heels and looks up
His mouth falls open
arrives and shuts it for him
What are you doing Vincent
Our train car is over here
With a regretful backward glance at Cara, he allows himself to be dragged away
Frustrated, Cara turns and casts about for another possibility
She spots a    seated on a bench
(
) All aboard
All aboard the 4:25 is departing
Tousle Hair gathers his bags to get on the train
Encouraged, Cara moves to cut him off
As Tousle Hair stands up
he's six foot seven
Cara stops short, irritated
The  behind her boarding the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesn't notice
he walks straight into her
4
Ow
Sorry
Excuse me
Pardone moi
(30's, amiable) is a cheerful American tourist
Open face, completely lacking in guile
Frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly around Cara and boards the train
Cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt
Frank is a man of average size, average build
she peers over her glasses at him
And her expression slowly changes
She follows him onto the train
-  loitering further down the platform, reading the Herald Tribune
Or rather, not reading it
He's been watching Cara
He lowers the paper and climbs onto the train through a different door
- The gleaming Orient Express pulls out of the station and gets underway
- The train is moving
The thick carpet, the mellow wood of the inlaid panels, the subtlety of the Lalique mirrors and the softly lit lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury
Frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window in his casual jeans and pullover sweater
He's wrapped up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel
So wrapped up that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him
She crosses her legs
He glances up
Slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off
Then the headscarf tied around her neck
her sensual movements in
The effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip tease
5
Frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled
She takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes
She goes to remove her mock-turtleneck sweater
The zipper seems to give her trouble
Without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and leans toward Frank
think 'm going to need your help
Frank is barely able to respond
Hmm
My zipper
(off his blank look) It's stuck
Frank finally moves into action
He sets his book down and leans closer
Awkwardly he reaches towards Cara's beautiful neck
He attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric
But the zipper resists
'm afraid of hurting you
She slides forward on her seat, to get even closer
Don't be afraid
The train car sways slightly and throws Frank off balance
He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives-- with a tearing sound
Frank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his fingers
'm
sorry
Cara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment
It doesn't matter
6
Maybe  should let you do this-- Don't give up so quickly
Reluctantly, Frank continues with the zipper
The tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by inch
First her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are gradually uncovered
The zipper keeps going downward
No sign of anything underneath
Frank is practically sweating
Finally he uncovers fabric
He finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat
Cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever
(') Thanks
And settles back into her seat, cat-like
He stares at her for several moments, at a loss for words
My name is Frank
Cara
white-jacketed  arrives
(to Frank) Will you and your wife take dinner here or in the dining car this evening, monsieur
Pardon me
Oh, no
We're not actually-- The dining car would be lovely, thank you
The steward nods and disappears
Frank just stares
: 7
- The Orient Express plows through the Alps
a window where we see Frank and Cara sitting at a romantic, candlelit table eating dinner
- Linen tablecloths
Fine china
Frank is one of the only men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket
Frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then another and another
He takes one or two pills from each and swallows them methodically
She watches him
Are you ill
What
No
She looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate
(') Just nervous
don't like travelling
(gently mocking) So you decided to take a holiday on the Orient Express
He hesitates
'm on my honeymoon
Your honeymoon
Cara is annoyed at this revelation
(') Should we ask the waiter to set another place
She's in Pennsylvania
Off her questioning look
8
(') You're sure you want to hear this
If you'd like to tell me
Two weeks ago she left me
For the owner of a pizza parlor
That's awful
Frank nods, matter-of-fact
No travel insurance
No refund on the tickets
So
here  am
On my honeymoon
'm sorry, Frank
really loved that pizza too
"Bala Pizza" if you're ever in Rosemont
wouldn't touch it
'm loyal to you
waiter delivers their drinks
Cointreau for Mademoiselle
And for Monsieur
a "Miller Light
" Thanks
The waiter rolls his eyes and leaves them
Cara seems amused by Frank's obliviousness
(') What takes you to Venice
She nods toward his well-thumbed paperback
You read spy novels
(playful) () 9
(') 'm a mysterious woman on a train
You tell me what my story is
Okay
you'd be a diplomatic attache or
let's see
a girl from East Germany whose father's been kidnapped by Soviet agents
They're blackmailing you into stealing
probably a microchip
There's usually a microchip involved
What awaits me
Trouble, certainly
Danger
No doubt
You'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters
Is there a man in my life
Beat
(') Or a candidate for the job
He gazes at her with a glimmer of hope
She's insanely out of his league
But she's the one flirting with him
Maybe

British, Interpol chief inspector
He's the kind of man who commands respect (think Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive
) , his American counterpart matches him step for step
We're putting a lot resources into this investigation, John
Tell me you're going to get him this time
(dry) We're going to get him this time, Ms
Jones

She's on the train
They'll be in Venice in the morning
,  - Behind the ornate, 17th century doors is a high-tech amphitheater style briefing room
All glass and steel
Suited bureaucrats and officers from all over Europe listen to Ackerman as he leads the meeting from the podium
Our target's name is Alexander Pearce
British citizen, born in London into an ordinary middle class family
The only thing remarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers
Ackerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen behind him: a fuzzy photo of a British schoolboy with a shy grin
(') Which he used to hack into a computer and fix the test results his final year at school
(French Interpol liaison) looks up skeptically
11
Your mastermind couldn't pass his exams on his own
He didn't fix his test scores; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class
It made him very popular
ripple of laughter through the group
(') (severely) What started as school pranks eventually became something much more serious
After a year in the training program at Goldman Sachs, he decided that gambling suited him better than working for a living
That, in turn, involved him with some rather unsavory people and ultimately led him to put his financial genius to work in his true calling: money laundering
is the Swiss Interpol liaison
He speaks with the crisp accent of a man who is fluent in several languages
You've assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer, Mr
Ackerman
There is nothing common about Alexander Pearce
Quiet simply, he has turned money laundering into an art form
His greatest innovation: The False Lawsuit
He clicks through a series of flashy Powerpoint slides illustrating Pearce's financial dealings
(') Pearce sets up two companies: one is a Casino in Arizona for example and the other is a shell company in the Cayman Islands
() 12
(') The Cayman Islands company files a lawsuit against the casino, claiming copyright infringement or some other complaint
They "succeed" in winning the case and the casino pays the shell company an enormous settlement
(understanding) The money travels from America to the Cayman Islands
Yes, but now the money is legal
Not quite legal
The
has been cheated out of the revenue
(beat) We calculate that Mr
Pearce's tax bill currently stands at $743
7 million dollars
Jean Luc leans toward his colleague
(whispers in French) That explains what the American harridan is doing here
Ms
Jones gives him a glacial stare
Exactement, monsieur
Jean Luc reddens
Oops
Apparently not every American fits the stereotype
Mr
Pearce has some other debts as well
Most of you will recognize Ivan Demidov
Click:   of a balding   emerging from a limo
(') Pearce laundered over a billion dollars for Demidov
At some point Pearce decided he'd rather steal from Demidov than help him steal
() 13
(') (beat) Given Demidov's ties to organized crime, 'd say that was a mistake
(clears her throat) The
Government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the Russian parliament; our target is Alexander Pearce
Ackerman smiles coolly at her
Of course
An   from Germany raises his hand
Has Mr
Pearce ever been in custody
Ackerman looks down for a moment, as if it pains him to answer
Almost
: '   ,  - : Fog covers the skyline, exposing only the slate rooftops of buildings that haven't changed in centuries
We hear the sound of water gently lapping the shore
From out of the mist emerges
-- a patrol boat, lights dimmed
It gently touches the beach
officer lowers a ramp
An    in Kevlar and headgear pours out of the patrol boat
Ackerman steps off, pulling on a vest
He nods to Goyal
Finally
Let's go
14
They follow the team
- who kneels to open an electric panel
a glass plate with a fingertip shape in the center
The  places his hand against the glass: a red light beeps on -- it's a bio-metric lock
He turns to Ackerman
This is gonna take a few minutes
Ackerman betrays no impatience
He knows better than to rush the professionals
He simply nods
The Specialist opens a tool box filled with sophisticated gear and gets to work
' ,  - Wrapping a towel around herself,  , the girl from the train, stares at herself in the bathroom mirror for a beat
So do we
She steps out into the lofty master bedroom suite
In the dressing room, Cara calls out to someone in the next room
'll be ready in fifteen minutes
Cara sits on the bed, drying her hair
On a night table beside her are keys, a wallet and an expensive ' Cara pauses; she's heard something
She walks across the tiled floor to the balcony overlooking the elevator entrance
She freezes; six tactics  face her with guns drawn

Then

She calls out

The tactics team  the door
Ackerman charges into
Cara stands frozen beside the man's effects on the night table
The wallet
The keys
The watch
Where is he
On the other side of the room, Ackerman sees an , which the ocean breeze swings
Rushing forward he sticks his head out the window
Hanging outside the window is the rigging for a '  - a platform that seconds before was lowered to the sand below
In the distance, a recently boarded water taxi pulls away from the dock and sails out into the lagoon
Ackerman turns to face the study
On the desk is a cup of coffee with steam gently rising from its surface
cigarette sits lit in an ashtray, the smoke curling toward the ceiling
Ackerman stares at the empty, slowly revolving, chair
He walks toward , now in custody
He holds her defiant gaze for a moment
16
You have nothing to say
Cara looks at him for a moment, then lowers her eyes
(') Get her out of my sight
The Tall Commander shepherds the handcuffed Cara down the stairs and into the elevator
She wears Alexander's
(
) What does this Alexander Pearce look like
: - Ackerman closes the file in front of him on the podium
Nobody knows
He disappeared after his escape
He's had extensive plastic surgery to alter his appearance since then
Drug lord Amado Carillo did the same thing in the 90s to successfully elude authorities
How do you know about it
Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time
He treated them so well that they're virtually all completely loyal
None of them would cooperate
We've questioned the ones we could find, and the only thing we learned is that Pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the surgery
So nobody knows what he looks like
17
Correct
Forgive me for saying so Mr
Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance
What makes you think you can catch him now
Ackerman regards him with aplomb
His girlfriend was recently released from custody
He'll come for her
We'll be waiting
What makes you so certain
Ackerman clicks on a slide
Cara's face fills the screen behind him
murmur runs through the room
Every man stares
He'll come for her
Ackerman himself glances up at her face with a look of longing
'  for a moment before we
: - stands alone on the platform amid the bustle of the station
The gleaming train stretches out behind her
- Frank's eyes drift open
He glances out the window and as his vision comes into focus he sees that the train is stopped
He sits bolt upright
'  over the loudspeaker is saying something in Italian
Frank stumbles over himself to collect his things:      book, sweater, pills, etc
18
- Frank struggles down the aisle, bumping into fellow passengers and apologizing as he goes
All the while looking around for a sign of Cara
- Frank steps off the train and glances about at the hive of activity
Frank brushes past the -  from the Paris station
Finally he spots her
'  - Cara with her back turned
Frank hurries over
was afraid 'd missed you wanted to ask where you're staying in Venice
'm supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but  thought maybe-- (without turning) 've got a better idea
She holds out her valise for him
He takes it hesitantly
She peers at him over the rims of her sunglasses with a very slight smile
: ,   - beauty shot of the Grand Canal: magnificent palaces and churches soar upwards on either side in all their glory
launch labelled Danieli, travelling fast over the water
Cara shakes her head to let the wind ruffle her hair
Frank, clutching the railing beside her, afraid to wake up
19
,   - Frank leads us through the distinctive, revolving glass door into the low-ceilinged entrance lobby
Cara at the desk talking to the receptionist
You have a booking in the name of Mason
Si, Signorina
Signora
That's my husband
She nods at Frank
For a second, the receptionist cannot keep the surprise out of his eyes
This glamorous, superbly dressed creature is married to a dull, American tourist in a -shirt
He recovers his composure and alters his manner at once
Very good, Senora Mason
Welcome to the Danieli
You are in the Doge's-- our premiere suite
(pause) Is there anything special you require
Have a copy of today's Herald Tribune sent up to the room please
My pleasure, Signora
He gives her a large gold key and nods to a porter to take the luggage
Frank hurries to catch up with her
he watches them go
(') (in Italian) Mother of God, what a waste
20
,  - Together, they follow the porter into the ravishing, open central hall of the hotel, with the great, ornate staircase soaring up and up, past Gothic galleries and finely carved balustrades, beckoning
Frank and Cara trail the porter across the marble floor
Frank glances about, dazed with delight and amazement
'  - Under a gilded and coffered ceiling, portraits of the Doges flank a vast, hooded fireplace
The porter is showing them round the huge apartment, opening and closing doors
The bedroom is through here
You have two bathrooms, here and here
There is a small kitchen which
He glances at Cara; she doesn't look like a woman who spends a lot of time in the kitchen
(') you may not need
There are two televisions, video, , radio, hi fi sound system
And
The porter throws open a pair of French windows
He lets the view speak for itself
They step forward
The whole of St
Mark's Basin and the Venetian lagoon are laid out below them
(') Is everything satisfactory
Yes
Thank you
Then  will leave you
The Porter looks expectantly to the "husband" for a tip
Frank doesn't get it
An awkward beat
Cara takes a few Euros from her purse and tips him
The Porter exits
21
,   - Frank stands on the balcony in a daze
He stares down at the Molo and across St
Mark's Basin to San Georgio Maggiore
Cara joins him
You like it
Frank opens his mouth to answer
Then laughs
What's not to like
'd have been bored here on my own
There's more than enough room for two
can see that
didn't ask for an extra bed
Frank looks at her for a beat, barely able to breathe
(') Are you all right with the sofa
If you like,  can have them bring one up
His face falls
He tries to cover up his reaction
No, no, no
The sofa's fine
Perfect in fact
Before he can say more, the buzzer sounds
The luggage
'll get it
He goes back inside to answer the door
Cara remains alone on the balcony, immobile, as if holding her breath
She's waiting
listening
22
'  - Frank walks across to the door
There is a small spyhole and he looks through it
The porter stands there with a trolley
Frank opens the door
The porter wheels the trolley in and starts to carry the bags into the bedroom
- Cara relaxes again as she hears Frank approach
He steps outside on the balcony
've put my things in the other bathroom
She turns to face him
Have you ever been to Venice before
He shakes his head
(') Then we need to go out
: ,  - as he weaves through a sprawling mess of personnel and equipment, cell phones, computers and cables from various national agencies
The United Nations-aspect of the Task Force gives it impressive scope but also results in a Tower-of-Babel effect
The calm eye of the storm is Ackerman
She's checked into the Danieli
she's not alone
Good
(to the room) Maintain surveillance but keep your distance
() 23
(') Don't try to get clever: remember that Pearce is smarter than most of you put together
who quietly slips out of the room
,  - Gulfstream G550 executive jet banks over the Venetian coast and comes in for a landing
Wheels down
Stairway unfolds
The man who steps off the plane is dressed in a hand-tailored Italian suit and shoes that cost more than some cars

In the flesh
- floats over the rooftops toward the penthouse of a ultra-high end business hotel
'   - Demidov sips a glass of red wine
The view from his room rivals the one at the Danieli but Demidov pays no attention
He's busy scanning his emails on his Blackberry
Knock, knock
thick-necked  in the background goes to answer the door
moment later
He ushers in Quinn, the Swiss Interpol agent
Take a seat, Mr
Quinn
Can offer you a glass of Brunello
It's a '97
No thank you, Mr
Demidov
Demidov swirls his glass
You know 'd never admit this at home, but Vodka is for peasants
There's much we could learn from the Italians
24
He smiles pleasantly at Quinn, then, on a dime, he turns back to business
(') Tell me 'm not going to be disappointed
Quinn takes out an envelope and passes it over
don't think so
He flips it open and examines the contents
a photo of  and some text
(to himself) He always had good taste
Demidov makes a gesture and a second  with a on his face gives Quinn an envelope filled with cash
Quinn tucks it away discreetly, as if embarrassed by the directness of the pay off
Mr
Demidov
if  may ask you a question
Why do you care so much about Alexander Pearce
mean, you've come here yourself
as if it were personal
Demidov looks at Quinn thoughtfully
It may be difficult for you to understand, Mr
Quinn; you Swiss are mercenary by nature
But for some of us, there are things more important than money
put my trust in Alexander Pearce
He betrayed that trust
Quinn smiles tightly
He's ready to get out of there
(') And it's bad business to let somebody make a fool of you
If Pearce gets away with it, what does that say about me
: 25
,  - clear, bright winter day at the beach
Devoid of tourists, the famous stretch is a completely different Venice from the one we're used to seeing
Sandbanks stretch out into the dark green sea
Cara and Frank walk on a deserted patch of sand
The wind wraps her light sun dress around her body, intermittently hugging her perfect curves
So
when you're not on a Grand European Tour, what do you do in Rosemont, Pennsylvania
'm a teacher
High school math
And you
What do you do
She glances at him slyly over her movie star shades
This is what  do, Frank
You're good at it
sound of voices and laughter drift toward them
Up ahead on the beach they see a group of Italians in formal clothes
woman wears a white bridal dress
Oh look
a wedding
How lovely
'm not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life
Oh yes
forgot
She takes his arm and steers him toward a bistro with sidewalk tables
: - Cara and Frank are seated
bottle of Orvieto rests on the table
26
Do you think it's really over
Hmm
Maybe she'll change her mind
Women do
She might give you a second chance
suppose that's a possibility
(hesitates) That's what  tell my statistics class anyway; life is a game of chance
Endless possibilities and permutations
You just have to calculate the odds
You haven't answered the question
Well
(quietly) 'd like to think that love is a question of destiny, not chance
Cara looks at him curiously
For a moment there you just reminded me of somebody
She shakes her head and takes a sip of wine
(') He had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that he'd completely avoided the truth
His entire life was wrapped up in deception
(lost in thought) He told so many lies,  wouldn't believe him even if he finally did tell the truth
He doesn't sound like much of a friend
27
He wasn't
Frank glances at her wrist
So why are you wearing his watch
She looks up at him
You're smarter than you look, Frank
She runs her fingertip over the face of the watch
Then, impulsively unclasps it and reaches for Frank's hand
(') And you're right
Here, take it
She puts it on Frank's wrist, over his protests
What
No,  can't
This thing must be worth a fortune-- insist
You're doing me a favor
(firm) Take it or 'll toss it in the ocean
He hesitates
She means it
He closes the clasp
'll wear it until you regain your senses
He feels the heft of it on his wrist
Admires it for a moment
It really is a beautiful watch
She settles back in her chair, pleased with herself
He looks up and sees her smiling at him

It suits you

Frank and Cara tumble in together, laughing, a little tipsy
He glances at the sofa and that sobers him up, reminding him where he's going to sleep
However
He watches Cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off her shoes
She throws open the French doors to the balcony
Frank bypasses the sofa-bed and follows her outside

She pulls away from him
Her composure changes; the passion is gone
The expression on her face is matter-of-fact
You should leave Venice tomorrow
(softer) It's a city for lovers Frank; no place to recover from a failed engagement
She turns and walks toward her bedroom
Frank stares after her in stunned disappointment
What
what did  do
She pauses at the door
Her expression softens slightly
Nothing
'm sorry
Then she disappears into her bedroom
The door closes behind her and we hear the click of the lock
Frank remains standing alone, immobile
After several moments he sits on the sofa
There are two folded blankets and a pillow
From within Cara's bedroom we can hear her voice, muffled but still audible
(') that's exactly what 'm doing, but now  want him to go
30
He approaches the door, straining to hear more but her words fade out
: - Frank gets ready for bed
He takes off the watch Cara gave him and something on the back of it catches his eye
It's engraved with a name: He stares at the name for a moment, then unzips his travel bag
Takes out his pills
Pops a bunch
Brushes his teeth
He pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if wondering how in the world he ended up here
It's like he's staring into the face of stranger
He puts his tooth brush down and pads off to sleep on the sofa

He blinks his eyes
The morning is misty
He closes the balcony doors

Frank struggles not to notice
He turns to his bed and begins folding sheets
Then he hears the sound of water running in the shower
He glances over at the door ajar, the sound of the shower
it's too much
Frank walks to the bedroom door
He pushes it open
The door to Cara's bathroom is open
The outline of her naked body is visible in the shower
She lifts her wet hair and soaps the back of her neck
She sees him
Cara is so stunned she simply stands there
Frank walks to the shower and opens the glass door

Walking in, he  Cara against the glass, clutching at her slithery body, kissing her frantically
she kisses him back with ardor, wrapping her dripping legs around his back

Frank wakes with a start to see
is setting up breakfast on a cart
Pardone Signore
Good morning
Frank stares in surprise at the food spread out before him
(') La Signora ordered this for you when she left
When she
He looks around the suite
He is alone
He nods
(') Thank you
The waiter has finished
He hovers for a moment
Finally Frank takes the hint and gives the man a one Euro tip
He takes it with disdain and leaves
Frank throws off his blanket and sits up
'  - Frank strolls into the room, barefoot, in his boxers
The bed is unmade
32
Cara has left a shirt over a chair
he picks it up and holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering scent
He notices a newspaper
a copy of The International Herald Tribune is open on her bedside table
He lifts it to see what Cara had been reading
There is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with a ball point pen
The message is just a list of words: " " The dots single out letters in a code
Frank picks up the pen and puts a faint line through the groups of unselected letters to reveal the message: "Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro" Frank studies this for a moment
Laying the paper on the table, Frank walks to the door

) Breakfast
Frank reaches for the doorknob

Breakfast again

Scarface takes out a silenced  and mutters something in Russian to his partner
He produces a and crouches out of frame
Frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking tumblers inside the lock
He looks around wildly
Sees the  on the entryway table and reaches for it
Ch-chunk
The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts to open the door
The chain stops it
pause
33
moment later a  comes through the crack and starts to slide the chain
Frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast
Frank throws his shoulder against the door
The knife clatters to the floor as the door slams shut
Frank jams his  into the lock and turns the bolt into place
There's angry confusion on the other side of the door
Frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock
Frank scrambles out of the way
The sound of metal scraping in the lock
Russian can be heard just outside
heavy blow as they try to shoulder the door open
Frank looks around desperately for an escape
The bathroom
The sitting room
Adjoining doors
None
There's nowhere to go
Frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet
He scrambles outside as
Bullets rip through the wood and metal, blasting the lock assembly apart
The door bursts open
- Frank looks down and stares at the to the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below
Guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee
Three balconies over, Frank sees the rooftop of the modern wing of the hotel
The two  rapidly move through the room, searching
Nyet, Nyet
34
The one place they haven't checked
Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework
He grimaces as he  himself onto the railing of the balcony adjacent to his
He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street below
He gets a tentative hold
drops her coffee and screams
The Russians sprint out to the balcony
They spot Frank
Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her breakfast table, and prepares to leap again-- but slips on the spilled coffee
Bullets shatter China around him
He cuts his foot on a broken plate
He grabs his bleeding foot
Goddamn it
'm a fucking tourist
Another round of shots ring out
They don't seem to care
Frank goes over the railing with another awkward
His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto the Pallid Woman's balcony
This time Frank lands in the lap of a
Are ya bloody mad
The Burly Welshman  Frank in the stomach, which drops him out of the way of
Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder
He cries out and falls down on top of Frank
The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and prepare to
as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and peers over the next balcony
35
Which is at least   from the roof
He misjudged the distance
Shit
'  - Frank runs through the hotel room, past the Welshman's wife to the door
behind him and pounding feet send him out into the corridor past a room service steward to an
Which   will not do but the-- - will and Frank flies down the steps, three at a time, hearing his pursuers above him, running harder than he's run in his entire life
But he's slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons through the railing
-, several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the metal stairwell
Frank pants as he pushes out a side door
,  - Frank sprints along the edge of the canal, dodging tourists and children, vendors and locals
He spots a ' three wheel  and jumps on
As he pedals, he realizes it's too slow so he and  - a painful spill, he cuts his hand - but clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down
Running up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva Degli Schiavoni
36
,  - Frank runs down the ridge of the roof
silenced shot hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance
He bumping down the other side of the roof until, as he topples over the edge, he thrusts a hand at the gutter, smashing his head against the wall
He drops onto the pavement along the edge of the small canal
He doubles back towards the lagoon
Looking back, he sees the men still in pursuit
He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria, scattering the flapping and fluttering
The Gondolieri and their passengers watch the half-naked man run past and cheer
(in Italian) Run faster, man
The Russians force their way past the pedestrians
They have almost caught him when
- Ducking inside a leather shop, Frank heads straight for the back entrance and finds it
He stands on the cobblestones
Blood streams from his forehead as well as his hand
He has to decide which way to go
The alley is long and narrow on either side
An awning above
Clear sight lines
The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal
- The Russians burst out the back
There is no sign of Frank
Scarface looks at the Canal
He walks to the edge of the water and  gun fire atop it
Nothing
: 37
Frank lies huddled on his back    behind the leather shop, barely able to control his frantic breathing
He's mere feet away from the men who are trying to kill him
He looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian peering out over her window box
Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips
prayer that she won't give him away
She looks at him disapprovingly
Then disappears back inside
as he waits, his heart pounding
Seconds tick past
is he safe
Rrrrrip
black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun, tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's head
He cries out
The awning rips and dumps him down hard onto the cobblestones below
Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots that belong to
who stand over him
One of them holds a nightstick
They stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants lying at their feet
They've seen stranger things
: "" ( ) - Frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders
Most of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a rough bandage on his head
From down the hallway a cheery stubble-faced ,  (30's, animated), walks into the room where Frank is waiting
Domenico laughs, talking on his cell phone as he enters
38
(in Italian) You can't let them stay over, man
You start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car
Stop cuddling, Tomaso
Frank stands
Excuse me
(suddenly noticing him) Hey, what are you doing in here
The officers told me to wait here
've been sitting here for over two hours
Dominico glances over his shoulder
think they forgot about you
Frank sits back down heavily
Domenico sits on the edge of a desk
(') What happened to you, anyway
Somebody tried to kill me
Domenico picks up Frank's statement and glances at it
Mr
Taylor, wow, you had quite a day
Eh
We got chasing, we got shooting
Domenico looks at mild-mannered Frank sitting there in his boxers
The story seems unlikely
You think 'm crazy but it's all true
Maybe you crazy  it's true, my friend
39
Domenico looks at Frank a little harder
Decides this guy is not making all this up
(') Okay, so who are these guys
Why they mad at you
have absolutely no idea
They followed you from the Danieli
They came to the room
They pretended to be room service
You don't scopata one of their girlfriends or something
didn't "scopata" anybody
Who is
He consults a piece of paper
(') Cara Mason
Frank is quiet
Domenico playfully points at him
(') catch you, right
(irritated) In America the cops catch the crooks, not the victim
Ha ha, we do that sometimes here, too
Domenico considers for a moment
(') Is no domestic, then
40
No
How long you know Cara Mason
met her yesterday
And you take her to the Danieli
That must have been good meeting, yes
didn't take her
She took me
The infectious grin again lights up Domenico's face
You lead an exciting life, Mr
Taylor
Not usually
Domenico picks up the phone and dials a number
He talks in brisk Italian, listens again and replaces the receiver
Signora Mason was staying with "her husband" last night
You marry her, Mr
Taylor
No
think maybe Signora Mason might know why these guys behave badly
What do you think
Pause
think that's possible
You got a phone number, mobile
She didn't give me one
41
Domenico looks him over
You need some clothes
'll be right back
He leaves Frank alone again
Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the doorway
He spots something in the adjoining room; a computer that has been left on
He wanders over and looks at the screen
An idea comes into Frank's head
he looks around
Nobody is watching him
He glances at the inscription on the Then quickly sits down
He does a search for " " and types in the name: An immediate hit in the data base
Alexander Pearce's page fills the screen
The caption reads: #6 on '
In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of a man's head
Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears Domenico returning
He quickly steps back into the room where he was left
enters carrying a garish
He hands it to Frank
(') Here
Put these on
Time to go
Frank looks at the clothes
Um
thanks
Where are we going
'm taking you to the hospital, Mr
Taylor
doctor should take a look at you
42
'd really rather just go-- Don't worry
put you in Padua, away from Venice
You'll be safe
(scribbles his number) Any worry, you call me
give you my home number
: ,  - Frank lies flat on his back
leans over him with a kindly expression
Relax signore
We're just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head
She slides him slowly into the mouth of an  scanning machine head first
It hums to life
,  - Domenico whistles as a hotel clerk escorts him to to the Doge's suite
(in Italian) Unfortunately we've already re-let the room
(nervous) We'd rather the guests didn't know about the incident
Don't worry
'll be discreet
Grazie
The Clerk knocks
The door is opened by Ivan Demidov
43
(') beg your pardon, Signore, but this is a police officer
He needs to briefly examine the room
Of course
Demidov steps back, holding the door open
' ,  - Demidov watches Domenico, who sniffs around
(casually) What happened, officer
That's what 'm trying to find out, Signore
Domenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks around
He spots something under the sofa and fishes it out with his penknife
a spent bullet casing
He puts it in a plastic bag, pleased with himself
Demidov catches his eye
He smiles at him
You are a good detective
do my best
Domenico stands and takes his leave
(') Sorry for the inconvenience
Enjoy your stay
As he and the clerk exit, Scarface steps out from the other room
Off Demidov's look, he leaves the suite to follow
,  - Frank lies on the bed
There are clean bandages on his injuries
44
The television drones on the wall: an Italian reality show
holds her hands over her eyes
The taunts her: (
) (in Italian) Now remember,  said you were in for a surprise
a big surprise
Frank waits for the surprise
,  - Ackerman is tilted back with his eyes closed like he has a headache
Jones enters with a file labelled:    "Frank Taylor"
What did we find on the American
He's a tourist
Member of the teacher's union
Pays his taxes
Has bad luck
Evidently
He had a pair of Russian hit men after him
Are you still going to tell me Demidov is clean
never said he is clean
just said he isn't our target
'm just wondering how they tracked them down at the hotel
(under his breath) Just so long as they don't beat us to Pearce when the real one arrives
He looks up at Goyal
(') Where's the teacher now
45
The local police picked him up
Then he's safely out of the way
: - Frank sits up in his bed, reading
The
Hello
,  - : Domenico - in his terrace flat
He wears a - shirt and holds a glass of wine
Loud Italian pop music plays in the background
Well it's official Mr
Taylor
You're not mad
That's a relief
went to the hotel
Somebody shot at somebody
found a shell casing
'll have it analyzed in the morning
Frank glances around uncomfortably
'd like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning
Relax, you're perfectly safe where you are
(pause) You have any visits from your Signora Mason
46
(quiet) wish
Never let them cuddle, Mr
Taylor
One cuddle and it all turns to merda
Good night
If you need anything, you have my number
Frank hangs up, shaking his head
In the restful silence he hears a gunshot
door slam
Nervous, he gets up and goes to the door
- Frank looks right and left
The corridor is empty and silent, lit by strip lights set on low
Just as he's about to close the door again, Frank notices that there is a label stuck there with his name on it, just above the room number
He struggles with the label for a few seconds, tearing it off
He sticks the label on the door to an empty room opposite
- Frank goes to the sink and splashes water on his face
Stares at himself for several moments, as he did in the bathroom at the Danieli
He's lost in thought
Then
He hears the clang of a metal pushcart being wheeled along
Some footsteps approach
There are voices speaking an unfamiliar language, maybe Russian
Russian
Frank scrambles for his clothes
He fishes out Domenico's phone number from a pocket and races to the phone
Then freezes, listening: The footsteps move away slightly
there is the sound of a door opening
The door across the hall
47
Seconds pass
The door is closed again
The footsteps move down the hall, slowly fading away
Frank punches in the policeman's number and grips the receiver
It rings
'   - saucepot simmers on the stove
The phone
Behind it is a  - pierced by one circular bullet hole
The music still plays
As our gaze drifts downwards we see Domenico's bare feet, prone behind the kitchen island
The phone  and
- Frank is struggling into his clothes
Everything seems to stick and take forever
He opens the door a crack and looks down the ward
Nothing
He moves along the passage, slipping into doorways and out of the light
He finds the elevator and jabs at the button
The light shows it is approaching the floor
It stops
The doors open
Frank is about to enter it, when suddenly
An  exits and brushes past
Frank breaths a sigh of relief and steps in
,  - Frank presses the button for Receptione et Terre and waits an interminable four seconds for the doors to close
Slowly the elevator descends
and stops
The doors open
big  stands with his back to us, blocking the exit
Frank shrinks away, with nowhere to hide
The man turns
48
He's a  , waiting to get into the lift
He stands aside to allow Frank to leave
Frank takes a step out
and sees  talking to the receptionist
Hurriedly, Frank reverses back into the elevator
(to the Nurse) Wrong floor
Then, just before the doors close, Scarface turns
his eyes meet Frank's
He starts towards the elevator
but the doors shut first
The lift stops again
The doors open on the first tier of the subterranean car park
Frank leaps off
,   - Limping and terrified, Frank jogs towards the ramp marked Uscita in the far corner
An   splits the silence
The lights blind Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him
He falls to his knees
The car skids to a stop
The door flies open
He squints
Sitting behind the wheel, calm and beautiful as ever, is
He stares
What are you waiting for
Get in
'  - He climbs into the car
She turns to him as she pulls out
Did you miss me
little
He glances anxiously over her shoulder
49
(') Um
you may not believe this but there are some people trying to kill me-- (calm) know
Cara drives toward the ramp
He looks at her
Do you know why
It's because  kissed you
She stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top of the ramp to open
It rises with a loud creaking to with two men inside
One of them steps out and ducks under the gate as it rises up
While he's briefly silhouetted by the car's headlights we glimpse the outline of an
(') Shit
With remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets her car roll backwards, gliding silently and perfectly into a parking spot
Silence
They watch the   slowly descend the ramp
The Russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully alongside
Frank watches, holding his breath
The sound of another engine cuts through the silence pair of headlights come up from the level below
The   from the elevator is driving up toward the exit ramp, toward the exit where the Russians are waiting
slipping back into the shadows and readying his gun to fire
50
sees what is about to happen
His face betrays his concern
He reaches for the door
Cara presses the central door lock
Frank's door doesn't budge
He looks over at her
(re: the Nurse) That guy has nothing to do with this
Neither do you
He looks her straight in the eye
She relents
(') Okay
If you want to play hero
She turns over the ignition
(') Hold on
Cara revs the car and pulls out fast, cutting off the Nurse's car
He leans on the horn
At the top of the exit ramp, the metal parking gate is slowly being lowered
She weaves around the black car, deliberately heading for the gunman
He opens fire
Bullets spray wildly, ricocheting off the walls, shattering windshields
Frank covers his face as a side-window pops, showering him with glass
The  is forced to jump out of the way as Cara scrapes the side of her car along the wall
Sparks fly
The black car burns rubber as it -turns to follow her
She guns it up the ramp towards the closing door
There's not enough room
There's enough room
51
The fence whirs at head height and keeps lowering
The black car is closing in behind them
We won't make it
thought Americans were optimists
At the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his eyes
The gate clips the top of Cara's car with a tremendous
Traps it
Cara presses her foot all the way down on the accelerator
Smoke pours from the tires
The black car  them from behind
Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines of Cara and Frank's
Bullets shatter the back window
Cara pushes Frank's head down
The sound of burning gears as the engine hits its limit
Suddenly, scraping paint, Cara's car  forward, jetting out onto the street
The fence drops further and shudders to a halt
The black car is trapped
The Russians can only watch as Cara speeds away
: '  - The quiet hum of the autostrade is the only sound in the car
Frank sits in a daze
He turns to her
Do  look that much like Alexander Pearce
Cara turns sharply
52
How do you know--
Frank holds up his wrist
The watch
She hesitates
pause
don't know
You're about his size
That's all
(incredulous) You don't know what your own boyfriend looks like
Alexander crossed a very dangerous man
He changed his appearance in order to vanish
Great
Don't worry
'm taking you somewhere you'll be safe
We should go to the police
Because they did such a good job protecting you before
Frank doesn't respond
(') Trust me
Frank looks at her
Then relents, leaning his head back against the support and closing his eyes
: 53
- The car is parked along a muddy canal
Beside it runs a small disconnected set of palazzos
Cara shakes Frank
He won't wake up
Frank
Frank
He's snoring
She pinches his nose closed
He startles awake
She smiles mischievously
He follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men sitting on stone steps
And  thought  wouldn't get to do any sight-seeing
Frank steps over a greenish puddle
Here we are
She pauses before a run-down palazzo
,  - The narrow hall is dark and shabby
Cara walks up the stairs to a door on the landing
She opens it with a key
' " " - It is completely dark inside
The two of them maneuver in the darkness
The sound of a hand bumping against a wall
Finally somebody finds the light switch and-- holds a
38 Taurus  in front of her
Frank happens to be right in her line of sight
He flinches
54
Whoa
Sorry
She quickly directs the gun away from him
Frank leans over, catching his breath
Cara starts to giggle
Frank starts to laugh too
, ' " " - The apartment appears as if it was leased, stocked and then never set foot in again
Brand new appliances that have never been used
Frank walks over to a flat screen  and curiously peels off the protective clear film
He looks up and sees: Cara has her head inside the
What are you doing
She pulls out, a flashlight in her mouth
Making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines
Frank watches her walk over to the
Frank pokes through the cupboards
Stocked with fine olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed fruit from orchards in France
He opens the icebox
Inside is frozen meat and fish
He pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks - it is labelled ",  , 8/07"
He goes Barracuda fishing
Cara has poured herself a glass of wine
He goes Marlin fishing
You catch the Barracudas by accident
55
Frank looks at the steak
, ' " " - -- now seasoned, grilled and surrounded by whipped sweet potatoes, beets and almonds
Frank places a plate before Cara who sits with her wine at Pearce's oak table
She looks appreciatively at her plate
And she left you for a cook
Frank smiles and pours himself a glass of wine
Cara takes a bite
(') Mmmmm
That's decadent
With these ingredients, it's not hard
Frank savors a bite of his meal
(') You know something
Food tastes better after you've been shot at
Cara laughs
She clinks his glass
'm glad  decided to come back for you, Frank Taylor
They watch one another eat for several moments
Can  ask you a question
She sets down her fork
Leans back
(') What's it like
Being a criminal
(scoffs) 'm not a criminal
56
You carry a gun, you consort with people being chased by killers hate to break it to you, but-- Okay, 'm a criminal
She takes a big gulp of wine
Moves over to the sofa
(') didn't mean for things to turn out like this
always lived by a certain code
But then
broke it
She lapses into silence
Frank comes and sits beside her
For Alexander Pearce
She doesn't answer
Which is an answer
(') What's he like
beat
He's the most interesting man 've ever known
When  first met him, wasn't expecting that
He took me by surprise
She shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if reliving a memory of sensual pleasure
(') If 'd been prepared,  might not have loved him
But  wasn't
So did
She frowns into her empty wine glass
Frank slides a little closer
(soft) don't regret it, you know
Regret what
57
Kissing you
He looks into her eyes
They are sitting very close on the sofa
The lights are low
The mood is romantic
Frank puts an arm over her shoulders and leans in for a kiss-- Cara stands abruptly
What are you doing
He looks   up at her, questioningly
thought
You thought what
That  saw you on the train and my heart stopped
That all my life 've been waiting for a math teacher from the Midwest to sweep me off my feet
Frank doesn't respond
(') picked you because of your height
Do you understand
He does
His humiliation complete, he rises with as much dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the kitchen
Cara looks after him
exasperated yet already sorry for being so blunt
She is about to say something when
Her
special ring
She answers right away
- The  strolls the Piazza San Marco from behind as he speaks into his phone
Have you been reading the newspaper
58
Cara narrows her focus
She walks away from Frank, stealing away into the bedroom
Her heart is beating
Yes
there was nothing there today
Is
is it you
Alexa-- No names
Not on the phone
,  - The   of the man's voice shimmer on a computer monitor
Goyal and Ackerman stand watching, hanging on every word
(
) (from the speakers) It's been a busier weekend than expected
Place him
Place him
-  zeroes in on a  screen
The screen gives him a map of
Then zooms into a map of the   district
, " " - Cara holds one finger in her ear, listening intently
(
) There's a recipe in a Tuscan cookbook there  need
Would you look it up for me
Do we really need another "recipe
" want to make sure our guests are surprised
59
- The Englishman passes the Lagoon to his left, and enters an enormous courtyard, the Arco Foscari
He looks down at his watch
You're a brave and loyal girl
'm in awe of you
,  - The computer map hones in on the
Go
Go
Go
Goyal is already out the door and Ackerman grabs his Kevlar vest and follows, racing down the steps
, " " - Cara folds her arms as she listens
That's because you leave everything up to me
She pouts, only partially joking
(') 'm fine by the way, in case you were concerned about me
(playful) My only concern is for those who cross you, my love
- At last The Englishman arrives before the lower colonnade of the ' , the seat of medieval Venetian civic government
It is a wonder of Gothic architecture with spires piercing the blue sky
He gazes up at it for a moment
60
You may not believe it, but every step of this miserable game is taken in the hope of earning your trust and ever-lasting regard mean that
The Englishman is at the Ponte del Suspiri-- the "Bridge of Sighs
" , " " - Cara's expression softens
You have a talent for saying the right thing
(to herself) You always did
Frank listens to the end of Cara's conversation, his forehead creased with concern
,  - The Englishman closes his phone and disappears into the crowd
, " " - Cara speaks urgently
Wait-- The line is dead
- silent caravan of three black 's - a strange sight in Venice - pull up in perimeter around the Bridge of Sighs and skids to a stop
Ackerman and the others leap out, looking around
Then Ackerman sees it: The Englishman's  , sitting on the cobblestones
61
They approach
Goyal kneels to pick it up with a plastic bag
We should check for prints
Maybe he forgot to wipe it down
doubt it
Ackerman looks around
, " " - Holding her now unimportant phone in her hand, Cara draws herself up and walks into the Frank lies asleep on the couch
Cara walks to the kitchen and retrieves the Tuscan Cookbook
Thinking herself unobserved, she opens it
has been turned down
recipe for
Cara pulls out her red, felt-tipped pen
She finds a sentence in the recipe with a single pen dot beside it
Tapping her pen under letters on the page, Cara works out the code, memorizes the contents of the message and closes the book
His eyes are open
- Establishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the winter time
Boats are pushed out into the canals
Trash is hosed from the cobblestone streets
Tables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes, waiting for the tourists to come
62
, " " - With an unfamiliar gentleness, Cara approaches Frank sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder
Frank
have to go
He opens his eyes and looks at her
(') Don't go out
All you need is here
In four or five days everything will be resolved
Resolved
It will all be over
'll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life
This will be a great adventure you can look back on
When will  see you again
Never
She looks at him evenly; one last glance between two people from two completely different worlds
(') Good-bye, Frank
She leaves
,  - She has started down the stairs when Frank appears on the landing
He leans over the balustrade
Is he worth it
Get back inside
She has stopped mid-flight
63
You're going to risk everything for him
Would he do the same for you
She is quite straightforward in her response
It doesn't matter
love him
He doesn't deserve it
She shakes her head
None of this is your business anymore
Now get back inside Frank
Just as she raises her voice a door opens below them in the hall, and an old man comes out
He looks up at Cara
Signorina
This is exactly what she did not want
But she controls her annoyance, nods in greeting and continues towards the front door
(to the neighbor) Mi dispiace, Signor
The Old Neighbor nods as Cara walks out the door
He admires Cara's shapely form as she crosses the cobblestone streets and disappears into the alley
He glances back up at Frank and whistles appreciatively
Frank turns and goes back inside
,  - Ackerman sits in an office chair, gently revolving
Jones, Goyal and Jean Luc are there as well
Why do women find these con men so appealing
Jones is the only woman nearby
64
Don't look at me
married my personal trainer
(sotto Jean Luc) She's twenty-six
Jean Luc can't tell if she's serious
How did Pearce seduce that beautiful woman
Was it his charm
His looks
Looks change
Ackerman sips from his ten thousandth cup of espresso
Maybe it's because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires, so then can she
He looks around to see if the others like this theory
(') She can become a child again
Who wouldn't want that
There is a bitterness in Ackerman's tone that reveals he is personally hurt by this
Goyal's Blackberry makes a beep
She's on the move
Time to go
Ackerman pushes himself wearily to his feet
By all means
Let's follow the children
, " " - Paging through the cookbook, Frank locates the page
He smiles in recognition at the familiar  pattern of red dots
He pulls out a

, " " - Frank examines a sleek, tiny electric razor that resembles a lollipop
Turning it on, he applies it
Pleased, he keeps shaving
Getting out of the shower, Frank enjoys the soft Frette towels
, " " - In the closets are dozens of flawless, custom-tailored suits
Flipping through the rack like a discerning shopper, Frank arrives at a suit that catches his fancy
Elegant and simple
Frank struggles to close Alexander Pearce's pants around his lightly padded mid-section
a little too tight
Frank is irritated to discover he's not quite as trim as Pearce
Frank engages himself in a spontaneous program of He struggles through a batch of push-ups, then sit ups
Frank flosses his teeth
Then he backs up, taking in his outfit
The lines of the suit highlight his frame
He likes what he sees
'   - Demidov is getting dressed
It's an elaborate ritual: carefully pressed pants, ironed shirt, starched collar, etc
His two  stand nervously at attention, watching him
66
When  was a young man, times were very hard
When an opportunity presented itself, you took it
He pats talcum powder on himself
The men remain stone- faced
(') was twelve years old when Gregor asked me if  was ready for a man's job
He was the top chelovek in our housing block
So said yes
He gave me a crowbar and told me to go bash in the skull of another boy who had stolen something from him
He points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table and snaps his fingers
Scarface hands them to him
(') Now it just so happened this boy was a friend of mine
did not want to do this terrible thing
But when you come from the streets, you have no choice
He carefully knots his tie in the mirror
(') worked   very hard for years to get past   that life
So  would not have   to do these terrible things
So  would have a choice
He turns and smiles at his - bodyguard
He gestures toward the man's holstered pistol -- (') have people like you to do these things for me
He holds out his hand;   hands him the pistol
(') Except that you don't
Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face
Blood explodes from  's nose
He falls down to one knee, clutching his face in pain
67
Scarface looks on in fear
Demidov calms himself almost as quickly as he lost his temper
He drops the gun on the carpet and steps back in disgust
(') If you did your job properly, wouldn't have to get my hands dirty, you piece of shit
He turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands
: - Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani
She checks her watch
Then walks faster
She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat) floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo
Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant
- From a second story  of rooms, The  peers through the curtains
He sees Cara seat herself at a between the pool and the lagoon
His eyes settle on the transporto
Workers step on and off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel
He leaves the window
- There is a small cabin on the deck
Inside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics officer huddle
Ackerman stares out the tinted window
'  - he can just see Cara sitting at the table
68
,   - Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly evaluates the men in her sight lines
Venetian civic leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps
Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of drunk in each other's grasp in the pool
She turns away
- Squinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements
-  , idling at his bussing station, his eyes roaming the palazzo
-   , who quietly turns away requests for a ride into St
Marks Square, his finger to his ear
- An   sitting a few seats away from Cara
And an    (police patrolman) loud and jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his earpiece
He speaks into the air
(
) (from the speakers) Eh, we do not know any further
characteristics
(pressing a button) You know what we know
,   - The   swivels to follow a , elegantly dressed, with trim hair who swiftly approaches Cara's table
Standing up, Ackerman holds his hand up
69
(into the speaker) Hold
wait for my signal
Cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant man approaching
The  walks quickly toward Cara's table
The elegant man is
Ackerman stares at the monitor with Frank's face on it
He's quietly furious
What is that fool doing in the middle of my operation
Cara stares slack-jawed at Frank
He has given himself a complete make-over
New haircut
Pearce's suit fits him well
He looks terrific
Cara notices before quickly recovering her composure
Time for Alexander and me to meet face to face
(quietly) don't know what you're talking about
Please go, 'd like to have a quiet coffee
Frank sits at the table with Cara and eats a
Ackerman barks whispered orders into the speaker: 70
(frustrated) Move off
Move off
The   quickly moves away from Cara's table
Ackerman stares at the monitor which captures Cara's angry expression
(') (talking to the screen) Get rid of him
Defiantly, Frank pulls his chair in closer to Cara
He signals to a different
(to the waiter) Caffe, per favore
Frank turns back to Cara, who calls out-- Cameriere
No caffe for signor
(contradicting her) With milk
She stares at him
Do you want to be dead
Not particularly, but 'm tired of being afraid
've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and 've decided 'm finished
Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette
He lights it, smoking while he talks
71
(') When  first saw the name  got scared: "Alexander Pearce
" He even sounds like some super cool master criminal with Russian enemies and the beautiful girlfriend
he probably works out
He might own a pizza shop on the side for all  know
Frank frowns at the cigarette
(') These are disgusting
- Goyal is seated at the communication station
- Frank is settled in opposite Cara
He's not going anywhere
Ackerman peers directly out the window, as if he's going to see something different
Put Lipetti in
Tell him to play it like he's dealing with a rowdy guest-- escort him out
,   - Cara looks all around
No sign of any suitor approaching
: the hands of the  , who sprinkles pepper carefully, presumably onto a dish
He then platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder
Frank, you have no idea what you're sticking your nose into
Probably not
But 'm doing it anyway
Alexander Pearce nearly got me killed
It was his idea, right
() 72
(') He told you to pick out some random sap on the train to take a bullet for him, didn't he
Frank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger
(') Well 'm not playing the role anymore
'm going to confront him
He's supposed to meet you here, isn't he
'm going to tell him exactly what  think of him
Wonderful
Another macho idiot
(to the waiter) Conto, per favore
Frank leans in
What's the lure, Cara
Obviously not his character
Is it the money
The luxury
What's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail
'm leaving Frank
He's smooth, right
He probably has mistresses in every European city, too
It's really a shame you've scared him off-- She tosses some Euros on the table
(') The two of you make a nice couple
The   arrives with a
He sets it down in front of Cara
The   now moves toward the table with a grim expression
The   removes the platter
Cara looks down
73
Spelled out in  and  on the plate is the following: "
8PM
" Cara no sooner reads it than the Thin Waiter, who we now see is
on the platter, scattering the salt and pepper granules to the wind
What the hell
As Frank looks up
The Englishman has already turned away, but the Undercover Waiter is moving quickly toward Cara's table
The Undercover Waiter picks up speed, changing course slightly
he's after The Englishman who is about to enter the restaurant kitchen
Then  steps in front of The Undercover Waiter, mistaking him for Pearce
(') Is this him
Frank
- Ackerman slaps the cabin table
Abort
Abort, goddammit
The Undercover Waiter tries to move past Frank
You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you
Not much of a tough guy, are you
Frank  him back
74
(') Where  come from, we don't treat women like that
Frank grabs the Undercover Waiter's collar with unaccustomed strength
Cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant
She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward the Palazzo Vendramin
In the midst of his scuffle, Frank looks around and realizes she's gone
The Undercover Waiter's earpiece falls out in the melee
Frank sees it and hesitates
Maybe this guy isn't Pearce
- Getting up from his seat in the cabin, Ackerman gestures for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock
: Frank looks around and sees Cara:     fifty feet away
Walking with purpose
That goddamn fool
Ackerman rubs his face and squats down, frustrated beyond measure
What do we do with him
Throw him in the lagoon
: - Frank brushes past tables, hits the street and  down the Palazzo, toward Cara
Cara
Cara says nothing
She just shoots Frank an angry glance and climbs onto   (water taxi)
75
Frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away
Suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him
of '  are right there
They pin his arms forcefully
Ok Signor
you can come with us now
Frank looks at the two big men on either side of him
Then at Cara disappearing over the water
The fight drains out of him and he doesn't resist
: - Frank sits alone in the sparsely furnished, windowless room
table, two chairs
large mirror on the wall
Frank straightens his slightly disheveled suit, as if he's been dumped here without ceremony
He glances in the mirror periodically, suspicious
The door opens and Ackerman enters
He pulls up one of the chairs and gestures for Frank to do the same
Please
He looks Frank up and down
(') Nice suit
It's borrowed
It's a good fit
Unfortunately
Ackerman reaches into his breast pocket and takes out his credentials
Tosses them on the table for Frank to see
76
(') Police
better than the alternative  suppose
Ackerman smiles
Frank remains defiant
He jerks his head toward the mirror confidently
(') Who's watching from behind there
Ackerman looks over at the mirror, taken off guard by the question
He stands and goes to the mirror -- lifts it off its hooks and sets it on the floor
Nothing but plain wall underneath
Ackerman sits back down
Frank is a little bit chastened
You have a vivid imagination
haven't needed it lately
Ackerman smiles
(') You're in for a disappointment
'm not Alexander Pearce
know that
Frank looks up
Since when
Since the beginning
Frank stares at him blankly
How
Come
want to show you something Frank
: 77
,  - Ackerman leads Frank through the maze of desks and police
Various members of the task force follow their progress
Jean Luc, Jones, etc
They arrive at a central  area where Goyal sits in front of several computer monitors
He looks up as Ackerman and Frank arrive
(to Goyal) Pull up the  Academy graduating class for 2002
Goyal raises an eyebrow, but does as he's told
few moments later a photo of   in uniform comes up on screen
(') Take a good look
Frank peers at the screen
He spots the instructor-- Ackerman seven years younger
You
Take a look at the second row
on the screen
Frank examines the second row
One of the young women is
Her hair is pulled back
She looks more the determined police cadet than the sexy siren
but it's definitely her
Cara
He is dumbfounded
We've been watching you this entire time
(dawning) You saw those men try to kill me and you didn't intervene
78
'm trying to apprehend a major criminal
'm not a babysitter
Frank grows angry
want to speak with somebody at the American Embassy
'm going to tell them that you and your undercover officer knowingly and recklessly endangered the life of an American citizen
Let's see what my government has to say about that
Jones clears her throat from a chair across the room
We're aware of the situation, Mr
Taylor
But we take a long view of these things
fortunately you are unhurt
Frank is incredulous
Then 'll go to the press
'll tell the entire story to the New York Times
(quietly) No
don't think you'll do that
Why not
Because  don't think you want to see Cara's entire career destroyed
Frank falls silent
Ackerman puts an arm around his shoulder and leads him away from the others
(') Espresso
: 79
,  - Frank stands on a balcony overlooking a waterway
Ackerman emerges with two cups of espresso
Hands one to Frank
Women like Cara don't come along very often
In my case, they don't come along at all
She's the worst combination: stunning looks and a brilliant mind
If she's so smart, how did she get caught up with Pearce
It started out as a straightforward placement
'  -  [] Cara (younger) poses as an art student, sketching a in the Anticollegio
(
) we ran her deep cover to build a case against Pearce
It took
He hired her as an assistant
She turns her face and smiles at an
-  [] The wind blows in Cara's hair
She sits on the top deck
'  passes her a drink as he walks by
She smiles at him (again we do not see his face)
(
) Then she began missing drops
Omitting important details
80
- Ackerman turns to Frank
She was no longer with us
She was with him
Ackerman finishes his espresso
(') She explains it now as the confusion of her new life outside the academy
That  misread her capacity for this kind of work
Then why are you still using her
She's all  have, Mr
Taylor
Beat
You think she'll turn him in this time
don't know
Goyal walks up behind Ackerman waiting patiently for a moment to interrupt him
(') do know however, that you are very smitten with her
Frank looks back at him evenly
It's not just me, is it
Ackerman acknowledges the point with the barest of nods
Goyal signals that Ackerman has a phone call
: 81
,  - The principal apartment of a Venetian palazzo, looking out over the Grand Canal
Cara holds her cell phone to her ear as she walks
(
) Cara
Where have you been
on the phone at his office
Have you got him
You mean the idiot who ruined our operation
Have you got him
Ackerman glances out the window at Frank
Yes
Cara is relieved
It's your own fault
We never should have endangered a civilian
You should have put an agent into place
There was no time
Besides Pearce is too smart for that; he would have spotted the agent a mile away
He didn't spot me
Ackerman smiles bitterly
Apparently he didn't have to
Cara doesn't answer
Ackerman regrets the jibe
He steps into a  where it's quiet
82
(') 'm sorry Cara
That was uncalled for
as she listens to him
(') 'm on edge because of our failure today
If only the American hadn't messed everything up felt sure Pearce would show up today
What makes you think he didn't
Ackerman's face lights up
: ,  - Ackerman strides into the room, calling for attention
Okay everybody, listen up
Jones, Quinn, Jean Luc and the rest of the team assemble
Goyal has Frank with him, dragging him around like a lost puppy dog
(') We have a location and time for the next meet
Pearce's villa
Eight o'clock
We have to move fast-- Pearce's own villa
Why would he risk going back there
He must know we'd be watching
Perhaps he's nostalgic
doubt that
Maybe there's something of value still there
He left in a hurry after all
Call in a search team
83
We searched the place after the raid last year
If there's anything hidden there, only Pearce knows where it is
He picks up his coat
(') We need to get agents in place all around the villa
Frank speaks up unexpectedly
If you're all around his house, will he show up
dozen heads turn to look at him
If  needed your advice Mr
Taylor, 'd ask
Frank shrinks down in his chair
beat
Ackerman turns back to the rest of the room
(') Establish a wide perimeter
We'll keep our distance and wire the entire villa for video surveillance
The meeting breaks up
Everybody jumps into action
as he slips out a side door
: - standard hotel room-- no lavish suite this time
Cara stands in front of the mirror
Her shirt is unbuttoned as she works to attach a   to her bra
The tape gets stuck to itself and she has to start over
on her hotel room door
84
Come in
Frank enters the room
Sees her half-dressed-- 'm sorry
It's okay
Come over here need your help
In an echo of their first meeting on the train (but without the false flirtation) she turns to him and hands him a piece of tape
Their eyes meet
flicker of a smile passes between them
Frank's fingers are perfectly steady this time as he helps her secure the microphone and do up her shirt
Ackerman told me everything
She takes a deep breath
'm sorry Frank
There's no apology necessary
He steps back from her
She smooths her blouse
Turns to him
(re: the wire) How do  look
Like the most beautiful woman on earth
The complete honesty and directness of his compliment takes her by surprise
She's strangely moved by it
She brushes her hand affectionately over his cheek
When will you go home
85
Ackerman asked me to stay with the surveillance team in case the thugs who came after me at the Danieli show up
'm the only one who can identify them
Something occurs to Frank
(') Did you tell him to keep an eye on me
(busted) told him to make sure you were safe until this was over
He nods
little pleased at her concern
You shouldn't worry about me
What about you
What about me
What are you going to do
She takes a beat, then puts her game face on
My job
: '  - light mist
The sound of water lapping against the shore
The scene is familiar
almost identical to the night of the raid just over a year ago
Then a wind picks up and blows the mist clear
an undercover  with an earpiece walking a dog a block away
three blocks away -     with a scope
- a   with binoculars scans the empty street below
86
- two blocks down is a village
- Ackerman and his team have set up a make-shift surveillance outpost here
The high-tech equipment looks incongruous with the thousand year-old stone walls and worn oak pews
bank of monitors reveals various views of the inside and outside of Alexander's villa
Frank hovers in the background behind Ackerman
He notices Ackerman has a copy of the International Herald Tribune
You all read the same newspaper
It's a good paper
And sold throughout the world
Makes the classified ads especially useful
Frank nods
Ackerman sits down next to Frank as if he were an old pal instead of a quasi-captive
(') Since the internet came about, hardly anybody uses old school methods like that to communicate anymore
Except Alexander Pearce
No lines to tap
No signals to intercept
(admiringly) He's a very clever man, your double
look forward to meeting him
So do
- circles in the canal behind the villa
One of Ackerman's   is at the wheel
He sees a flat-bottomed black  motoring toward him
light from the boat shines in his eyes
87
(in Italian) You'll have to turn around, sir
There's been a chemical spill in this area-- silenced bullet strikes him in the forehead
The agent topples into the water with a gentle splash
The black boat steers around the rudderless patrol boat and heads toward the villa
'  - - a lone female figure walks down the cobblestone streets toward the villa
(
) She's approaching the destination now
- The black boat slips underneath some moorings
gloved hand tosses a grappling hook up to a beam ten feet overhead
It catches
The boat is tied off
Silently, a masked figure begins to climb from the boat up into the bottom floor of the villa in the semi- darkness
'
Cara unlocks the front door with a key and walks inside
' /  - from screen to screen as   Cara moving through the deserted rooms
Everything is cold and lifeless
Like a palace that has been turned into a museum
88
- While everyone is focused on the monitors showing Cara's progress, Frank notices some movement in a monitor far off to one side
It shows the lower floor of the house
(points) Who's that
They all turn to look
male figure, his face masked, approaches the lens of the surveillance camera
The  shuts off
Ackerman barks at a technician
What happened
Get it back on line
The surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons, etc
Was that Pearce
How did he know there would be a camera
Another monitor goes dark
Then another
He's taking out the entire surveillance system-- Stop him
can't
He's cutting the feed at the source
Frank looks anxiously at Cara on the monitor climbing the stairs
Blink
She disappears from view as well
Everybody starts talking
89
How can one man move through the house that fast
(overlapping) What should we do
Shut up
Everyone
They quiet down
Ackerman turns to the tech
(') Do we still have audio
The tech nods
(') Turn it up
Everybody in the Church stands stock still
Staring at the dark monitors
Listening
Cara's footsteps click up the stairs and then slow
They move tentatively across the floor
door or a heavy footstep
Cara's breathing gets louder
There's somebody else in the building
(
) Alexander
No response
Click, clack, click
She takes a few steps
-- concerned
-- calm
' ,  - Cara stands in the center of the large room
She catches sight of her reflection in the large floor-to-ceiling window
There's a movement in the doorway behind her
She spins around to face
He and his two men have removed their masks
90
Sorry to disappoint you, my dear
He steps toward her
Cara pales
- Everybody strains to hear what is happening
(whispers) Who is that
(
) How are you this evening
(
) (a tremor in her voice) Fine, thank you
The accent is Russ-- Shh
(quietly) It's Ivan Demidov
Jones looks at him
(uncertainly) Not possible
Cara takes a step back toward the window
Demidov follows
You're waiting for someone, Ms
Mason
Cara doesn't reply
(') You haven't seen Alexander Pearce in a long time, yes
'm sure it will be a touching reunion
() 91
(') If you don't mind, we'll keep you company while you wait
(anxious) What are we going to do
We're going to wait for Alexander Pearce
Just like them
- '  -  has maneuvered close enough to the window that she is visible
As they approach, Demidov and his two men come into range as well
(into his radio mic) She's brought them to the window
- Everybody is listening
(
) there are three of them
'  - he looks around at the cops desperately hoping somebody will do something
They all look to Ackerman
' ,  - Demidov circles Cara dangerously close
Not very polite of your boyfriend to keep you waiting
He loses track of time easily
have a hard time believing that
(pause) Perhaps he's already here somewhere
hiding
even watching us
92
(
) (') What do you think
long silence
The tension grows
Then we hear
Everyone in the room flinches
(
) (') You know
have a feeling he is around here somewhere
And if he cares about you
if he wants to see your lovely face again
he should show up before it's too late
-
This time Cara cries out in pain
Goyal turns to Ackerman
Sir
Demidov's right
He's here somewhere
Another
Another scream
Jean Luc looks to his colleagues-- Jones, Quinn
then turns to Ackerman
Every one of them is about to burst
We have to do something-- We have to wait
Yes but-- (harsh) She's my agent
She's my responsibility
muffled
Cara groans and   her body hit the floor
That wasn't a slap
93
Every cop in the room is clenching his weapon
Desperate for the order to move
To jump in and stop this
They are all looking to Ackerman to give the order
As the silence wears on, even Jones starts to waver
She speaks quietly to Ackerman
What if he doesn't come
Ackerman doesn't respond
The lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing than before
Suddenly Goyal notices
Where's Taylor
: - Frank runs for all he's worth
Panting for breath
'  - Frank bursts through the front door
Races to the steps without hesitating
' ,  - Cara lies on her side at Demidov's feet
Blood trickles from the side of her mouth
Her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the room half-askew
Then they suddenly come into focus as she sees
figure walks into the room
He stand motionless in the doorway, surprisingly calm
Demidov turns
(leans down to Cara) Good news
He loves you
94
Demidov's men take Frank by either arm and roughly drag him forward
Cara lifts her head with an effort
That's not Alexander Pearce
Demidov ignores her and walks up to Frank
You know, Mr
Pearce,  thought was finished with this sort of thing
But in your case, 've been forced to make an exception
He holds out his hand and one of his  gives him a and a
He is  Alexander Pearce
Demidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel
The thugs push Frank to his knees
But he's barely paying attention to them
His eyes are locked on Cara
She meets his gaze
For a moment, it's as if nothing else in the world exists but the two of them
He may only be a hapless tourist, but he loves her
He's the one here, willing to give up his life to save hers
(') Oh Frank
'm so sorry
Nothing to be sorry for
Demidov finishes attaching the silencer
He points the gun at the back of Frank's head
Good bye Mr
Pearce
At this moment, Cara fills her lungs and screams: Ackerman
95
She bends her head toward her cleavage, yelling into the tiny microphone
(') (furious) Ackerman
Demidov is taken off guard
- Her scream echoes through the arched church
Ackerman gives the order
Do it
- '  - Demidov and his gun-wielding henchmen standing over Frank and Cara
' ,  - The huge, plate glass window shatters as the high powered bullet slams through it
Everything explodes in a mass of blood and glass
is blown off his feet
His body hits the ground next to Frank
his gun skitters across the floor
Demidov looks from the window to Cara with cold fury in his eyes-- she's the one who has called in the artillery
He raises his pistol toward her, point blank
The gunshot takes him by surprise
He turns to see
holds Scarface's smoking pistol in his hand
Demidov just has time to process the fact that Frank is the one who shot him before the life drains from his eyes and he topples
Demidov's other bodyguard fires out the windows wildly and makes a run for it
Glass flies everywhere
Frank throws his body over Cara to protect her
96
short and furious exchange of gunfire as the other plate glass windows explode
Wood splinters fill the air as furniture is torn apart
Finally
One of the sniper's bullets finds its target and the goes down
Frank remains on top of Cara, shielding her until long after everything has fallen silent
'  - Ackerman and his team approach, guns drawn
Undercover agents converge as well, closing the perimeter
' ,  - Frank and Cara sit in the middle of the room amongst a sea of broken glass
Just getting over the shock of being alive
Are you all right
Cara nods
She looks at him for a long moment, then breaks out into a smile
did well to choose you on the train
Frank's turn to smile
He looks around the room at the carnage
You didn't get to arrest Alexander Pearce
He never showed up
Frank slides closer to her
Gently, carefully, he slips his hands into Cara's cleavage
Surprised, Cara starts to pull back-- but he puts a finger to her lips
She hesitates
looks at him questioningly
But she doesn't protest as his fingers move toward her bra
97
and grasp the tiny
With a sharp tug, he rips it free
He tosses it across the room
Then he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear: (a British accent) You're wrong
'm here
She straightens up
Her heart skips a beat
(') It's me
'm here
She covers her mouth
Her eyes mist over with tears
She runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement
Like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face
Her mind reels
Then their lips meet
They kiss
And kiss
Like drinking from a fresh spring in the desert
Finally she pulls away and looks at him
Why
You said 'd told so many lies, you wouldn't believe me even if did tell the truth
This was the only way to convince you
(pause) The truth is that  love you
All that matters is that you believe me
She stares into his eyes for a beat
Finally looking at her without a trace of deception
She believes
They hear voices on the stairs below
Frank holds up a finger to her-- wait
Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built-in bookshelf
It swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor
Frank removes the fitted floor boards
There is a sophisticated -  -- just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie
98
Frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open
: '  - up the stairs
He leads the team into the
He looks around at the mess as the agents fan out
Cara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit
Cara
want the paramedics to make sure you're all right-- She blows right past him
Ackerman calls out after her
(') Cara
She pauses
Turns to face him
Ackerman looks down for a moment, ashamed
(') 'm sorry
we'll talk about this later
No we won't
There's nothing to talk about
don't work for you anymore
She walks past him
For a moment Ackerman and Frank look at one another
Mr
Taylor
you're free to go
He looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect
(') It seems  underestimated you
(American accent) It seems you did, Mr
Ackerman
99
With that, Frank steps out of the room
Ackerman's attention is distracted by-- Sir
over here
Take a look at this
Goyal has found the safe
Ackerman comes over and looks
- the only thing in the safe is a single Goyal signals to one of the
He opens a laptop on the desk and they plug in the   to check the contents
While they are doing this, Ackerman bends to inspect the -
He was here
Jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen
Account numbers
access codes
unless 'm mistaken
he left the money behind
mistake perhaps
How much is there
Goyal scans down to a total
Looks like 744 million
That's no mistake
(walks over) That's his tax bill
She holds out her hand to the  who has just removed the
(') 'll take that
She slips it into her pocket, then turns to Ackerman
100
Ackerman has moved away
He's staring down at the ground -- from behind he looks like a man defeated
(') Well John
with the funds recovered,  don't think there's going to be any appetite from our side to continue this investigation
Ackerman's shoulders are slumped, staring at Demidov's dead body on the ground
Jones puts a hand on his back, consoling him
(') 'm sorry you didn't get your man
Then Ackerman turns
a big smile on his face
Oh but  did get my man, Ms
Jones
She realizes; he was after Demidov all along
Ackerman nods to Goyal, a twinkle in his eye
(') Mr
Goyal, you may place Mr
Quinn under arrest now
Quinn is taken completely off guard
Before he can move, Goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs
(') (to Quinn) What
You thought  didn't know
You were unwittingly quite helpful; without you Mr
Demidov might have escaped justice
He turns to Jones with a smile
(') After all, Demidov wasn't a target of this investigation, was he
Ackerman walks over to the window as Quinn is led away
'  - Cara and Frank walk toward the canal in the street below
approaches
101
There's something  don't understand
how did Pearce manage to get here and open that safe without anybody noticing
And where did he go
Ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his back
For the briefest of moments, Frank looks back up at him and their eyes connect
Frank gives him a little smile
Cara takes his arm to climb onto the boat
:   his eyes narrow
He knows
For a moment he doesn't move
Then, in spite of himself, a small smile creeps over his face too
Because Pearce was cleverer than all of us
: - Cara and Frank step on board
The  starts the engine
He turns to
that he is the "" we've seen throughout the movie
He and Frank look at one another for a moment
$20 million dollars worth of surgery and that's the face you chose
(English accent) It's good to see you too
They embrace warmly
Cara is in disbelief, realizing just how completely Frank/Alexander has planned things out
She casts one last glance backwards
102
You really think they'll just give up
The Americans have their money left it all for them
What about Demidov's money
Well
(smiles) You have to save something for your pension
The Englishman opens the door to the cabin for them
bottle of Crystal Champagne and two glasses are set out for them
Frank leads Cara in and offers her a glass
Instead, she slips into his arms and presses against him
They begin to kiss
discreetly behind as they pull away from us, the water taxi swinging out into the Grand Canal
As it recedes from view, the vaporetto's tail lamps shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of Venice
a city for lovers
