Written by Michael Brandt & Derek Haas 12/1/2005 : the face of  , 25,
(
) Six weeks ago,  was ordinary and pathetic
His wry smile gives way to
Black
And then
' - The     , pointing straight down, overlooking a table of twenty-five people dressed in business casual, pretending to have a good time at lunch in
this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant
At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in
front of Wesley,'and the   descending directly for it, slowly, as we hear
(
) It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant there was a certain amount of inter- office pressure to go to Appleby's and sit at a table of twenty-five with my boss Janice presiding at the head even though she's too tight to pick up the bill
Which meant, the poor bastard waiting on us had to split the check twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf, no less -- don't do us any favors, Rochelle
Anyway,  ate a plate of extreme nachos and then polished off a bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single- handedly
The   in the bowl of spinach dip and we
: '  - where Wesley drops his head down on his desk
2
so by the time  got back to my cubicle, my eyelids were so damn heavy, had to put my head down, even if it was just for a wink
: - sharply dressed man,
, wearing a dark
Armani suit, enters a skyscraper through the lobby
He's a shade taller than most of the office workers who are coming and going
- He heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top floor
And as his finger presses the button, just where the thumb meets the forefinger, we see a  of a three- headed dog
Soon
- the doors open again and he finds himself in an opulent corridor -- sleek and expensively designed
Only one office is at the end of the hall
Expressionless, he makes his way toward it
Without knocking, he steps inside
'  - an office fit for a king
Or a queen
Because behind a glass desk sits a beautiful Indian woman dressed traditionally in a serape, with a red bindi on her forehead, the holy third eye
Her name is
Mr
sits in the single chair opposite her
After a moment, Puja looks up
didn't expect for you yourself to come
One of the heads, in the flesh
You're an important fence
3
'm flattered
She reaches over to an attacha case and removes a file
(') The name of the target is Henry Helms
Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a few feet away from Mr
, who rises so that they are both standing
She really is quite beautiful, exotic even,
with piercing eyes
(') He's a journalist who stumbled on to a story exposing a lot of powerful people, people who don't like having their power threatened
x Poor Helms
There
have been five attempts on his life, but he has been well protected
and well hidden
Turns out his wife's family has a lot of money
He's in town to accept an award
We'll see to it that it never makes his mantle
And for that, my clients will pay handsomely
Mr
is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens
he notices that the red bindi on he r forehead tarts to move a little, like a second dot is trying to emerge from it, like an amoeba splitting
It's a sh hooter's laser
His eyes go wide as saucers
x DOWN1
1 but it's too late as bullets rip into her head
splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet bar

Mr
crouches, drops his hands behind his back, and a
-- as technologically advanced as anything we've ever seen -- spring into his hands
The bullets
stop flying and he sprints at the window from which they came, smashing t rough what remains of it, disappearing from the demolished room
all this as Puja's dead body hits the floor, blood seeping out of that holy third eye
-    - Mr
's momentum carries him from one building to the next, over an alleyway, the wet-concrete shining below
He lands on the
: and rolls up quickly, guns ready
His eyes spot   running and ducking for cover on the neighboring rooftop
and on a dead sprint across the roof
he spots about a    sticking out from around an air-conditioning vent
He fiKes the his left band
The bullet flies through the air and rockets into the flesh
which happens to be one of the marksmen's ears
The guy    and falls back from the vent, exposing himself
That's all Mr
needs, and another shot rings out while he's still on a dead run
The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead, silencing him, just as
Mr
ducks behind a stairwell door
He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r screen
It actually shows the heat signatures of the three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed
second marksmen is just on the other side of the stairwell
The third is on the far side of the rooftop
Mr
takes another look at the heat signature of the marksman hiding behind the shed and he  his gun
5
/~, then does an amazing thing: in the split second that the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the side
actually steering the bullet around the wall and into the ksman's throat
Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of aluminum off the top of the stairwell
which causes it to flip up in the air above the head of the hiding marksman
the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,
,sending the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the marksman's heads As he falls
the   is breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades
all chopped down in a matter of seconds
He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up
() 'mon, c'mon, c'mon
He looks out at the stairwell door
and all is quiet
Maybe Mr
didn't know he was there, maybe he left, maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all
() Okay
okay
He finally decides
and takes one step forward
THWAP1
1  bullet disintegrates his knee
He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr
walks toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a hunter over his prey
Mr
's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist, pinning it away from his dropped weapon
() Who sent you
6
For a moment, we're not sure the last marksman's going
to answer
Then
() We're
we're just the decoys, man
We were paid to get you out here
The marksman points at a small   sitting on the roof, relaying their every move
Mr
's face falls as
those words register, and just then
over thetreets of the city, block after block in the blink of any eye
until it reaches a rooftop, over a mile away
: man named  is in a crouch, holding a massive pointed upward, at an angle
small  on Cross' gun shows the scene from the roof, along with various elemental measurements: wind speed, pressure, temperature, distance, altitude
the information on __the reflects off of Cross' eyeball as he processes,,the shot
a quick adjustment to the gun and a slight pull of the trigger
We follow the arcing bullet back over the rooftops in an instant
Somehow it keeps it's elevation and it's path
to the resigned look on Mr
's face: an outsmarted man, a dead man
The bullet hits him square in the chest, and he falls to his knees, then slumps over, dead
Flies start to gather as he lies there
First one, then two, then several as night - to day
- and two pairs of legs approach the dead body of Mr
7
The first set belong to an older man, , who looks
like he has seen his share of death
The other set belong to the hottest black woman on the planet,
As they look down at the dead body
It was a set-up all the way
Sloan just nods
He then stoops down, shoos some of the flies away with the back of his hand and picks up the file that Puja gave Mr
The    on the back of Sloan's hand as he reads the file
It, too, has the tattoo pf the three- headed do q, in the same spot as Mr
(') (re: the dead body) That's two heads in two weeks
Which leaves only one: you
Sloan nods
He wants out
And killing all three heads gets him that
Sloan nods again
(') Well,  don't know if we have anyone who can stop him
Sloan squints back up at Fox
There's one person who can
Yeah
Who
And with that, we

'  - Wesley Gibson, the guy from the opening scene, fast asleep in his little cubicle
Some drool falls off his lip and 'erks h' awake
Just then, the shot -, and we see , his fat boss  caught in mid- stride coming toward him, looking like she's ready to bring the wrath of God
(
) My name is Wesley Gibson
If you look at the corner of my desk, you'll see the billing reports  was supposed to hand in to Janice an hour ago
The   is highlighted on the screen for just a moment
then the movie  normal speed and Janice reaches Wesley's cube in no time
Oh my fucking god  hope that's not my billing report sitting on your fucking desk
Holy shit on an altar, it isl couple of the other   look up at the fireworks and smile
like they're actually enjoying Janice's histrionics
(') why don't you just take a dump in your hands, fork it over to me and say, "this is the best effort 'm gonna give to you, Janice
This is the best you're ever gonna get out of me
" Hell, Rochelle on her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than your lazy ass and she's already left for the day
Je-sus
Wesley looks like he'd rather be anywhere else
meant to
(imitating him) meant to
meant to
Well  meant to be a size four but meaning to doesn't pick no cotton
9
She snatches up the report off his desk
(') Tell you what
'll just input the four- ones myself
() Look everyone, 'm gonna do Wesley's four- ones for him
don't have enough to do with my own damn job so 'll do Wesley's too
Wesley grabs the report back
'll do it
Minimum for the maximum
That's all you ever do
The minimum you can do to suck the maximum from this company
said 'll get it done
'm sorry
No, you're worthless
'm the one who's sorry  hired you
She storms away, fuming
Wesley looks over and sees some of the other workers still staring at him, amused
He sits back down to the semi-privacy of his little cubicle
: - in a suit is droning on and on in front of a nifty power-point presentation
The    to reveal Wesley, bored to tears, sitting at a long table with Janice and other corporate minions
The   Wesley's note-pad where it looks like he's taking notes on the presentation
Instead, covering every inch of the page, is the phrase "life sucks then you die
" 10
(
) My job title is Account Manager
used to be called an Account Service Representative, but a consultant told us we needed to "manage" our clients and not " service- them
Onemore "life sucks then you die
" (

) (') have a girlfriend whom  neither manage nor service
: '  - Wesley's  is currently riding some guy named on her living room
couch
She's not very attractive, sort of plain and ordinary
(

) Her name's Cathy
She works at Banana Republic
The guy she's humping is my best friend, Barry
She's giving it her best
As her  reach a crescendo, we
: - Wesley is still sitting there with his note pad, while the consultant continues to rattle on and on about God knows what
Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley can spot his company
's hot intern, , talking on the phone
He zeroes in on her, until
Wesley suddenly looks around the room and everyone ijL_ staring at him
() Yes
Uh
Well the 602 deals with applications sent by prospective clients and the 603 is when the client is
Everyone is still just staring
11
(') 'm sorry, Jesus
uh
what was the question
asked you about the effects of net investment income with regards to underwriting cycles
Well, that's the thing
- What's the thing
(trying to redeem himself) Cycles
Hard market, industry-wide cycles differ from our firm's cycles so think it's amistake to apply
Good God a'mighty
Son
everyone knows that net investment income is inversely related to both premium and loss reserves, making firm cycles inherently dependent on industry cycles
Everyone snickers
(') In fact, to prove my point, 'd like you to spend some time this afternoon adding up the yearly differential responses
Get it to me by five
Sure
Wesley jots down on his pad: " ," and underneath it: "Differential responses
then you die
" He underlines it three times
- Wesley sits at a small round table by himself, eating a ham and cheese on white
12
group of
other  sit at a table nearby, gossiping and guffawing about whatever shit they have to discuss
(
) There are people, everyday you meet them, who you wish could see you in a different setting, a different place
Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and starts fishing through the refrigerator
(
0
) (') instead of where you are, what you've become
Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at his table
Nicole turns and smiles at Wesley, starts to head his way, when
Nicole
Get your ass over here and
tell us what the hell is going on with you and Whitcock the big cock
He pulls a chair over from next to Wesley to make room for her at his table
Wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich
'  - Wesley is staring, at his monitor
(
0
) And you wish to god your eyeballs weren't being sucked out of their sockets by monitor fatigue
That you didn't spend five years in college to do goddamn differential responses
see that he is actually i>laying solitaire on the computer
He keeps checking over his shoulder for Janice, but she is talking on the phone in her office with the door shut
He looks up and watches the computer clock turn from 4:59 to 5:00
He saves his solitaire game and then turns off the computer, snatches up his jacket, waits for Janice to turn her back to him as she is engrossed in her call, and then sneaks away
- Wesley presses the down button and waits
13
'mon, c'mon
After an eternity, the doors open
(') But at least at the end
of the day
Wesley steps in and turns around
Before the doors close, he sees his boss Janice down the hall, looking at him
She checks her watch and looks back at him, pissed
(') () you know that tomorrow it's going to start all over again
and then the doors close
- Wesley pedals a ten-speed down a busy street
It's raining, and he squints to keep the water out of his eyes
- He stands nervously at an  machine
He checks to see if anyone is looking, and then hits the "check balance" button
message comes up: "You have $47
92 in your account
Would you like another transaction
" He clicks "yes" and then "quick cash" and waits for the $40 to dispense
'  - Wesley enters, toting his bike, only to find Cathy and Barry laughing on the couch, watching some crap on television
He's two steps in the door when
Where's the spaghetti
What
14
specifically told you to get noodles on your way home
God, Wesley,  already put the sauce on
Sorry
Iadidn't
You didn't listen is what you didn't
- might as well talk to the wall
'll be right back
He turns around
'  - He starts to head away when Barry pokes his head out of the apartment door
() You want me to go with you, buddy
What a dick
Wesley doesn't turn around, defeated
got it
- He's back on the ten-speed, pedaling again in the rain,
a pissed expression on his face
(
) My parents both died when  was born
He grits his teeth as we

) The nutjobs  had as foster parents thought any book that didn't contain a red-letter edition was the spawn of the devil

) so  had to hide my stash like it was a bag of many jane
Stuck in a hole is a copy of

) (') and God told her to beat me with it
Young Wesley takes a beating, , ,
his face screws up, taking the blows
(
0
) (') But despite them,  thought  was gonna be something special
: - that same expression is plastered on Wesley's face as he pedals
He banks the bike up a curb and into a grocery store parking lot
Across the street, a man watches from behind the wheel of a 171 Chevy Chevelle
In fact, it's Cross, the man we last saw assassinating Mr
on the rooftop
He watches Wesley park the bike and move into the store
-   - Wesley stands, looking over all the different kinds of noodles
None of them just say "spaghetti
" 16
Suddenly, a woman's voice pops up behind-him
There is a remedy for all things but death
She said it so fast he's not sure he heard it right
He turns and sees the-hottest zQZM ever to ace Kroger's aisles: ox
She's wearing barely enough clothing to cover her tight body
(like he
didn't hear) 'm sorry
You apologize too much
(stammers again) Sorry
She looks him in the eye
Spina bifida babies have more backbone than you
With that, she walks toward the end of the aisle, eyes scanning the whole time
Stunned, all Wesley can do is watch her walk
on the sMll f her back is a tatt It' tattoo we saw in the be i n n : a thKee-head2d dog
She gets to the end and catches him looking at her
Then she makes a very subtle gesture with her head
as if to say "come here
" Wesley still isn't sure what the hell is going on
Sheepishly, he makes his way to where she stands
She leans in close, her lips just inches from his ear
(') knew your father
Whatever Wesley was expecting_ it wasn't that
He pulls back from her
17
think you got the wrong guy
Can't say that  agree with you, Wesley
(running it all together) What is this
How d'you know my name
Your father
My father died in a car wreck the week was born
,Your father died two days ago on the rooftop
of the Metropolitan Building
For a moment, just a moment, Wesley is stunned, but Fox just keeps sizing him up
(') He'd be damn disappointed in what you've become, too
Wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture
Lady
've been called a lot of things, but "lady" ain't one of 'em
Wesley starts to talk but Fox interrupts him
(') Damn, Wesley, how d'you ever learn anything when you won't keep your mouth shut and your ears open
'm trying to tell you about your father
Wesley starts to open his mouth again, but then closes it
He waits
(') Your father, Wesley, wits the greataz sit assassin to ever live
Your father, Wesley, worked for the Fraternity
is
The Fraternity
(keeps right on going) Your father, Wesley, was set up and gunned down by a man he used to consider a friend
And your father, Wesley
Suddenly, s raises her hands and- fist' two blgck (') taught me everything  know
Wesley takes a step back
() What is this
This is what you've dreamt about all your life
Just then, Cross o s the corner to t e' e also fisting a Da'r of alms
Wesley's eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing,
: forcing Cross to take cover on the far side of the aisle
(') Move
Now
She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a killing machine
They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle explodes in an avalanche of bullets
Glass bottles of spaghetti sauce shatter, turning the aisle into a rainstorm of red droplets -- we're not sure what is sauce and what is blood
Then
Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas and up to the top of the freezer section, so he can have a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley
He starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section, smashing over styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely miss Fox and Wesley, but slam into the freezers behind them, sending ice and glass exploding everywhere
19
But Wesley and Fox are too quick
She still has a
hold of Wesley's wrist and she propels him through the swinging doors of the stock room
-
- There is a cherry red  convertible parked right next to the store
Wesley is still trying to figure out what the hell is going on as Fox tosses him the ke
Drive
What
But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and ready, as Wesley's legs
somehow take over and he hops behind the wheel
Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner, practically going up on two tires
Wham
Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck when it launches forward
He races through the gears and rips around a corner and out into traffic
(') Where are we going
Just drive
The Chevelle stays on his tail behind them; Cross drives and fires his Glock at the same time
Bam
Bam
Sam
Fox does her best to send bullets back his way, while Wesley mans the wheel, breathing hard, still stunned at what is happening
He spots a side-street
Hold on
whips the car into a rubber-squealing turn
20
- and ends up going the wrong way down a narrow one-way street
He now has to weave in and out of cars headed right for them, as Cross stays tight on their ass
Horns are  in his face, but Wesley somehow keeps the
Ferrari on all four tires as he bobs in'and out of the paths of oncoming cars
4  4 Chevy Pickup is headed like a missile right at them
Wesley's eyes go wide
Truck
Go around it
No
Shoot the tires
Fox looks at Wesley, momentarily stunned by his idea, then spins and fires away at the oncoming truck
The front tires on the truck explode and the truck veers hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk
,,, hat sends it into a violent roll
Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips forward
right over their car
Wesley watches it fly over them, amazed his idea worked
when finally it  down into the street between them and Cross's Chevellel Cross is forced to slam on his brakes and slide out
but it's too late
his Chevelle smashes into the 4  4 before skidding to a stop, a tangled mess in the street
Wesley snaps back to reality and rips the Ferrari off the one-way street and down a side street
- He pulls the car to a stop, then looks over at Fox, amazed
21
() There's a lot of things you don't know about yourself, Wesley
Who was that
That
was the man who killed your father
And now he's trying to kill you
Wesley forces a laugh, but right now it's hard to paint any-thing as ludicrous
No
mean
told you my father died when  was a baby
She leans right into his face so that their noses are only inches apart
Have you ever believed that
Have you ever been content with that answer
Wesley stops, not sure of anything right now
(') Today's your new birthday, Wesley
Drive
He settles back in his seat and pops the clutch again, this time, easing
a little more respectably into traffic
- The Ferrari cruises to a stop outside a warehouse
The people  work with
we believe your father passed his skills on genetically to you
You knew how to handle the car, you knew to shoot at the truck
It's that confidence we're gonna need to work on
Wesley is still dazed
22
(') Now  want you to look at me and tell me something
And  want you to be honest with me
What
Do you think  look fat in this outfit
What
thought so
Let's go
She hops out
They walk inside a
- t where Mr
Sloan stands next to a hucre man, , who is slicing beef off of hanging cow ca f es
There are flies buzzing around and blood draining into the center of the floor
If Wesley wasn't nervous before, he is now
Mr
Sloan
The Butcher looks up from his work and lays down the knife, right next to where Mr
Sloan has a pair of silver pistols and a magnifying glass resting on a rolling table
(') () This is Wesley Gibson
He needs his life changed
The Butcher looks him over
We all end up where we belong, don't we
The Butcher snickers
Sloan speaks up
Fox told you about your father
Wesley looks from Sloan to Fox to the Butcher and back to Sloan
23
() Like  told
um
the lady here think you might ha ve me mixed up with someone else
'm just an
um
account serv
uh
that is
account manager
and
my father died
He hesitates
When
They look at him, imploringly, waiting for an answer
guess 'm not sure
Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the gun in Wesley's hand
Shoot the wings off the flies
What
() Shoot
the wings
off the flies
For
the first time, Wesley notices flies buzzing all around
don't
In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun off the rolling table and ',s -pointing it at Weslev's temple
He begins to count
You have three seconds
Three
two
Before he can say one, Wesley reacts
blindly firing the pistol in his hand, indiscriminately, ,
until his finger is just jamming on the trigger over and over
After a moment, he looks up, unsure why he isn't dead
24
Sloan smiles, drops his pistol on the rolling table and picks up the magnifying glass
He stoops down and signals Wesley to do the same
: Four flies lie on - the floor
crawling o d
their wings actually separated from their bodies
: Wesley jerks upright, trying to process this
Like  said, you got the skills
And after we fine tune those skills
His eyes lock on to Wesley's, holding them in a vice-like grip
(') you're going to hunt the man who killed Your father
Wesley is as stunned as we've ever seen him
he blinks a couple of times
(') Walk with me
He drapes his arm around Wesley and leads him out the door
- Sloan and Wesley move down a busy commercial street
know thin is hard for you to understand, Wesley, but  want you to concentrate on what 'm saying
Your father was a member of the Fraternity, a collection of the most powerful assassins the world has ever known
They weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about on the city streets
Instinctively, people step out of their way
But 've never heard of

We don't advertise Wesley
We blend into the environment like moths against a tree

He also has the tattoo
He's : - Sloan is still walking with Wesley
Wesley watches every face that passes them by
any of them could be Fraternity members
26
until that time when we are called into action
: - The Chef loads plates of food up on the warmer, where a picks them up and delivers them to a group of prominent looking
The lead businessman digs into his steak, and immediately his left arm starts to curl up, like he's having a heart attack
His cohorts look on as he spills over, knocking all the plates off the table, gasping for breath, his throat closed
When the    , the Chef is gone
: - The Gardener works his gardening shears on a hedge in the front of this mansion
, ,
We realize , he's cutting a hole all the way through the hedge
Then, he reaches down into his burlap sack and withdraws a long range rifle with a scope
He pokes the rifle through the freshly-cut hole, looks through the lens, starts to squeeze his trigger
The     to give us an aerial view of the neighborhood
We see that we are in the hills over the city, and across the canyon, a Japanese man is just pulling into his driveway, driving a black Audi, a mile away
He brakes his car, opens his door, but   bullet disintegrates his head and he topples over, never knowing what hit him
Back at the hole in the hedge, we see the Gardener's eyeball looking through from the other side
until it disappears and he is gone
: - The customer takes the gun from the Gunsmith and pays him in cash
27
He then tucks the gun in his belt and walks out the door, like he's a bad-ass, instead of the goombah that he is
He only gets a block before the gun at his waist , causing him to flop on the sidewalk, like he just stepped on a land mine
The bell to the Gun Shop jingles as the Gunsmith leaves and heads in the opposite direction, whistling to himself, not paying attention to the pedestrians running to help the dying Italian
(

) And when the time comes that we are called, death is as certain as the sun
: - Sloan and Wesley enter a normal looking pharmacy
They pass through the small front room and head directly to the back
We have been active for centuries, Wesley
outlasting rulers, governments, nations, kings
We recognize no borders; the entire globe is our killing field
They are buzzed through by  , and enter
- a sophisticated back room, where a trio of flat screen monitors are mounted on the wall
We are the baddest of the bad, the three- headed dog that guards the gates of hell
We show no mercy, we destroy the weak, we have absolute power
() But recently, a fallen angel, one of our own, has challenged that power
The screens in the room come to life with the face of Cross

- Wesley is still absorbing the story, his life so different than when he got up in the morning
Why would you do that
Sloan puts a hand on Wesley's shoulder, gently
Paternally
Your father was like a brother to me
() will do anything to avenge his death
' Sloan turns off the monitors and pulls over a wooden chair from where it rests by a wall
(') So Wesley
you have a choice
Would you like to go back to your job, your girlfriend, your life, just as it was before
() Or would you like to begin your training with an assassin's Fraternity that writes the world's history in blood and bullets
Wesley doesn't know what to say
Sloan moves to a back door

(') () If not, you're welcome to head out this door here and we'll never see each other again
With that
, Sloan leaves through that back door
But
: He stops
He pulls out a gun and waits for Wesley to make his decision, pointing his gun at the door
: Wesley is still standing there, unaware of what is on the other side of the door, thinking, thinking, thinking
He takes a step toward the door
: His boss Janice, yelling at him, mocking him
Wesley hesitates, looks at the chair, then the door again
: His girlfriend on the couch, riding high on Barry, loving every minute of it
Wesley stands frozen, staring hard at the chair as to swirl around him
: The consultant haranguing, the other employees laughing, eating
alone in the break room, riding his bike, all the aspects of his shitty life
as the   to swirl around him, his face going hard
(
) Fuck consultants and fuck action items and fuck differential responses
Fuck it all
He takes a seat in the chair, which creaks when he sits in it
(') (out loud) Fuck it all
: Sloan hears the creak of the chair and lowers his gun
He smiles and walks off down an alley
31
: Wesley waits in the chair for what seems an eternity
starts to bite his thumbnail, nervously
In comes the Pharmacist
The man is built like a mountain, with muscles rippling out of his white smock
He's got a British accent and is extremely polite
'Ah, made your choice, did 'ja, of boy
() Yeah
Very good, very good
He walks behind Wesley
(') The weather's been lovely the last couple o' days-- would you mind putting your hands back here for me
Wesley does, and the Pharmacist binds his hands with some rope
(') There, that's it
Very good
Is this the beginning of my training
Quite right
The Pharmacist cracks his knuckles and then, He hits Wesley so hard right in the cheek that it almost knocks him out of the chair
What the fuck are
WHANIlM 4
1 The Pharmacist smashes him again
Wesley struggles against the ropes but isn't going anywhere
The Pharmacist rears back
and
keeps hitting him over-and over again until Wesley's eyes roll to the back of his head
32
: (
) You know how when you have a dream and wake up unexpectedly
' A13ARTMENT -  - Wesley jerks awake in his bed
(
) and the dream is still
on the fringe of your brain but you can't quite remember the details
He looks up at his ceiling fan, barely turning, a few blades missing
(
0
) (') But then you see that same old busted ceiling fan over your bed and you are so damn glad it was just a dream
He sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror
His face has been pummeled; it looks like a piece of squashed fruit
(
0
) (') This was nothing like that
- Wesley shoves his  card in the machine and hits the "check balance" button
Which reveals: $100,000
92
Amazed, Wesley takes out a grand, the machine just spitting him money
Smiling, Wesley jumps back on his ten speed and zips into traffic
The s in in wheel of the bicycle turns into
'  - that little spinning wheel on a monitor tbAt indicates your computer stuck
Wesley sits in his cubicle, staring at it
Then
33
What happened to your face
Wesley turns in his chair, surprised
Nicole stands there, looking as pretty as ever, way out of -his league
() uh
got hit by a man much bigger than me
Nicole smiles, flirtatiously
Was this over a girl
Something like that
had no idea you had such a secret life outside of here
She cocks her head and studies him
(') Is there something different about you
Besides the
face
No
Not really
Same old Wesley
don't think so
She puts her hand on top of his; he can only stare at it
this kind of thing just doesn't happen to him
(') You aren't like these people Wesley
've always thought you were different
Would you consider me to be an observant person
What's that mean
Wesley's about to say something, when he spots Janice heading their way
Wesley nods at her and Nicole frowns
34
(') Uh-oh, here comes the wicked bitch of the west
With that, she steps away, just as Janice walks up
Wesley stands to face his boss, as Janice launches into him
Jesus
Fucking Popscile, you don't have time to get me the differential responses but you got time to chitty-chatty with the intern
Why do  even keep you around, Wesley
Well  know one thing, your review is coming up next week and can't wait to start checking me off some boxes
attitude: poor, performance: poor, management skills: poor, works well with others
Wesley just focuses on that mouth
Fat lips over fat gums over yellow teeth
But now all that's coming out of it is
'  Jibberish that goes straight from her larynx to Wesley's ears where it imbeds in the soft flesh of his brain and It's so goddamn loudl if only
if only it would just
() UP11
1111 It's so unbelievably stunning coming out of Wesley's mouth that it hits Janice like a slap in the face
Heads all over the office start to poke out of the tops of their cubicles like gophers coming out of holes
Nicole watches, pleasantly stunned, from a few feet away
Janice looks around, shocked
Wesley likes the way that felt, so
(') Just because you have one single iota of tenuous power, you think you can push everyone around
() 35
(') understand, Janice, that junior high must have been particularly difficult being called Tubby all the time, but that doesn't give you the goddamn right to treat your workers like horseshit
Sure we laugh at you behind your back and sure we know you keep a stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk
Janice looks down at her fingers, which still have a little grape jelly on them
(') and sure everyone takes their lunch an hour before you so we can get an extra hour away from you, and  know that must sting sitting by yourself in the White Castle parking lot every day gnawing on your third burger thinking up ways to humiliate us
Janice's eyes fall to her feet
(') you know, if you weren't such a bitch, we might actually feel sorry for you
As it is,  feel  can speak for the rest of the office when  say
With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending them flying
Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as everyone watches him go, admiration plastered on their faces
The loudmouth from the break-room steps out
That was great dude
He holds up his hand for a high-five, but Wesley just him with a right cross, not breaking stride on his way to the elevators
'  - Wesley flies out the front door, just as Fox's Diablo swings around the corner
What's up, new man
36
You were watching
Never stopped
How'd it feel, saying exactly what you wanted to say
Like  had a gun in my hands
Fox grins as Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on the pedal
The Diablo's tires smoke as she launches it out of there
- They return to the butcher shop
Sides of beef hang from hooks next to a cutting table
The Butcher is sharpening a knife
You need to get used to the blood and the muscle and the meat and the sinew and what a single blade of steel can do to a chunk of flesh
The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of one of the hanging carcasses, then slaps it on the table
(') Take care of him, Butcher
Will do, Fox
The Butcher measures Wesley, then starts to talk in a steady, almost bored voice
(') Remember, it's the body we are killing
Know it like a surgeon
Wesley nods, half disgusted, half enthralled
(') Okay, we'll start at the beginning
To cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-pick style and thrust down behind the clavicle, cutting side to side
He jabs the blade into the beef
and just as he does
37
-  : we smash cut to a  walking to his car just as the Butcher comes up behind him and performs the exact same move he was just demonstrating
Just as quickly, we
-    : and the Butcher performs the next move
- To slice the diaphragm, first whip your wrist into the target's trachea to prevent screaming, then drive the knife at a forty-five degree angle upward just below the rib cage
Just as the knife hits the side of beef, we smash cut to
-   : a   coming out of his hotel bathroom wearing a bathrobe
Suddenly the Butcher is on him, performing what he just described on this poor bastard, who can no longer scream because he's missing his trachea, and just as quickly
-    : we are right back to the hanging side of beef as the Butcher performs the next move
If you want the jugular, pull your enemy's head to the left and jab your knife well into his sterno-cleio- mastoideus muscle, here, then cut down and left
Just like before, we smash cut to
-  : a  moseying down an alley, carrying a briefcase, when suddenly, the Butcher comes out of nowhere, pulls the enemy's head to the left and then
, jabs the knife into the neck, matching the move-he was just demonstrating
38
7  -    : The butcher continues to hack away at the hanging meat, describing more and more ways to kill with a blade
(
) They never show you this shit on the McDonald's commercials
as the   Wesley, who is completely absorbed in the lesson
The Butcher hands him the knife, and Wesley starts to make his first chops at it, wanting to please the Butcher, wanting to get it right
- Fox is seated at a small outdoor cafe, sipping on a latte, reading the paper
There's a story about the death threats to Henry Helms on the front page
Just then Wesley approaches, his face splattered with flecks of blood
She wipes his face with a napkin
You haven't quite figured out this whole "blending in" thing, yet
Let's go
- huge Chevy 4X4 pulls up and Fox hope out from behind the wheel, followed by Wesley
They get to the door and Fox pulls out a metal device to pick the lock
What is this
This
She picks the lock and they step inside
- the empty morgue examining room
Empty except for a d d ozen dead b s laid out on slabs, covered by white sheets
This is the Roach Motel, Wesley
Wesley looks around, disgusted
39
(') All right, find us some skinny bitches
Wesley uncovers the first body
it's a
black male
(') Nahh, let the brother rest
Find us some white meat
And nothing too fat
Wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second body
He unveils it to reveal
what looks like a dead suburban housewife
(') Perfect
Load up soccer mom
- Fox and Sloan stand next to a paper target -- the kind of thing you see in a police target range
It shows the outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for where you're supposed to aim
The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper target
Sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom and target to the end of the range
The    to show Wesley is with them standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite end of the range
Selecting your weapon and then disposing of it is the most pivotal aspect of every assassination
An array of firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley
(') Pick one
Wesley eyes all the weaponry
Finally, he settles on a short-barreled black handgun
Sloan takes it from him and inspects it
(') Excellent
This is an Imanishi 18
It holds seventeen bullets in the clip and one in the chamber
It's made of a composite material unrecognizable by metal detectors
() 40
(') And the Imanishi's bullets have microchips that communicate with similar ones in the gun
Computer chips
() Sometimes the closest distance between two points is not a straight line
What if soccer mom here is between you and your target
suppose you're going to tell me to shoot her first
How'd you do in Physics class
Mostly 's
Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying
(') Okay,  got a
Why
couldn't remember all the rules -- That's it
Rules
What if  told you there weren't any
He nods at Wesley, like he's on to something
(') People live by the rules set before them
We take them on faith that they are right
But how many times in your life have you thought you had a better way, against-the rules that was simply laughed at
Every day
41
Because you use your brain differently than other people
All Fraternity members do
don't get it
Humans use neurons to think
But most people can only handle a small percentage of those neurons firing at once without suffering a seizure or an aneurism
Not us
And not you
We have the ability to think differently than other people
So we set our own rules
That's right
Sloan hands him back the weapon
(' Try it
Wesley aims the pistol at the target in front of him
He and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the shoulder
(') Have you ever shot a gun before
Just the flies
So you have no pre-conceived habits we need to break
Shoot the target
Don't hit mom
You mean curve the bullet
How
This isn't about "how
" It's about "what
" If you'd never been told a bullet flies straight and  handed you this and said hit that target
what would you do
Allow your instincts to guide you
Just like the flies
() 42
(') The technology is only here to assist your natural instinct
Wesley lifts the gun, his mind racing
(') It's not 'will' that makes the physical react how we wish, it's 'control
' You are in control
The bullets blast out of the gun, like they are on a track set up by Wesley's brain
He flicks his wrists and
they arc qUickly, Just missing the body i e th2 center of the target
Sloan smiles
(') Rules are made to be broken, Wesley
No one was better at that than your father
He had a pair of pearl-handled revolvers with which he could conduct a symphony
i Wesley nods proudly, and squeezes off some more shots, all chasing through the same hole in the target
: '  - Cathy jumps up from the couch when Wesley comes in
Oh my god, Wesley, where have you been
've been so worried
But Wesley just pushes past her and starts to throw clothes out of drawers into a black duffel bag
(') What're you doing
Are you leaving
You owe rent
But Wesley just keeps packing
(') You can't leave
This is bullshit, Wesley
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
43
Wesley just zips up his bag and turns back toward the door
where Egx is now standing, wearing outf' that would make the devil blush
(') Who the fuck are you
But Fox doesn't even acknowledge her presence, and just watches Wesley do his business
Wesley walks out the door and Fox follows
Cathy chases them out on to the landing
(') You're nothing, Wesley
And you will always be nothing
You think you're gonna be happy
with that skank
Uh-oh
Fox stops and turns around -- fisting her pistols
She unloads
The     , who is about to pies herself, standing in the door frame, with bullet holes placed expertly around her head
Wesley and Fox keep moving, down the steps
Barry is coming up the steps, but he takes one look at them, does a -turn and hurries out of their path
'  - Wesley tosses his bag into the corner of this immaculately furnished penthouse apartment, overlooking the skyline
You can take the couch until we find you someplace better
Okay
She moves toward a separate bedroom
(') Fox
She stops
44
(') What was my father like
For a moment, she thinks about it
Then
Come on
- They walk down a downtown lane, buildings crowding in on them from all-sides
Not too many people are out this late; they have the sidewalk to themselves
Your father lov ed you, Wesley
He talked about you all the time
Really
Wesley looks at her hopefully
She smiles, thinking about the past
That's a fact
He knew he wasn't supposed to, but he couldn't help it
You worked with him
() He trained me
Made me what  am
: -  - younger, greener Fox stands alone in the alley, eyes scanning the rooftops
(
0
) remember one night he had me on my own for the first time, and  was tagging this target named Buster Burgess
But was green and clumsy and stupid
Buster marked me and disappeared into this old tenement building
45
(-
-  - shadowy figure creeps to the edge of the building and looks down
We can't quite make out his face
Fox is looking the other way and he's got a clean shot
He raises a rifle to his eye
He nails Fox in the thigh, and she falls helpless to the pavement
(
0
) Motherfucker shot mein the leg
Put a damn hole in my favorite skirt
The figure re-aims, ready to take out the helpless Fox
(
0
) (') Then you know what happened
(
0
) My father saved your life
Put a bullet in Burgess
k, (
0
) Naww
ended up with four more slugs in me
The figure unleashes four more shots
: - They turn a corner and head up into the lobby of a tall building, their conversation continuing
What kind of training is that
'm here, aren't
: Wesley weighs all this, puts it together
My father was Burgess, wasn't he
Fox nods, smiling
They step
46
: andstart riding it up
He didn't hit me anywhere important, and he used pin-shot bullets that didn't do any real damage
But you can be damn sure  don't let any mark get the high ground on me again
Shesmiles at another thought
(') And you know what we did instead of go to the hospital to stitch me up
What
We went driving
: --  - sits on the corner
black 911 convertible breaks through the glass and skids to a stop next to Fox in the street
Two hands pull her up and drop her in the passenger seat, and the car roars off
: -- Wesley smiles
The elevator
- Fox and Wesley step out on to the rooftop where Mr
was gunned down
What's this
This is where your father was killed
Wesley's eyes narrow and he looks around, taking it all in
47
How
We're not sure
The fence he was meeting was shot in the head
which led him out to here
but it must've been a set-up all along
All  know is it would take a hell of a trap to bring your father down
Wesley crouches down by where his father's body would have been, running his fingers over the gravel rooftop
My whole life  thought he was dead shouldn't feel any differently just because it happened 20 years later
But
But,  do
Like  missed my one chance
Well that's why you're here
To make up for lost time
Wesley looks back at her
Can  see his body
: - They stand in a dark corner of a decrepit morgue, where a couple of urns rest on a counter
The place doesn't look like much more than a crack-house
We cremate our dead
'd like to say it's to honor them, but it's mainly to keep anyone from identifying them after they're gone
These are my father's ashes
Yeah
48
Sloan said his heart stopped but there was no entry wound
That's right
Can  have a minute
Sure
She leaves and Wesley approaches the urn holding his father's'remains
He runs his finger over it, and just when we think he's going to have an emotional moment
' he smashes the urn on to the stand, the ashes spilling out everywhere
Wesley runs his fingers through the decay: what a mess
there are pieces of bone intermingled in the cremains
But then hisfingegs find something in the dust
a with a hole running down its center
He holds it up to the light for a closer look
As he studies it, we start to hear
- Wesley site with his hands tied behind his back, taking another beating from The Pharmacist, who spouts assassination techniques while he pummels Wesley
If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one and find yourself the one, remember that each foe will likely move at the same steady speed away from each other, allowing you to keep a gun on each
(') Now, if you find yourself one ' on three, that poses a real bit a' ball ache
49
The sound of the Pharmacist's voice fades to the background as Wesley's voice-over comes up
(
0
) There are two kinds of pain
One is an object
living thing that crawls around the outside of your body
Cuts, broken bones, bruises
all deliver the kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and they soon disappear to nothing but the sound of a gnat in your ear
Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness
(
0
) (') 've lived with a different kind of pain all my life
the kind that comes from two decades of being passed over, pushed around, ignored
But you can't hide from that kind of pain either
Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face
(
0
) (') because it finds you
He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his head
- Sloan sits across from Wesley at a skinny table in an otherwise bare room
Watch the eyes
Look for a slight swelling of the pupil
You can train your body to stay a constant temperature, you can control your heartbeat, but you can't control the center of your eyes
That's how you know when someone is lying to you
Sloan looks right at him
Wesley narrows his eyes, trying to fend off his stare
(') Do you want to fuck Fox
No
50
know that's a lie without even seeing your eyes
Fine
Try something else
Okay
What are you hiding from me
Wesley looks down, then focuses on Sloan
Nothing
Sloan waits
Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep something from this man
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center
places it on the table
(') You told me to hunt down my father's killer
That's what 'm doing
What's this
The bullet that killed him
You said his heart stopped but there was no entrance wound
This bullet has a hole cut into its center
Yes
You know how a mole buries into the earth by pushing the dirt back around it think this bullet does what the mole does
Splits the skin and pushes it back through its center, filling the space it just passed through
Sloan looks at him, like he might have been underestimating him until now
(') Fox was telling me that my father used special bullets
It looks like Cross does too
which means these are custom made
If we find who makes them, then we find someone who has access to Cross
51
Sloan picks up the bullet and leans back
You put this all together on your own
Wesley taps his head
Firing neurons
() Whatever happened to my father's guns
The pearl handled ones
Don't know
But whoever has them isn't long for this place
Sloan reaches down and picks up a binder which he drops on the desk
What's that
Cross
The details of his life
q Continue your hunt
No rules, right
This stops Sloan for a second
No rules
'  - Wesley lies on Fox's couch, trying his damndest not to peek at her through her bedroom door
It's cracked just enough that he can see her draping a towel around her body as she heads to take a shower
Wesley site up and looks at the binder sitting on the table
Slowly he opens it and sees a picture of Cross staring back at him
The man who took Wesley's father from him
Wesley studies the face, wanting to know every detail
52
: Fox peers out the door and looks at Wesley, watching him absorb more of Cross with every page
: - Sloan leads Wesley into a gigantic room lined from floor to ceiling with leather-bound books
We keep a record of every assassination mission, going back to the Ides of March
Maps, diagrams, logistics, complications, weapons of choice
it's all there
Wesley nods, impressed
Sloan just keeps leading him through a set of double doors, into
-- a large room, the size of an auditorium
On the floor is a gigantic model of the entire city, built to scale, showing all the buildings, skyscrapers, churches, the waterfront, the city streets
Everything the city has to offer laid out in miniature
Sloan and Wesley stand like giants in the middle of the model city
What's all this
Where we plot our local hits
This city is one of the Fraternity's major headquarters
(looking around) This room
The books
Seems low-tech
Part of mastering technology is knowing when to use it
Models can't be hacked
Your father built this room himself
Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst them are a few vainted red
Some of the model street lamps are also red
53
The color red appears sporadically throughout the entire model city: on the sides of buildings, on mailboxes, on some of the manhole covers
What's with the red ones
Sloan just smiles
and      , then ' on one particular street on the map, further in on one and we
: - the s city street, now full-sized, buzzing with activity, pedestrians hurrying to work, cars and taxis and trucks whizzing through the street
Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in particular
The Fraternity's grasp reaches every facet of the world's major cities, including their construction
Look at this streetlight
Wesley peers at it
there is a plaque affixed to the pole
the standard thing you find on these things
"Municipal
63070
" But then there is something different on this one
a tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque
the Cerberus instead of the seal of the cit Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside, revealing a hollow space behind it
He reaches his hand inside and pulls out a small handgun
flips out the clip expertly, then racks the weapon
Wesley can't believe it
You have stashes
everywhere
Jesus
54
Just then, two   walk by, eye
the gun Sloan has pulled out
Sir
Sloan flashes his tattoo at them
Keep moving, fellas
They nod and do just that
(') They let us do our jobs, we let them live
on Wesley's face as he realizes the full scope of this organization and we
: : Wesley firing his Imanishi 18 on the shooting range, steering the bullets wherever he wants them to go
Closer
Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the target, making the angle all that much tougher
Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol starts  next to him
He looks over
Sloan is standing nr= &o him, firing at the target
Every shot bends around the body and hits right in the forehead of the target
Wesley smiles, impressed
Wesley thumbs through an old Fraternity book, which has detailed sketches of an assassination in 17th century Paris
Wesley working out on a heavy bag, honing his punches, the Chef holding the bag for him, muscles rippling
Wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature city, trying to memorize where the red marks are
55
Wesley sitting here,
being grilled by Sloan, as he tries to-tell the undetectable lie
Our job isn't just about how fast or true you shoot, Wesley
Physical agility will always lose to mental agility
It's warfare of the mind
'
Wesley looking at Fox through the bedroom door
Wesley working with the Butcher on the art of knife play
The Gardener and Fox show Wesley the rooftop of a certain building on the model city, one corner of the roof painted red
Fox and the Gardener now with Wesley on that actual rooftop, pointing out firing angles, modes
of ascension, and escape routes
The Gardener moves over to a cornerstone in the roof of the building and then easily lifts it off, revealing a stash of assault rifles
k
Wesley looking at some ammunition while the Gunsmith talks and demonstrates
He fires at one of the targets, which  in a splattered mess and we cut to
'  - Fox making coffee as Wesley sits, studying the binder, his mind racing
Cross and my father were tight
But Cross thought he should be one of the heads of the Fraternity so he left and vowed to kill the three heads
Which means my father is dead because of petty jealousy
More reason for Cross to die
Wesley flips to the picture of cross
But  don't see jealousy in those eyes, do you
Fox walks over and slams the binder shut
56
Listen
to me, Wesley
In two weeks, we have to kill Henry Helms
Do-you know who that is
The journalist who's got a price-tag on his head
price-tag that we're going to collect
Your father was meeting with a fence about the job when Cross took him down
So we can only assume Cross knows about the target too
We
you
have to take Cross out before we prosecute this mission
We can't have him out there as a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you understand
Yeah
We've never defaulted on a job and this 1k one won't be the first
- Sloan fires at the target, the bullets following his every command
Wesley does the same, equally skilled
Fox sits, watching the two of them
Is it becoming competitive
One shoots and then the other follows, neither one ever missing
Finally, Gunsmith runs the target back in to change out the body
Fox leans back, impressed
May have found your match, Sloan
Sloan smirks and turns to instruct Wesley
Pick the weapon, make the kill, destroy the weapon
No other rules
Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns
57
(to the Gunsmith) Close the gap
Push the body closer to the target
It's already at four feet
Closer
Here's two
Your father couldn't even do that
Closer
Wesley, at some point -- Closer
'll say when
Gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the body, until it's actually touching the back of the dead business man
How you gonna --
Just run it out there
Let the kid work
The Gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range
Wesley looks at Sloan
You wanna go first
There are limits to everything, Wesley
At some point the body becomes a shield
Wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds, lightning fast
The Gunsmith brings the target back to them
a the business man is riddled with es
guess not every rule can be broken
58
Check the target
The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found it's mark on the target
(') You'll find one entry below the shoulder, missing the major blood vessels there, exiting the back
Second shot went through the abdomen, clipped only the bowel and exited cleanly
Third hit the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, which is partially protected by the ribcage, and passed through the liver and probably part of the gallbladder
Upper left abdomen is a good place, where number four ruptured the spleen before continuing down main street
And finally, what  like to call "the ,7FK
" Number five entered the mouth, was redirected downward by the upper jawbone , and exited the back of the neck
That's the shot you'll find in the middle of the target
Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target
(') (to Sloan) Fuck the rules
With that, he turns and walks away, a look on his face that is his fiercest, a far cry from the kid in the cubicle
That same expression is on his face as we
: - Wesley strains against the ropes that bind his hands as The Pharmacist waylays him
But is t' e
Wesley counts out the punches as he takes the shots
One
There is a look in Wesley's eye we, haven't seen before, a burning, searing fire
As he continues to take punches and count them out
59
(') Two
(
) Three
(
) Four
(
)
(
) he pulls his arms tight, and his muscles start to twitch and bulge -- muscles we didn't know he had until
now -- and as he continues to take punches,
,
, , the rope strains against the wooden chair, and we can  the wooden legs start to pop, until
Wesley Jerks his arms ee and comes swillcrincr with the broken of leg of the chair
The Pharmacist goes down hard and Wesley stands over him, out of control,
furious,
, beating him with that broken chair leg
The    one of the walls
: to where Fox and Sloan are watching Wesley pummel the pummeler through a one-way mirror
He's ready
the los2k on Fox's face becomes more and more and sexual until
'  - she leans on top of Wesley, straddling him on too of her bed
They unleash on each other, and from the looks of it, Fox makes Cathy seem like a nun
Don't you quit now, baby
Don't you quit now
Wesley didn't know it could be like this
After they finish, Fox gets up and heads to the shower and he watches her go the whole way
In the doorway, she turns around
(') Sloan says you're ready
60 - Wesley site in a chair as Fox crouches next to him with an advanced tattoo machine, inking his hand
Do you like being the only chick in the Fraternity
() Who said  was the only sister
Maybe you just haven't met any others yet
Wesley laughs
(playfully back) Maybe  have and 'm just not telling you
() Hold still
He settles down
How did you end up here, Fox
Same way you did, sugar
They found me
What did you do before
Fox looks at him, a wry smile on her face
Sold perfume
At the mall
No shit
No shit
can't see it
Get in line
61
What made them come after you
mean, know why 'm here
Fraternity members all have something in their lineage that shows they'll be good at this
And yours is
My great-great-great-grandfather on my mother's side
He was on a slave ship coming over from East Africa and as it was pulling into Charleston, he killed every white man on the ship and swam to shore
They caught him and hung him four days later
That's terrible
Nah
Motherfucker deserved it
Be raped eight women in those four days
One of them was my great-great-great-grandmama
She pushes her chair back, done with her work
The    as Fox removes the device so we can take a look: the three-headed dog has been tattooed into his hand
- Wesley and Fox walk down a crowded urban city street
The finds Wesley's tattoo and then moves around behind Fox and holds on hers
Where's the Diablo
() got tired of the color
Wesley can't help but smile, then Fox stops
They're standing right in front of a  , displayed in the window is a    911 convertible sitting in a showroom window
'us like the one Wesley's father smashed in Fox's story
62
- Suddenly, the car comes flying out of the window, glass shattering everywhere as it tears up the street
(
0
) Being a member of the Fraternity was like winning the lottery
: Traffic lights mean nothing, as Wesley mashes the accelerator to the mat, and the Porsche responds, ripping up the road like a tiger on the prowl
Fox rises up in the passenger seat, looking over the windshield, the wind whipping her face
(
0
) This
this is what my dad's life was like
He was a fucking god
He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around a corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler, which has to slam on its brakes
(') Where we headed
Trial by fire, sugar
Hook a right
Wesley whips the car around a corner
(') Park it here, baby
He pulls the car to the side of the street
in front of a busy outdoor mall
It's covered with shops, eateries, movie theaters and people, people, people
Fox eyes the crowd
You need a new wardrobe or something
we're here for a reason and it ain't clothes-shopping
Somewhere in that crowd is your first target
63
test
(shakes her head) The real thing
Who's the mark
You'll know him when you see him
What if  don't
Then you get shot
Fox hands him his Imanishi pistol, which Wesley rolls over in his hand
(') It's graduation day, baby
He nods and makes his way toward
: where he quickly mingles with the crowd
He has his hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded- sweatshirt, the pistol inside
People pass him on his left and right, some make eye contact, some don't
anybody could be the target
Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying
the by the theater, the - at The Gap, the -  shopping at the sunglasses stand
And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not expecting to see
Barry, his best friend that was shagging his girlfriend
is thumbing through books outside the
seemingly
not paying attention to what's around him
Wesley can't believe it
It can't be him
Can it
Just then, Barry stops looking at the books and starts walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down
Fuck, this can't really be happening
64
Wesley gets ready, both hands inside that front pocket
and now Barry meets his eyes
still coming
still coming
Wesley
hey dude
Wesley can't believe itl (') Thanks for calling me
wanted to say
Wesley pulls out his gun and Barry throws up his hands
(') Whoa, man
But now we see Wesley is looking past B_arry
over his shoulder
Get down
and he's looking at a man we recognize from his office
The Consultant
He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of pistols
Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger
but it lust , the chamber empty
: : Fox holds the clip to Wesley's Imanishi, tapping it in her hand
Holy shit, she gave him an empty gun
: : Wesley can't believe his gun is empty
In the split- second that it takes him to realize this, the Consultant has his guns leveled, taking aim, but
65
Wesley moves faster than we thought he could move
he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel, and dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street
The Consultant chases after him, knocking shoppers out of the way, sending fanny packs and Nordstrom bags flying
Wesley hooks a right around a   and heads straight down a narrower section, like he's on a mission, knowing exactly where he's going
And now we see why
Because the city around us goes stark white like the Mg Room
We're seeing what Wesley sees, what he's memorized in all those hours staring at the model
Finally we see one   next to a fountain, which is bright red
Immediately the natural color of the city c2 Ws back and Wesley is running all out for that bench
He goes into a slide, hitting the grass
underneath the bench, sliding under it, popping up on the other side
He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does, revealing an
and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming, using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up, surprised and
: The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting him in his two shoulders and his chest
People start  and  the hell away from the gunplay
Wesley is about to run away himself, but when he turns, Fox is right there beside him
smiling couple of   are with her, smiling as well
Wesley looks over at The Consultant, who site up, smiling too, even though he's bleeding from three spots on his body
Pin shot bullets
Wesley looks down at the gun
Just like my father used on you
Fox nods, as the Security Guards go to help the Consultant to his feet
(') You were watching me in the office
66
() Protecting our assets
She hands the clip from the Imanishi over to Wesley
(') Time to do this for real
: Wesley and Fox walk down a long hallway toward a single doorway
They open it, revealing
'  - a large office with a single desk and a roaring fire
Sloan turns from the fire to greet them
He holds up the "mole" bullet, and smiles
The mole bullet is made by a midget t Filipino named Pek War
His fingers are so small that they can shape and smooth the metal better than anyone
You've known all along
You knew before ever broke the urn
had to let you figure it out for yourself
Part of my training
Part of your quest
To get to know your father
() And his killer
Wesley nods, a grave expression on his face, like he knows what he is going to do next
67
(') Pek War charges exorbitant prices, as much as ten-thousand dollars for a single round, but his craftsmanship is unparalleled
He heads over to Wesley, hands him a slip of paper
' (') You can find him at this address
: '   - three-foot-seven-inch Asian man site at a worktable with his little legs dangling over the end of his chair
is concentrating hard on the metal in his hands
The diminutive man looks up from his worktable when he hears a loud
Andey
He gets no answer
He remains perfectly still, listening
(') Andey
l Two louder  and a  jerk his head around
Then he's up out of the chair, faster than we thought a little man could move
Breathing ragged, shimmying across his work space, Pek War hurries over to a chest of drawers
He gets to it and throws open the bottom drawer to reveal a stash of handguns
He reaches for one
but the muzzle off a pistol comes _ uE to the back of his head and the hammer clicks as it is pulled back
Pek War throws his hands up
(') Alam man lamangl Alam man lamangl Wesley signals for him to turn around
After he does
400 68
(') Alam man lamang
Wesley measures him with eyes that have gone hard
Fox stands over Wesley's shoulder, loving every moment of this
Then
There are two things about you 'm sure of right now, little man
One is that you can speak English
Pek War sees that Wesley means business
(perfect English) And what's the other
That my nutsack is bigger than you
Fox snickers
() What do you want
bullet you made killed his father
The bullet maker looks as though he knew a day like this might eventually come
His face falls and he looks
at his feet
only mold the ammunition
cannot be responsible for the way it is
Wesley  him in the face with the butt of his gun, then grabs a long, metal -type tool from the work table
Bullshit
You're as responsible as if you pulled the trigger yourself
() didn't
'm only going to ask you one question and  want you to think very hard how you want to answer
With that, Wesley sticks the stiletto into Pek War's side
OWWW1 Relax
The blade is in only an inch or so
The little man starts jabbering to God in some foreign language
(') See 've learned a thing or two about human anatomy recently
In fact, this blade is stuck just beneath the coastal cartilage of your tenth rib
Just a little push and it will deflate your lung
That's called a pneumothorax
Helluva way to go, suffocating in a'room full of fresh air
Plus the sound, the sound of all that oxygen hissing out of your lung
pssssssh, like a balloon at a birthday party
Enough to make a man beg for a second chance
() But you're only going to have one
Pek War waits, trying not to writhe from the pain
(') So my question is
how do  find Cross
Pek War's eyes go wide, pleading
() My clients use middlemen,  don't meet them in person,  know so little about them
Wesley twitches the handle just a bit
(') Okayl Okayl Dammitl God damiaitl 'll tell you
70
Wesley lets up a little bit
(') Prearranged meets
Fox snatches up a nearby phone
Start prearranging
- The Porsche once again tears across the asphalt, as Wesley drives
Wesley, you gotta know something
No matter what kind of training you've done these last few weeks, killing your first, well that's gonna change you forever
Wesley drives for a while
Then
You know what my foster mother
told me when  was six years old
Fox shakes her head
(') She caught me eating some jello out of the fridge after my bedtime
knew wasn't supposed to but  was so damn hungry, and it was just some fucking jello
Anyway, after she hit me so hard couldn't bite down straight for a week, she told me
she told me that God had killed my parents because  was such a wicked boy
Jesus
Someone needs to find that bitch and set her straight
So  grew up thinking  was the reason never knew my parents
But now, to find out, that no, my father didn't give me up because he had died
he gave me up because he was Protecting me
well guess  want to give him something back
71
Here we are
- They are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one of which has the words Times-Herald on it
Newspaper delivery  make their way in and out of the loading dock area of this building
Overhead, an   scrapes along the worn tracks
Fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley, so they can have a view of the corner in front of them
Wesley scans the area quickly
Not very discreet, are they
Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley is talking about
On various rooftops we-see peering down
looking over the site
The others are only backup singers
This is your show
Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear, crouching down
Just then, out the windshield, they see a  wearing a long black overcoat approaching the corner near the newspaper building
Fox's eyes start to dance
(') Remember: he's good, baby
But you're the best 've ever seen
Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car
: From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back
His steps become quicker, getting closer every passing second
Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his gun
and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning, Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a nearby warehouse
72
His bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves over the edge of the building and finds its mark, causing a crouching  to plunge from the roof to the street near Wesley
The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross disappears into the nearest building, the Times-Herald
Wesley and Fox run toward the building as three other Fraternity members beat them there, the , the , and the
Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then start inside the building
No
The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the dock
Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as screaming  run from the place
We need a way in there
Let's find another door
He'll be long gone by then
(shaking her head) He's got the high ground
Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock
On the pallet
They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the lift
Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching on the pallet on the front
: Once inside
73
Separate
The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await
: The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes, eyes darting, guns drawn
He backs up to a pallet of stacked newspapers, using it as cover
What he doesn't realize is that between each stack of papers is a space, just big enough for a -- bullet finds its way through the space and hits the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him around
: Cross' gun
Another shot and we follow the bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is now leaning
the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the flog
Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs
Just as Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden beam holding back some massive rolls of
The rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way, allowing Cross to escape up the stairs
Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs
: Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing up the morning edition
group of   see the guns the Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety
Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring machines
(to the Waiter) Stay here and cover us
There's no angle for him to hit you if you stay here
Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the machines
74
(') Don't let him get up there
And stay clear of the presses
He'll use them however he can
How do you know
It's what 'd do
With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the machinery
The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a hundred pounds of paper spins through every second
He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that scaffolding
Everything looks clear, until
shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o Waiter's head gives way
He turns to see a bunch of cans of spray lubricant falling to the floor
No big deal, until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it to explode
The burning oil covers the Waiter, who  and stumbles nearer the printing press
More shots from Cross and one of the   on the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half
The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a
saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf
With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the presses
For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes with Wesley
but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep moving
He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically cartwheels away
but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the press near her, sending flying metal everywhere
piece of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg
making her break out of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded
75
Fuuuucckkk
Cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a door
(') Keep goin', baby
Take him
Wesley races for the stairs
He is the only one left to chase Cross to level three
: Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready
The place is already in pandemonium, with  yelling and screaming and running for cover
Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in the business offices of the paper, and it looks surprisingly similar to his old office
Lame-ass cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere
Wesley jumps up on a desk
Cross
Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of the office
Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at Cross
who immediately returns fire
and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets in mid-air
The bullets ricochet and take out a where someone was playing
The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving over and in the cubicles
Cross has a gun similar to the Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each other from sharp angles
Strangely,
the first bullet collision was not blind luck, but the pattern for the battle
They are fighting the same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man using the same techniques at the exact same time
Wesley needs an angle, and spots a    the words "Action Items" written on it
He fires at it, and his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them strikes Cross in the shoulder
Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to flinch
right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby window, smashing the glass out, 76
Wesley doesn't hesitate behind him
he sprints for the same window and dives through it, guns at the ready and
: we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor, firing his guns the whole time
until he lands top of an "" train moving at ll speed
: Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to the Porsche
She ignores her wounds and rips the car out of the alley, chasing after the fleeing  train
: Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train
He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley
but they both have to duck as the  train whips under an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere inches
Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars and enter one of the  cars
: Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his wound
Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also swings down between the cars and enters
: where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way down the center of the empty car and out the back door
Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready
He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing Cross
They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing their guns
77
Wesley kicks Cross off of him, but Cross-spins with two new suns in his hand
Wesley is
on him quick though, and Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough to crack it
With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off
Wesley fires as he falls backwards
Cross falls backwards too from the momentum
and they both smash out opposite windows of the train before landing on either side of it
- But the amazing thing is
they stand up and keep firing as the cars are whipping by at 80mph, and realize they
are timing their shots to actually blast between each car in the s it-second the opening passes
: ride along in blissful ignorance, reading their papers, holding on to the handrails
completely unaware of the gunfight raging outside the train
bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a ' paper, and exits a window on the opposite side of the car
The man sticks his finger through the hole, unaware of the battle outside
What the hell
: On opposite sides of the train, Wesley and Cross are both sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end of the last train, while dodging each other's bullets
as the last car passes, they each jump on the tracks, ending u with guns tucked under each other's chin
Wesley
This takes Wesley aback
(') Look into my eyes
Wesley's finger is starting to squeeze his trigger
as is Cross's
(') (growls, in pain) Look into my eyes, goddammit
78
Finally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees himself reflected in Cross's Dupils
Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards away, and her headlights illuminate them
Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing: he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground
Wesley can't believe Cross would leave himself defenseless
Moving swiftly, Cross men tucks something into the Rocket of Wesley's hooded sweatshirt
(') () Everything they told you was a lie, Wesley
With that
Cross falls down
His black jacket spills open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder, but to hig n too
one of Wesley's bullets through the train must have found its mark
Cross is bleeding profusely
He gasps a couple of times
then, with his last bit of energy
(') Find the missing piece
And
don't
let them
dispose of the weapon
With that, the life goes out of Cross's eyes
Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some meaning there
But Cross just stares blankly back at him, just as Fox comes limping up
You did it, baby
Son of a bitch, you did it
You put down motherfucking Cross
Wesley looks down and sees some of Cross's blood on his hands from their clench
There is also some on the gun he is holding
ar --h d ed crun
Wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl-handled gun from where it dropped and looks over them both
(') What'd he say to you
Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's eyes
He looks back down at Cross's body
79
He said
he said 'pies on the Fraternity
' Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the whole story
Finally, she nods
Well
damn,  couldn't be more proud of you, baby
Let's go lay this on Sloan
Yeah, sure
What's wrong
think  need
a minute to myself
() Sure
It's your first kill
'll wait for you
Naah, that's all right
You need to get stitched up
'll meet you at that Korean place
You sure
But he's already walking off
She watches him go, thinking
: - Wesley walks down the street
instinctively get out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk
Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket: a beaten-up copy of
In fact, there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid
Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the cover
printed on the inside in a steady hand are the words: " left you something
" Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a Harley at a curb
He bee-lines for the guy
80
- Wesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to its limits
His angry expression hasn't dissipated
- The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the kind you might find in any run-down suburb
Kids run around the neighborhood, playing
: Wesley sits and looks at one particular house
He climbs off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying his book
: He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down the side of the house
until he finds a familiar wooden
Familiar because we've seen this place before: it's where he lived when he was a foster kid
He removes the board, then reaches into the hole
His hand seizes on something
From the hole, he withdraws a attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North Highbury St
Wesley's eyes move from the copy of  , to the key, and back to the book
Finally, he lowers his hands
revealing a little eight- year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard
Hey
Hey
You live here
The kid
nods
(') Foster home
4014 The kid nods again
81
(') Read this
He tosses the kid the book and heads off
- He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key
Across the street, the address matches: 1850
Highbury
The place looks like a concrete fortress
no windows, just a large-iron door in front
Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean
He gets to the door, looking for a key-hole, but he doesn't find one
He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then
the door opens, revealing a woman,
She takes a look at Wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her lips
Come in, Wesley
He stares at her, trying to figure this out
He steps
: and finds that the place is nicely decorated; an attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced bunker
Anna is now trying to hold back tears, but can't
He's dead, isn't he
There's no point lying to this woman
Yes, ma'am
She nods knowingly, sadly
He told me if he didn't come back
it would be you who pulled the trigger
a He killed my father
82
Anna looks at him, confused
But then, realization sets in
think you need to meet someone
she leads Wesley into another room, where a five-year-old boy, plays the floor
(') Wesley
This is your brother
Andrew
Wesley's not sure what to make of this
My brother
Half-brother
But both of you, you are both 100 percent your
father's boys
've seen that from the beginning
Andrew is busy playing with a couple of on the floor
Wesley studies the little guy, still confused
(') Your father
he was with you the whole time
Wesley looks up and sees what she's referring to
The walls are filled with pictures of Andrew, Anna, and
remarkably
photoaraths of Wesley at various ages w hgn he was- growing u
(') This was his favorite
She hands him a picture of Wesley at about age 12, sitting with his back to a tree, reading The picture has been taken through a windshield, across the street
Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against one of the walls
: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery store
But now we see that Fox positioned Wesley between herself and the shooter
He wasn't trying to hit Wesley, he was trying to separate him from her
83
Wesley, thinking, remembering
: Wesley studying Cross's face in the file, seeing that there isn't jealousy in those eyes
Wesley still slumped against the wall, surrounded by pictures of himself
: Wesley reflected in Cross's pupils
Holy shitl
Cross was his father
Wesley looks up at Anna's kind face
(') When your father and  found each other, when we had Andrew, he said he could no longer live the way he had been living
He said he wouldn't give us up, the way he had given up his first eon
Wesley stares at the picture
he can't believe he was being watched back when he felt so alone
(') It was his greatest regret
She leaves him in the room, alone, with his brother
Wesley watches the kid, trying to process it all
For the first time, emotions overcome him, and he breaks down
but he's too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob down in his throat and blinks back the tears
Goddamn, he has a brother
-  - He walks up behind Anna, who is sipping some coffee at a kitchen table, red eyed
would you like some coffee
'm okay
Wesley sets the key down on the table
(') Do you know what this opens
: 84
in a solid closet door
Wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open revealing a   , just like his father's
guess it's not much of an inheritance
() He left me more than this
Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm
want you to know that he forgave you before you ever pulled the trigger
He tried to keep you out of it for so long
Why didn't he just tell me
once they had you
he couldn't risk it unless you were alone
He knew his one shot at telling you might be his last
Her eyes harden a little bit
(') You have to finish what he was doing, Wesley
It's the only way any of us will ever be free
Especially your brother
They won't stop hunting us
your father knew that
Wesley nods
'll be back as soon as this is over
You have family here
Wesley nods, these words meaning so much to him
--  - Fox eats in a small restaurant in the heart of Koreatown, the kind of place that has the hot hibachi grills on the table tops
85
The place is mostly empty, quiet, with mainly Korean faces both dining and serving
It's the kind of place where you can eat and not be bothered
The doors swing open and Fox looks up
The silhouette of e     DOgJLWM is disturbing, a familiar person in a long black coat
Jesus
She squints, the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as all she can see is a silhouette
(') For a second there  thought you looked just like Cross
Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table as Fox lights up a cigarette
Skipped the hospital
He picked me clean and  don't care much for needles
She blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises toward the ceiling
(') Sloan's on his way
One of the waiters waves to her to put out her smoke and she just stares him down
The man backs off, nodding and smiling
(') You want something to eat, baby
'm all right
They got some good shit
Ostrich, chicken
won't fill you up too much if you're watching your calories
Naah
8a
Well, the big man should be here any minute
Yeah
() Listen, can  ask you a :question
Baby, you can ask me anything you want
He focuses on her eyes, zeroing in on the pupils
Did you know Cross was my father
What
Did you know
Closer, closer
tight on those pupils
What're you talking about Wesley
Cross killed your father
-: We see her pupil swell, just a tiny bit
--: He saw it
exactly what Sloan told him to look for when someone is lying
And from the look on Fox's face, she knows he saw it
Goddammit, Wesley
She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill so that it
(') Why'd you have to ask me that
With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge black Smith and Wesson revolver
$7
Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets
Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her feet don't touch the hot grill
If she's wounded, we wouldn't know it
Wesley does the same on a nearby table
They take shots at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no bullets find their mark
Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously fast
She's like the animal she's named after, and she launches off one of the tables
and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a form tackle on to a table
where he lands Quare on the oven top
and his guns go flying across the room as
the table to starts to burn through his clothes
% Arrrh
You shoulda known better, baby
But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven- is burning into her back
With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips herself backwards off the table
With another kick, she sends the hot table flying at him
It rips free from its wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the restaurant
Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not before it burns his arm as he blocks it
Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a hailstorm of bullets
But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment where his hands come u holSling his weapons
In
one fluid motion, he flips back over and
88
shoots bullets up in the air and then flicks his wrists so they arc over at the open gas nozzle
The bullets strike it, sparking, and then
: fireball b sts from nozzle, while a great Riume of sweltering fire keeps pouring out
Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the opening he was looking for
He  again, and one of his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in the side of the face
She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off her chin
This only seems to enrage her
Pissed, she produces two    out of the small of her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea -- and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull
(') () Aaaaahhhh
She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from where he lies flat on the floor
She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless
and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's face
(') gotta admit, baby
She starts to squeeze both the triggers
(') thought we might have a future
But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she reels
In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her toward him
taking her guns right out of her hands like a quick-change artist
Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the last expression she'll ever have because
69
Most of Fox's face is blown clean fr her head, and a blood mess s ra s a oss the wall
Wesley leans his head back and closes his eyes, the spume of fire flickering brightly against his lids, the events of the last several hours washing over him
: For several moments, there is nothing but darkness and a silence as permanent as death
Finally
(

) There's a town in Germany called Leverkusen that had a bear hunter named Hans Koblenz
: --  - Sloan, the Butcher and the Pharmacist walk across the parking lot toward the door of the smoking Bar-b-que joint
(

) 60 During his life, he was said to have killed over four hundred bears and was the pride of this small community on the Rhine
You want to know how he died pair of black bears singled out his house from the entire village, mauled his wife, killed his twin daughters, and then lied in wait for him to get back from the woods
--  - The fire is out, but it has blackened the inside of the joint, so that it looks like an absolute war zone
Fox is in the same position as when Wesley shot her, but there's a sheet of paper folded on her chest
The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he approaches the body, frowning
(
0
) When the hunter opened the door, they ripped his throat out before he could scream
() 90
(
0
) (') The two bears then curled up on the rug in the middle of the floor -- the rug that had once been their father -- and proceeded to bite
each other till they bled to death
Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees beneath it that pearl-handled revolver
The one with the blood on the handle
(
0
) (') That's a true story
He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper: 7' Sloan folds the paper back up and looks at the blood on the gun
He knows
: - Wesley stands in the slaughterhouse, holding two pistols, looking around
The place has been cleaned out
There's no sign of the Butcher
- Same thing at the Pharmacy, an empty store now
- and in the Fraternity's library, nothing
All the books are gone
Wesley processes this, frowning
He keeps walking to the
: where the entire model city has been destroyed, like a Giant has trampled it beneath its feet
Wesley stoops over and pulls one smashed building out of the mess, looking at it, thinking, thinking
and then he's up and moving quickly
: 91
'  - Anna opens the door for Wesley, who looks like he is on to something
My father
he was working on a plan, right
don't know
There was so much he wanted to keep away from us
Wesley moves into Andrew's roan
where the boy is still playing with the black model buildings
Wesley moves over and crouches down next to Andrew
Can  see that for a second
The boy hands him the building in his hand
It is painted jet black, except for one corner of the first floor, which is painted red
Wesley looks up at Anna
(') Do you know where he got this
- Anna leads Wesley down some wooden steps into Cross's basement
Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been made into a model map, similar to the one that the Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings are black, with an occasional red mark
The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of the city, and a   indicates a route through the streets
And on the wall are  and  of Henry Helms
Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his father's plan was
He sees a missing place for a building and puts Andrew's toy back in place, then studies the map some more
/'" -" Does this mean anything to you
92
There are large question marks painted on various buildings along the Helms' route
() My God, he's been planning it from the beginning
() This is a Fraternity hit
Cross
my fathar
set up Henry Helms as bait, knowing Sloan would use his best men for the job
He was going to take them all out
Wesley looks at it some more
(') Only he didn't know where on the route they would try and hit Helms
That's the missing piece he was t rying to figure out
Do you know the answer to that
Wesley looks up at her, resolve on his face
No
But  know who does
: - It's dark
Really dark
lump in a bed stirs
The lump stirs a little more
: , the hot girl from Wesley's office, moves to her peephole and looks out, but there's no one there
She opens the door and gives a quick look down the hall, then shuts it and hurries to her kitchen
93
She starts to open a cabinet but stops,  and jerks back, scared shitless
Wesley is-in her kitchen, lust a few-feet away
She looks at him
Jesus
(seeing who it is) Wesley
Is that you
He looks bruised and battered, but there is a hardness to his eyes
It's me, Nicole
What happened to you
Wesley wipes his eyebrow with his thumb, like he's considering what he wants to say next
asked you once if you thought  was an observant person
She doesn't understand
but suddenly we
: - that meeting room from his old job
In fact, it's a replay of that same scene
Wesley is still sitting there with his note pad, the words " " printed over and over, while the consultant continues to rattle on and on
Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley spots the hot intern Nicole, still talking on the phone
And just like before, he's zeroing in on her, but this time, we keep zeroing in and zeroing in, until we see something we didn't see before
Nicole reaches up over the counter to grab a stack of papers, and her shirt pulls slightly up from her back
and that tattoo of Cerberus
&)- three-headed
log _is ,printed there, in the exact same place Fox had
-and we keep zeroing in on it and zeroing in on it until we
/ : 94
- : Where Fox is tattooing his hand again and we get another taste of that conversation they had
() Who said  was the only sister
Maybe you just haven't met any others yet
(playfully back) Maybe  have and 'm just not telling you
and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley meant what he said, and we
: '  - Wesley still stands there, just a few feet away from her
Sloan didn't just have one person in my office watching me, he had two
What are you talking about
What name do you go by
The Intern
He points at her tattoo
(') Because  know you have the mark
Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a switch
Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but Wesley is faster
He pins her wrist back, twisting until she drops the knife
She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her chin
(') Where's the Henry Helms hit going down
Where's Sloan
95
Sloan's not your biggest problem, fuckface
Yeah
Why's that
She reaches over, slowly, so he knows she's not going to go for a knife
and she turns on a small sitting on the kitchen counter
The screen comes to life, showing an inf mercial for the ob'e
Nicole shakes her head and
flips up the channels
and now we see what she wanted to show him
: Wesley's   fills the screen above a reporter's head while the  babbles in a serious voice
responsible for several recent shootings, including one tonight at this Korean restaurant downtown and another at an outdoor mall
Details are sketchy, but we repeat, if you see this man, please contact
' : She starts cycling through the news channels
and each one shows
different  standing outside the smoking bar-b-que, or talking about Wesley, or speaking with police
One is even interviewing Wesley's old boss, Janice, who is very happy for the forum
: He was aggressive toward me and other employees
a very negative person, extremely negative
can't even repeat the words that came out of his mouth the day we let him go
96
' : Motherfucker
Dispose of the weapon
() Me
That's right
And the cops were told to watch this place too
You have nowhere to go
He's smarter than you
He'll feed the cops evidence singling you out for every hit the Fraternity has pulled in the last ten years
(ignoring her) 'm only going to ask you one more time
Where can  find him
You won't get to him
You can't
The cops will be here any second
Wesley reaches over- -and cranks up a gas burner, the menacing flame on high
Then this is going to get painful quickly
She stares at that blue flame, fear in her eyes for the first time
He starts pushing her head toward it, closer and closer
(') Henry Helms
Where is it going down
The first  from Nicole is lost in
: (0
) Open up
Police
The door to Nicole's apartment smashes open and four cops burst through the door, guns ready
97
They spread out quickly, checking out the place
One of the disappears into the kitchen
2 (
) Oh, Christ
: - wail and a  hovers nearby as Wesley stands on a roof, looking down on the scene
He sees 's roll a gurney out toward an ambulance as  cover every inch of the ground
From where he is, it looks like every cop in the city is here
: One  looks up and sees a figure on the roof, long jacket blowing in the breeze
Surprisingly conspicuous
What the fuck
2 What is it
The first cop points up toward Wesley on the roof
2 (') (into the radio) Air Support can you get a beam on the four-story southeast of our position
: Quickly, a spotlight lights up the spot where Wesley was standing, but now we see it's iust an air-conditioning vent with soave loose streamers flapping off of it
Damn, it looked just like Wesley a moment ago
was it
(on the radio) Negative, roof is clean
- Wesley steps out of a dark doorway, his hard eyes following a police car as it roars by without noticing him
98
He pulls his jacket collar up, puts on
a skull cap, and takes off in the opposite direction, away from the scene
He passes a newspaper dispenser, but the
on the front page, which is still talking about Henry Helms
The     photograph of Helms, which
: Morning
- where   himself is tying a tie in a hotel mirror
He's a handsome enough guy, distinguished even, but he looks tired, like the weight of living under a death threat has dragged him down
door opens, and we see his wife,  , step past two, huge  to come in
The car is here
- gaggle of large bodyguards surround the Helmses as they hurry out of a side door and make it into a
They notice the half dozen   positioned around their limo
holds the limo door for them
(re: the cops) What's all this
We're not taking any chances
He shuts the door for them before climbing behind the steering wheel
The limo starts to make its way down the drive, flanked in front and in back by dark  and the motorcycle cops
- Commercial ships cruise up and down a river, under an expansive

Sitting next to the incline to the bridge, is an abandoned four story building, what used to be
a - guy looks down at the street with his binoculars
It's the Gunsmith
(into a radio) Nothing yet, sir
- On another tall building, Sloan talks into a radio
Hold until  give the word
He clicks off the radio and looks into his palm, where- e's holding that pearl handled aun, fingering the dried blood
: The suburbans and cops flank the limo as it rolls through the concrete jungle
: The bodyguards peer up at the buildings ready for anything
Henry Helms reaches over and grabs his wife's hand, a reassuring gesture
But his white knuckles betray his trepidation
The driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the east side of the river
: They make a turn along the river and haul ass toward the bridge
Traffic is sparse and they look like they have an easy clear passing
: The Gunsmith sits, waiting patiently
100
: Sloan watches the Limo starting to approach the bridge
(into the radio) Here comes the car
Any minute now
Take your positions
Sloan leans out over the edge of his building, gun ready
: On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith puts down his binoculars and picks up a rifle
The Pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and looks down, high-powered rifle in his hand
On another building, the Chef does the same
And on still another building, the Gardener also gets ready
Each killer is in a different spot and has a gun, pointed and ready, just waiting for the signal
: The limo is about halfway up the incline now, a sitting duck, hellfire about to rain down upon it
: The Gunsmith waits, waits, waits
and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of him, a knife is held to his neck from behind
The Gunsmith doesn't even so much as swallow, as the blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a drop of blood
() Wesley
The      to show Wesley crouched right behind him, a look of icy determination on his face as he holds the knife in place
101
() The name is Cross
In the distance, the Helms limo moves on, safely
Looks like you missed your chance
Now where is Sloan
The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice
You don't understand, man
This ain't about Helms
The Intern told you right where to go
He smiles
(') 'm just the decoy
around behind Wesley
to show that three laser sights are lighting up his back in a perfect pattern
And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in the open
The three surrounding rooftops, slightly more elevated, hold each of the three assassins crouched-in sniper positions, zeroed in on Wesley's back
But instead of surprise, Wesley just leans in closer to the Gunsmith's ear
() She told me that, too
And with that, he rolls the o0 over of , just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash a hail of bullets
The Gunsmith takes a dozen shots, all in the chest, but none of the bullets make it through the Gunsmith's body
(') Should've studied your anatomy, fellas
Wesley   indiscriminately at the neighboring rooftops, lying on his back, using the
dead assassin's body as a shield
102
Quickly, he bucks the Gunsmith's body off of him and scampers for a nearby stairwell
: The assassinB-all disappear from their positions and head to the street
: -   - Wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the front door of the building
He clicks the empty cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he hears a sickening sound behind him
The sound of two knife blades being rubbed together
and Wesley turns to f' the Butcher there waiting for The Butcher quickly hurls a knife, which buries in_the fleshy part of Wesley's shoulder 1 Wesley ignores it and fires
i The Butcher deflects them with the knives in his hands: Wesley goes to fire again but his firing chambers recoil, showing that he is out of ammo
The Butcher's eyes go wide
Like  told you
the blade will always live on
remember some dumb shit like that coming out of your mouth
Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out the kniZ2 in his shoulder
They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging off each other as each tries to gain an edge
The fight spills out the front door, and into
103
: the two men slashing, ducking, and moving in the middle of the street
- Wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosiLthe Butcher's face And forehead, filling his eyes with blood
The Butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming on to his hands
He tries to wipe the blood from his eyes, but it's just getting worse
can't see
But you can hear
So hear this: To cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice- pick style
Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it
(') and thrust down behind the clavicle, cutting side to side
He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over as his gore spills out into the street
But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new predicament
He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener
To make things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him
Three on one, mate
You're out of ammo
And you're in a part of the map with no Fraternity stashes
() That's what 'd call a real ball ache
For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the situation
His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef to the Pharmacist
Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black
, just like in cross's model
Wesley's eyes fall on the on the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block making up a decorative support column in front of it
104
Wesley smiles
'm working off of a different map
With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a Lexus parked at the curb
The three assassins fire relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car, smashing it to bits
as
on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just as he reaches that cement block
affixed to it is a small   Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new pair of sophisticated As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we
: to follow both of his bullets in flight
: from the left gun heads for the Chef
He tries to drop down, but the bullet curves downward, it pierces his body
and
: We see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs-exit his side and head for the Pharmacist, while
: the bullet from the right gun heads for the Gardener, who moves fast to fire his own gun, but the bullet catches him in the wrist, knocking his gun out of his hand, and
: it hits the Gardener's scaphoid bone, ricocheting out, also, right at the Pharmacist
: just as the two bullets come together
Bugger
105
hitting the Pharmacist on both sides of-his head, before he can even react
Wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of the Pharmacist's head as he falls to the asphalt, dead
But Wesley's not through, he moves over to the Gardener and rolls him over
Where is he
Where it started
Wesley ends it for the Gardener
- We've seen this place before
It's the same roof where cross took out the second head of The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes blazing
Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away, holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on Wesley's head
Can't say  don't have a sense of irony
The place  first decided to bring you in
Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops
(') You once asked why  helped hide you as an infant
It gave me power, Wesley'
Power to become a head of the Fraternity
Power over your father
And ultimately it gave me you: the perfect weapon to kill your father
But now you have to dispose of the weapon
In some ways it pains me to do so
You 460 are like the son  never had
106
Fuck you
Sloan's eyes narrow
Fine
Keep your worthless dignity
You're still just the same loser we plucked off the street six weeks ago
Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in
Sloan laughs derisively
(') You can't win, Wesley
The Fraternity is everywhere
Even if you kill me others will come from other cities to take my place
You'll be hunted your whole life
() But that's not gonna happen
Like  told you before, when we are called, death is as certain as the sun
Wesley stands as straight as he can muster
The two men face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge city
an old newspaper even blows through like a tumbleweed
And we are close on Wesley's face
act it i the same shot from the opening of the movie
Six weeks ago,  was ordinary and pathetic
We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve
(') But not today
With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun, the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they both open fire
Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan does the same
Just like he did with h' father
But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took the knife
107
(' Uhhh
He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too damn far to stop now
he flips his gun from his good hand to his bad hand and manages to keep
Then Wesley does something unexpected
he starts sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets out of the air
He closes the gap
ten feet
five feet
a surprised and worried expression now spreads on Sloan's face,
like what is this kid doing
But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his feet
They go flying right over the edge of the building
Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop himself
but Sloan is going to go over
At the last moment, Sloan reacher
for-something
anything
and grabs one-handed the barrel of Wesley's gun
For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious position, looking each other in the face
Sloan can't believe he's been bested by this kid
() Go ahead and shoot me, killer
Just like you did your old man
Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then he smiles
'm done with this life
Just like my father
And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h : We watch Sloan's body fall through the sky
108
down, down, down
until it  into the sidewalk, splattering like a grapefruit
: Wesley rolls over on to his back, looking up at the darkening sky
(
) It's true
Six weeks ago  was ordinary and-pathetic
Just like you
He sits up, moving

You're the new guy, huh
Just started last week
Where'd you move here from
All over the place, really
Nothing too exciting
Well, welcome to the team
Just watch out for Brokaw
He'll stab you in the back first chance he gets
Just then, a harried man, , comes storming up
Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes to get to
The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does
(') Laziest skirt  ever hired
But nice fun bags, 'll give her that

He leans over Wesley's desk, right in his space
( '  ) Jim, right
Yes, sir
Listen, Jim,  don't want to get started off on the wrong foot here, but we
have numbers to make and if we don't make those numbers, it's my ass on the line
And if my ass gets chewed out by regional,  can guarantee
that your ass is gonna be Purina doggy chow
Now 'm not sure how they ran things
Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and-- further, until the words become gibberish, just like they did with Janice
Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time to hear
(') so do we understand each other
Of course
Good boy
With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up his ass that they look like they may burst at any second
Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads 11:15
He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the receptionist's desk
She looks up, bites her lower lip
You want to take a break with me
Sure
She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting for the doors to open
(') You know, we don't usually get breaks
Just then, the elevator doors
Well, you'll find there's nothing "usual" about me
They climb in
on Wesley's face
