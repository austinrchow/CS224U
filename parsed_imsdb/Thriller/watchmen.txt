The Intruder   out of the air with even quicker reflexes, but the act buys Blake time to pull a  with a from a hollowed out
He's a pro but so is our Intruder
Before Blake can get a shot off, the Intruder is already upon him,  the gun out of Blake's hand-- --Blake  the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder drops the gun
Blake fights
Not like an old man, but like the trained killer he is
But the Intruder is much, much faster
Younger

At the cop still arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow tape
At the   zipping up Blake's

It's late this month
When will it be here

This is plate glass too, you'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in this

At least
You check the bedroom

He leaves Det

It's later now, the news stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone

Earlier today  came across what appeared to be a suicide
It was later learned to be a homicide

Something recognized
And suddenly, unexpectedly heard my own clock ticking
We move out of the  and see our guy for the first time-- (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench coat, fedora, and a silver-white  with oily moving about, creating shifting, doubled  like a Rorschach test
Scary looking
Rorschach draws a hydraulic   from his coat, and the       where it latches itself through Blake's broken window

'  -   - With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment
He investigates, silent
He sees the same things that the cops saw
but he notices the speakers by the
Notices one of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew
Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the speaker was hollow
(The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun and put the cover back on when he left
Why
) '  -   - Blake's clothing hangs in military rows
Rorschach runs his fingers along the wall-seams
He pauses, presses on the hanger , which   to reveal a

But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention
Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current Black leather armor, gloves, boots
Hanging over it all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather
Rorschach stares
Framed nearby is the The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last Laugh On Moloch
" Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero called the Comedian
In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian named  prisoner
(We'll meet Moloch later
) On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of superheroes
Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr
Manhattan, as is the Comedian
(As are  ,  , and , all of whom we'll be meeting soon)
The caption below reads: "The New Watchmen
" Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open
He quickly closes the secret hatch
'  -   - Two uniformed  stand in the doorway
() 7
: 1 You sure it wasn't the wind
2 Nah,  definitely heard something
1 tell ya, 'd rather do traffic duty than be posted at a crime scene all night
Watch the door
Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than being concerned
He then enters the bedroom
Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom: 1 (

Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns-- --and comes face to "face" with Rorschach, standing inches away
The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror
He goes to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, "Shhh"-- The fingers    '
The cop  and falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper

As he speaks, we   various  : The first is a   dated 1958: --the caption underneath reads "Hero Calls Himself The Nite Owl

'll never know what possessed me to put that mask on the first time

: (

Pirate outfits, ghosts
Gangs that thought it was funny to dress up and pull heists, crap like that
: Another  , dated 1962: --
"'We're going to clean up this town

) (') So a few cops, we decide it might be funny to mask up too
Be anonymous
Take these guys on at the street level, right
Then the media got wind, ran with it, turned it into a whole different beast

The plaque below reads:  , 1969
Another clipping: "Hero Retires, Reveals Identity In Tell All Book
" Finally, we come to   (aka Nite Owl), 70s, though his eyes sparkle with strength and his face still shows the edges of a born hero
The  is on in the background
(') Superheroes, Supervillians--you know who ran into the other day at the market
The Screaming Skull
We chatted for a while
Turns out he's a born again
(
0
) No way
We see who Hollis is speaking to--  (the second Nite Owl), late 30's, handsome, though he's let himself go the past few years--his edges have gone soft
He was in the photo of the new Watchmen in Blake's apartment
All the nuts that started popping up, 'll tell ya
Who was that midget you and your partner chased down years ago
What'd he call himself
The Big Figure
Big Figure
midget bad guy
Guess it doesn't get lower than that, does it
Hollis laughs at his own joke; Dan chuckles, polite
() 9
: (2) (glances at his watch) Wow, it's really late
Dan stands, finishes his beer
Hollis sees him to the door
Well, even though  spent my time catching real bad guys, you were still a better Nite Owl than  ever was
That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it
They hug
With all this talk of war, all that's going on in the world, it's a shame the government forced all you guys out
Before Dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on the : This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime scene in the early morning hours
Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes ten years ago
Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on screen
Well, forced all of you guys out except one
() Next week
Dan nods, then leaves
'  -  / Dan descends the stairs
He pulls up his collar against the cold and walks down an alley
below Hollis' apartment reads: "  --Obsolete models a specialty
" 10
-  / Dan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of , wearing yellow and black  brush past him
stops
Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far
Move your leg
What
said move, dick
Dan finally realizes what he's talking about
Dan meets his eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg
The Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass
'  -  / Dan walks down the empty street to his , digging for his keys
Then he stops, suddenly alert
His front door hangs slightly --the ' been
There's a  on inside
Cautious, Dan enters the house
'  - Dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen
He hears odd, metal scraping
'  - Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find-- Rorschach
Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold Hello Daniel
helped myself to some beans
You don't mind
No, of course not
You uh, want me to heat some up for you
No need
() 11
: Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask back down
There's a strong familiarity between the two but at the same time, Dan is wary
You were on the news
They say you attacked a cop
Minor wound
Won't need hospitalization
Other than that
How have you been keeping
Out of prison
So far
Look at this
He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table
Dan picks it up, runs his fingers over the -
This little stain, is that bean juice or-- Human bean juice
It belonged to the Comedian
He's dead
The Comedian
Nervous now, Dan glances out the window
(cont'd) Let's talk downstairs

Dan opens the closet, revealing an old
With some difficulty, Dan   the   with a lead down into the dark

No-one has been down here for years
In the center of the space, an   the size of a subway car is covered by a dusty --the Owl-Ship
How did it happen
() 12 : Murder
Someone threw him out a window
Maybe it was a burglary
The killer might not have known who Blake was
An ordinary burglar
Kill the Comedian
Ridiculous
You're right
heard he was working for the government
Maybe it was a political killing
Maybe
Or maybe someone's decided to kill off costumed heroes
You don't think that's
a little paranoid
Is that what they're saying about me now
That 'm paranoid
-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any
The man wasn't exactly endearing
Just because something happened to him doesn't mean it involves us
One of our own has been murdered thought you might be interested
An attack on one is an attack on all of us, right
Dan hesitates
'm out, Rorschach
've been out, we've all been out
Except you
You know that
Yes
know that
Anyways,  thought 'd let you know
Just in case
() 13
: (2) Yeah, thanks
You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street-- Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark
remember
Used to come here a lot
Back when we were partners
Yeah
Those were good times, Rorschach
Great times
(more to himself) What ever happened to them
You quit
Rorschach disappears into the  , leaving Dan to reminisce alone
Dan glances at his old costume hanging
- The kind of room you rent by the hour
Or the minute even cheap looking  enters with an  , giggling
She playfully pushes the Officer onto the bed
So tell me what you wanna do
Sir
Seeing that  don't have to be back to base till Friday--everything
He puts a stack of  on the dresser
Then takes his off like he can't wait
The Hooker gets on top of him- --when the
Rorschach steps in, yanks the Hooker off-- --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which Rorschach dodges
Rorschach  the guy's arm, then the Officer on the side of his , tearing the joint to shreds
The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor-- Rorschach nails him in the head with a  , knocking him out
The Hooker screams
Rorschach grabs her by the hair and her face into the wall
Quiet, whore

: Nose broken and bleeding, the Hooker quiets to a whimper
Rorschach takes the officer's uniform and
Then leaves

At the 50th-floor there is a -  where

The decor is Egyptian and marble
Dan approaches a beautiful  behind an imposing desk
'm here to see Adrian Veidt
Do you have an appointment
No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to see him
'm sorry, Mr
Veidt doesn't see anyone without an appointment
understand, but if you would just tell Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, 'm an old friend
Well, Mr
Veidt is very busy at the -- Just tell him 'm here
assure you he'll see me
Dan glares at her
She glares right back
game of chicken
She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office
Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by nervousness
Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him-- it's been a long time
He glances at the eyeing him
Finally, the Assistant returns
Go on in, Mr
Dreiberg

'  - Dan enters the enormous office--there are three  feeds onto the walls, architectural models of real estate developments, poster size ad campaigns for "Nostalgia" perfume--all reflecting the financial empire of Veidt Enterprises owned by-- -- , late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end of the office,  on a treadmill as journalist holds a tape recorder to him
Adrian sees Dan approaching, smiles wide
He holds up a finger, telling Dan to hold on a sec
Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch
Picks up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover
Mr
Veidt, would you acknowledge that you are considered the world's smartest man
() think it's better to be the world's most modest man
You should ignore my people, they tend to be a little too enthusiastic
Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly seems out of breath as he answers questions
If we could move off the subject of business for a moment, 'm curious whether the world's smartest man thinks we're headed for our next World War
Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan
Predicting stock prices isn't the same as predicting world events
hope there isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that matter
Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans, plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better place
My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr
Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions
This energy could power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there are no limitations-- (reaching Dan) () () 16

Will you mind pausing the interview a moment, Doug good friend of mine is here
Doug Roth leaves
Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat
You look good, Adrian
Dan--it's been far too long

Dan examines an - of Adrian as  (his superhero alias)
Rorschach
He paid me a visit too
He did
Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him
thought your assistant was going to take me out
() Sara can be tough
Is that why you came to see me
You're worried about this mask killer theory Rorschach's conjured up
You're the world's smartest man, Adrian
You tell me
Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through nostalgia
revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act was passed
If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already
Adrian notices the news on one of his  projectors
Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian border
Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim
(') No, there are other things in the world 'm far more concerned about

We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with his sniper rifle aimed

Then a war
And then the Americans will send-- -  -   - (in Mandarin) --their blue abomination to intervene
And we don't want that
At the same time, we can't assume to know what's on the minds of our enemies
We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan

Manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend,  , 30, very much in her prime, enters from the other end
Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What are you doing here
You're a wanted man
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre
Don't call me that
My mother made me take that name
always hated it

Well,  might not be able to count molecules, but either way, Blake was a bastard

There's no past to travel back to, no future to travel forward to, everything happens all at once, our actions affect the course of time instantly, yes  know
() 'm sorry, it's just a little unnerving to be with someone who can see the future, or whatever you call it

That memory seems to be painful for her

Please keep in mind, Ms

You remember that crazy guy, what did he call himself
Captain Carnage
Pretended to be a supervillian just so he could get beat up all the time
Yeah, he tried that with me once
just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, "punish me

" () Whatever happened to him
Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft
They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter
Sorry, sorry, that's not funny
can't remember the last time  laughed like this
It feels good
Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee
We can see he's smitten with her and that he probably has been for years
Laurie seems oblivious
It's great seeing you again, Laurie
Yeah, this was fun

To be honest,  can't tell if he even cares about me anymore

Y1 know, when  think back, why did we do it
Why did we dress up like that think the Keene Act was the best thing to ever happen to us
You're probably right

All that tight spandex
That was awful
Uh, yeah
Awful
And to think my own mother pushed me into that spandex
Pushed me into the whole costume thing in the first place
Wanted her little girl to be just like mommy and fight bad guys

Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan

Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings
Look, Rorschach and  have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts
Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp
That's true

Because twenty years from now we're all gonna be dust
Mankind's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time and now we finally got the power to finish the job
Ain't nothin' gonna matter when the nukes start flying, and  promise you they will
Then Ozymandias here is gonna be the smartest man on the cinder

Doug Roth
Journalist who grilled Dr
Manhattan on national television
No  didn't watch that interview
This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when  went to see him
Hmm
Journalist set up Dr
Manhattan, was probably working to set up Veidt also
Dan stands there thinking
As if hit with an epiphany

Rorschach
What, what if it's Adrian
Veidt
Behind everything
Makes no sense
() 96

He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr
Manhattan
And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast
He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list
That doesn't explain the attempt on Veidt's life
If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first
It was a risk, but-- But why

Suddenly there's a   in the hall
The Lynx growls
Adrian switches the monitors to the security cameras which show ion and Laurie materialize in the snow
(') Speak of the devil
- Laurie vomits in the snow
Adrian, of course
Who else would have the resources Wait, this is Adrian's compound
Are you saying he's responsible for this-- Jon walks toward the building, entranced
Distracted
Yes
Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others
Excuse me, Daniel, 'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago What, Daniel
Millions of others
Jon don't start that crap now, not here

: 'm sorry
It's these tachyons
They're, muddling things up

-   - Jon materializes in the hall
Adrian sprints like lightening, out of the room, followed by the Lynx
No, don't let him escape
Jon, stop him, he killed millions of people, who knows what else he'll do
Jon walks calmly after Adrian
(') Jon, are you okay
You seem drugged
Yes
Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others
Excuse me, Daniel, 'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago What
Where's Laurie

It's these tachyons

Adrian, don't be foolish

Forgive me, girl
Jon enters the corridor with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a The Lynx'     as The Lynx
Adrian
Adrian, don't-- through Jon and the Lynx--both are
Adrian peers around the corner, winded by his success
You know,  really wasn't sure that would work

Oh shit
Adrian opens his eyes and  her in the stomach, sending her flying back
() 115
: (2) If you've hurt her, 'll-- Oh Dan
Grow up
Adrian exits as Dan helps the winded Laurie to her feet
Together, Rorschach, Dan and Laurie follow him back to: -   - Adrian approaches his wall of  screens when-- (
) Jon, now 100  ,
Adrian crawls desperately away, grasping for his remote on the floor
As Jon approaches him, Jon  to six feet
(') Restructuring myself was the first trick learned
It didn't kill me before, did you seriously think it would kill me now
You are nothing but a man
And the world's smartest man means no more to me than its smartest termite
Out of tricks, out of traps, Adrian lifts the remote
(') What is that, Adrian
Some new, ultimate weapon
Yes
Yes, you could say that
Adrian goes back to his wall of screens, watching the news reports
We hear   and : "India and Pakistan immediately call for truce," "China stands down," " withdraws forces," "Israel agrees on cease fire
" stand in Adrian's eyes
He raises his fists in triumph
(') did it
've saved Earth from Hell
Next,  will elevate her to the vaulting stature of Heaven
Next
You can't get away with this
() 116
: No
Will you expose me, undoing the peace so many have just died for
Morally, you're in checkmate, just like the Comedian was
Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in
'm afraid he's correct
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again
He's right
All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth
We we can't say anything about this You're joking, of course
Rorschach walks toward the exit
Rorschach, wait a second
Let's talk this out
Never
Not even in the face of Armageddon
Never compromise
Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication
Seeing this, Dan runs after Rorschach
Rorschach
Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the exit
Where are you going, Rorschach
Back to the Owl-Ship
Back to America
People must be told
Evil must be punished
() 117
: (2) Rorschach, you know  can't let you do that
Rorschach pauses
Dan is halfway there
Rorschach removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes
Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity
If you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary
None of this would have happened
So what are you waiting for
Do it
Jon    and
Dan collapses to his knees, sobbing
Jon contemplates the - where Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears-- --reappearing across the hall where Laurie is
She is also in tears, watching all the horrible footage on the  screens
Laurie
'm leaving this galaxy
For one a little less complicated
Leaving
,  thought you regained an interest in human life

think maybe 'll create some
Goodbye, Laurie
He kisses her on the cheek-- Jon, 'd hoped to talk to you
've made myself feel every death, see every innocent face 've murdered to save humanity--you understand, don't you
Without condoning or condemning, And with that, he disappears
Forever
() 118
: (3) Across the hall, Dan recovers from mourning Rorschach
He stands, gritting his teeth
Walks toward Adrian
What's on your mind, Dan
Your death
Really
You want to kill me
Yeah
You might have created peace, but not at the expense of justice
You need to pay for what you've done
That doesn't sound like you, Dan
That sounds more like Rorschach
Exactly
Adrian readies himself
Laurie breaks away from the screens
Only you're not Rorschach, are you now
How do you expect to succeed where he failed
Tell you the truth, Adrian
don't
Dan  at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life
His fighting style has changed
Dan's newfound brutality is informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach
About justice
About life
But Adrian is the best
He takes Dan's attacks apart with ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so focused on his goal
In the end, he  Dan's final strike and
Dan's arm  easily
Dan
Laurie charges Adrian
With one hand, Adrian blocks her attack, grabs her by the hair and  her to floor, knocking her out

Silence, but for the tinkling of  falling to the floor
Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered
Most of Adrian has been  under the ship
He coughs a fine blood spray
Adrian looks over to Dan, dying
don't regret my actions
know in my heart
did the right thing
So do
Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies

That's it
Careful
Now, pull the stick to the left The ship  and  awkwardly in the hall, smashing out more glass

It's afterburners  the room, and Adrian's body

Dan watches out the window, until his eyes slip shut -  (  ) Time has passed
The disintegrated buildings are being rebuilt
The shock of the attack is wearing off, and though the streets may not be as crowded as they once were, a sense of normalcy is returning
Sally Jupiter walks the sidewalk, looking for an address
'  - Sally mixes herself a tall drink at the bar
Sally calls out: You sure you don't want a drink

Thanks
We finally see Laurie now--her hair dyed, appearance changed

Sally freezes

Sally downs her drink, immediately starts making another
It, it was years later, he stopped by out of the blue, and, and apologized

He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed with color
Buttoning up his shirt, he spots Sally
Oh hi
Hello, Dan
Excuse me,  should clean up
Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom
Dan and Laurie embrace, kiss
Any bad guys last night
There are always bad guys
Even in today's world
Slow, Laurie turns to the window
Looks out at the New York skyline being rebuilt
Dan
Hmm
Will it be alright
The world,  mean
He puts his arm around her shoulder
As long as no-one ever finds out that Adrian was behind it all, the public will think ion is still up there, watching
