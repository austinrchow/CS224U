Written by Karl Gajdusek & Lewis John Carlino : 07/17/2009 "Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name But what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game
" The Rolling Stones, 1968 1
'  - on the needle of a precision-weighted 33rpm turntable
It comes down, touches vinyl
The Rolling Stones "Sympathy for the Devil" purrs out
(40's) Sitting in a comfortable wooden chair, stares right through us
Lean, hard, in perfect physical shape
In this moment, carrying the stillness of someone utterly in balance
For all we know, he's been sitting this way for hours
(
) Every man has a death that's right for him
Every one
to find a wall of photographs, charts, official documents
In the center   of a man, mid-40's, East-Indian, dressed like the billionaire he is
Dodi Fayed meets Bill Gates
(
) (') For every man, there's a way to leave this earth which is so right for them, it's almost as if they carry it with them
over the wall
The Mark escorted from a bullet-proof sedan by ear-wired men
Entertaining at a palatial estate
Magazine covers: "The billion-dollar lifestyle
" "The new Playboy
"
passing over smaller articles: "What does this man do with your money
" (
) (') When the right death overtakes a man, there will be grief in those who knew him, but there will also be a sense of inevitability
Because they will know, that of course
Statue-like, except his eyes which dart across the wall in front of him, making connections
- speed by, a blur of color
But all we hear is the Rolling Stones' song
And
(
) Of course, this was always going to happen this way
The     floods in as the cars blow by, revealing Bishop amidst onlookers, watching, calculating
2
'
: Two cars  in a corner,  to a stop, crushing a half-million in beautiful restored antique
The Mark climbs from his wreck, tosses his helmet, pissed
Bishop raises a camera, takes a picture
'  - Bishop at his wall again, this time actively engaged, working it
picture of the Mark in his vintage car goes up, underneath, Bishop tacks a stats page: "Fatality in auto accidents by type of impact
Head on, Side rear,
" Off to the side, bank statements, cash transfers
Saudi Arabia
Chechnya
United Arab Emirates
Bishop tacks more photos up
The Mark, getting off a private plane, the Mark, playing Polo
- Rider  a ball forward, spurs his horse onwards, bearing down on the ball
and
Another Rider comes in from the side, sends the man crashing off his horse
The second man, the Mark, takes a second to gloat over his fallen opponent before  onwards
Bishop watches, takes a note on a pad
'  - Bishop keeps working, the wall completely covered now
Lists of possible deaths have been ordered, drawbacks circled
Bishop scans over various magazine covers featuring the Mark
One with a vintage hunting rifle slung low in his arms, unbroken
"American Dream or American Nightmare
" Bishop stares at this
Eyes moving over the wall, accident stats, a copy of a hunting-club reprimand
he's arrived
- Bishop stands in front of a moving riverway, his body sheathed in a black slicksuit, backpack on
He slips into the water and starts to
We  with Bishop as he  , powerfully, not tiring
Finally, we  , across miles of water, realizing this is what Bishop will swim without stopping
3
- pair of   patrol a wooded shore
One lifts a pair of binoculars, scans the shore as  , a form moves from behind a tree, blends into the woods
Moving fast, silent, towards a   in the distance
- The  that someone is in here with us
illuminates Bishop in a , , No way to know what or where
The glow, coming from his watch, illuminates his face, crammed and claustrophobic
An eye checks the time, the light goes out
Just the sound of his breathing
- rise from the end of vintage hunting rifles
Game birds scatter into the air
Dogs , tear through underbrush
dressed in traditional hunting livery move through foggy woods, followed by
This is old school hunting, old school weapons
Camera finds The Mark, raising his weapon, sights falls, dogs race after it
The Mark starts forward but is interrupted by his Steward reminding him to break his weapon as the other hunters have
The Mark pushes the man back, ignoring him, hurrying on
At a small distance, two unhappy private security guards follow
- soft , almost inaudible
low rustle of cloth, then the green glow illuminates Bishop's face as he checks the time again
Hasn't moved in
- The Mark stumbles forward, over-eager to get to his prize
He's worked his way ahead of the field
The  has grown thicker
Human forms move on all sides, hard to distinguish
Guns go off around them
Dogs rush by
The Mark brings the weapon to his face
The shot echoes through the foggy woods
4
- The Mark, pleased with himself as always, bursts into the lodge, gun over his shoulder
round of  as his Steward holds up the morning's catch
He pushes on into the locker rooms as one security takes station at the door
The second emerges from the lockers, having just done his sweep
,   - The Mark leans his vintage hunting rifle against the wall, opens his locker
He kicks off his boots, pulls off his shirt
Takes a second to rub his face with his hands
It can be exhausting being him
Behind the Mark, a locker door opens and closes
Like a ghost did it
He doesn't sense a thing, reaches for his weapon, accidentally knocks it to the side
It ,
The Mark , half expecting it to fire
But no
He starts to lean down for it when another man's gloved hands reach it first
The Mark smiles down at the well-dressed man crouched by the gun, a little confused
Bishop looks up, smiles back
He puts out a gloved hand
Before the Mark can consider, he's taken Bishop's hand
Bishop holds tight
The Mark's smile
fades
Even though we know it's coming, Bishop's actions are so fast and final we're taken by surprise
He  the Mark in as at the same time he cocks the rifle's hammer, slams the gun into position, barrel pointed up and
The shot hits the Mark in the face, obliterates him, sends a plume of gore up against the ceiling
One, two seconds before the Mark's  rush into the room, guns lined
First sees the mess, puts a hand to his mouth
Second starts on the radio
The room is empty
- vintage 1972 Shelby Cobra parked by the edge of the river
Bishop emerges from the water, pops the trunk of the car
Towel and large rock inside
He towels off, tosses the suit and the rock into his pack, pack goes into the river
He grabs a sweater from inside the trunk
5
'  - Bishop gets behind the wheel, dressed
He checks himself in the rearview, finds a bead of sweat traveling from his brow
Wipes it away, irritated, and starts the car
- Establishing
quaint local convenience store off a two- lane road, nestled amidst trees
Bishop's vintage car pulls up and he gets out
- Door jingles as Bishop steps in, smiles to the , a friendly beefy guy in his 60's who checks the clock
7:00 on the nose
'Evening, Arthur
Got your weekly right here
The man hoists two bags of groceries onto the counter
Bishop comes forward, sees the Owner's  behind the counter
12, precocious, reading a dog-eared kid's book
Hey, Sophie
got something for you, wanna see
The girl smiles, puts down the book and comes over
Bishop crouches in front of her
He puts out two empty hands, shows them back and front, then tickles one ear with a hand while the other "appears" a small daisy
The girl sees it, smiles
a little disappointed
(') 'm just kidding
Bishop reaches into his jacket, pulls out the next installment in the kid's book she's reading:  series featuring a young female Harry-Potter like character on the cover:
Sophie , takes it
quick hug and she's back to her seat, opening the new book
What do you say, honey
Thank you, Bishop
6
You're very welcome
And she's back into the book
Bishop smiles, a little sad
It was nice
but the moment's over
He stands and collects his groceries
See you next week, Arthur
'  - ranch-style compound, nestled in the hills
Warm, rustic, and inviting
Bishop's Cobra drives past the  , a large craftsman, into a  where he parks next to a collection of other beautiful vintage cars
He gets out, crosses the dirt drive towards his home
separate from the main house
Two horses graze in an attached paddock
'  - Bishop's enters, flicking on lights
The home is beautiful, ordered
Everything a model of design and elegance
The walls are home to a collection of original and slightly sociopathic art
Lucian Freud, de Chirico, Zak Smith, Francis Bacon
Isolation, beauty, unrest
'  - Bishop unpacks his groceries
Organic
Raw
Supplements
Vitamins
Nothing looks delicious
His fridge is ordered
Glass containers in rows, lightly hued liquids in each
He opens a can of Friskies, sets it down for a mutt-like tabby-cat who lopes over and eats
Bishop scratches her behind the ears
'  - Bishop flicks on lights illuminating the  covered with charts, documents, photographs of the Mark
He goes to a gas fireplace built into the side of the room, fires up the flames
sideboard holds a collection of Vinyl Albums
Mint condition, collector
Fingers play over titles
Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Bob Dylan
The turntable needle hits Young's "Needle and the Damage Done
" Music croons sweet into the room as pages, photos, everything goes into the fire
7
One photo in particular: The Mark, busy on the phone as a young girl pulls at his suit jacket
He was a criminal bastard, but also a father
Bishop stares down at the picture, consumed by fire, reflected in his eyes
'  - Bishop, running on a treadmill, full-tilt
controlled sprint without end
The gym has all manner of customized exercise equipment
Weights, machines, a climbing wall, an infinite lap-pool
Bishop jumps off the treadmill, immediately takes his pulse, checks it against a clock on the wall, jots a note
Bishop, pressing weights
300+ pounds
Reps over and over, Muscles ,
In his eyes, almost a relaxed intensity
The rest of the world, turned off
Bishop  the weights,
Immediately taking his pulse, checking the clock
'  - Bishop sits at a small desk, plotting the evening's work-out in a book
He traces columns, enters points on a graph
Doesn't matter how impressive the numbers are, they've peaked and are now starting their inevitable slide
Staring at the book
'  - Bishops stands in front of his phone
He scrolls through the last ten calls that have come through
They all read "McKenna, Harry
" Over and over
Three days' worth
'   - Bishop eats dinner, alone at the end of a beautiful antique table
Hanging on the wall across from him, a vivid disturbing painting of three women
His food is a meal we might expect an astronaut to eat
Raw Spinach, a collection of supplements
He crunches through something that looks like cardboard, chews, stares at the painting
In his study, the phone rings
He eyeballs it, lets it ring
8
, '  - Bishop sits on the couch in front of the television, his cat curls under his arm, purring
Bishop flips channels through an endless display of over-amped human behavior
People and  in the sitcoms, people  on the talk-shows, people  and  on the dramas
Flip
Flip
news channel shows a  of The Mark
"Billionaire tech mogul dead in tragic accident
" Two  discuss
here's a guy at the top of his game
And yes there were questions about the money: Where did it all go
Were some of his friends less than friendly to the
But in the end, it's not the feds who catch up with him -- It's that age old adage that boys will be boys
These dangerous hobbies come with the risk of accidents like this -- Bishops punches off the tv, heads for the door
-   - Bishop pulls up in his car, looks up
Hundred of lit windows above him, lives going on behind each
He heads forward, the doorman holding the door for him
, - - Bishop gets out of the elevator, stops in front of a door
Beat
He rings the bell
' ( ) It's open
Bishop pushes the door open, steps into
- Beautifully, warmly furnished
Sofas surround a living area, a gas fire flickering
Throws and rugs
Art on the walls, tasteful and human
An open bottle of wine on a granite counter top
Over all the city, thousands of lights twinkle
9
' 'll just be a minute
We catch a  of the
towel over her hair, wearing a skirt and a bra, crossing from the bathroom into her bedroom
Even in the small glimpse, she's beautiful
Bishop looks down at a coffee table
Magazines, newspaper
picture of the first Mark's elaborate funeral
'm sorry  was away so long this time
had some complications
He turns
She's emerged from the bedroom
30's
Long dark hair, damp from the shower
Buttoning a shirt, the curve of her breasts caught as she does
comfortable, sophisticated air about her
Effortlessly attractive
You don't have to apologize
'm just glad you're here now
() Are you hungry
She starts to move by him, his hand catches her arm and she is in his arms, holding him , kissing him
(') 'm sorry
just
miss you never thought  was going to be a "woman who waits
" But  do wait for you
He nods
She breaks off, pours red wine in a glass
(') Were you in Europe
Africa
() Was there another woman
No
Liar
It's alright
don't mind
(Suddenly shifting gears) made something for you
She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen
Hits a button
moment, then an  flickers to life
: The , sitting in this same living room
She wears a long sleeve shirt over panties
Sips a glass of wine
Smiles warm at the camera
The silence of late night
10
Hey, you
Just got back from the weekend at the lake with Julianne and Barry and their kids
Their oldest is five
You'd like him
() Everybody spoke about you, of course
We should go up there sometime, just the two of us
: She reaches towards the camera and the image Another night, late
The  enters the frame, now wearing a stunning black party dress
(') (announcing, giggling) , just got back from seeing the most boring opening at the Pierre Grochet gallery
And of course everyone's asking where you are and of course  made your apologies, but what  was thinking
: She winks at the camera, happily drunk
Raises her dress a little, suggestive
(') () Why weren't you here to take me home and make love to me
She blows a kiss
Closes her eyes
: Watching
Emotion breaks the surface
The  raises the remote
Turns off the image
Looks at Bishop
Plain, not demanding
But caring
'm not a man who
It wouldn't be good for you, if  was around all the time
know
know
She moves to him and they are kissing fierce
,    - Bishop and the woman make love
She's the aggressor at first, pulling away Bishop's clothing, climbing on top of him, pulling her own clothes away
11
Bishop grabs the woman who  in ecstacy
He reverses her, throwing her down on the bed, climbing on top
The two of them, eye to eye as they fuck
,    - Early morning light filters into the room
Bishop, awake, staring at the sleeping woman
His eyes click over to the clock which reaches 6:00 am
As if he's been waiting, Bishop rises and dresses, silently
-  - Bishop stands in front of the plate glass windows
He turns and moves to a music box on a shelf, opens it
melancholy tune plays
He admires the machinery as he removes twenty $100 bills from his wallet, tucks them under the box
' Stay for breakfast
He turns
She's standing in the doorway, tying a robe around herself
cool professionalism inhabits her demeanor
Not crass or mean-spirited, but the romance is gone
Do  ever
No
But there's a first time for everything
Bishop goes to the  player, slots out the  they watched the night before and pockets it
Thank you
This was a good one
See you next time
Bishop
You all right
He turns, studies her
This is new ground
He nods and leaves
She stares a moment at the door after he's gone
- Bishop, running
Full-tilt again, a maintained sprint
He maneuvers through trees, over rocks
Below him, through the woods, his home comes into view
a   sits parked in front of the house on a cell phone stands by it
12
'  - The man wears a mid-level suit, a hired professional
(into a phone) Yes,  just got here
No, not yet
He turns,  as Bishop is there, , barely sweating
(') ( ) Hold on,  got him
The man holds his cell phone out for Bishop
beat, Bishop studying the angles
he takes the phone
(
) Arthur
Jesus Christ, Arthur, is that you
How are you, Harry
(
) Oh you know, 'm God Damn perfect
'm redecorating my fucking office and  wanted your advice on the god forsaken curtains is how  am
(beat, serious) This is
this is something, Arthur
need to see you, for old time's sake
- Bishop sits in the back, looks out at the city moving around them as the man drives
They approach the armored gates of a business tower:
The driver nods at who recognize the car, open the gate
The car drops down into the garage under the building
- Bishop and the man exit the Bentley
Four more down here, seated around a table, eating delivery from a local Deli
Two stand, one steps forward
Sorry, gotta do this
Patient, Bishop puts his arms out as the man searches him
13
- Bishop steps out of the elevator into a top-level wonderland of money manipulation
Desks, crushed with monitors, manned by casually brilliant -grads
Flat screens track the markets
All of this overseen by a witch's tit of a who eyeballs Bishop coolly
tapping gets Bishop's attention
The corner office is glass-walled
is tapping on it, gesturing Bishop inside
,    - The office is high-tech
Harry less so
60's
Overweight and doesn't give a shit
Cigars in a ashtray, ash-burns on the Persian rugs
man to be reckoned with, in his time
The time has perhaps passed
Harry comes out from behind his desk, points Bishop to a big leather sofa
Bishop perches on the arm
like the new digs
McKenna , like a grunt
Fiddles with his hearing aid, turning it up
Bishop's eyes track
Has it really been that long
Jesus
() You know how they say youth is lost on the young
They're right
If had my nineteen year old body back, wouldn't be here, 'll tell you that
'd be out there, making it my personal life mission to bang every stewardess who ever dared put on one of those whatchamacallit skirts
Times have changed, Harry
They don't wear skirts anymore
McKenna eyeballs Bishop, shakes his head
He goes to the glass wall, points out at the screens, financial markets
You know what all that is
(off Bishop's nod) That's their money, getting moved, exchanged
Made clean and neat and proper for Uncle Sam
And  have always been extremely careful
14
McKenna goes to his desk, tosses legal papers on the table between them
(') You know what that is
That's a God damn subpoena from the Justice Department
We get a new face in the white house, all of a sudden they want to look at my records
They got accountants want to go through
Are you kidding me
got the left hand coming after me for what  did for the right hand
Bishop looks over the papers, nods
(') So  call them up
say "hey, you guys gotta get your own house in order
" And
And
And that's the point
Nothing
tell them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it  get silence, zippo, fuck- all
What are they, twelve
don't see how  can -- That's bullshit, Arthur
Your father -- they still talk about the guy like he walked on water
You, they'll listen to
You -- 'm not a part of that
McKenna stares out the window at the street below, nervous
Shakes a pill out of as small vial, pops it
He chuckles, shakes his head
You remember that fishing trip we all took, back in the day
You were, what
About eight, right
(Off Bishop's nod) You fell out of the boat
couldn't swim a stroke
City kid
(Animated, laughing) You're in the water, splashing around
() 15
(') You got these big eyes like saucers, like you're sure you're gonna drown
Splashing
swallowing water
just  at your father and he's not making a move
Remember
Just looking down at you like
Suddenly it's gotten less funny
(') finally had to grab you by the hair, pull you back into the boat
You're shivering like hell and he -- your dad -- gives one of those laughs
Those big laughs everyone loved him for
() Anyway, the whole time you're in the water, you didn't cry out
Not once
You were a tough sonofabitch, even then
That was a long time ago, Harry
McKenna turns from the window, takes in all his monitors, charts
Stock lines tick up and down, graphs flow, pulse
Well, 'm in the water this time, Arthur
You think it's easy for me to ask
It cuts like hell
But that's what 'm doing
Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the office
Pillows and blankets on a sofa
Some clothes strewn about
McKenna's been sleeping here
long beat
Bishop
nods
The tension seems to from McKenna
He claps Bishop on the back, nods back
(') Thank you
Thank you
Bishop's eyes track as elevator doors open and   steps out, a beautiful young woman with him,
She's a trophy, the woman you get for being top dog and the one you regret getting
Gorgeous, self-obsessed, entitled
She flops onto a leather sofa as Steve moves towards the office
Steve's young, mid-20's, strikingly handsome, wearing the casual uniform of wealth not earned
But there's something else that arrests Bishop immediately
Unwasted motion, detachment, observing the world around him
from above
16
Even as Steve nods to one of his father's security and pushes into the room, he picks up Bishop
The two men lock eyes, a strange reflection not of appearance, but of nature
(') And here's the prodigal son, arrived to bilk me for ransom
( ) Steve, this is Arthur Bishop
Steve shakes Bishop's hand
Strong
Observant
Hey
Nice to meet you
You work for my father
No, quite the opposite
Arthur's doing me a little favor
So you're a criminal
That's enough
Relax, relax
'm kidding
last beat between Steve and Bishop, then Steve lets it go, turns his attention to his father
(') need you to make a donation to Louise's charity
She's mounting some kind of fundraiser and she wants to make sure we do our part
What's it for
have no idea
And don't pretend you care, either
Write the check, go to the party, smile when the --- you and call you a great and generous man
( ) You ever think of having kids, Arthur
Nope
17
Wearily, McKenna brings out his checkbook
Wise man
How much
Thirty thousand
(Suddenly, to Bishop) You know,  can't tell what you're thinking, Mr
Bishop
Usually, 'm very good with that, with people
Sort of like a bullshit detector developed
But you're very
hard to read
Sorry
Don't be
So what are you thinking
was thinking that a son, should be more grateful to his father
() agree
agree
often wonder why 'm not
McKenna tears the check out, hands it to Steve
There
Now go away
Thank you, dad
Are we going to see you at the house any time soon
Yeah, this is just a few more days
We got this
situation
Steve hears the dark in his father's tone, tracks it
Anything  can do
You
Yeah, you can earn some money
Get married
() No, it's going to be okay now
Arthur's helping me out
Steve glances between the two men
Ego slightly bruised
18
Well it's good to meet you Mr
Bishop
My father seems to trust you, which is
unusual
Bishop and McKenna watch as he hits the atrium, hands Louise the check who goes out of her mind, jumping up and down, giving him a kiss that speaks of more to come, trotting off
Steve glances back one more time, then follows her
We will take from our children for a lifetime what we would not suffer from another man for an instant
Explain that to me
(off Bishop's silence) Okay
Okay, call me when you hear something
You take care of yourself, Harry
Well, that's your job now, isn't it
- Bishop exits the elevator
Security holds the door to the Bentley open for him
Bishop shakes his head, walks out
'  - Bishop exits an old freight elevator, enters this  loft space
Old architecture divided by free-standing walls hung with  from the same artist who's work hangs in Bishop's home
Intense, slightly surreal, deeply haunting
Nudes, raw
Men's faces, distraught, alone
matronly   comes forward familiar, takes his hand
Arthur
Glad you're here
Right this way
As they move across the space Bishop catches sight of a , lying nude in a pool of blue paint
Across from her, The  is full-focused on her
He's roughly Bishop's age
Cigarette dangles off a lip, tattoos on his arms
Fully comfortable and committed to the alternative life
The model senses Bishop's gaze, looks over, unashamed
19
(') This way
Bishop follows the Dealer into another area where they approach a canvas
It's a portrait of a young boy, alone
The effect is of rage-filled isolation
(') Zak is almost finished
It will make a wonderful addition to your collection
Bishop looks at the canvas
Nods
Glances back to where the artist is carefully adjusting his model's position
(') Do you want to meet him
No
'  - Bishop enters his home, sets his things down
Stares at his phone a beat, then on impulse picks it up and dials
The voice that answers is female, official
' Good evening, Mr
Bishop
How can help you
Yes
'd like to speak to Dean
There's a brief pause on the phone, then
' Mr
Dean is not available right now
Can  take a message
No
Just tell him  called
Bishop hangs up, stares at the phone
The doorbell rings
Bishop opens it to find a   on his doorstep
Bishop is suddenly casual, friendly
The public face of Bishop
(') Hello, Don
They make you drive all the way out here this evening
That's the job
20
The man gestures to the open barn door, the classic cars
(') You find tires for that old FleetMaster
() No, not yet
Maybe when  do, we'll take it out for a spin
Say hello to the wife for me
Will do
Good night, Arthur
The man heads back towards his truck
Bishop tears away the strip that seals the envelope, a small  jump-drive slides into his hands
The friendly grin on Bishop's face
evaporates
- Bishop fires up a computer hooked to a printer
He slots the drive into the computer
Nothing seems to happen, just a low pulsing red light on the drive
Almost instantly, his phone rings and he answers
Silence
( ) We should all be so lucky
Click
The phone goes dead
Almost at the same time, the glowing red light on the jump-drive turns
Bishop's  fires up
It starts printing out pages few medical charts
and then a photograph: Harry McKenna
The new mark
- Bishop eats
Lost in thought
Eyes play over his art
- Bishop hits the study, work-mode
All hesitation gone
Pages are tacked up, other ripped down and tossed
He takes out a thick pen, circles words: "Syncope cardiac spasms
" "Prognosis
" "Poor eustachian tube function
" 21
- Bishop sits at a desk under a reading lamp, making notes out of a stack of books
Medical textbooks
Charts
diagram of the central nervous system
Stress tests
The technical specs for an electronic device
- Bishop receives a    from an attendant
Spreads them out over a counter
In the corner, a large photocopier
'  - Bishop sits at his desk, a Jeweler's Loup over one eye, working with soldering iron and electronic tools, meticulous
Behind him, tacked to the wall, are copies of the building plans
Heavily inked
Routes in and out penned in
Locations of security
Photographs
He's done his recon
Sitting in the sun on a window ledge: an open jar of Mayonnaise, turning rancid
fly buzzes around it
' : Bishop is working on a hearing aide
Tweezers adjust a tiny chip, slot it into place
Phone rings
Bishop eyes it for a beat
Snaps it up
The voice on the other end is world weary, professional
(
) Bishop
heard you called
Hey, you get the stuff  sent you
That's what  called about
know him
think there might be a -- (
) Hold on a second
long pause
Just air on the line
Bishop stares at his work in front of him, his research on McKenna tacked to the wall
Dean's voice comes back as suddenly as it departed
(
) (') No, it's been decided
This one's a go
You take care of yourself, Bishop
The line goes dead
Bishop stares at the phone for a second, sets it down
He looks up at Harry's picture on the wall
22
- The sun rises over the city, shafts of light illuminating the top floor plate glass of McKenna Holding Corp
The , being picked up
' Hello
' They want to talk
'm picking you up in an hour
' -- ' Send your people home
don't want anyone  don't know near you today
'm serious
' Thank you, Arthur
- Bishop hangs up his phone, watches as three bags of food are put up on the   counter
"McKenna Garage" scrawled
Bishop approaches the counter, reaches over the bags for his own food, pushing his drink onto the floor
'm sorry
My bad
The guy at the counter shrugs, turns for a mop
Bishop quickly reaches into the McKenna bag, switches a wrapped sandwich for one he brought
- white van passes the entrance to the underground garage, pulls into the Alley behind the building and stops
- Bishop kills the engine, pushes aside a curtain and heads into the back of the van which is empty aside for a heavy acetylene torch
The bottom of the van is covered by a thick black matt which Bishop kicks with his foot
The matt falls aside revealing a large  in the bottom of the van, right down to the pavement and the welded steel cover Bishop has parked on top of
23
Bishop picks up the torch,
- The four  are eating their delivered lunch
Security #1 puts a hand to his gut
Security #2 looks over
#2 Hey, you okay
#1 Actually, call central
'm not -- And with that, he's suddenly up and  towards the bathroom
Security #2 raises his radio
,
- Elevator doors open
Another   steps out, checks in by radio and heads down a corridor
behind him, Bishop drops through the ceiling hatch, dressed casual
He hits a button, doors close
'  - Elevator doors open and Bishop steps out into the office
Deserted
Monitors glow, tracking markets and trades
But the human element is gone
Except for Harry, alone, silhouetted at one of his large plate windows, watching the sun rise over the city
You ever wonder what the last day of your life will feel like, Arthur
You keep standing next to that window, maybe you'll be able to tell me
McKenna looks over, smiles weary
He looks exhausted
He goes to his desk, picks up a tie, looks to Bishop
This turns out alright, 'm going to send you a dozen Thai hookers and a case of Cuban Esplandidos
You can return the hookers if you want, but the cigars
24
() don't smoke
You will, my friend
For these, you will
- Bishop and McKenna heading down
McKenna watches the numbers
Bishop studies McKenna
then, casually: Why the change of security
What
Beat
Bishop  the  button
Elevator jerks to a halt
Bishop gets a finger into the doors,  them open
(') Arthur
McKenna looks at the effort, sighs
Lets Bishop help him down
Halfway through,  , McKenna starts to fall
Bishop  him
McKenna  at Bishop, concerned
Bishop nods, heading towards the , pocketing a small hearing aide as he goes
, touching the hearing aide in his ear
Come on
- Bishop and McKenna reach the bottom of the stairwell
McKenna's winded, steadying himself against a wall
Bishop cracks the door, peers out
What the hell
McKenna moves in, pushes Bishop aside
'
: His
Only there are two new faces in the garage
Replacements packing weaponry
This isn't good, Arthur
25
Listen to me
Stay here
'm going to check it out
Bishop, those men are armed
Harry, relax
know what 'm doing
And Bishop slips out the door, shutting it behind him
- The moment he's out, he turns and sinks down in front of it, blocking it with his back
He opens his jacket, brings out a small
Waits a beat, then flicks a switch
- McKenna there,  at the door
Nothing
He approaches the steel door, tries the handle
Can't open it
Nervous, he carefully puts his head against the door to listen
The   ,  fill McKenna's ears
He staggers back, crouched, terrified
: The sounds of gunfire is coming from it
More shots, then the sound of on the door
' Harry
It's a trap
The door flies opens and Bishop  , gun raised
McKenna starts up the stairs, breathing hard
Behind him, he can see Bishop, gun lined back at the door
Gunshots assault his eardrums
- On the other side of the door, Security hears the door slam, looks over for a moment, but there's nothing else
- McKenna picks up the pace, hauling himself upwards
Sweat off him, eyes wild
He stops, tries to catch his breath
Shooting  through his right arm, he grabs it just as    from below
26
Bishop comes rushing up the stairs
His shirt stained with blood
Gun in his hand
Come on
If we can get to the roof can hold them off
Come on
McKenna  , staggers on
,    - Door  open, McKenna staggers onto the rooftop
The manic victory of having made it clashing with the tragic knowledge that his heart is rebelling
He falls to his knees, clutching his right arm coursing through his body
Unaware for the moment that everything has gone silent
come into his view
He looks up, sees Bishop standing over him
Bishop's face is a death mask
Emotion removed
Harry stares into his eyes
and understands
You
Bishop nods
McKenna  which turns into a scream as sends him reeling
He falls, hitting his head
Blood rolls down his face
(') You bastard
You
Sonofabitch
You didn't have the balls
The balls to
He
Tears stream down his face
His body , not giving up the ghost
We know it's in there
But it doesn't show
Instead he checks his watch, calculates time
(') Oh God
Oh, Jesus Christ help me
Please
Please
Please
McKenna stops struggling, stares up at Bishop
Tears streaming down his face
(') Please, Arthur, put me out of my misery
Your father
Bishop checks his watch again, doesn't meet McKenna's eyes
Checks the stair door, looks over the building edge
27
(') Please
'm scared
'm really god damn scared
Suddenly Bishop
Lightening fast, wrapping up McKenna's head, fingers  expertly along arteries
McKenna   one horrible second, then goes limp in his arms, dead
Bishop releases, stands, stares down
For the first time, uncertainty in his face
Why did he do that
He looks at the body, at his hands, out at the city
Wipes his forehead with the back of a hand, furious at himself
He reaches down, removes the hearing aide from McKenna's ear, replaces it with the original, turns away
McKenna's body, alone on the rooftop
,    - as he pushes through doors into a  of Police, detectives, private security, lawyers, all milling about on phones, gathered around a figure on the ground
'  - The Art Dealer hands Bishop the finished painting, wrapped
At the far end of the studio the Artist and his friends smoke and drink and laugh
Bishop nods thanks, turns and leaves
,    - Steve stares down at his dead father
draws a line around the body
Steve is expressionless
'  - Bishop backs off from the wall where he has just hung the new painting of the boy
It stares back at him
,    - Blue-gray morning
Cold wind blows across the rooftop
Steve watches the last police leave
He's alone
He stares down at the outline where his father lay
28
- funeral in progress, hundreds of flower arrangements, decorations, fit for a head of state
few dozen attendees
At the front, Steve McKenna sits in front of his father's coffin, cold
His girlfriend Louise next to him, weeping
She cries at funerals
Bishop stands at the back
His eyes scan over the proceedings
Sixth-sense, Steve suddenly turns his head, makes eye contact with Bishop
His good works comfort all of us, even in his going
We commit his remains to your earth, oh Father, and we pray you vouchsafe him eternal life and that you bring comfort to those who have been left behind
His only son, Steve, who is himself devoted to -- The Priest falters as Steve rises, moves away from the event
Bishop tracks him as he wanders through gravestones
(') Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost
-  () At the gravesite, men fill in the hole with dirt
Nearby, six limousines are lined up
But only the one directly after the hearse has its door open for Louise who stands, waiting, looking for Steve
Bishop watches the dirt hit the coffin
Then looks over as Steve approaches through mausoleums
My condolences
() Yeah, Harry was a popular guy
Good to see so many of his friends here
Touching
Bishop considers, tracks the attendees who pass by a suited man as they leave
Each of them receiving and pocketing an envelope as they do
Bishop looks back to Steve
(') Best grief money can buy
Give me a ride home
29
Bishop nods to the head limo where Louise is waving impatiently at Steve to come
Looks like you have one
Yeah, all of that
Empty limos
Fake guests
All so that the papers print what an important and respected man Harry was
Steve takes in the one or two guests, already counting their money a few yards away
Shakes his head
(') Well,  hope it's what Harry would have wanted
But it's not for me
Beat
Bishop nods
'  - Bishop steers the car into the hills, past high-end estates
You know, what  don't get is you
Harry didn't have any friends
Your dad worked with my father a long time ago
So
So, just paying my respects
So your old man was into all that
( ) Yeah, he was into all that
Well, that is refreshingly honest, Mr
Bishop
What about you
Bishop doesn't answer, steers the car up a manicured drive
-   : An
main house, lawns, pools, guest houses
30
- Steve and Bishop get out of the car
The McKenna estate was modeled neoclassical for a wanna-be emperor
Now a week of youth with limitless credit has left its mark has been set up poolside
spins a trance-like deep groove
lounge around the pool in bikinis, less
Beautiful and bored
, most dressed modern hip-hop, mostly white, eyeball the women, fist-bump each other, drink beers
Steve takes the whole thing in, nods, somehow pleased
Why is it so comforting, when people surpass even our lowest expectations
() Come on in, meet the crowd
No, thanks
've got to -- Please
favor to me
None of these people even remembered what today was
Bishop nods
They move into the scene
People recognize Steve, hug or bump-fists
Steve's friendly, but stays locked on Bishop
Bishop observes it all, not uncomfortable
(') Do you believe in fate, Mr
Bishop
Why
basketball hoop has been set up near the pool
Young men take turns dunking and then landing in the water
think maybe we're all doomed to become our fathers
'll probably die spoiled, corrupt, lonely and alone
Runs in the blood
What would that make you
You're still young
You can do pretty much whatever you please
, two girls kiss each other, filmed in  by an young entrepreneur
31
You think so
Just chuck all this and go help the children in South America, something like that
Maybe
Well look at you, Mr
Bishop
You're a dreamer
Steve heads inside
beat, Bishop follows
- As soon as they enter, Steve finds himself locked up by two who whisper excitedly in his ear
#1 Well
Do you want to
No, in fact 'm pretty sure that's illegal in this state
( ) Come on, this way
Steve leaves the Beauties disappointed, moves up some stairs
Bishop follows
- Steve and Bishop move into another room where two flatscreens have converted the room into a Wii court
Young muscle-bound posers play a first person head-to-head shoot-em game
Others drink,
Two bump fists with Steve
One fronts cool at Bishop, fakes a punch at him
Bishop just watches, doesn't do a thing
The kid smiles, nods
On the floor, paintings of Harry McKenna, discarded
,   - This used to be Harry's realm
Now Steve's taken it over
Giant ornate king bed
Huge balcony overlooking the estate
Steve goes to the railing of the balcony, looks down at the grounds, the people
Bishop hangs back, glances into a private study, untouched from when Harry ruled there
Papers, books, a portrait of Harry over the desk
32
You know,  went up there
To where my father died
Oh
Hell of a place to die
Lonely
Bishop comes abreast of Steve, also looks down
Removed from the party and the pool area, a separate area of the estate contains an outdoor gym
Weights, exercise equipment, a fighting matt and martial arts equipment all present
(off the gym area) That all yours
If the body is weak, the mind can't be strong
Bishop nods, impressed
Something about this young man
Engaged, observing Bishop, but not needy
(
) Steve
Steve, man
It's Louise
At the door, a  of Steve's is held back by security
She's up in the bungalow
think she might really do it this time
( ) My girlfriend thinks that my father's death is a good time to kill herself
She thinks 'm not showing the appropriate human reaction
'll let myself out
No, please
You've seen this much
Aren't you interested
am
Off Bishop
33
,   - Steve and Bishop push through a guarded gate, up a small path arriving at a beautiful bungalow, set back in the gardens
Candle light glows inside
,   - Louise is nude, immersed in the water of a jacuzzi located in the center of the room
On the side, she has a bottle of scotch, some pills, and two razor blades
She looks up at Steve, streaked eyes dart to Bishop
Who's he
friend
Would have thought you'd have started by now
This isn't about me
It's about you
You need to watch
Steve crouches down, pours himself a shot from her whiskey bottle
Something angry and cold in his eyes
Okay
'm here
'm watching
You don't believe 'll do it
No,  know you, Louise
You'll do just about anything if it'll get you enough attention
You think you can hide behind that cool attitude
Like nothing matters to you
But  know you
You care
You feel
Do
Louise blinks, scared a little
But she pushes the fear away, picks up one of the razor blades
beat, then with a quick gesture, she slices across one wrist
Blood rises to the surface, runs down her arms into the water
Steve doesn't move
Neither does Bishop
Louise picks up the second blade with the cut hand
Fingers fumble, but she gets it
Slices across her other wrist
34
Blood runs
stains the water rose
(') Wow
How long will it take
( ) Mr
Bishop
Bishop rises, looks down at her in the tub
How much do you weigh
hundred and ten
His eyes take in her body, the flow from her wrists
You're a hundred and twenty-five
It'll take an hour and a half, maybe two
When you get cold
then you'll know you're close
Steve takes in Bishop in this moment, nods
Glances at the clock: 9:30
Then he refills his drink, heads out to the patio outside
Sits facing away from them
He'll stop it
He thinks he's above it all
But he's not
No one is
Bishop nods
Not clear if he's agreeing or observing
,   - Bishop sits with Steve on the patio
From inside, Louise's soft crying can be heard
Seen through the trees in front of them, young people dance, splash, party
( ) Steve
Steve
know you feel this
know you'll stop me
( ) If you don't care anything about your life, why should
Steve looks to Bishop
He checks his watch
10:30
35
'm getting cold
Please
'm frightened
'm scared, Steve
Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring outwards
You can help her if you want
The sounds of water, splashing
Louise arrives on the patio, a blood-stained robe loosely pulled on around her
Mascara eyes ran
She stares down at Steve
You're a bastard
You know what the kick of it is, Louise
If you actually had the stones, then there's be something for us
But in 30 seconds when you run down that path and all of those people go crazy saving your life
Well, then we'll be done
() know
Catch-22
Life's not fair
() What happened to you
Maybe nothing
Maybe you never really knew me
beat
Louise, looking between the two men
She  on her feet and Bishop puts a hand out, steadies her
You're a bastard, too
Both of you
Like looking in some dark mirror
Go on, Louise
You'll do fine
The world's gonna love you
Louise steps away, turns, stumbling down the path into the dark
beat, the men just watching after her and then a from below
,
People rush to Louise, help her to the ground
Others pulling out cell phones, call for help
Louise's  cries drift back
Would you have let her do it
36
We'll never know, will we
Steve rises, heads up a small path
- Steve and Bishop, walking high above the estate
Far below them, the lights of an ambulance in the driveway
You didn't answer my question
Everybody dies
Sure
But it's a whole other world when you're personally involved
There's a very big tab that has to be picked up
Such as
Bishop stops, looks down at the action far below them
Governments, cops, the military
we give young men a licence and send them into it blind, thinking it'll all be okay
Because someone told them they had permission
() But when you cross over that line, you do it alone
Most people, they stay that way from then on
Alone
Everybody can kill
You take a mother, protecting her child
Sure
But that's instinct
What 'm talking about is up here
(tapping his head) Knowledge of foresight
Intention
person who knows that the only way to truly be free of man's laws, is to break his highest one
Beat
It sits there, between them
Why are you telling me all this
37
Why did you want me to see that little stunt with your girlfriend
Bishop stares down the hill at the commotion
Ants swarming
(') These aren't your people, are they
You don't have "people
" Your life is crowded, but you're alone
Steve unconsciously nods, then: You know, you're right
You grow up spoiled, rich, like me
Only thing you really learn to recognize in people is when someone wants something from you
() What do you want, Mr
Bishop
What are you doing here
Bishop considers Steve, thrown
Then
Thanks for the tour
It's been interesting
Yes, it has
Bishop turns, heads back down towards the estate
Steve watches him go
'  - Bishop stares down at the line of supplements and pills set out in front of him, something gnawing at him
His cat nuzzles around his legs, purring
He scoops up the lot, washes them down with water

Everybody says hi, of course
But with me

He looks out at the restaurant

'
: Laughter, smiles, hands touching, hands waving mid-story, lips parting
Woman's hands touching their necks, eyes sparkling, men laughing, wallets flashing
Bishop rises suddenly, his hand going to his wallet, trying to get out of there
He steadies himself, moves towards the exit
People look over, alarmed as he grabs backs of chairs to steady himself
, sounds and suddenly he's  into blackness
- Bishop, shirtless
is examining the injury
Professional, but attractive
And attracted to him
Her hands on his shoulder, gentle
Her other hand on his back
Her eyes play over his form: , , healed battlefield for a body
Quite a collection you have here
Military
Something like that
Does this hurt
Bishop smiles, recognizing the nature of the touch
Yes, a little
The doctor lets her hands rest just a fraction too long, then moves across the room, writes in a chart
Any next of kin, anybody we can notify
(off his shake no) How about an acquaintance
Am  going to die
() No, not today
Bishop reaches for his shirt, slips it on
(') You damaged your deltoid muscle
But that doesn't explain the anxiety attack

(') Any unusual stress recently
Something at work
(off his shake no) 'm prescribing Cataflam for the pain and Paxil for the stress and 'm going to give you my card
If you have any other episodes
or if you need anything else, don't hesitate to give me a call
She holds out her card
He looks at her, lets her stay that way for a moment, then takes the card
She looks away

The Doc demonstrates the precise hold, the pressure points that killed Harry McKenna

Finally stops in front of his house
He feels his injured shoulder, winces

on his front door
Bishop's eyes  open
He's on his feet, instantly alert, moving past a sideboard
He touches a hidden catch, a "click" and he reaches underneath, comes out with a handgun

Mr
Bishop
Arthur
Please, need to speak with you
The front door opens
Bishop, fronting sleepy
Steve is , , eyes blazing
What time is it
wanna show you something
Please
It'll be
It'll be interesting

Bishop is shotgun
The rear area usually reserved for passengers is empty
Gonna tell me what the big surprise is
'd rather show you
know, melodramatic
But  think it'll be worth it to you
Bishop , almost imperceptible as Steve pilots the car into the underground structure beneath McKenna Holding Corp

Steve grabs a case, is out
Bishops takes in the area
Two of Steve's  there, looking stern
Bishop checks the gun he has concealed in his waistband, reaches for his door

Steve pushes out onto the roof
Bishop follows
Security lighting floods on, illuminating the desolate surface in eerie even light

Steve opens his case, starts tossing down : : Harry McKenna
Dead on the roof
Other details
The doors, the elevator shaft, everything
, coroner's documents
Medical photographs
() Maybe it's time you start talking
(off the papers) You know what that says
My dad didn't die of a heart attack mean, he was dying of a heart attack, but that's not what killed him
The blood flow to his brain was cut off, his brain died before his body
Somebody killed him
On Bishop, considering Steve
What do the police think
() The police
They don't want to hear about this
mean, they'll look into it
But they don't very much like the idea that they totally missed this one and it'd be just easier for everyone if  would shut the hell up
What do you want
They killed him
Here, on the roof of his own building
His own security all around
Why here
Why even kill him, if he was already dying
You tell me
To make a point
That no one's safe
That they can get to anyone, whenever they want to
So what am  doing here
Bishop, supremely alert, listening
Tracking shadows
43
got my black belt in Karate when was nineteen
've studied Judo since  was six
'm impressed
No, you're not
Most people are, but you're not
If  came at you right now, 'd wind up dead as my father, wouldn't
Bishop doesn't answer
Steve breaks away, looks down at the place where his father died
(') Same as if  tried to exact justice for my father
These men, what this is
It's something you know about, isn't it
() Something you could teach me
didn't get the impression you even liked Harry very much
Steve  forward
Real anger, intensity boiling over
You really going to stand there and judge how much  loved my father
What the hell do you know about it
Bishop, hearing this
nerve touched
(') Besides, this isn't just about Harry
Harry's dead, may he rest in peace
But this is about me
They came here and they killed my father
They did that to me
You want revenge
Steve doesn't answer
long moment between them
Steve turns, looks out over the city
You know the word "Nemesis"
It's not actually a word
It's a name

Of anger

Bishop shakes his head, turns, starts to walk back towards the elevators
Steve collects his papers, angry
( ) Fine
Fine
In case you haven't noticed,  now have a couple of million dollars to spend on this, so  will find them myself and 'll deal with them myself and if  wind up dead trying, you can bury me right next to dear old dad -- Jesus, stop your whining
No one's ever spoken to Steve that way

Bishop nods, starts to leave, turns back
And Steve
no more surprises like this, okay
Steve nods
Bishop goes
On Steve, watching as the elevator doors erase the older man
'  - Bishop stands in the middle of his home, still
Thinking
Then he moves to his office, grabs a newspaper

Hits a button, the white light of the scanner passes

Bishop hoists the painting down off the wall
He has a print- out from his computer, tacks it in the center of the blank space left by the painting: The picture of Steve, scanned from the McKenna Obituary, enlarged
Tacked alone on the wall

- Bishop stands on the corner, waiting
He checks his watch: 6:58
Steve's Bentley pulls up to the corner, parks in a handicapped space
Steve gets out, nods to Bishop
Bishop takes in Steve, the Bentley, a metermaid ten yards away, already moving towards them
- Bishop enters this linoleum-lined hallway, slips the bored $100
The man hits a button, a door  open
- As they enter, fluorescent lights flicker on
Cheap, overused
Some burnt out, others shorting
line the room
Bodies, covered in green morgue drapes
Steve's eyes play over it
He swallows
Bishop is cold, business-like
Stay focused
This is a test
Bishop moves down the rows, pulling drapes away as he does
Nude  are revealed
Men, women, teens
In some, the reason for their death is obvious
Others aren't telling
(') You want to know about killing, look around
Steve does, a little creeped out, but keeping it cool
(') The act of killing, is an end in itself
Any other motive keeps it from being pure
The psychopath has no motive
46
No, he's driven, compelled, by his sickness
He's as much the victim as those he kills
More drapes fall
Dead eyes stare up at them
(') But when you make your own law, you're responsible to no one else but yourself
Maybe you're free

Do you
This isn't some idea anymore
This is the real thing
You still with me

Another drape falls

No signs of injury
Ever heard the term "Mechanic" used outside of its normal meaning
My father used it
dealer
a guy who works the tables
Bishops smiles, shakes his head
(') Or a
killer
hit man
Bishop just stares
Steve shakes his head, looks away from Bishop, winds up staring at a dead man
Laughs to himself
What are you thinking
had you pegged as
a security consultant
Maybe ex-military
Someone who
protects people
Maybe  do
Or maybe you just get paid to kill people
Bishop nods his head yes
47
(') So why let me in
mean,  know what  want
What do you get out of it
Times are changing
Security is better trained, more lethal
Sometimes  could use a partner
Bullshit
Bishop nods, smiles
He moves away from the tables, leaves Steve standing in the middle of it all
In this
there isn't room for those who are outside of it
There's too much isolation
Friendships can't work
Eventually everyone expects you to account
The isolation
becomes a liability
You stand out
Standing out
isn't good
Steve smiles, shakes his head
You need a
friend
An associate
() 'm offering to teach you something that most people can't be taught
Because you think 'm a natural
That remains to be seen
(taps his head) But you're alone in there, aren't you
That's
the prerequisite
Steve continues to stare at the bodies
Bishops starts towards the exit

Bishop who takes the punch, steps back
Steve's still on him
Kicking, two, three times
Bishop catches a kick, tosses Steve back
He lands cat-like on his feet, comes back at Bishop, strong
Hitting, pushing Bishop back against a wall, seeming to dominate the fight
buzzer goes off
Bishop drops his guard, would be flattened if Steve didn't pull his punch, walks out
'  - Behind Bishop's gym is a rifle range
An assortment of weapons lie on a table
In front of them, some trees, some old cars
some bottles sitting on the limbs of the trees
Bishop picks up a handgun, checks his pulse
Steve has obviously learned from him, does the same
Bishop raises the gun
Two bottles shatter at 30 yards
He tosses Steve the gun
Steve keeps two fingers on his pulse
'm still at 130
Too fast

'm working on it
Bishop nods, picks up the rifle, sights
1,000 yards away, the bullet  the head-rest of an abandoned car
Bishop looks to Steve who gives up, raises the handgun
Three shots
Three misses
Steve tosses down the gun, frustrated
You were still over 100

What am  supposed to do
There are no perfect situations
You fought me at 100%, so you were winning
But in doing so, you gave up your shooting option

They  for position, in and out of the other cars on the road
Portrait of control
Expertly working the tuned car, coaxing power and speed out of it
Careless, going for broke, not caring if he has the space to make his moves
He  his car, right at Bishop
who has to  away, off the highway, onto the smooth dirt-pack
He , blasts back onto the road, catching air
Steve  out load as they  the top of a rise
: An existing accident
beer truck jack- knifed across the freeway
Bishop , fighting for control
Steve  his car, too fast, it goes into a another car, gains air and  ass-backwards into the side of the beer truck
'  slides to a stop
Bishop gets out, tracks: , climbing out of the Maserati onto the hood protruding from the side of the truck
,  at the sky
Bishop approaches, sees that hundreds of bottles of  have cascaded out of the punctured truck
Steve wipes blood from a cut on his forehead, grabs a beer and cracks it, swigs as he sits on the Maserati hood
He grabs another, tosses it to Bishop

Come on up, man
The view is beautiful
Bishop takes in the situation, the small crowd gathering
he jumps up, sits on the hood of the car with Steve, both leaning back against the cracked windshield
You lost control
You think
Steve puts out his beer
hesitation, then Bishop clinks beers with him
They both drink
Stretched out in front of them, the highway seems to go on forever

Leaving
Never turning back
Sometimes
Why don't you

Steve  loud
Bishop laughs
Maybe the first time in ages
They drink, watch the sun move lower in the sky as emergency vehicles approach
'  - Steve comes in from the guest-house, showered
Sees Bishop at the dining room table, takes in the place for the first time
The art on the walls
You know, looking at these, a person might think maybe there's a screw or two loose up there

Music, voices, crowds of people
Bishop moves through
Dressed average, just a guy in the crowd
He watches a couple argue

Most of these people know they're targets
They'll be watching for you

(
) (') You need to understand the location, control the situation
You're looking for escapes, security, police presence
Bishop passes two , squeezes between two parked produce trucks towards the row of shops that border the square
- Bishop stands in front of a case, watches the precision instruments tick
From behind a counter, the Chinese notices him, puts down the watch he's repairing, approaches
60's, authoritative, a  on his forehead
Interest you in anything
Bishop takes in the man, eyes check polished reflective surfaces, back to the man
Bishop points to a watch
That's a beauty
() You know your instruments
52
- Concealed amidst exotic Guatemalan wraps, Steve tracks the Watch Shop
The attractive older woman running the stall eyes him
He looks right through her
'
: Bishop exits, heading back into the market
(
) Most of all, you need to answer this question: "How does this man die here today
" Bishop passes a butcher cutting into a slab of meat
Steve follows behind Bishop, lost in the sea of people
(
) (') Everybody, everyday, has a way to die
You have to find it
,   - Bishop stands in front of stall filled with classic toys, rocking horses, vintage dolls
His gaze finds a large, still- boxed doll of the "Luna Cromwell" character that the Grocery Owner's Daughter is obsessed with
Almost life-sized
They don't make that anymore
That's a classic
can let you have it for three hundred
- Bishop turns away from the stand carrying the doll of teens  by Bishop, buffeting him for a moment
Slightly off kilter, he checks his surroundings
Nothing
Bishop starts again, aware for the first time that a  is headed his direction, passing a knife-sharpening stand, blades gleaming, his face hidden by a low hat
Bishop tracks the figure out of the corner of his eye, turns and pushes through the tight space between two stalls, out the back where trucks are parked
Bishops glances back for the man, squeezes between two large trucks
coming out the other side when
loud  makes Bishop glance over
coming from one of the trucks which starts to  backwards and Suddenly  are on Bishop from behind, backwards, into the space between the two trucks

Bishop checks the surroundings, nods
Steve release him
Good
Very good
Good
That's all you got
How about God damn perfect, man
Don't get cocky
Broad daylight
thousand witnesses
Man takes a wrong step
Excuse me if  take a moment to appreciate myself
Because that was poetry
(laughing, smiling) You just can't bring yourself to be impressed, can you
Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has fallen in the gutter
Picks it up, tries to dry it
(') (hand to his ear) What's that
You're what
Oh, you are impressed
No, come on, you don't have to say that
Really, 'm fine with -- You what
You've never seen someone better
Wow
All right
You did very well
Damn straight  did
And now, in celebration of me, 'm taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses

Something about Bishop's serious gaze has stopped Steve
Bishop reaches into his jacket, places a gun in Steve's hands
confused beat, Steve conceals the weapon
(') Bishop
54
There's a man behind me
Look up once, then look away
Don't look back
Steve glances up
We realize we're right in front of the watch store
The  is pulling the steel grate down over his store, closing for the day
(') You got him
Yeah
Look
You did good here
Really good
But this was just a game
That man
is your graduation
Who is he
He owns the watch store
know
meant
what did he do
Bishop comes close,
've taught you how to kill without anyone knowing there was a murder
've taught you to be invisible
But that's strategy, not killing
The real test
it's the actual killing, isn't it
Bishop
Do you want this
Be very sure
Because you can walk away
No
'm ready
Bishop studies him
nods
Turns to go
(') Bishop
We're right here, where you wanted us to wind up
You knew where 'd hit you, didn't you
55
School's out
Bishop leaves
Steve watches him go
Stuck
Helpless
He turns back
The Owner is headed home for the day
- Bishop sits back at his reserved table in the rear of the place
In a chair next to him, the doll is awkwardly perched
Around him, people
Lovers
He reaches into his breast pocket, slides out a new envelope, tears it open
new jump-drive slides onto the table
He eats, takes pills, his eyes locked on the drive
(to Luna doll) Who do you think that is, Luna
He takes a card out of his wallet, studies it
It's from the flirtatious doctor
He pulls out his phone, dials
- Steve sits in a nondescript car, lights out, parked
'
: Two stories up, a lit apartment
The crosses by one of the lit windows
'  - The Owner has a delicate vintage Brietlang in his hands
He places it on a patch of velvet, watch-repair tools laid next to it
He moves to an old stereo, puts the needle of a turn- table down on spinning vinyl
The lonely sounds of Brahms Piano Concerto No
2 fill the room
He returns to his desk, sits
tiny noise from the hall "click
" He looks up, sees nothing, settles in to work
To the front
Steve stands in the hallway, motionless
He's just closed the front door behind him
In his hands, a lock-pick set which he now pockets and pulls out the gun Bishop gave him
- No way to tell where he is
He's holding the Luna doll
He reaches forward, knocks on a door
56
' ( ) It's open
- The 's apartment
Not the doctor's, the same we've been to before
Everything eerily identical to the last time
Sofas, gas fire, throws and rugs, open bottle of wine
' 'll just be a minute
of the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a vanity
She glances back, smiles warm
Laughs a little when she sees the doll
It's for a friend
Bishop awkwardly sets the doll down near the front door, moves on, into the apartment
Restless
(') 'm sorry  was away so long this time
had some complications -- ' Don't be
He turns
She's emerged from the bedroom, adjusting the dress she's just pulled on
Beautiful
She comes up to him, kisses him
He doesn't respond
She backs off, moves to the kitchen to pour two wines, You know who  saw yesterday
() Bradley Fliescher
He and Ginny have this little cottage up the coast they hardly use
was thinking, maybe next week you and should go
Approaching, handing him a wine
(') You and me, the whole weekend
What would we
do
She approaches him, sexy
Touches him, intimate
He stares at her, blank
She recovers fast, moves off
(') Of course why do we need that
We have each other right here

'  - Carefully, slowly, Steve makes his way down the hall towards the lit living room
The owner pauses, enjoying the crescendo of the music
Eyes closed for a moment
Then they open
Steve is standing in the doorway to the living room, the gun pointed at the owner
The owner sees him, becomes motionless
The two men staring across the space between them

The Owner  to the side with surprising speed and agility just as Steve
The bullet catches the Owner in the side,  him around

Steve tracks, pulls the trigger again but the gun only "clicks" empty
The man reaches a coat rack, grabs it in one fluid motion and is  back at Steve who barely has time to drop the gun and  the rack as it  through the air at him
The Owner  and  again
Skilled, professional, martial-arts trained
Steve blocking one, two, the third hit connects, sends Steve  back, crashing through the watch-repair table
The Owner leaps at him with the rack
Steve is  able to catch the end before it impales him

Blood pools on Steve's shirt
Steve and the Owner both track it

Bishops turns from the screen, walks away

He's staring at her, oddly

His eyes move down to her sofa where another man's tie has been discarded

The pretense dropping
The real woman scooping up the tie, tossing in a drawer

You didn't give me any warning this time

It won't happen again

Listening for his target
His hand moves to the wound in his side, comes away covered in blood
Another decision, the man slides the weapon over his shoulder, retreats

He reaches his , blows inside

Steve takes brutal punches to the head and face
Blocks one and they , rolling in the tight space of the hallway, the man coming up on top, pinning Steve's arm,  him in the ribs
Something

Fierce, deadly

Carefully, she comes and takes the seat opposite him
No pretense
The professional, not the actor

He stares into his wine
Raises the glass to drink
His hand shakes
Do you remember, what you wanted to be, when you were a little girl

Then he slides the money under the box as before

He leaves, grabbing the doll as he goes
She watches him go, strangely
Sadness breaking through her cool
- Bell jingles as Bishop pushes in, holding the large Luna Cromwell doll
The Grocer looks up, smiling as he sees Bishop, then confused as he takes in the doll
of delight as Sophie appears, running, grabbing the doll out of Bishop's hands
Thank you, thank you

She takes off back into the living quarters of the house
The two men exchange looks, uncomfortable

Shuts down the powerful engine, emerges into the night and moves to his porch
The front door has been   by gunfire

Go ahead
Are you surprised to see me

Bishop doesn't respond
(') Was that the man who killed my father
There's a code, to what we do
It may not be rational, but it matters

You haven't answer my question: Did he kill my father
Bishop doesn't react, then
You should put that behind you now
Steve nods, swallowing emotion
Bishop starts to move and Steve is suddenly there, still angry, pointing the gun right in Bishop's face

You didn't
Blind fucking luck
Look at me
You tried to kill me

But you stopped him
Fuck you

Shakes his head, goes into his study

He moves from room to room
He hits the kitchen, looks in the fridge, makes a face at the empty shelves, the bottles of supplements
He moves on, pauses to stare at the gas fireplace in the study

Runs a finger across the headboard, dusty

Bishop points to some   on the Mark, glamorous
She was a model
The Mark is a beautiful woman
Before arriving at her current position, she enjoyed the way men looked at her
That's gone now
She needs to be taken seriously
She hates that men only see the beauty
Magazines, heads of state, all focusing how what a piece of tail she was
Like you did

He goes in, taking her with him underwater, his momentum carrying them both several feet under
She in his arms, fighting
Screaming, bubbles  from her mouth
It's silent
No sign of the violent struggle going on below the surface
Guard number one returns, glances up towards the pool
Doesn't hear anything
He sits back in his chair
The struggle is violent, silent, terrible in it's inevitable conclusion
The Mark writhes and jerks but Bishop holds her tight, always pulling her away from the surface
Finally, the fight goes out of her
She goes limp in his arms
He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes
Then lets her go, rising slowly to the surface
Bishop just breaks, breathing in, silent
He raises himself slightly, sees the guard at his post
The guard glances back towards the pool, hasn't heard anything for a little bit
new noise from outside gets his attention again
He heads out, hand on his sidearm
,  - The guard approaches the same door Guard #2 already checked, banging in the wind
Open again
He starts to move towards it when a  looms, he almost draws his weapon, breathes relief when he makes Guard #2
#2 () It's the second time it's come open
She still swimming
74
- The two Guards come into the pool area
On the far wall, the shower is running, a towel has fallen over the drain and the water is flowing down and into the pool
One of the men steps forward, concerned
#2 () Oh hell
The Mark floats face-up in the pool, just under the surface
,  - Bishop has already shed his wet clothing, pulls on dry clothes as Steve comes into the room
They barely acknowledge each other, business
Bishop stuffs the wet clothes in a bag, dumps it into a  chute
How did it go -- Not yet
As if on cue, an
Excited voices come on over an embassy wide  System
from the next room
Bishop opens the chute again as Steve cracks a glowstick, puts it between his teeth, swings his legs in, and
The door to the dressing room opens, armed guards flood in, along with Embassy officials speaking on radios
The room is empty
- Tight,   except for the eerie glow coming from the glowsticks Bishop and Steve have in their teeth
They slide , the sides of the tube  up at them
And then suddenly a dim  at the bottom, rising fast
,  - Steve lands hard in a cart of towels
Rises and pushes himself out of the way just in time for Bishop who grabs the pack he tossed down, shoulders it, and they're  again, now through sub-corridors
Alright, you gotta admire that
You gotta admit, we are a spooky good team
75
They  through a set of old doors, move fifteen feet to a metal roll-down door
(') It's like one moment we're there
the next moment
He   the door
at a
(') we're fucked
Bishop takes in the problem, starts to solve it
He tracks left right, considering options
(') There wasn't any sign of this on the plans
went over them fifty times
This isn't supposed to be here
This can't be here
Bishop holds up a finger
"Shhhhhh" They
soft "beeping
" Both men  around the edge of the metal door to where a small box with a red light
(') Bishop
what do we do
Duck
Steve looks at Bishop and
Doors  , burst through, machine guns raised and
Steve hits the deck
Watching Bishop, it's like everything we've seen so far was in slow motion
This is the real thing, unleashed
Bishop  the first man up, uses his Kevlar vest as a shield to catch the fire from the other two
The man as his arm breaks
Bishop gets control of his weapon, focuses it on the other two
One is  back
The other for cover
Fluid, Bishop  the man, pushes him  from him, coming up with  of the man's Flash-bangs in each hand
Each hand  the grenade's timers to two different settings, simultaneously  the levers
Second attacker  a burst which Bishop , the bullets stitching across the first attacker,  him back, his rounds  into the ceiling, showering Steve in debris
Bishop  the first grenade which reaches the attacker just as he rises for another shot
76
Another down as   dives through the door at Bishop who wraps the man up, his fingers finding pressure points on the man who goes limp in his arms, dead
On the floor, witnessing everything
Even in the chaos, recognizing the move
Bishop  the last grenade down the front of the dead attacker's clothes, wheels him around,  him against the concrete brick wall
more Security kick open a door, guns fire
Bishop goes horizontal, his legs  the one man against the metal Grate even as he returns fire at the other two who fall back and
The grenade goes off
Bishop is against the far wall
fill the space
Bishop , hauling Steve to his feet and shoving him into the ragged hole blown in the brick wall even as bullets trace after them
bullet catches Bishop in the side, he sprawls, then  towards the hole
- Cover in the floor is tossed aside
Bishop and Steve emerge, move 6 feet to a non-descript Buick
Climb in
The keys are waiting, Bishop starts it up, drives up the ramp
Next to him, Steve is catatonic, lost
As he drives, Bishop a strip from his shirt, pads the wound in his side
Hey
Hey
You still here
It was my fault
was in charge of the exit
looked at every work order, every entry in the building logs
No one controls 100% That's the nature of the beast
Steve swallows, nods as Bishop brings the Buick around a last corner,  at the closed gate in front of them, a Turkish guard waving his arms frantically
- Firetrucks and ambulances already crowd the streets
There's just no time or extra manpower left to react to the Buick which plows through the gate of the locked garage
77
- Two blocks behind, a single police car follows
Bishop takes a hard turn, moving
Hey
You did good in there
You hear me
It was asking a lot
You came through
Steve nods, processing, accepting
Another
Bishop slides the car to a stop in a covered lot
Across from them, Bishop's own Cobra waits
Behind them, the police car tears by, lost
'  - Bishop drives down the small lane leading to his home
Steve is staring out his window, deep in thought
Finally, looks over
For the first time takes in Bishop's injuries
You're bleeding
Yup
So back there
That was one hundred percent
Bishop looks over, gives nothing
Tiny smile
'  - Door opens and Bishop and Steve come in
Steve plops in a chair, head in his hands
beat, and then  filters in
Neil Young's "Needle and the Damage Done
" He raises his head, sees light glowing from the study
- Bishop sits in a chair, eyes closed
Steve comes in, stares at Bishop
Looks over and admires the surface of the spinning record
Do you think you know it, when you've made the mistake you won't survive
Or will it be like the Marks
Wake up on top of the world, never know
78
Steve glances into the open cabinet where Bishop keeps his vinyl,
Comes out with an signed album
(') Oh my God
This is a signed Hendrix Axis, 1967 release
This has gotta be worth
we have to play this
You have to play this
(shaking head no) That one
is for a special moment
Haven't found it yet
You haven't found the
Are you kidding
You have to -- what
Bishop's eyes  open
He looks out the window where a series of  are pulling up
Men get out, approach
This could get
interesting
'  - Bishop steps out of his home
One of the several men there steps forward
Mr
Bishop
Mr
Dean would like a moment of your time
Off Bishop who
nods
- Sedan pulls up, Bishop is escorted onto a private jet
'  - Steve stands in the middle of Bishop's home
Home alone
-- Steve stares at the classic vinyl on Bishop's turntable
-- Steve, wiring his IPod to Bishop's stereo
Nine Inch Nails' "Piggy" comes blasting out, insults the speakers
-- Steve moves to the bedroom,  at the haunting painting
He reaches forward, takes it down
Nothing
Blank wall behind
79
'  - Steve blasts in, lights glow on, illuminate the wall of research on the Female Mark
He goes to the gas fireplace, flames flicker up
Steve  down the pictures of the woman
Moves to the fire and feeds the first one in
, watching
His eyes
Tracking to the side
'
: Down, below the fire, stuck to the side of the interior cavity
a scrap of paper
Steve kills the fire, reaches in, carefully removes the scrap of paper
corner of a photograph
few buildings, distant, out of focus
Almost nothing
,   - Bishop, shirtless, stares in the mirror
He checks the wound in his side, splashes Vodka from a handful of mini bottles, painfully re-wraps the wound
- Bishop emerges from the bathroom, peers out at the grey monoliths of Washington
, below
,    - Gray morning
Wind blows
Steve stands alone, holding the scrap of photograph, now in a plastic envelope
He stares at where the chalk line has almost completely faded, then looks up, taking in the views, vantage points
half mile away a building under construction rises high
- Bishop steps off the plane
Another sedan and driver waits
- : The McKenna Holding Corp building
Image focuses on the rooftop, shutter clicks
Steve lowers the camera, looks at the display
He removes the scrap from Bishop's fireplace, compares it
the same buildings in the corner of the frame
Perfect match
No remaining doubt
Bishop killed his father
80
The   is up here with Steve, hanging back
Steve nods to him
Do it
don't care what it costs
/
- Driver pulls the sedan to a stop in front of a large nondescript building
Bishop steps out, alone on the street, passes through the morning commuters, and goes in
- Bishop passes through a
Post 9/11, hyper-conscious
Metal detector
Smart guards backed up by battle-ready  Marines
Bishop collects his , waits for a door to "click" open
,   - Bishop sits in a fluorescent lit room, now with a bar-code badge on his coat
few other people also wait
Bishop checks his wound, pulls his coat closed to mask where blood has stained his shirt
door opens and a plain woman nods to Bishop
'  - Bishop sits in a chair
Through blinds, views of gray
We realize that the plain woman is sitting across from Bishop, watching him
Finally, the door opens and enters
Pasty white, slightly balding
It's hard to locate where the sense of power come from, but it's there, innate
He motions to the woman who leaves
Dean sits at his desk, taps his fingers on it
You look like shit
() How does Harry McKenna's son figure in
He's going to be working with me from now on
You sure that's wise
81
Do  need your permission
No
And for the record,  don't believe you'd ask for it
Dean grabs a remote control on his desk, points it at the set of flatscreens on the wall which hum to life, muted
News reports featuring the killing of the Turkish Embassador
Shots of the woman, smiling
Helicopter shots of the pool structure
Words scroll: "Terror on our soil
" "Assassination
" " Envoy ejected from Turkey
" (') () That was my baby
But my baby has turned into an epic shit-storm and so when the man who caused said epic shit storm suddenly decides to do some soul-searching
() What are you doing, Bishop
The mistake was mine, not the kid's
'
Dean leans in, intense
Bishop watches the screens screen changes to a commercial for a Bahamas resort
(') am on some very fucking thin ice right now which means you are on some very fucking this ice as well
Someone  trained
That could be worth a lot to you
Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the interior blinds, raises one
From here they can see out over the office
Glimpses of a dozen conversations
Other men and women at work
More than a couple glance over towards Dean's office
predatory vibe
And here  thought we were both going to live forever
Bishop smiles
Dean stares at him
Bishop stares back
Suddenly, this becomes the moment, the decision
82
(') You know, in this business, you only get one mistake
(off the flatscreens) So nothing more like that
You take full responsibility
Yes
The two men, face to face
Then Dean's phone rings
He turns to it, snaps it up
( ) Hey, Stanley
Yes, we're all sorted out
just need you to -- The hit, on the woman
What was the reason
Dean looks back, surprised, angered
( ) 'm calling you back
Dean clicks off, takes in this change of rules
dead seriousness infects his voice
Fear
(') You know, this foul-up, McKenna's son, it's all got some people's panties in a real twirl
() This isn't the time for questions
This is the time for survival
Everyone
is expendable
Beat
Dean turns away, picks up the phone again
(') ( ) Yeah, get me Stan again
- Steve lays out by his pool, sunglasses, baking under the sun as his group of hangers-on swarm around him
Play, dance, splash
He's immune to all of it
Louise climbs from the pool, water drips off her perfect form
She nestles in behind Steve, her hands running over his body
He stares straight ahead, as if she didn't exist
83
Come on, baby
What's the matter
Finally, something does catch his attention: At the gate, a Van pulling up, the driver heading toward him
Steve lowers his glasses
'  - Seen from far away, the sedan pulls up
Bishop gets out
'  - Bishop enters, looks around
No sign of Steve, or any disturbance
He moves through the house
Steve
Steve
Bishop tense, in his study, holding the phone which rings
rings
Steve's voice comes on the voicemail: "Hi, this is Steve
You know what to do
" Bishop, sitting on his couch
On the  in front of him, images from a protest in Turkey, an American flag burning
Bishop's eyes flick to the stack of DVDs from the woman
No
He keeps watching the news images
His phone rings
He snatches it up
(') Bishop
(
) You're still alive
Seems that way
(
) Hey, can you meet me
Something want to talk with you about
Bishop, silent
(
) (') It's important
Come up to the house
Please, okay
Okay
84
- Bishop's sportscar pulls up in front of the large estate
Bishop gets out, surveys the grounds
Weirdly quiet
The windows of the house, dark
The grounds, empty
He moves to the gates to the back yard, finds them open
He pushes through, cautious
- Bishop moves towards the darkened pool area
As he approaches, Steve comes into view, standing by himself on the edge of the diving board in the center of the dark space
There you are
Thanks for coming
What's on your mind
Steve just smiles, shakes his head
Bishop stares at him, tense, confused
Each trying to read the other
Then Steve raises a bottle of whiskey to his mouth, drinks
Bishop takes a step forward and
Explosions
Bishop ducks, rolls, his hand moving under his jacket
but not coming out with his gun
He takes in a surprise party, opening in front of him
Beautiful woman, , blowing horns
Men, pouring champagne
falling to the ground where seconds before they blew into the air, a large , illuminated behind Steve: " " And Steve, standing on the board, master of ceremonies, staring back at Bishop
oddly cool, dispassionate
Then he smiles
Bishop rises
Women come to him, touch him, put a party hat on him and give him small kisses with wishes of "Happy Birthday" as he moves to the pool edge across from Steve
It's not my birthday
When was the last time you celebrated your real birthday
No response from Bishop
Steve nods, swigs the bottle again
He's lit, something fierce and fiery in his eyes
85
(') See
You're overdue, buddy
Who are these people
They think you're a friend of mine, a producer, from Canada
() In other words, they're all your best friends
,   -  () Bishop sits on an outdoor sofa, surrounded by several gorgeous aspiring
Steve sits across from him, Louise under his arm
Bishop watches as one of the models ties a cherry-stem into a knot with her tongue, presents it to the group to a round of applause
( ) So what movies have you made
( ) Oh, he makes the really violent, disturbing stuff
You wouldn't know it to look at him,  know, but what's locked up away in there
(tapping his head) Frightening, man
God,  love those
Which ones -- Mr
KcKenna has a creative relationship with the truth don't actually
The model glances around, unsure
Oh, okay
That's funny
So what do you do
Yes, Mr
Bishop
What do you do
Bishop doesn't respond
He's just staring down
'
: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa the models are perched on: The tear-strip from a  Envelope
86
(') Come on, Mr
Bishop
We're all waiting
Bishop looks up at Steve who  back
beat, and then Bishop is up and moving through the crowd, pushing by people ,
He almost runs into a bright blue-haired woman on the arm of a jockish
Excuse me
He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the Woman
She's utterly different than we've seen her
Tonight, she's the clubbing party-girl
Dark lipstick, bright blue wig, heavy eye-liner
(') Hi
Hi
This is strange
The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies
High- fives all around
He glances around for his date
Is he your
No, just a job
(off his nod) have to
know
Go on
She nods, turns away
He also turns, starts moving through the crowd, pushing through
and suddenly she's back with him
No words
Lights and sound and dance around them
She leans forward, kisses Bishop once
Backs off, smiles, turns away and makes her way back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse
Bishop
staring
Turns away as the
Steve's voice fills the outdoor space, amplified
Ladies and gentlemen
The man of the hour
hits Bishop
He squints up as the crowd makes space for him
Steve's near the , speaking on a mic
87
(') know that not many of you know my friend
My good, dear
friend
mean, he's a man of few words
And he's an art lover
Did you know that
His home is covered with work
It's amazing, what you can find in there
Amazing
weird beat
Steve, smiling fierce
(') Happy birthday, Arthur
Behind Steve, a covered object
Steve now turns to it, pulls the cover off a  of Bishop, clearly done by the Artist he collects
The image is twisted, vivid, disturbing
As the crowd erupts in  the  himself now comes forward, Steve's arm around his shoulder and bumping fists before the Artist heads on towards Bishop, shaking Bishop's hand
Faces
People
On Bishop, just looking at Steve who stares back
unreadable
- Bishop bangs out a door into the front drive, makes it to his car, fumbles for his keys
Sweating, off-kilter
(
) Hey, you forgot something
Steve's there, holding the portrait
Bishop nods, takes it
Sorry
Sorry for leaving
'm just not used to -- No worries, man
It's your party
You can leave it
() It's true, isn't it
What you said to me the first time we met
What's that
This thing we do
Finally, you always do it alone
Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces himself to stop
88
Steve
thank you
Uh-oh
can feel some male bonding coming
We gonna hug it out, Bishop
No, 'm serious
Thank you
People don't
Anyway, it's been a long time, since someone did something for me
Steve looks back, nods
Strangely dark
Happy Birthday, Arthur
Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger
wink, and he turns and is gone, back to the party
Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away
'  - Bishop drives the car out of McKenna's estate, pulls out onto the street
He starts to accelerate away
then  the car in the middle of the street
Fighting what his guts are screaming at him
Losing it,  on the steering wheel
Suddenly still
,   - Party rages on, oblivious to the absence of its recipient
Suddenly faces turn
to where Steve is looking down on everyone from a third story balcony over the pool
( ) Are you all having fun
and
(') despise each and every one of you
,
Steve  out into space
Perfect huge swam dive
falling
the water
moment of silence
did he
Was that deep enough
Steve  out of the water
Party  back into life
89
,   - High above the festivities
Bishop slips over the wall, makes his way down towards the estate
- Dark and empty in here, party raging outside
Bishop enters Steve's bedroom
Messy, the bed unmade
woman's underthings lying on the floor
Bishop surveys the room, checks drawers, peers down into the party below
He can see Steve in the middle of it all, Louise on his arm, his hand on her ass
Bishop moves to the office door, locked
He slides a pick- set out of his pocket, gets to work
,   - The door lock "clicks" and Bishop enters, closes the door after himself and locks it, turns around
The room has been  of everything that was in here last time
are the paintings, the portraits, the mementos
All traces of Harry McKenna, removed
Instead, a  desk inhabits the center of the room, a small computer monitor and keyboard centered on it
Bishop comes around, touches a key on the keyboard
The monitor glows to life with a single "" prompt
Bishop stares at it
He sits, staring, concentrating
,   - Steve has moved to the edge of the raised patio, looking down into the valley
His eyes still, deep, impossible to read
Hey
Hey baby
Karen's got some amazing
You need to come try
Steve turns those cool eyes on her
She shrinks
We think he might slap her, then: Give me a moment
'll be right there
We'll do that amazing
And he looks away, back down over the view
resigned loneliness settling into his features
90
,   -  () Bishop, just staring at the password prompt which throbs in front of him
Beat
His eyes flick across to the few books lying on the desk
Weaponry, physiology
Greek Mythology
Bishop reaches forward, types "Nemesis
" Hits moment
and then our minds are blown
The entire wall of the room in front of Bishop glows to life
It's a one large high-resolution monitor
On it, glows an infinitely detailed work-up on Bishop
photograph on him glows at the center of the screen, changing every three or four seconds to another
This is Bishop's method, brought into the 21st century
Accounts, Medical charts, psych profile, associates, residence
Bishop approaches
takes it in
Touches "Accounts" and the window   across the whole wall
Multiple windows, all of Bishop's money, displayed in real time, the numbers subtly changing with the flow of foreign markets
Another window above is labeled "Associates
" Bishop touches this one and the financial windows are replaced with a collage of
Not too many
We recognize the Store Owner and his Daughter
Steve himself
An older man "Gerald Bishop," Bishop's father
And a photo of the Woman
Bishop touches the woman and multiple images propagate out from the single
Many stills, but several are in motion, looping: Childhood movies
commercial done as a teen blue movie when she was 20
Bishop's eyes settle on a video image: He and the woman, caught just an hour ago in the middle of the dancing party
The woman leaning to him, kissing him
Bishop stares at the image, then touches another image labeled "Residence
" , the images are replaced with images of the interior and exterior of Bishop's home
Bishop stares at them, confused
realizing that in one of the images, the trees lightly sway in the breeze
Huh
His eyes dart to an image of his
It looks like a still, until suddenly Bishops' cat passes through the frame
Bishops' eyes dart, moving from frame to frame
The whole interior of his life
His living room, bedroom, study, gym
All live feeds
(') Son of a bitch
91
,   -  () Door  open, Steve pushing in, his arms wrapped around Louise and another gorgeous woman from the party
As the two women hit the bed, start undressing each other, Steve takes a moment -- sensing
Something not right
He pulls keys from his pocket, unlocks the study door, peers in
'
:   - (
) Come on, Steve
We need you
- Low end
Mean men and loose women
Metal on the juke
Duct- taped naugahyde
Bartender on parole
Eyes raise as Bishop pushes in, scattered focus, hits the bar
Whiskey
Neat
Lots of it
Bishop fumbles in his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash
$100s and $20s
Eyes track
At a booth, two   lock onto Bishop, one sporting a middle-finger raised  tattoo on his bare shoulder
Bishop pushes $100 forward
That's too much
Bishop grabs the shot, down it
Pushes the empty shot and the cash back at the bartender
'm not going anywhere
Another shot is put down on the bar, empty
Bishop wipes watery eyes, nods to the bartender to hit it again
Bishop stares at the drink, then his attention is drawn to the bar
Footage from the protests in Turkey is narrated by a news anchor, speaking
Intelligence services can listen to our calls
But what about the rest of the world
() 92
(') Well, today the answer seems to be 'No" as outrage over the assassination of the Turkish envoy Bahar Miryem has forced the  to reverse its position, now saying that it will not make it support of Turkey's  bid contingent on its cooperation in the security agreement
Miryem had always advocated for Turkish autonomy from -- Bartender hits a remote, annoyed
Channel changes to a 70's Charles Bronson flick
Bishop blinks, shakes his head
He collects himself, weaves out of the bar
The Ex-Cons watch him go
- Bishop weaves his way into an alley to piss
Relieves himself on a wall
Done, he zips up, turns
One of the Ex-Cons catches him across the face with a punch
Bishop reels back against the wall
More
Bishop takes the punches, no defense
Face punished
The guy backs off, slightly winded
Dude, you don't want any more, give us that money
Bishop shakes his head
Two more hits to the body
Bishop just keeps taking the punishment
Seems to relish it
Spits blood
Look, 'll give you my money, but you have to promise me you won't spend it all on lipstick and tampons
Ex Con #2 pulls a gun, puts it to Bishop's head
#2 You wanna die right here, motherfucker
Bishop raises his eyes to the man
Not so drunk after all
Thank you
93
'  - Bishop sits at his dining room table, staring straight ahead
His face is cut, his flesh swollen
He
If paranoia and loneliness had a face, this is it
to find the Artist's portrait of him, hung on the wall across, a surreal and distorted mirror
He chews his food steady, even, acutely aware he's being watched
We  on the small camera eye tucked in the high corner of the room, staring down
,   - Steve sits half-naked in the office chair, the high-tech wall illuminated in front of him
In the bed in the other room, the two women are asleep, nude, draped over each other
Steve watches Bishop leave his table
He hits a control and the image , picks up Bishop checking his mail, grabbing a baseball cap from a rack as Bishop moves to his den, settles into a chair facing the television
Can't see his face, just the back of the cap on his head, the tv screen, set to white static
He touches a key and the on Bishop, moving slightly
(
) () Steve
Where are you, baby
'  - The  purrs static, white flickering light fills the room
We  , reversing, to find: The baseball cap, held up at the top of the chair by a pillow
No sign of Bishop
'  - Bishop moves through shadows
He knows the positions of the cameras, avoids them, heads towards his
- Bishop enters, turns on lights
He threads his way through his collection of beautiful automobiles until he reaches the far wall
He  up a large steel door
revealing a wall,  with his research on Steve
Lots of it, weeks of work
He moves forward to a paper that lists stats about Steve that includes a blank space for "Occupation:" Bishop fills it in: "Mechanic
" 94
Suddenly  wash across the space
Bishop glances out: is making it's way up the drive
,   - The wall-sized monitor glows Steve's face as he watches the driver get out, makes his way to the door, knock
Steve's eyes flick to what he can see of Bishop, asleep in the chair
No movement
Steve  , interested
The  Driver knocks again, rings the bell
Still no motion
and then Bishop  from the chair, makes his way to the door
Steve watches Bishop signing, closing the door and moving into his living room where he opens the package, considers the small jump-drive that slides into his hands
Watching
'  - on Bishop's weighted  turntable
The needle coming down
touching spinning vinyl
Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil" croons out
, tacking up pages, photographs, financials
We don't get a clear look, but some pages are redacted, there's government letterhead
Personnel files, budgets, itineraries
Many stamped "
" Bishop draws lines, connections
Tosses some pages down, pins others higher
Working it
He backs off, stares through us
'  - Steve pushes in, looks around, tracks towards the study
Hello
Bishop
He enters the study, sees the , the night's work
In the center, a photograph of Dean, Bishop's boss
(
) There you are
Bishop is leaning in from outside
Nods to Steve
So who is he
95
Government
Very well protected
What happened to you
You should see the other guy
Bishop  Steve an object, goes back outside
Steve looks at it
' helmet with visor
'   - Steve comes out to find Bishop working intently on a chemical project
He's pouring a black plastic-like substance into a shallow mold creating a Quarter-sized object
What's that
This
is liquid Semtex with a built in combustible
Very volatile
Nice and shiny once it dries
But don't
scratch it
Bishop takes a knife, scratches the surface of the coin-sized disc, then backs off, by Steve, back into - So that's how we take him out
(shaking his head) No
That's just to focus the mind
You makes bombs to focus your mind
What do you do
(beat, off the Wall) This one's different
They want it fast, and they don't want it to look like an accident
Someone wants to send a message
Like with my father
96
Yes
Like that
Didn't think that was your style
() First time for everything
Steve looks at Bishop
Outside the explosion against the house
window
Steve crouches, hands covering his head
Jesus
Bishop puts a hand out
There's something  haven't told you
What
broke a rule
brought you in without asking
So this hit, is a test
Of us, of our arrangement
(beat, off Dean's picture) If that man is breathing three days from now
then they'll need to make an example of us
Do you understand
Steve
nods
Takes Bishop's hand who pulls him up
So what you're saying is you and are stuck with each other
'm sorry
For what
For getting you into this -- knew what  was doing
Bishop considers, nods
97
Get packed
- Steve and Bishop push in, backpacks on
Trash, bad lighting, sad people in dirty hallways
They start up a long flight of stairs
,  - Steve and Bishop push out onto this dilapidated rooftop, Washington  spread out around them
They unpack gear from the backpacks
Tripod, camera and telescope are quickly assembled
Bishop steps back, lets Steve take the first look
Bishop takes notes
count six
no seven at the main door
: The front entrance of the building
The security check Bishop went through
(') Jesus they've got  Marines in there
Two at the door, one
maybe another two out of sight
Bishop considers Steve, locked to the telescope, the sharp point of the pen in his hand
(
) Fifth floor, corner office
: Steve finds Dean, at his desk, talking on the phone
Animated
Alright, got him
He's at his desk
We could take the shot right from here
Glass is three inches thick
Steve moves his hand to turn on the laser Bishop used before to listen with
(') And has laser sensors
98
Steve laughs, suddenly walks away from the telescope
Bishop goes to it, takes up the watch
Alright, fine
What are we doing here
Who is this guy
: Dean shouts into the phone, slams it down
Leaves his office
Bishop pulls away from the telescope, hunkers down to wait
Starting to get it
Yeah, 'm getting that this isn't a job
It's just a really complicated
suicide
Bishop smiles
Steve moves off, restless
,  - Whole day has passed
Bishop hasn't moved, stares across at the  building, the corner office
Steve sits nearby
You know, you can front sonofabitch all you want, Bishop
You're scared, too
You don't really know how we're going to pull it off, do you
You ever think there's some things that just can't be done
Everyone has a death -- Really
Because, this guy
look at this guy,  don't see his death
see my death
And  don't particularly like the view
Bishop notes the lights going back on in Dean's office, returns to the telescope and starts jotting notes in a book
: Dean back at his desk
He looks exhausted
(') And you know, as much as  like the quality time, unless you can read lips,  don't exactly see what we're doing here
99
Steve glances at Bishop's pad where he's transcribing words: "No, no, tomorrow
'm sick of this, this is my life we're taking about
You're bringing me in
Give me a time and a place
" (') You read lips
Bishop glances at Steve, puts his eye back to the camera
:   on Dean's desk piece of paper on the blotter
"Click
" "Click
" Bishop pulls the memory-card from the camera
() You any good with computers
'  - Bishop is working on his classic Mustang
He's got the steering column apart, working the mechanism
Focused
,   - Steve is in front of the electronic wall of info on Bishop
His hospital report open
In a separate window, video feed of the real Bishop in his barn working on his car
Steve marks the injury on Bishop, then opens a new window
Multiple images of the scrap of paper on Dean's desk
Steve gets to work enlarging, rotating, skewing the images
Music and  filter in from outside
Steve becomes aware of the noise from outside, frowns
- Steve emerges onto the high balcony overlooking the never- ending party
He raises a  and fires into the air
Faces, startled look up at him
Everybody out
'm serious
Get the fuck off my property
moment, then people start to flee
Only Louise, drink in hand, moves towards Steve, confused
Steve, baby
100
Steve levels the gun at her
You, too
,   - Steve comes back into his office, facing the wall
He tosses the gun on the table, gets back to work
Glances at one of the other open windows that shows Bishop at his fridge, pouring himself filtered water
Steve's hands fly
The images are pieced together, enlarged, skewed until nonsensical markings resolve into an address
Steve punches it into a search window, waits a beat, then eyes scan over the list of returns, lock onto something
He picks up the phone, punches a number
Watches as Bishop's phone rings, watches Bishop answer it
(
) Did you get it
It's the  Attorney's office in New York
He's running
He's trying to get out
Steve, trying to read Bishop's face,  in
(') Do you think we're hitting him because of what he's done, or because he's trying to get away with what he's done
(
) Does it make a difference
No,  don't suppose it does
beat
The two men, far separated
(
) Do the angles
Find us a shot
- Steve and Bishop step out of the airport with bags, hail a taxi and climb in, headed into
101
(
) Security's going to have the actual street locked down
But there's a residential street, perpendicular
- Upscale streets lined with brownstone walk-ups
Steve and Bishop walk with roller bags and a shoulder tube past mothers and Nanny's ushering their children to school
(
) High-end people
They'll put up with a sweep, but they're not going to allow an agent to spend the day
They reach an address
Bishop puts on a hat, some sunglasses, slaps a badge onto his jacket that reads " Municipal Utilities
" He trots up the the half-flight, rings the bell of an elegant brownstone
- Nice
Lace curtains
Classic living room
Magazine racks, grand piano, original art
Besides, the angle isn't right, too flat
Except when they hit the stairs
It'll spread the group vertically
It's
the shot
Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence
Each opens their bag, removes a series of innocuous objects, begins to dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal
From a clock, a firing mechanism
From the tube, an aluminum barrel holds a fishing rod
The rod is discarded, the barrel is attached to a hard plastic stock
Batteries are opened and slender shells are removed from each
As this strange choreography continues in silence, we to the dining room where a  and a  are bound and tied, pillowcases cinched over their heads
Their bindings allow them to hold each other's hands which they do, tight
They're terrified, but okay
Back in the living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the home-made rifle, a telescope, lifted from a child's gift box, snaps it on top of the rifle
102
- Dean squints in the back of his limo as it pulls into daylight
He's on the phone, eyes darting, nervous
(
) Look,  don't care
Find her, need to talk to her right now
- Bishop puts the rifle to his shoulder, sights
Behind him, Steve slips a blade from the crease of his suitcase, considers it, looks back to Bishop
You ever worry about the right and wrong of it all
'm not talking about God, just
(tapping his chest) Whatever you feel here
'
: The  Attorney building
The security detail
The steps leading to the street
It's a little late for -- Come on
You're telling me you've never done anything just because it was the right thing to do, even if it didn't make any sense
You never took a chance like that
Bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch
Once  did
How'd that work out for you
Beat
Then suddenly Bishop's view is obscured by a large truck, which has stopped trying to make the turn
We have a problem
Bishop moves the scope, precisely looking for alternatives
Nothing
He sets the rifle down, thinking as Steve takes in the new situation
There's no shot
What do we do
There's no shot
103
moment more, and then Bishop
We travel with him, to the entryway
Keys, hats, jackets, sunglasses
Bishop grabs a hat, tosses one to Steve

And Bishop's out

The security detail, suspicious of the truck

Men speak into radios
- with Bishop, Steve following
Hats and sunglasses
They descend the steps onto the sidewalk, closing on the Attorney building ahead
Steve comes abreast of him as they move down the street
On your four
You see him
Coming up, a  in a jogging suit stretches, touches his ear where's he's wired
Steve and Bishop come abreast of him
Steve pushes him down into the garbage alley between two homes
The man drops
Steve comes back, the man's gun palmed
Offers it to Bishop
(') No
You're the shooter
When
You'll know when
, , taking the corner onto the main street in front of the large building
- Dean's eyes track the outside, the limo making the final turn onto the street
Security visible ahead
( ) Hey
Listen,  need you to go out of town for a few days
No, know, but you have to trust me
() 104
(') Just go -- no, don't tell me where
Just go, okay
Okay
Yes, 'll call you soon,  gotta go
- Steve and Bishop,
They pass directly behind a Security on headsets, watching monitors
are also working, one  in particular guarding the corner of the perimeter
Bishop nods to Steve who heads up the stairs towards the building
Bishop checks his watch, looks down the street where '  and escort have turned the corner
Bishop moves to the cop, stands in front of him
The guy patiently puts a hand on him, moving him on
Bishop doesn't move
The cop
needle hits a record's surface
"Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
" /
- Suddenly dropping into Dean's  as his limo pulls up to the steps
Chaotic motion,    as the car door opens, security handlers reach in
We , fast up steps lined by City
One of the police turning his head, staring at Dean
Bishop
Suddenly frozen
His handlers unsure what's going on, alert that something's not right
Bishop
Bishop does
Security reads Dean's fear, closes on Bishop even as Dean himself starts to  , separating himself from his own security, now turning to
Straight into Steve, gun raised
small moment frozen in time as Dean understands his end
-
Steve double-taps Dean in the chest, then one to head
And  begins its rule
Security which were closing on Bishop now , draw weapons and  at Steve who drops down in the small cement crease between stairs and statues
Ducked low, bullet shattering granite and marble around him,
The first glimpse of something inside this young man

Bishop, for the moment forgotten by the security who have reversed to deal with Steve, suddenly
Perfect timing, the security  again as Bishop draws his gun and , over and over, clipping officers and security in the legs as he  down the steps towards

The  looks back through the opening, surprised, just in time for Bishop to grab him by the collar and  him into the back at the same time slipping through the opening and sliding into the driver's position
As he slams the shifter into  men line up in front, with weapons
- , Limo  backwards, angling Security   as the Limo clears the rail, comes down  just across from the small alcove Steve's pressed into
The passenger door opens
Get in
Security are standing up, opening up, as Steve  forward
- Steve lands awkward in the front seat as Bishop throws the limo into drive, floors it  the steps of the building, men diving aside, swerving onto the street
Thanks
Behind you
Steve has half a second to puzzle this one as the Driver grabs him from behind,  him backwards
Bishop eyes his mirrors, counting the number of vehicles pursuing
Eyes makes calculations, gets distracted for a moment from the   between Steve and the Driver occurring in the rear compartment
106
Bishop raises the divider, steps on the gas
- Engine , Limo surges forward, pursuit cars dropping off
There are no turns, no spins
This is straight-line acceleration circa
Bishop guides the limo faster and faster, blasting across intersections, timing his spacing to inches, no margin for error
Around him, pursuit cars aren't as good, they  off into crashes, clip traffic,  out of control
- In front of Bishop, intersection after intersection of cross- cutting traffic
Bishop speeds up or slows just a fraction, making space for the limo,
He notices a hand-held automatic weapon secured to the dash, grabs it, checks his mirrors
: Bishop watches a pursuit car - by a truck, then his view is blocked by  and the  as they wrestle and fight
Over his initial surprise, the Driver's trained, and good
He locks Steve up,  him against the window, choking him
Bishop sees a traffic jam  ahead, the limo closing at 100 mph, no alternatives
He lowers the divider
Get in front
Working on that
Now
Bishop   the -Brake, putting the Limo into a
The shift in force tosses Steve and Guard across the rear space
Steve dives forward towards the front as

Limo clips the building halfway,  the limo in half
The rear section crumples against the building as the front section  down the building face, comes to rest against a

We have got to go
Steve's pointing at the rear exit
It looks far away
(') You go for it, 'll cover you
Bishop takes in the exit, the gun in Steve's hand
- More  arrive, take positions
There must be thirty guns pointed in their direction
- Bishop cranes around, tracks cop and
'm sorry  brought you into this
Not now, Bishop, we have to -- It was
It was the only thing knew how to teach you
Steve looks at him oddly, moved
Then
Don't worry about it, Bishop brought myself into this
Bishop considers this, nods
And he's    towards the

Clear shot at Bishop

Displays fly as they muscle through to the back, then through service corridors, back into a , headed for the front door

Bishop raises his weapon, into the metal of the cars
The  panic, ,  into parked cars
The cops piling out and taking position as   scream and flee
Bishops checks his fire

The two of them, suddenly lining weapons into each other's faces
Breathing had
eyes locked as beyond them another police reinforcement arrive, takes position
The  of a cop, distant outside,  a round into a shotgun
Both men  to the ground, roll even as they switch to single-shot mode to preserve ammo
, they fire back at their attackers, precise, as the cops open up
Firing
Bullets find exposed legs and arms, men stumble back or fall to the ground, screaming
Almost at the same exact moment, the men switch their aim back to each other
Both men, controlling emotion and body
Gasping for breath, bleeding
Why
You don't know
Tense beat
Glimpsed through shattered windows, arrives, takes the perimeter
They're being surrounded
Suddenly an  pulls into view between the restaurant and the  and Police position, a confused and frightened at the wheel
Police  at her, confusing her more
Steve makes a decision
Lowers his weapon, grabs a napkin, ties it to hide his features
(') Cover me
And with that Steve is  towards the outside

Clean shot of Steve's back
He opens up
Bullets tracing around Steve, pushing the men back just long enough for Steve to reach the , haul open the door

She scratches back, one hand ripping the bandana away from Steve's face
He  at her for one deadly second
- Bishop  as the sound of the  come from the
The passenger door opens and the woman climbs out as the away, cops and  firing after it
'
: The woman watches her car go, then turns and sits on the pavement
Her hand moves to her chest, comes away bloody
Angry like we've never seen him
Cold
Furious
The stupid waste of it all
He meets the woman's gaze
She dies looking at him
Helicopters clatter above, bullets plink into dishware and hardwood
Bishop just stares at the woman for a long beat, then he turns away, back into the building
It is
over
-  () approaches the , slammed against another car
Shielded men throw the door open
It's empty
-  () move into the restaurant Bishop was last seen in
Guns lined, checking corners
But there's no sign of Bishop
- Bishop enters the flat
Cool afternoon breeze blows through curtains
He stops, stares at the couple who owned the flat who now lie motionless
Small holes in the red-stained pillowcases over their heads
Steve has been here
Bishop swallows, angry
He forces himself back to the task at hand
Breaking down the never-fired weapon
He works efficiently, silently
111
- Bishop sits at the gate, waiting to board his plane
He watches families get ready, college kids laughing
On the silent TVs,  shows footage of the aftermath of the gunfight in the street
"Eight dead
"   Attorney speaking at a press conference
Something is wrong in this country
But today because of the actions of a few cowardly men, we may never know the true face of -- voice announces boarding, drowning out the
Bishop collects his things
- Grocer glances at Bishop's two grocery bags, then to the clock: 7:10
Sophie reads her book with her doll speeds by outside
Sophie tracks it, looks at her father
'  - Key in the lock, Bishop enters, stands in his living room
Nothing
'  - Bishop stands in front of his machines, still
Reaches out, touches one
Waiting
' - Bishop sits across from the portrait of himself, finishes the last bite of his dinner
He takes the plate, walks into the kitchen and to the sink, washes the plate
His cat curls around his legs, purrs
Bishop takes a scrap off the plate, bends down and feeds it to her
She starts to eat, then her
Steve hits him from out of nowhere
Bishop sprawls as Steve , gun lined
Bishop hits Steve with the fridge door, knocks the gun out of his hands, it skitters along the floor
Bishop moves towards it, Steve swings a knife
Bishop catches the blow, but Steve  down on the bad shoulder
Bishop  as something gives, stumbles back as Steve swings again, Bishop turning, catching the blade in his shoulder
112
Bishop reels back against the wall as Steve picks up the gun and
Fires as Bishop flees the room
Steve follows, keeping his shots controlled
Slugs chew into walls, furniture as Bishop dives out the front door
Steve advances, re-loading
You know, when they came to me said "Are you sure
" Bishop
" But They're right, aren't they
'  - Steve steps out onto the porch
You don't really like the work anymore
Bishop's voice comes from the darkness near the barn
Maybe not
Steve  as Bishop , finds cover
Yeah
That's
what did you call it
That's a prerequisite
() Besides,  guess  had other reasons
If it matters, today we killed the man who ordered the hit on your father
Yeah, but not the man who actually killed him
Steve advances, clearing the side of the barn,  his weapon on Bishop, who's standing next to the barn
Why'd you kill those other people
(shakes his head) You really going moral high ground on me
Seriously
You might want to check your soapbox there, partner
113
Steve fires just as Bishop  back, into the barn through a side door
Steve , slides towards the front
(') ( ) But that's the difference between us, isn't it
You're all alone, but you still
like people
You wish they liked you
Whereas have people everywhere
and all ever want, is to be alone
Steve hears  coming from the barn
(') There's no weapons in there, Bishop
've
what did you teach me
've controlled the situation
One hundred percent
The barn door blast outwards as Bishop's vintage Mustang come careening out of the barn at Steve
Who
He aims, fires five times through the windscreen
The rounds  Bishop as the car  at Steve who steps aside at the last moment, the car barely missing him, continuing on and  against the side of the house
the propane tank
Steve squints and
The propane tank  in flame
Steve is knocked back
When he rises, the interior of the car is an inferno
The body is slumped against the wheel, the fire consuming him, cleansing him
Steve
Bleeding, bruised, victorious
'  - Steve enters the study, looking down at Bishop's record player, looks back at the wall of work on Dean
Smoke seeps through the walls, pushes through cracks in sills
Steve opens Bishop's record collection, takes the pristine collector's Hendrix
The one never played
He moves into the living room
lick across the walls
Through the smoke, he sees the portrait of Bishop staring back at him
He raises the album in thanks
'  - Steve now stands outside Bishop's home, watching
The whole place is an inferno
114
Pictures bubble and peel before turning black in the heat
The stack of DVDs melts, dripping down
Flaming beams crash down, crumple classic cars
Steve watches it all
The fire reflected in his eyes
- hot gorgeous day
Slight breeze blows through trees, ripples the water on the pool which is suddenly by the figure of Steve, swimming laps, hard
He gets out at the far end, looks over his grounds
There's no one here anymore
The place is deserted except for ear- wired  who patrol the grounds
'  - and  pick through the smouldering rubble watches as the door to Bishop's fire-ravaged car is pried off
- Steve trots in from outside, pulling on a loose shirt
The house is spotless, transformed
No sign of a frivolous young man's pursuits
Art and culture and wealth
'  - The door to the car gives suddenly, falls to the ground
The Detective pulls a handkerchief, puts it over his nose and mouth as he peers in at the body
'  - Steve busts in, dragging his father's 80's turntable with him
The portrait of Bishop has been hung here in his office
He glances at it, then breaks the seal on the Hendrix album, stares at the grooves before seating it on the turntable and hitting a switch
Player starts up, needle swings over
Steve moves to his computer and punches in the password
On the wall-sized screen, the Bishop research glows to life
All the connections, people, history that made Bishop
Bishop's cat jumps into his lap, purring, and Steve strokes her
Finally, a decision
He hits a button and the prompt "
" Appears on the screen
115
Needle comes down, touches the record, the sweet sound of Hendrix's "Little Wing" fill the world
Steve's finger still hovers over "
" Bishop's cat jumps down, trots away
He watches the cat go, hits the button
The wall-sized screen goes blank
Just a cool white nothing
Steve , nods, leaning back
when a voice comes from the record player, overlayed above the song
' Steve, if you hear this, then it means you found the right moment to play the record
Good for you
It also means you had to scratch the needle across the surface of the record
Steve's eyes  on the record player, the needle scratching across its surface, from the surface of the record, the smallest trace of smoke
'  (') Sorry it has to end this way
Steve's eyes dart to the portrait of Bishop
Its cold eyes stare back
- The windows of Steve's office blow out of the estate's 2nd story
: '  - The Detective, handkerchief over his face, leans over the body
Burnt beyond recognition
moves away, down to the body's shoulder
(
) Every man has a death that's right for them
Every one
where a form, a heat shadow, has burnt into the charred remains of a shirt
fist, middle-finger raised
We know this tattoo
It was on the ex-con who tried to mug Bishop outside the bar
This is not Bishop
(
) (') death so right that when it arrives, those who knew him will say "Yes, this is right
" 116
The detective leans the body forward, and the shadow disintegrates into ash
- brand new Maserati crests the hill, moving
Brakes lock up, it slides to a stop in a patch of dirt
(
) "
This was always going to happen this way
" Bishop gets out
Shaved, healthy, clean
He climbs onto the roof of the car, stares at the highway which winds away into the distance
Freedom, laid out before him
He stares at it, wanting, needing
He blinks
