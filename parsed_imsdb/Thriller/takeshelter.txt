Written by Jeff Nichols Grove Hill Productions Release Edit Draft - Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree strong wind bends them back, showing their light green bellies
This is a modest house in a row of modest houses
Propane tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to be more rural than suburb
(35) stands in his driveway
His eyes, locked on the sky, narrow as he stares at
stretching out on the horizon in front of him
It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and gray clouds
They swirl in and out of one another sending wispy tentacles toward the ground
Curtis stands, awestruck
The clouds move fast overhead
He looks up as they overtake his position
light rain begins
The rain pats the ground
It makes soft indentions on his cotton shirt
He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder now
He notices something strange
The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk
He pulls his shirt out and sees dark spots forming there
He holds his palm out flat in front of him
The rain pools
He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers
It's an amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil
Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now
Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead
The wind bends back the trunk of the maple tree
Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging
: - Curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle
Cool, clean water rushes over his face
- (29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan
She's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized - shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them
(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of toast and feeding it to the dog
2
Hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid wrapped over her right ear
It clips into her hair near the back of her head
The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian Ridgeback that appreciates the attention
Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head
In the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand and sets it on her plate
(takes a seat) No, no, no
Don't feed the dog darlin'
Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds it to the dog
Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs out on everyone's plates
(') Thanks babe
You slept late
Yeah
need to go
What you got going today
've got to finish up some curtains for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are coming over
( ) With the kids
Yeah
Cammie said she just needed to get out of the house
Samantha takes her seat at the table
Tell Nat to take it easy on her
Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah
Cam can hold her own
We need to send in the deposit for the beach condo
He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to make eye contact
She looks over at him
He speaks using sign language
Three broad, slow gestures
3
() love you
Hannah puts her arms around his neck and he squeezes her
He stands and grabs a sack lunch off the counter
On his way out, he kisses Samantha on top of the head
(') Just write the check, babe
Okay
Okay
Bye
Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the dog
(') (as she signs) No more food
You, eat
- Curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door
Keys in his mouth and sack lunch in his hand, he makes his way down the porch steps and onto the front walk
He pops open the chain-link gate and heads for the - parked on the street
Clear blue sky overhead
- Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun
slight breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling
spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the ground
Curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the drill's cabling system and yanks down
Yeah, let's keep going with that bit
It'll go another 10 feet
He yells to (36), a big guy sitting at the controls of a diesel powered -
The truck has a long rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised  on its back
We won't get the gravel pack down today
Why not
4
Those clouds
We're gonna have to call it
Curtis looks back to a potential
Gray clouds forming across the horizon
Happy hour starts at five Dewart
( ) Not if it's rainin'
Ready
Oh, yeah
- Samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric through her sewing machine
She's making curtains
(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed not to sweat
She's a woman with rough edges
(24) cradles a brown-haired  on top of her pregnant, eight month belly
As Nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two kids, (7) and (5), playing with Hannah
They were just drinkin' and laughin' and oh, my god
it was like  was bein' in a museum and saw the progress from apes to men
saw it
saw the future
Dewart, that was him
that was going to be him in 20 years
Oh my god
Cammie laughs
Let me tell you, you laugh
You laugh
But this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar just like `em
Yep
( ) Hannah
Samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside
Hannah, with her back to the house, bangs a 2  4 with a rusted nail in the end into the ground
Samantha is out the door
5
- Samantha walks briskly, talking to the other children
You guys okay
Yeah
Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues banging the two-by-four into the ground
As soon as the child sees her mother, she stops
Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board away from her
Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time
No
Don't touch
Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side
Samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around
(') (signing and speaking) You understand
Hannah nods once, "yes"
(') Oksy
Come here
Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard
is buried in the ground just behind the pile
It's a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky
She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants
Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh
Thunder rumbles low in the distance
She looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside
(') Hey,
Bring the girls inside
- The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark soil into black mud
6
Curtis holds a rain slicker over his head
He watches as the hole they are drilling fills up with brown water
He lifts his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from the mud
Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting up
He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the controls of the rig
What
It's not my fault
told you
Yeah
All right
All right
'm callin' it
Shut it down
Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee
/
- Samantha holds the front door open as Nat and Cammie leave with their children packed up and in tow
It's raining pretty hard outside
Bye guys
Thanks for coming over
'll call next week about the Lions Club supper
Okay
Love you
Bye Sam
Bye Cam
Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat
Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house
The rain outside is the only noise
She heads to the kitchen
, Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching the rain
Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her
She wraps her arms around Hannah, who lifts a hand to the glass
(') Can you sign s-t-o-r-m
7
Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannah's and signs "s-t-o-r-m"
Hannah turns to see her mother's face, and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol
Fingers, spread and bent, moved downward
(') Storm
Hannah looks back out the window
They watch the storm together
/
' /'  - The blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard as Dewart fishes the last Busch tallboy out of icy water
He cracks it open and takes an extended sip
Curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his drunk friend
gotta get home
Nat and me been lookin' into a threesome
We've been chattin' with a girl online from Canton
Yeah
Big `ol girl
What's big
She's about two fifty, two seventy five
She can't be no taller than 5 foot
Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh
Shit man
The laughing subsides
(') don't see me and Sam gettin' into somethin' like that
No
don't guess you would
Dewart is staring at Curtis
(') You got a good life Curtis
8
Curtis shrugs
(') 'm serious
think that's the best compliment you can give a man, take a look at his life and say, that's good
That guy's doin' somethin' right
Well
It ain't always so easy
Hell  know that
Dewart sees something out his window
(') Ah shit
gotta go
Manana
Good night
Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the maze of junk on their front lawn
Dewart passes her without saying a word
Curtis watches as she follows him inside the house, still talking
He shifts into drive and pulls away
- The lights are out and the house is quiet
Curtis eases open the front door and steps inside
Standing on the door mat, he slips off his mud-caked boots and gently sets them aside
'  , Curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open
Hannah is curled up with the covers
He watches her sleep
Samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind Curtis
He turns his head when she approaches
() Hey baby
She wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow to make room for her
They whisper
(') She do all right today
9
She was fine
She's still not playin' with the others, though
She can't connect
Honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back
She fished out a board that had nails on it
'll get to it this weekend
It's quiet for a moment
(') still take off my boots so won't wake her up
She smiles up at her husband
still whisper
He pulls her tight
They stand together in the doorway
The house is silent
- Curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow
He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic playscape in the middle of the backyard
The dog, Red, paces by the back door
He's agitated, but his movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his collar to a nearby post
He barks
Curtis flinches at the loud boom
He looks to the sky and sees dark clouds twisting overhead
Hannah plays, unaffected by the noise
To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland that runs up to his property
Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete culvert that leads out to the open field
giant   gathers force on the horizon there
Red barks incessantly
He winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar
Curtis flinches again as     streaks to the ground in the distance
Sparks shoot into the air leaving a circle of scorched crops
Another  of thunder
10
light rain begins
Red snaps his head around and bucks into the air
He gnashes at the rope
Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to the approaching
He holds up his hand and studies the falling rain
It's the thick, amber colored liquid
With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of out in the field
Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar
He thrashes his head, the rope , and the dog flies toward Curtis and Hannah
Curtis turns to see Red charging them
He barely has time to set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm
They crash to the ground, tangled together
Rain coming down hard now
Curtis yells and waves Hannah back
Red, snapping, buries his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm
Blood streams from the wound
Curtis screams in pain
- Curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm
He grinds his teeth and doubles over in pain
It takes a moment for him to find his bearings
His breathing slows
He gently rubs his hand over the skin on his arm
Sweat has collected around his collar and temples
From the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the room unsure of what just happened to him
- Eggs cool on a plate
Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work
He stares vacantly at his breakfast
He looks up at Hannah
She sits on the floor surrounded by toy building blocks and plays with the dog
She rubs under Red's chest and in turn he licks her face
She smiles and gently pushes him away
Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee
11
Curtis
What
Did you hear me
You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight
Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah
He grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying
(') What's wrong
Nothing
just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin' with the damn dog
She's fine down there
She had toast already
Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair
Curtis backs off, frustrated
Hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog
Hannah
Come here
Hannah
Curtis
What
He stops and checks his watch
(') 'm late
You didn't eat anything
Heading out
It's okay
Curtis is gone
Samantha looks at Hannah on the floor with the dog
12
-   - The main headquarters of Delta Agri-Pro is housed in a giant metal building
row of cheaply built, 70's style offices with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse that contains all manner of agricultural and construction equipment
Tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc
, many of which were represented at Gator's bar yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi-circle around  (53)
He speaks, clipboard in hand
didn't say you had control over the weather Russell, what  did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the 15th
That's non- negotiable
Dewart eats from a bag of Sunflower seeds
Curtis stares down at his forearm
He rubs the skin there
Jim runs a finger down his clipboard
(') Umm, Curtis
Where we at on that east 82nd site
Curtis snaps his head up, takes a second
Yesterday slowed us down
We couldn't get the second pilot hole drilled
Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side melodramatic move
It rained for two hours yesterday
Two hours and our entire schedule went in the toilet
We lose the permit if you're not out of there by end of day
Yes sir
End of day Curtis
Curtis nods
(') All right
Valerie tells me that the father son pancake cook off
13
-   - Curtis and Dewart walk to Curtis' truck
Hey,  gotta make a stop before we head out there
Think we got time
Yeah
There's time
- Dewart stands by a flatbed cart with a prefab sitting on it
Curtis loads chain-link fencing materials onto the cart
- The wheels of the well-drilling rig are half sunk into the muddy soil
Curtis stands over the hole being drilled
The turning metal pole suddenly seizes up and stops
Smoke begins to seep up from the hole
Sonofabitch
Dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look
We stripped that bit
Yeah
Well, bring it up
We gotta re-set it
Dewart walks back to his controls
Curtis heads to the cab of the drilling rig and checks his watch
(') Shit
Something catches his eye in the distance
Clearing past the rig, he walks out into the adjacent field
He removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland that stretch for miles in front of him
In the sky overhead, 14
Hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts in the air
They dive bomb then ascend in intricate, patterns
Curtis watches, mesmerized
Dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches in reverse
Curtis
Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the pattern of birds
They shrink and stretch from thick clumps to long cylindrical tubes
choreography
Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking with the  of metal on metal
You ever see birds fly like that
(holding his hand to his ) What
Curtis looks back, giving the birds a final review
/
' / - The sun has just set adding a purple hue to the sky
Curtis steers his truck up to the front curb of his house
, He sees Samantha standing by her car, the back door open
She watches him pull up
Hannah is already packed into her car seat
( ) Shit
, Curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway
Come on we gotta go
Ah, Jesus
could really use a shower
15
Samantha isn't having it
She climbs in the passenger seat
Curtis makes his way to her car
- Curtis' work boots are encased in dry mud
Chunks have broken off and pepper the thin blue industrial carpet
His mud-stained fingers tap on the top of a desk
Dirt caked under his nails
(
) So if you continue with the basic vocabulary, this will allow you to communicate with your children better
Curtis sits, filthy, at a school desk he doesn't quite fit into
speaks to a   of
(') Between the ages of four and seven the focus is more on the sign and then later we'll begin adding the alphabet as more of a support syster
Now in
Curtis looks over at Samantha, who is sitting in the desk next to him
She won't look at him
He cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room
An   sits on a large, colorful rug with a of , all different ages, playing games that teach hand signs
Hannah actively participates in the group
(') the male sign is signed at the forehead area
For example, father is signed up here like this
Father, very good
Curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for "dad" along with the other parents
-  - Curtis, Samantha, and Hannah sit on the floor in a circle atop the colored rug
Samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes on them
They take turns making the corresponding sign
Curtis stares at Samantha, but she's still giving him the cold shoulder
Finally, while holding up a card, she looks at him
He signs, "'m sorry"
fist moving in a circular motion at his chest
16
You're not sorry
am sorry
She looks to Hannah and signs, "swim"
Well, you stink
You smell really bad
He smiles
think  smell good
She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, "Dad" and "stink"
Curtis turns to some ladies behind him
(') Do  smell good
Samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand
(') See
Maybe  should marry her instead
They continue to laugh
Stop
'  - Curtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the torrential rainfall outside
He shakes water off, wipes his face
The windows are smeared by thick, dark rain
It's hard to see out
He looks over to Hannah sitting in her car seat
It looks odd on the front bench of the truck
He signs to her
(signing and speaking) You okay
She nods
He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers
The liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges
Curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street
He checks his blind spot and pulls away
, 17
Stop lights blur into hazy red and green spheres
Curtis checks the rearview, but the back window is covered by the rain
He tries rolling down his window, but water blows in
He rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse
The truck shimmies from left to right, pushed by the wind rattles
Suddenly, (') Curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel
The truck hydroplanes
Curtis' head busts against the steering column
The front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop
The  of a broken radiator
Curtis winces from the blow to his head
Hannah is crying
He reaches over to her
(') Are you okay
Hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying
Curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head
He's dazed, mumbling
(') You're okay
The truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched up a pole
cut on his forehead has begun to bleed
He sees movement
passes by the hazy side window
moves past the driver's window
The truck shifts as weight is added to the bed
The  of pulling things from the back of the truck
moment
Curtis flinches as a 2X4 pounds the windshield
The truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the hood
Bump
Bump
The roof caves in with two
Curtis looks around frantically
He reaches over to Hannah and begins to unstrap her from the car seat
18
breaks through the Passenger Window
, pale and aggressive, stands in the rain storm staring through the broken glass
She reaches for the lock
Curtis pulls Hannah from the child seat and recoils against his door but is jolted as another board  through the driver's window
yanks Curtis by his collar
He's pulled against the door
pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him
He strains against the arm
Sucks air
Needing to breath
The Woman at the passenger door grabs for Hannah
Curtis kicks at her
's boot   the back window
The Man in the bed of the truck reaches for Curtis' face
He flails and kicks, unable to break free from the forearm at his door
The Woman gets hold of Hannah
The child is yanked from Curtis' arms
He screams
(') Hannah
Hannah
Hands claw at Curtis' face
Scratching
Blood streaks
The Woman has disappeared into the storm with Hannah
Curtis screams
Fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing hold of his cheek
They pull the cheek back
He yells in pain
/ - Samantha walks down the hallway holding Hannah's shoes
Hannah trails behind her
Here honey
Put on your shoes , Samantha walks in
Curtis is standing at the counter in his undershirt and boxers pouring a cup of coffee
(') Good, you're up
Curtis doesn't turn to greet her
He just stirs a spoon in the black coffee
Samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back
She notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat
19
(') Honey, you're soaked
He turns, taking a sip from the mug
She feels his forehead
(') Are you sick
've felt better
guess we could stay home if we need to
Where you goin'
It's Saturday,  was going to take Hannah to my booth
Oh
Yeah
Curtis walks to the table and takes a seat
You look really sick honey
'm all right
It's just a cold or somethin'
Let me get you some Advil
She heads for the hallway
No
Don't worry about it
Ya'll just go
'll be fine
You sure
Yeah
(holds up the mug) Better already
Samantha walks to her purse on the counter and roots through to find a set of keys
20
Okay
got my phone if you need anything
Don't forget Sunday lunch is here tomorrow
This reminder makes Curtis rub his face with a grunt
(') If you're sick, we should cancel
'll be all right
Okay, we'll talk later
She heads for the door with Hannah
(') Come on
Let's go
( ) You sure
Honey, please
Okay
Samantha scoops up her bag and takes Hannah by the hand
They leave the room
Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking at him
Curtis stares back, sipping his coffee
- The reverse lights shine as Curtis' pick-up rumbles backward
Curtis eyes the side mirror as he maneuvers the truck into his backyard
In the mirror, the trash pile comes into view
Just behind it, the   doors appear
The truck shutters to a stop
Curtis studies the Shelter in the side mirror for a moment
grassy bulge with angled metal doors peeking over the trash heap
He climbs out
blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck, floating down to the yard
Curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye the Storm Shelter
He yanks a bale of chain-link from the bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the yard
He steals another glance back toward the Shelter
21
Dropping the bale, he sizes up the space
He looks to the sky
It's a beautiful day
He begins counting off steps from the back fence line
-    - - linen sheet floats down over a folding table
-The hanging bag is placed on a portable clothes rod
-Hands place an assortment of home sewn crafts like napkins and embroidered pillows out onto the table
- tackle box is opened revealing a tray of small bills and change
calculator is removed
Hannah kneels in front of a folding chair behind their at an open-air flea market
She uses the seat of the chair as a table for a tiny porcelain tea set
Samantha stands over her display table smiling and nodding at perusing
-    - - mallet drives tall metal stakes into the ground
-The cord holding together the bale of chain-link is snipped and a boot rolls the fencing out flat
-Chain-link is attached to the stakes with a number of metal braids
-The prefab  is set down in the back corner
Curtis stands in front of his newly created dog pen
It's waist high and about 7'  10', tucked in the back left corner of the yard so that half of the pen is made up by the existing fencing
- Samantha turns to see a large woman holding up an intricately embroidered pillow
You can tell by the look of her that she's a flea market pro, a  (54)
How much you asking for this pillow
22
This pillow's fifteen dollars
That's more than  want to spend
This is all hand stitched
It takes a really long time
That's why charge that
'll give you seven for it
Samantha looks at the woman, who is almost daring her
can't go that low
Well that's my offer
The woman sets down the pillow and begins looking over other items on the table
Samantha bites the inside of her cheek
She doesn't like to haggle
How about 10
The woman doesn't look up
'll give you eight, but it's in change
Samantha forces a smile and motions to Hannah
That's fine
The woman smiles and removes a Ziplock bag of assorted coins from her purse
Hannah takes the bag
(') Lucky for you she likes to count change
Hannah opens the bag and begins to turn it over
-  - Curtis unlatches a piece of the braided wire holding a separated section of fencing that acts like a gate
Red
Come on
23
He opens it and looks down at Red, who sits at his feet
He speaks gently to the dog
(') Get in
Red walks into the pen
(') Good boy
Curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the fence
Red approaches so that his nose is touching Curtis' fingers
Curtis scratches him
(') 'm sorry about this buddy
We just gotta work it like this for awhile okay
Curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans
He sees the Storm Shelter poking up from behind the trash pile
He looks down at Red
Curtis walks to the Shelter
Clearing past the trash pile, the shelter appears, the mound fully visible
Curtis stops at the angled doors
He studies them
rusted padlock is snapped shut across the handles
He reaches out and lifts up the padlock
He yanks on it, then lets it fall
- Coins splash across the kitchen counter
Curtis sets an empty coffee can back on the shelf in front of him and begins sifting through the change
Odd screws, buttons, then he gets to what he's looking for
small set of brass keys on a matching ring
He grabs the keys from the pile and exits
- Curtis walks back out to the storm shelter, keys in hand, long flashlight in his back pocket
He pulls up the padlock that holds the two rusted doors together
Popping off the rubber cover, he tries a key
The lock pops up
He unhooks it from the doors and lets it fall to the ground
Curtis strains to pull the first door open
It's heavy and sticks from lack of use
Finally, with a creak, the door swings back
24
Curtis holds his head to the side, a musty odor coming from inside
He forces the second door open
Curtis stands in front of the shelter, a gaping black hole angled up from the earth
He takes the flashlight from his pocket and turns it on
It illuminates concrete steps leading down
The dog, nose at the fence, watches from his pen on the other side of the yard
Curtis enters the shelter
- It's pitch black inside
Curtis makes his way down the steps and holds out the flashlight
An assortment of trash on the ground, empty cans and water bottles, some candy wrappers
The whole shelter is only about 6'  8'
His head fits fine, but he still ducks like he might bump it
He shines the light on the back wall
rotted, wooden bench is bolted into the concrete there
Curtis walks to it and takes a seat
He's looking back toward the steps now
shaft of light cuts a strict beam through the open doors, lighting only the concrete entry
Curtis takes in the quiet of the concrete box
He leans his head back on the wall and closes his eyes
He shuts off his flashlight
Left in the dark, he takes a deep breath
Exhales slowly
- ( ) While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs wife
Curtis sits in his Lazyboy bent over a frozen dinner
He watches the local news on
Samantha walks in with a glass of milk and some Oreos, a magazine tucked under her arm
- Samantha takes a  down from the top of the fridge
It has designs of starfish and other ocean creatures on it
25
She sets the tin on the counter next to the tackle box she uses as a cash register and yells to Curtis in the den
But that's what  don't understand
If he didn't do anything why did you put him out back
Samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market
She sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box
Curtis says something, but it's inaudible
(') What
She opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word "" written on it in black sharpie
Samantha adds the money to the envelope and puts up the jar
She opens the fridge and takes out the milk
(') You hear me
said if he didn't do anything why did you have to put him outside
Curtis' attention is on the
Samantha sits on the couch
just wanted him to be outside for awhile
He's your dog
He's always been an inside dog
He's my dog, and that's why he's outside
Right now with Hannah and everything  just think it'd be better
Hannah loves Red
Hold on
Curtis stares at the television program
Samantha's eyes narrow
Frustrated, she flips open her magazine
the gas cloud spread across their six acre property
() 26
(') The only way off their land was across the train tracks which were blocked by wreckage
(from a hospital bed) tried using some wet rags and towels to breathe through but that just seemed to make it worse
While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in- law died in the home
Jacobs survived despite enduring eleven hours of exposure to the gas cloud before finally being flown out by helicopter
You hearin' this
Her nose still in the magazine
It's awful
Eleven hours
No way out
Samantha shakes her head
Curtis watches the footage of Walter Jacobs
He watches his red rimmed eyes
The deep lines in his face
- It's daytime, but the house feels dark from the storm blowing outside
The  of rain pelts the windows and roof
Curtis, dressed for work, walks from his bedroom down the hallway
He passes the den and stops at its entryway
, Hannah sits on the couch with her back to him
She's on her knees looking out one of the front windows
dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows
What sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark, thick rain smearing down the outside of the glass
27
Curtis flinches
He shows concern as heavier rain begins battering the house
The wind picks up making wood beams creak on their foundation
Hannah
Hannah doesn't move
She continues staring out the window
The  of the storm outside intensifies
Windows begin to rattle in their frames

The windows
Curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body, trying to protect Hannah
Shards of glass splinter across his face
- Curtis gasps for air
It doesn't come
Gasp
He's sucking for a breath
Hyperventilating
He rises up in bed, gasping
His face flushed and head soaked in sweat
His eyes dart around the room, frantically searching his surroundings
One more gasp, and air enters his lungs
He coughs
More air
Long, deep breaths
He's calming down
His breathing comes under control
His attention turns to something else
Something under the sheets
Curtis pulls back the bed sheets
The mattress is soaked in urine
This scares him
His hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxers
The toilet
Footsteps in heels
Curtis quickly pulls the covers back up
Samantha enters the bedroom
She pulls her hair into a tight ponytail and picks earrings off a nearby dresser, her back to Curtis
Babe

Shannan
She turns
You're still not feeling good

She's taken aback
Okay

He's exhausted
33
Missed you at church this mornin' Curtis

Curtis looks at him
Was it a good service
It was
It was good work

Curtis, how you doin' bud
Hey Doc
How's my girl
35
The Doctor turns to a small table in the corner and grabs a wooden tongue depressor and an otoscope from a drawer
She's good
That's good to hear
Tilt your head back for me
The Doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils
don't have a cold
The Doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table
Oh
Did she get that down wrong
No,  just told her that
Oh
So what's the problem
've been havin'
've been having some trouble sleepin'
was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it
Doctor Shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request
How long's this been goin' on
`Bout four nights now
You're not sleepin' at all
Well some, but real restless
Well,  think four nights is a little too soon to tell
My advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night
Cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine
get some daily exercise
36
Well,  think
Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say
(') think  may need to try some medication
Why do you say that
( ) The reason 've been having trouble sleeping is because of some dreams 've been havin'
didn't think it was anything at first, but then the other day  woke up and the bed was wet
You urinated in your bed
Yeah
Couple days before that had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away
Doctor Shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this
You been to see your mother lately
He swivels the stool around and writes on a prescription pad
It's been about a month
He tears two sheets off and holds the first out to Curtis
Okay
This is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative
It's non- habit forming, but 'm only giving you enough for a few days anyway
Take it and see if it helps
In the meantime, (holds up the other slip) This is the number of a good friend of mine in Columbus
He's a psychiatrist
It's a drive, but he's the best  know
37
Okay
'll give him a call and let him know you'll be down to see him

'm sorry it took so long
Samantha looks at the paper, impressed
Can  give you a hug

Oh, honey
Look at this one
It's a 2-1 and it sits directly on the beach
Wouldn't that be great
We wouldn't have to worry about Hannah crossing traffic

That sounds real nice
Samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as Curtis heads to the bathroom

(') Hey, how much food do you think you'd need to live on for a week
What do you mean

What do you think you'd need
Not a lot
You think

You hear about people livin' for days all the time offa bark and melted snow

Shit  don't know
You asked the question
It's on there

Curtis steps back from the arm of the drill
Dewart taps the wrench on two bolts to make sure they are secure
Curtis flinches at the sound
(') Dammit
What
Curtis turns around and checks the sky
It's clear blue
Not a cloud in sight
It sounds like thunder
What sounds like thunder
Curtis doesn't move
He watches Dewart walk to the controls of the drilling rig
Curtis steps back from the rig and checks the horizons
Nothing
It's a beautiful day
Dewart looks down at him
Curtis' face is pale, scared

Not sure what to say
Curtis turns and walks to his truck

Curtis
Where you goin'

The horizon is still clear
Curtis begins to hyperventilate
Short breaths accompanied by cold sweat
Sucking air
He can't breath
He panics
The truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly slams on the brakes and steers off the highway
Dust settles outside as Curtis begins to get his breathing under control
He rests his head on the steering wheel and shuts his eyes tight
Everything quiets down
His breathing
The road
No more thunder
Curtis looks out his passenger window
His truck has stopped in front of a Tractor Trailer Depot rusted shipping container with giant white letters painted on it reads, "  "

The dirt lot is piled high with containers
He studies the " " sign, then a smaller sign next to it that lists available sizes

Not much furniture or personal trappings

'  - Sarah runs her fingers around the bent edges of a small photo of Hannah
Isn't she lovely
Curtis drops his head
He looks uncomfortable
Mom
46
Yes

She looks at him
Totally open
(') Do you remember what year we brought you up here
To the first place
She has to think about it
(') It was `86
Yes
Because Kyle was going to be a senior
was 10
Yes
Curtis nods
Can you remember what happened before you got diagnosed
What do you mean
mean
just want to know how it all started
Before you had to leave
Sarah settles in her chair, understanding the question
Oh,  don't know
remember it was a real stressful time
Your father was gone a lot, and couldn't handle things on my own
Did you ever have any dreams
Like bad dreams
No
Nothing like that
There was always
() 47
(') (searches for the words) There was always a panic that took hold of me
thought people were watching me or listening to me

Her focus shifts back to her son
Are you okay
Yeah
Yeah
'm fine

He studies the number, then begins drawing a rectangular diagram below it
- Curtis blows into a Styrofoam cup and stares through the blinds of an office window
Outside, a flag snaps at the top of a pole next to the    sign
He looks down at a  laid out on an end table next to him
He flips it over and studies the ads on the back big one in the corner catches his eye
It reads, "
" The ad lists items for sell/trade:
Tactical Gear, Gas Masks, Batons
Curtis focuses in on the words "Gas Masks" and tears the ad out

Curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket
Myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk and looks over the papers
He takes a pen out of his pocket as Curtis sits down next to him
Well you've kept up with the payments on the house
50
We've been good about that
Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern
He confides
gotta tell you Curtis, banks aren't loaning money the way they used to
We've got you a loan today, but the interest rates are variable and we have to tie it to your house
That's fine
Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it
Curtis, 've known you a long time
We financed your house for you, two vehicles
'm telling you this is a risky loan you're taking
need the money John
Myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen
Okay

Right
Well
Curtis slides the yellow legal pad out of the book he brought
It's the library book on Mental Illness
(') Out of the five possible symptoms needed to be diagnosed with : () 54
(') (reads off the pad) delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and the negative symptoms, 've had two
Delusions and hallucinations
But they say it has to continue for six months to be diagnosed schizophrenia and mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere near that long
So,  took this quiz in the back of the book and scored a five out of a possible twenty
Schizophrenia starts at twelve
So, they say it might be a
(reads off the pad) brief psychotic disorder
Whatever it is,  need to know what to do or what to get on to get this thing under control
Kendra stares at him
Look
'm a counselor
Certified, but 'm not a psychiatrist can't prescribe anything to you can talk to you,  can recommend where to send you, but that's it
Curtis begins to gather his things
(') Now that said, if you want to talk, 'll listen
For a lot of people that's a good start
Curtis hesitates
(') Now you said here that your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her thirties
And you're at 35
You wanna talk about that
Curtis settles in his seat
Sets his book on the floor
Yeah,  don't know my mother's symptoms

My brother was 17

Well defined bolts that strobe the night sky silhouetting towering thunderheads

Curtis looks back to Samantha and Hannah, still asleep
He pulls the car over to the shoulder of the interstate and continues watching
He climbs out

Keeping his eyes on the lightning storm, he walks to the shoulder
It's a fantastic display of light
Hurried and intense of lightning reaches down to the ground
Sparks pop off the earth in the distance
Another  streaks down, getting closer
Curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed
( ) Is anyone seeing this
Curtis walks to the back window of the car and sees Samantha sleeping inside
He reaches out to knock but stops himself
He turns back to the lightning and watches

-Curtis, work goggles on, stands in a head deep hole holding a pneumatic jack hammer up to the exposed exterior wall of the storm shelter
He begins hammering
- Samantha's car pulls up and parks on the opposite side of the street from their house
She gets out, puzzled by the Backhoe and Trailer parked in front of her house
Huge light brown tracks of dirt stripe the concrete driveway
Leading Hannah by the hand, Samantha follows the tracks to the backyard
, Samantha stops, mouth agape, stunned by what she sees
20 foot by 8 foot wide hole that is 10 feet deep sits in the middle of her yard
Smaller trenches lead out from it
Dewart leans against the propane tank in the back corner of the yard
He digs dirt from underneath his fingernails with a pocket knife
Seeing Samantha, he waves a hand
Curtis' head appears from the hole
He stops when he sees Samantha
They stare at one another
He can see her surprise
He continues up the ladder and walks over to her
Dewart watches from the back of the yard
Hey
It's all right
Calm down
Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word
(') Samantha
Are you out of your mind
She continues into the house
Curtis turns, frustrated
Dewart takes this in, then goes back to his nails
58
- Hannah watches television in the den by herself
, Samantha sits on the edge of the bed
Curtis stands a few paces back
His hands dug into the back of his dusty jeans
Not a word
You didn't say one word about this to me
Don't you think you owe me that
Don't you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what had to say
didn't want you worryin' about it
Well 'm worried Curtis
How are you paying for all that
got a home improvement loan from the bank
Samantha is stunned
She stands and gets in his face
How could you do that without talking to me
You know the expenses we have comin' up
You want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter
'm doin' it
'm doin' it for us
know you don't understand
You're right
don't understand
don't understand half the stuff you've been doin' lately
don't understand you puttin' Red out back
don't understand you stayin' up all night in that stupid tornado shelter
You don't come to bed half the time
You leave and don't tell me where you're goin'
Explain that to me
Please
Tell me something that helps me understand why you're bein' like this
59
Curtis can't look at her
He tries to find words but fails
There's nothin' to explain
Samantha stares at his face, searching for an answer
She's on the verge of tears
(') 'm gonna go put Hannah to bed
Curtis walks out of the room
Samantha can't hold back, tears run down her face
- Curtis stares at himself in the mirror
He opens the bottle of prescription pills and shakes out two
Looks at them
Shakes out another three
He pops the pills in his mouth and drinks from the faucet
- It's dark and quiet in the house
Samantha sleeps on her side, her back to Curtis
Her head is jostled
More
The bed begins to vibrate
Her eyes open
She turns over to see Curtis
He's having a
Samantha reaches for him
Eyes closed, his body convulses violently
Samantha quickly turns on a bedside lamp
Curtis
She touches his arms
small amount of  begins to trickle from both sides of his mouth
(') Baby
Oh, my God
Baby
Oh, my God
Baby
Samantha jumps off the bed and grabs a cordless phone on the dresser
She dials, watching her husband continue to shake
(') need an ambulance
My husband's having a seizure
41800 Tindale Road
Hurry up
He's bleeding
Samantha goes over to him
Holding her hands out, cautious to touch him
60
(') (into the phone) Okay
Okay
Samantha puts the phone receiver down on the nightstand
The Operator's  still coming through
She touches his arm
Suddenly, the seizures stop
Curtis' body is still
Samantha freezes
His eyes open and he thrashes up in bed
Samantha jumps, tripping and stumbling backward
Curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs
His head darts back and forth, eyes wild
He sees Samantha staring up at him from the floor
He begins to calm down
Curtis touches his mouth
Sees the blood there
(') Honey
Samantha stands up and goes over to him
She sits on the edge of the bed and touches his arm
She's scared
(') Honey
Are you okay
Curtis slowly nods
(') You were having a seizure called an ambulance
Curtis sees the phone on the nightstand and grabs it
(into the phone) No
It's fine
It's fine
Don't send an ambulance
It's fine
Curtis clicks off the phone
What are you doing
Curtis wraps his arms around her
He holds her tight
The of ambulance sirens approach from the distance
Samantha speaks, her voice trembling
(') Baby what's goin' on
61
- The ambulance lights splash across the house
Curtis escorts EMTs down the front walk
He favors his left leg, walking with a slight limp
'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out
It's what we do
Now we can still take you in if you want a doctor to look at those cuts in your mouth
Yeah
That's all right
'll see somebody on Monday
All right
Thanks
Curtis shakes their hands
He turns to walk back in the house and notices  watching from their porches
- Curtis turns up a bottle of peroxide and swishes it in his mouth
It burns
He spits into the kitchen sink
Samantha sits at the table watching him
Concerned, scared
She holds a balled up tissue in her hand
Curtis takes a seat across the table
She waits for him to say something
haven't been honest with you
'm sorry
What's goin' on
've been havin' these dreams guess they're more like nightmares
It's why 've been actin' like this
Samantha listens with a furrowed brow
(') They always start with a kind of storm
Like a real powerful storm
() 62
(') And there's always this dark, thick rain
Like fresh motor oil
And then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy
They attack me
Sometimes they go after Hannah
First one  had Red nearly chewed through my arm
That's why you put him out back
Yeah
What was the dream
Tonight
It was Dewart
We were at the job site
The storm started and somethin' happened
His face
His eyes were different
He came after me with a pick ax
And we fought
And he ran it through my leg
Curtis zones out for a moment
Samantha says nothing
(') It's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream
It's a feeling
'm afraid something might be comin'
Something that's
not right
can not describe it just need you to believe me
Samantha's eyes are red
Her nose
She nods slightly and dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye
(') 've been to a counselor
've seen her a few times
This makes Samantha look up
(') You know what  come from
And promised myself
promised myself would never leave
And  am doin' everything that  can to make that true
The room is quiet
Samantha watches her husband
63
' /   - Hannah lies flat as the sled moves her through the oval scanner
red, lighted crosshair passes over her face
' / - Samantha has Hannah on her lap
She and Curtis listen intently to an  who sits next to them with a file
Since the doctor's approved her for surgery, We just need to get her scheduled
The next possible opening is
(reviews a calendar) The 21st of next month
That's six weeks
Six weeks
Is that okay
It's wonderful
/ - Curtis stands with Russell over the hood of a pick-up truck
They look over a roll of ground water charts
Russell talks and points to the map, but Curtis' attention is focused elsewhere
He watches Dewart in the distance
this point just to the west don't think we'll have any problem
We should be able to get twenty, maybe thirty in this next week
But we're looking to see how that's gonna shape up, so
Dewart smiles and makes broad gestures with his arms
He's telling a story to Dave, who laughs hard
(') Curtis
His attention snaps back
Yeah
64
What do you think
Yeah
That sounds good
We'll get it done
Russell rolls up the charts
They walk toward the work site, toward Dewart
-  /'  - Jim fills out paperwork at his desk
There is a
Come in
Curtis walks inside
He stands in front of the desk
(') What you need Curtis
need a favor Jim
What's that
Can you take Dewart off my crew
Just reassign him someplace else
Jim sets his pen down and leans back
What's the trouble
He not pullin' his weight
No, nothin' like that
He's a good worker
He's a good man
He's my friend
think it'd be easier not being in charge of someone 'm so close to
Jim nods
You know,  understand
This is part of what it means to manage people Curtis
You're gonna have to learn that
65
Yes sir
appreciate that but
well it would just be very helpful in this case
Okay
Well,  can put him with Russell
Anybody else you prefer
No
Whoever you think's right
Okay
Thank you
Curtis turns to leave the office
You been missin' a lotta work Curtis
know
My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits
haven't let anything get behind
No
But don't
Okay
Yessir
Curtis shows himself out
- The sun has just set and a purple hue hangs over everything
Curtis stands in the very back of the yard and watches a guide a long, flatbed trailer up the driveway
An 18 foot metal   rides on the back
- Nat and Samantha sit at the kitchen table going over a list of food in a note pad
know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side
66
What like slaw
Nat gets up to refill her drink
She looks out the back door and surveys the construction zone
lowers the Shipping Container into the giant hole in the backyard
Nat shakes her head
don't know
Maybe a vegetable or salad
Dewart's been tellin' me how strange Curtis has been actin' lately
am so sorry
Nat brings her drink back to the table and sits
Samantha doesn't look up from her pad
(') It's not like you don't have enough on your plate with Hannah
Nat puts her hand on Samantha's
Samantha moves it
Things are fine
We're fine
Nat smiles sympathetically
- Curtis meanders inside
He sees police tactical and survival gear behind the counter
Chief among them is a collection of gas masks hanging on the rear partition
Can  help you
Yeah
Can  look at one of these gas masks
Sure
Which one you want to look at
The newest one
The  of the store removes a mask and hands it to him
Curtis fiddles with the mask
67
(') How much
One seventy eight
Curtis frowns at the price
Anything cheaper
No
That's the cheapest one  got in the store
They go all the way up to two ninety
don't know what you want to spend but a gas mask ain't something you want to go cheap on
You got any kids sizes
No
Kids can't wear those
They got a have a special thing, its like a hood
don't fool with those
Curtis nods
The perusing Shopper listens in
Yeah
Ring me up a couple of `em
- Curtis stands at the driver's door of his pick-up
The box sits on the seat in front of him
He opens it and removes one of the gas masks
He stares into its vacant plastic eyes
He drops the mask back into the box and shakes his head
Sighs, frustrated with it all
He checks over his shoulder, scans the parking lot
- Curtis stands on top of the shipping container that rests in the hole roughly a foot below the yard
Wearing tinted goggles, he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container with a small blowtorch
The sparks stop and Curtis raises the goggles to inspect his work
He kicks at the weld with the heel of his boot and the metal falls into the container
68
He sets down the torch and removes a roof turbine vent from a cardboard box and holds it up next to the newly cut hole
(
) What the hell are you doin'
Curtis smiles to himself
He turns to find (42) standing at the edge of the hole
His hands are tucked into the back of his jeans and he's sizing up the work
Curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto ground level
He holds out a hand and Kyle shakes it, never taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter
(') What you got goin' on here
Just addin' on to the storm shelter
Why
Just `cause
Kyle notices the  piping running in the trenches
You runnin' water to it
Oh, yeah
From our well
Runnin' sewer out to the city line
How much you spendin' on this thing
It's not bad
Doesn't look it
Curtis shrugs
Kyle sees his reluctance
(') You take your eye off the ball one minute in this economy and you're screwed
You got the cash for this
Yeah
69
Don't put nothin' on credit cards
That shit'll eat you up
'm not
Kyle is staring him down
Curtis just looks at the shelter
There's a long silence shared between them
Samantha called me
figured
Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent
(') Called you to come tell me to quit
She called `cause she's worried
Says you've been stressed out
Curtis doesn't answer
(') So
So what
You stressed out
No
No more than anybody else
Work all right
Uh, huh
Hey, look
You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle
That's fine
We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it
You can stop that shit right now
'll come over there and remind you what it feels like to get your ass whipped
Curtis keeps his head down, scolded
Kyle relents
70
(') 'm just coming here to check on you
Well  appreciate it Kyle
You been to see Mom
Yeah
few days ago
She all right
You should see her
Take your girls
Yeah
'll get around to it
There's an awkward moment as Curtis works with his back to Kyle
(') You need a hand
Curtis turns and looks up at him
Shakes his head
No
've got it
Kyle nods
Okay
Call me if you need me okay
will
Kyle looks at him for a moment
He turns and walks toward the driveway
(') Hey Kyle
Kyle turns back
Curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over to him
(') Actually you could do me a favor
What's that
71
You still looking for a dog
Sure
Kyle looks at him
/ - Curtis slaps down the tailgate to Kyle's truck, which is parked in the driveway
Red, tail wagging, hops up into the bed
Curtis closes the tailgate and sets a leash and two bowls into the back of the truck
Curtis rubs Red behind the ears
They got a good spot for you, okay bud
Kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck
You sure
Yeah
know it'll make my girls happy
All right
Kyle walks around the truck to the driver's side
Hey Kyle
Yeah
Kyle stops
Curtis walks up and hugs him
Kyle slaps him on the back
Take care of yourself
All right
All right
will little brother
You take care of your family
Handle your business
Okay
Curtis nods
Kyle smiles, shaking his head
72
(') All right
Kyle climbs into the truck and cranks it
Curtis steps back as he pulls away
Red looks back from the bed of the truck
- Hannah, fresh from the tub, stands to let Curtis rub her wet head with a towel
He finishes and stands
All right
Bedtime
Hannah looks up at him
Curtis signs his hand like a pillow then touches his watch
They move out of the bathroom
/ - Curtis sits on the edge of his bed staring at the window in their room
He's already dressed for work
He watches as the thick, dark rain hits the window and streaks
He has a curious look on his face
, down the hall
, past the den
, into the kitchen
Curtis stops at the entry to the kitchen
Samantha, wearing a robe, stands with her back to him
She's cooking something at the stove
Curtis notices the back door standing open
slants down outside
He looks down at the tile floor
track inside
They lead to where Samantha is standing
She turns to him
She's pale with a vacant look on her face
Her hair is soaking wet
Curtis looks at her, concerned
She stares back, emotionless
She slowly looks down at the counter next to her
kitchen knife rests there
Curtis looks at the knife
They look at one another again
73
- Curtis sits at the breakfast table across from Hannah
He looks over at Samantha
She cooks, her back to him
Hannah climbs out of her chair and goes to look out the back door
Samantha turns and dishes eggs onto Curtis' plate
You okay
She touches his hand
Curtis
Their eyes meet
He wants to take it back, and she can see that
It begins to sink in for her
Hannah vocalizes something behind them
Samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief
Hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door
Samantha turns and sees a  standing in their backyard
She flinches
(') Who's that
Curtis stands to see out the back door
Ah shit
- Jim, Curtis' boss, stands with his hands on his hips looking down at the planted shipping container
Curtis approaches
Hey Jim
Curtis
Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house
Said that's why you wanted him off your crew
came out here to see it myself
Yeah
It was just a hauler and a backhoe
It was Saturday
had `em back in less than 8 hours
You know that doesn't matter can't even tell you how many rules you broke
() 74
(') What if you had an accident
Huh
What if you ran somebody over on your way out here
Lawsuit like that could bankrupt me
Well, 'm sorry Jim
hadn't thought of that
Thank God nothin' like that happened
You know
'll do whatever  can to make it right
You can pick up your last check on Friday
You've got two weeks benefits
Curtis nods
Accepts it
Did you fire Dewart
He's on two weeks leave unpaid
'm sorry Curtis
You did this to yourself
Jim turns and walks out of the backyard
- Samantha clears the table
Hannah sits, watching her father walk in
Curtis stops just inside the door, closes it
've been fired
Samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink
She doesn't look up
What about the health insurance
We get two more weeks
Samantha slams the plates into the sink
They break
She holds her head back and stares at the ceiling
She walks over to Curtis
(') 'm sorry
and  him across the face
Hannah begins to cry
75
Samantha turns and collects Hannah from the table
She grabs her things and walks out of the house
Curtis stands alone in the kitchen
/ - Curtis walks down the hallway to Kendra's office
The door ajar, he knocks and enters
'  - Curtis finds (42), a man in khakis and a button up, sitting behind the desk
Oh, `scuse me
Andy rises from his chair
Are you Curtis
Yeah
Come in
Kendra transferred out
'll be meeting with you today
Curtis looks at the man
He's kind of mincing
(') Please, sit down
Curtis takes a seat
What happened to Kendra
She got into a program at  so she'll be transferring near there
've split her case load with another counselor
It's been kind of crazy around here lately
Huh
So 've looked over your file
It says your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her early thirties
Let's start there
76
Curtis looks at the man for a moment, then stands and walks out of the room
/ - Curtis' truck is parked in the driveway with the hood up and the engine running
Curtis stands over the vibrating engine, studying it
He looks at the belts
He watches them move
- Curtis hefts a porcelain toilet down the steps of the shelter
dull light glows through the new entryway that's been knocked out through the back left wall
Curtis goes through it
, Curtis sets the toilet on the floor
He picks up the camping lantern and holds it up to the space
The lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is
Two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of supplies
Canned food, a small gas burner
Curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the back corner
- Samantha walks inside followed by Hannah and a  from the flea market
'm so sorry
completely forgot
That's okay
Don't worry about it
Here
hope you like them
Samantha hands over the plastic bag
Thanks
brought cash
That's terrific
It's fine
77
Samantha takes three twenties from her
(') Call me if they don't work and 'm sorry again
Oh, it's okay
Thank you
Samantha closes the door
, Samantha takes the tin decorated with ocean creatures down from the fridge
She removes the envelope with the word "" written on it and takes out a stack of bills
She folds the bills over and stuffs them into her purse before placing the empty envelope back in the tin
She looks out back and sees Curtis sitting with Hannah
, The shipping container has been covered over with dirt
Two rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound
Curtis sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with Hannah
He signs something that makes her laugh
Hannah smacks a muddy clump between her hands
Curtis touches her nose, leaving a dirt smudge
Hannah laughs
She touches his face, smudging it
, Samantha watches through the back door
'  - Samantha tucks Hannah into bed
She kisses her on the head and turns out the bedside lamp
Samantha leaves the room
- Samantha steps out of the house
She walks over to Curtis, who is standing on a grassy section of the yard over an assortment of auto parts
They don't speak for a moment
What's that
That's the alternator from the truck
() 78
(') was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there
Ah, what the hell
Maybe 'll hook it up to your old exercycle
Samantha almost smiles
Curtis keeps his eyes on the parts
(') You gonna leave me
Samantha looks at his hands
They hang by his sides
You flinched when  touched your hand this morning
'm sorry
was in one of your dreams
Curtis nods
Yeah
Can you deal with that
He holds open his hand to her
She takes it
Yeah
Okay
Then  made a decision
We cancel the beach trip
We have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check
'm going to get a job
You're gonna find another job
'm going to call to see if we can move Hannah's surgery up
We'll need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year want you to see a psychiatrist
Not a counselor from the free clinic
Someone good
Doctor Shannan gave me the number of somebody
But, uh,  just don't think we can afford it
79
We'll find the money
Also, the Lions Club supper's this weekend
want you to come with me
don't want to see any of those people
want you to go
need to do something normal
All right
Curtis nods
Samantha let's go of his hand and walks back to the house
Curtis goes back to studying the auto parts
- The inside of the club is a musty banquet hall with wood panelled walls and a drop tile ceiling
The place is packed
Rows of folding tables fill the center of the room
long has formed along the side wall that wraps to a serving station at the back
Heated metal bins filled with fried oysters and french fries
Curtis gets in line with his family
, Curtis holds two paper plates
How many pieces does Hannah get
Just one
Curtis uses tongs to grab pieces of fried oyster
Looking up, he can see back through the kitchen to an open door outside
Dewart stands there over a butane fired frying pot
He wears an apron and stares at Curtis
Curtis moves down the line
- Lewis sits with Cammie and their baby
He laughs and talks with another man
From a different table, Russell leans over to eye Curtis
80
Curtis sits at a table with his family
He loads Hannah's plate up with ketchup
tap on his shoulder
Curtis turns to find Dewart standing over him
What're you doin' here
Not here man
Dewart taps him on the shoulder again
said what are you doin' here
Curtis stands and Dewart takes a step back
The general noise of the place starts to quiet down as people take notice
few stand
Curtis
told people what you been doin'
know
You cut me loose
Everything we been through
know
'm sorry
Dewart shoves him in the chest
You ain't fucking sorry
You sorry you wouldn't cut me loose
We fuckin' friends
This how you treat friends
Curtis places a hand on Dewart's chest
Come on
Dewart punches Curtis in the face
It stings
(') God dammit
81
Samantha gathers Hannah and moves back
Dewart shoves Curtis across the table
Oysters and bottles go everywhere
The entire room is on its feet watching
Curtis slips getting up
Dewart walks around the table, heading for him
Curtis stands and kicks Dewart in the knee
It buckles back and he's on the floor
He cries out and grabs the twisted joint
He's done
Curtis paces over him, covered in ketchup and soda
He shouts down at him
He wipes at his face
Sees all of the people staring at him
Addresses them
(') You think 'm crazy
Huh
Is that what he told you
Curtis
He points to the gawking crowd
(') Well, listen up
There is a storm comin' like nothing you have ever seen
And not a one of you is prepared for it
() You think 'm crazy
' ' () You think 'm a thief
Hannah watches
She looks on as Curtis paces, pointing and yelling, red faced at the crowd
Curtis backs off
(') Sleep well in your beds
Cause if this thing comes true, there ain't gonna be any more
Curtis looks down at Dewart
He turns to see Hannah
She's tucked under her Mother's leg crying
This hits him hard
He stops
Looking at Samantha, his eyes fill with tears
82
Samantha, leading Hannah by the hand, walks to Curtis
He stares at her, on the verge of breaking down
She takes her hand and gently pulls his head down to her shoulder
Without another look toward the crowd, Samantha leads her family out of the dining hall
- Hannah stands on a toolbox and rests her elbows on the side of Curtis' truck
The hood is open
She watches her father fiddle with re-installing the alternator
His fingers covered in grease
Hannah steps down from the toolbox and walks into the front yard
Curtis pauses, hearing a high-pitched, warbling in the distance
He notices Hannah is gone
Hannah
He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing on the curb
She looks down the street
He runs down his driveway, wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon
(') Hannah
, flying in intricate geometric patterns, swarm above the house at the end of the street
They twist and bend into speckled black shapes
Hannah, watching, walks into the street
Curtis catches her by the hand
He turns away from the birds to see a building on the opposite horizon
He scoops Hannah into his arms, stepping back from it
The  of the birds grows louder
Curtis pivots to find the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him
He turns away as the wall of birds crash past him
The force so powerful it knocks him backward
He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and wings
The Flock passes
Curtis stands, his face cut and scraped
Hannah cries, clinging to his chest
The windshield of a car parked next to him
Curtis looks at the broken glass
dead bird, it's neck broken, rests crumpled on the hood
83
Another bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him
Then another
Curtis looks up
The Flock of birds are circling overhead and diving down at him
More birds crashing to the ground
Curtis covers his head
The neighborhood's tornado  begin to sound
Curtis rushes Hannah toward his front door as dozens of birds plummet from the sky
The sirens
- Curtis wakes to Samantha shaking him by the shoulders
She's nearly on top of him in the bed
Curtis
Wake up
Wake up
continue to scream throughout the neighborhood
Curtis looks to the window
Rain and hail are battering the house
He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm
They rush out of the room
'  - Curtis bursts into the room
Hannah is standing at the window looking out
Curtis scoops her up, scaring her
She begins to cry as they run from the room
- Wind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground
Rain cuts at a sharp angle
The Tornado Sirens continue
Curtis, Hannah in his arms and Samantha close behind, exits the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter
He passes Hannah to Samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys
At the doors to the shelter, Samantha holds her robe up to shield Hannah from the hail
Curtis gets the lock and opens the door
They go inside
- Curtis slams the doors behind them
It's pitch black until he gets to the switch on the lantern
The room fills with the orange glow as Curtis snaps the padlock through the door handles
84
Come on
It's okay
Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of the shelter
Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one of the cots
She's signing to her, trying to calm her down
(') It's okay
All right
Come on
Sit down
Curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting through it
He removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask connected to a small tank
He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah
He tries slipping the oxygen mask over her face
Samantha grabs his wrist
No
Don't do that
It's okay
It's oxygen
Here
Put this on
Curtis hands Samantha a gas mask
Are you kidding
Please just do it
Okay
He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face
(') There we go
All right
Keep it out of your eyes
Okay
He signs to her
(') Hey
love you
It's okay
Curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank
He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them
He slips on his gas mask
Samantha is hesitant
She looks at her husband in the mask and leans back against the side of the container
Hannah looks up at her
She touches her mother's mask
Samantha slips on the gas mask
85
The camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up
The faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside
The family sits huddled together on the cot, wearing their masks
- of thunder rattles the shelter
Curtis snaps awake, still wearing his gas mask
Samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep
Hannah sleeps under Curtis' arm
He gently lays her down on the cot and stands to stretch
He walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a small flashlight off the metal shelving
He clicks it on and moves over to the concrete steps
He takes a seat and listens
He places his hand onto the metal door
of thunder
He can hear the rain and wind blowing outside
- Samantha rubs Curtis' shoulder, gently waking him
Wake up babe
Curtis' head moves
He sees that Samantha and Hannah have removed their masks
Where's your mask
We took them off
It's fine
Take it off
No
Curtis hesitates
We're fine
Take it off
Curtis slips the mask off his face
Worried, he takes a breath
(') You need to open the door now
86
Curtis doesn't move
He looks at them
() What if it's
What if it's not over
What
What if it's not over
It's over
Get the keys
Open the door
Curtis slowly gets to his feet
He sees the dark entryway to the original section of the shelter
Taking the lantern, he walks to it
Samantha and Hannah follow
Curtis stops just inside
He holds the lantern up, illuminating the padlocked metal doors
He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps
He places his hand on the door
He flinches
It's still storming
No
It's not
can hear it
Samantha stares at him
The room is silent
don't hear anything
Put your hand on the door
You can feel it
He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors
He watches her face as she places a hand against the metal
She looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head "no"
Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from earlier
(') (signing and speaking) Thunder
Do you feel it
87
He flinches again
Looks to the ceiling (') (signing and speaking) You feel it
You feel it
Hannah walks to her mother
Samantha holds onto her
Curtis steps back from them
They watch him, their backs to the doors
He flinches and covers his mouth
(') 'm sorry
Baby, there's no storm outside
'm sorry
Samantha walks over to him
Curtis
wouldn't lie to you
We love you very much
Please open the door
Curtis is on the verge of tears
He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket
He removes the keys
He holds them out to Samantha
'm sorry
can't
Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis
Tears shake from his trembling face
love you, but if  open the door, then nothin's gonna change
You'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change
Please
This is what it means to stay with us
This is something you have to do
He looks at Hannah, then Samantha
Curtis steadies himself, trying to control his flinching
He wipes his face with the back of his hands and takes a deep breath
Curtis walks toward the doors
On the steps, he reaches up to the padlock
The keys shake in his fingers
He turns to Samantha
Could you move Hannah back
88
Samantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them retreat to the rear wall
He goes back to the lock
He inserts the key
The padlock pops open
Curtis removes it
He looks back at Samantha, then flings open the doors
It's blinding
Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes
He stares up at a crystal blue sky
Samantha watches as Curtis steps out of the shelter
- Curtis rises through the storm shelter's entryway
Out of the corner of his eye he catches, Curtis is startled
He turns to see a  of  from the power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner of the house
power line dangles overhead
He turns to see  in their yards clearing debris
Leaves and branches clutter the ground
The aftermath of a storm
Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah
She surveys the damage
It's fine
She walks over to Curtis and hugs him
He kisses Samantha on the head
Curtis looks up at the sky
- Curtis sits with Samantha in the plush office of a (56)
Curtis rubs his hand over the soft leather upholstery on the couch
Do you have any vacation time that you could use
don't have a job right now
Well,  know that times are hard, but  think it's really important for you to separate yourself from that storm shelter
() 89
(') think you need to break away from it for awhile
We can start you on some medication that  think will help, but that action alone would mean a lot
We usually go on a trip to Myrtle Beach every summer
We were gonns go this month
think that would be okay if we start the medication now
It would give you all some time to prepare as a family, but  want to be clear, when Curtis gets back he'll need to take more time than that
What does that mean
mean that he'll need hands on therapy at a real facility
Curtis looks up for the first time
You mean  have to leave my family
think you need to seriously commit to some treatment
Curtis processes this
Samantha takes his hand
/ - Curtis scoops handfuls of sand out of a foot deep hole on the beach
He slops the wet mixture into a castle shaped bucket, his back to the shoreline of gentle, breaking waves
(signing and speaking) Hey
Good, huh
Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry sand over castle shaped mounds already formed
- Samantha drops four hotdogs into a boiling pot of water and stirs a bubbling pot of canned chili
90
The beach condo is small, but brightly furnished
/ - The wooden deck hangs off the back of the beach condo picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks lifts the corner of a stack of napkins
The wind blows harder, fanning the napkins off the table
, Curtis, still working in the sand, puts a top on the sand castle
Good
We put a top on it
Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and turns it over to top off their sand mound
He hands the bucket over for Hannah to refill
The  of the waves behind them has
They don't notice
Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the sand castle
Curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees Hannah staring at the water
She looks at him and signs something with her hands
(') What is it honey
Curtis misses it
He shakes his head, "no", and Hannah signs again, slowly: "----"
(') What
Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet
He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized
Scared, she looks to her father
He grabs her under the arms and rests her on his hip
She buries her head into his chest
, gust of wind greets Samantha as she walks out onto the deck holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili
She stops, seeing the horizon
Her mouth falls open
She slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table, her mind racing
She looks down at Curtis in disbelief
91
Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact
He studies her face
Samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all
She looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis
Concern on her face, she nods to him
Curtis sees her nod
Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to apologize
After a moment, she mouths to him, " love you
" Curtis nods back to her
She looks back up to the shoreline
, Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo
, Samantha hasn't moved from the porch
light rain begins to fall
Her hands grip the railing
She turns her left palm up
Dark rain collects there
, 100 Behind Samantha, Curtis appears in the open sliding door clutching Hannah
The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass next to him
(') Sam
Samantha looks down at her palm
She rubs the thick, viscous rain in her fingers
She looks back up at the storm
On Samantha's face, Okay
