Gothika by Sebastian Gutierrez December 8, 2002 The Woodward Forensic Institute () is a 175-bed Intermediate Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric patients
Its primary clientele are those who have histories of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian
: : '  - in on a sleeping couple in the dark
The reads 5:59
The woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off
She grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it
Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc
)
This is  : 30, sharp and prettier than she knows
- Miranda slides through the water
Swimming cap on, goggles
Her   takes us in and out of the water
Something unsettling about this sound
Something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path
Like graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat
She emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself in a towel
- Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper
- Miranda's husband   (older, a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast
Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file
He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper
pleasant domestic scene
It's 8:00
'     - Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps
Doug kisses his wife and hops out
Exemplary carpoolers
Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives off
- Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate
lets her in
As the car drives past we read the plate on the wall: () 2
: "  " The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we
- '  - Stark walls
Simple decor
Bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas
Miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, : charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke
Mid-session: This is your stepfather who came to visit you
My stepfather
No
He's dead
(beat) killed him
Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough
Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist
That's the first time you admit it
So
There's a first time for everything
(jotting this down) It means you're finally past the denial stage
This is good, Chloe
never killed anyone who didn't deserve it
You only killed your stepfather as far as  know
should've taken care of my mother
She knew all along
You remind me of her
() 3
: remind you of your mother
Always so put together
Like you iron your underwear
Like your pussy is the apricot of the Promised Land and the bread of the -- (getting her back on track) Let's get back to your visitor last night
The Devil
Alright, the Devil
Why would the Devil visit you
It's already hell in here, what would he have to gain
He came to fuck an angel
(giggles at that) 'm his dirty angel
Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room Darkness
Miranda's breathing speeds up
He grabbed me by the hair while sucked him and usually  love that,  just do -- maybe you can tell me why  love it so much -- but not this time, he was just too rough -- As suddenly as it went out, now the visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock
That's it until Monday
Try and get some sleep tonight, okay
Sure, Doctor
(leans in) Crazy people hear messages from God
Not the Devil
You know that, right
() 4
: didn't say you were crazy
You don't have to say it
She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this
Almost
appear at the door
Miranda nods for them to escort Chloe
Chloe shakes their hands away from her, strides off dramatically
The princess of the asylum
- Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork
The end of another workweek
, a good ten years older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches
Dr
Grey
Dr
Graham
They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other lot
Power went out again in our wing
(knows what's coming) Same here
It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, you know
You're not shrink appropriate and you're about to get promoted
Everybody's afraid of something
What am  afraid of
Yourself
At least you should be
What are you up to this weekend
() 5
: Write a little country music, decline invites to grand social events, drink myself to sleep -- the usual
You
Doug wants to look at some Real Estate up at Willow's Creek
Again
He thinks it's fun
So is golfing, 'm told
Who was your six o'clock
Chloe McGrath -- talk about trying to empty the ocean with a tea cup
She's a mess
hear Manhattan's full of them
Don't start with that
already turned down the job
We're staying
Good girl
They have reached an office marked " " and peer in to see Parsons (50's, distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the phone
He gestures for Pete to sit
Miranda is about to exit when he covers the mouthpiece -- Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to set that dinner with you and Doug
Are you free tonight
He's stuck at a school board meeting
Parsons looks through his appointment book
() 6
: You've been here a year already, Dorothy's starting to take this personal
How's next Wednesday
Next Wednesday it is, Phil
He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone call
- Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind
waves her off
- Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up ahead
knocked-down telephone post blocks the road
at the scene
patrolman waves her down
'  -  - , 40', recognizes her and ambles over
Anybody hurt, Sheriff
Nah, telephone post just decided to fall
It'll take us a while to clear this up so 'm afraid you're gonna have to take the long way home, Miranda
If you say so
And tell your husband he owes me a phone call
Will do
Wouldn't want him in trouble with the authorities
() 7
: That a girl
The law never sleeps and all that
You take care now
He taps on her hood and heads back to the site
She shifts into reverse and makes a -turn
- Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge
Something definitely creepy about this deserted place -- '  - Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the machine
(into phone) Hi, it's me
Are you there
Pick up, pick up
'm on my way but just got detoured so 'm
bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the passenger seat
She reaches for it and when she looks up we see: stands smack in front of us
Naked
About to get pummelled by us
Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing
as she struggles to regain control of the car and finally     -- She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing back there
Drunk or high or in any case completely out of it
(into phone) Stay on the line
Don't go anywhere
The weirdest thing just -- (the phone cuts out) Hello
Hello
() 8
: She stares at the dead phone
Punches the buttons on it
No go
Wonderful
She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car
- Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not moving
Just standing there
Her back to us
Hello
Are you hurt
Hello
Nothing
As we get closer we see she is covered in bruises
Clearly something horrible has happened to her
Were you in an accident
Were you attacked
It's okay, 'm a doctor
(beat) My name is Miranda Grey
And now she turns
Young, seventeen tops
Busted lip, black eye
Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around the girl -- You're in shock right now, that's perfectly natural
'm going to get you to the hospital
Okay
The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm
Hard
Don't be scared
It's going to be fine
Now the girl is touching Miranda's face
Her movements desperate, smothering
Like the movements of a drowning person
Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down
Hands off me, okay
Tell me your name, do you remember your name
The girl tries to speak but no words come out
Instead she produces a strained, wettish sound
Creepy as hell
And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking -- () 9
: What are you doing
'm trying to help you --
The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake
And as Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body
: - Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat
Just a bad dream beat
at first but  , we hear a outside
Like an  of some sort, but vaguely familiar: , ,
Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of water on her bedside table
Except
it's not there
She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed
And now she glances around the room and realizes this is not her bedroom
She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark
Trips over something
that
Her heartbeat goes haywire
She feels her way along the wall to a small opening in the door
glass pane
She peers through the glass at the empty corridor outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's inside a cell
She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic -- Hello
Somebody help me
-  - through the tall iron gates, past the guard
Now we spot the source of our continuing sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens
The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab prison, with separate wings (male and female), research units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center
10
- bored group of female patients listen to a social worker lecturing them
janitor mops a long corridor
Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of orderlies
doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as )
They force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing her tongue, prepare a syringe
Institute director Phil Parsons at a meeting with other doctors, discussing a patient's progress on a chart
Now we are  up the main building's wall and large windows into -- Pete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a , who nods respectfully as he goes -- ' An  unlocks the door for Pete
Through the glass pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's:
#1 Sleeping beauty is awake
Peter forces a smile, enters -- ' Peter, what the hell is going on
Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here
How do you feel
How do you think  feel
Is this a joke
Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the nurse with the meds to come in
Miranda catches all of this, growing more agitated
She wears the uniform all patients wear: a white -shirt and sweats
Her wedding ring is gone
() 11
: What are you doing
Giving you something to calm down
don't need to calm down
What need is an explanation Pete grabs the meds from the nurse
Irene and the attendant step closer to help
Miranda feels them closing in on her
Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle: Just take this and we can sit down and chat
Why here, why not in my office
She looks at the silent faces around her
No sympathy
Or maybe too much sympathy
Either way it's unnerving
don't want an anticonvulsant, at least give me Valium
(nods at nurse) Fifty milligrams
Jesus Christ, you're gonna knock me out
Ten milligrams
(final offer) Twenty
The nurse complies
Miranda stares at the meds, trying desperately to put this into some kind of perspective
How would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell, dressed like this
We can discuss it at length after you take your meds
Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant
Pete holds Miranda's gaze
Miranda takes her meds
() 12
: Okay
This better be good
Pete motions for the others to leave them alone
One by one they file out and lock the door behind them
'  - Miranda paces
Alone with Pete, she is even more upset
Miranda, this is very awkward
Technically  shouldn't even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until you're transferred
So whatever is said here won't leave this room won't tell Parsons,  won't tell anyone
want to talk to my husband
You can't to that
Sit down, please
Try to relax
Why would  pretend to be in any way relaxed
understand you're upset
But we need to put some things in order
Two massive understatements
He hesitates, unsure where to begin
How long have you been here
(laughs) What is this
Why are you doing this to me
Just answer the question
Humor me
() 13
: Hi, my name is Miranda Grey
'm a psychiatrist
transferred here to the Woodward Forensic Institute a little over a year ago
My job entails dealing with a ward of schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-fife -- don't mean how long you've worked here,  mean how long you've been staying here
This stops her
Wanting desperately to whip out a comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer
'm a doctor, yes
Or was medical school just an elaborate dream
Of course you're a doctor great doctor in fact
The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her
Pete, how long have  been here
Five days
(barely audible) What
You were admitted to the neurosurgical unit seizing violently
That lasted three days
Scans revealed left-sided weakness, numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits
Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we -- - Miranda seizing violently   : Doctors struggling to contain her
Arms thrashing, legs
of the wall, the floor
Head crashing against a cart, out of control
() 14
: (
) You came out of it and tested negative for , underwent extensive hypnosis and received amytal injections
: Miranda being tied down
nurse with a syringe -- '  -   () She looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks
You were tied down for a day and a half so you wouldn't hurt yourself and then you went into a state of, well -- (how to put this
) You've been pretty much catatonic
(beat) This is the first time you speak
Miranda, speechless
Reality sinking in
Doug must be worried sick
need to call him -- Pete shakes his head emphatically
You're the most logical person know, bar none
Plus you have a photographic memory -- unconfirmed, but you do remember events and phrases more accurately than anyone around
Why am  telling you this
You're establishing my personality as fairly intellectual, you don't consider me impulsive or emotional
And that's a fair assessment, no
Yes, that's fair
And following this pattern of analysis, we're about to discuss a traumatic event that rendered this psychological profile useless, correct
() 15
: Two hundred percent
pause here
He's waiting for her to continue
She's not used to being on the other side of the therapist's table
You think 'm in denial
That 'm putting on a brave show -- that this is a 'cover' for some unbearable emotion 'm hiding
Why
Don't analyze yourself, just focus on remembering
remember Friday night after work, if you say that was five days ago -- (pushing on) Anyway,  asked you what you were doing for the weekend and you said the usual and you made a joke about writing country songs and drinking yourself to sleep and told you  was going to look at some real estate in Willows Creek with Doug
And then what
Then  drove home
And then what
got home,  guess, and had dinner by myself because -- (pauses, struggling) Because Doug had an alumni meeting at his school and he was going to get a ride back
He's the principal now, as you well know
She stops here
Pete waits
The silence is deafening
She pushes on, but her hands shake a little
() 16
: But wait -- there was an accident before that, wasn't there
girl -- she had been beaten
took her to the hospital, right
There was indeed an accident, you were detoured by the cops
But there's no report of any girl
No, the cops weren't there
They were back on Main Road knocked-down telephone post, correct
Pete nods
Miranda is all foggy on the details: saw the girl after that
She was bleeding
- sway in the night breeze with their gentle tinkling , more menacing than joyful -- : '  - breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it
: - ' Jittery, alert
We scour her every blood vessel, iris, pupil
the  and now we distinctly make out an eerie shape reflected inside of it
But just for a sec -- The teenage girl
(
) What about your husband, what can you tell me about him
17
'  -   () Miranda shakes the puzzling images out of her head: Excuse me
What's the last memory you have of him that night
My last --
(frowns) Tell me nothing happened to Doug
Let's backtrack a second
You left your office, you were driving home, you got detoured by the police -- Did you call someone on the phone that night
don't know
might have
Who would you call
might have called Doug to tell him something
Or checked my answering service
Were you seeing someone else that night
beg your pardon
There was some trouble in your marriage, wasn't there
Of course not
She shakes her head emphatically as we: : -
- the large space to find Miranda and a (whose face we don't see) kissing heatedly
() 18
: (
) Wasn't there
'  -   () Miranda chases the disconcerting image out of her head
No
There was no trouble in my marriage,  don't know what -- (stops herself) There is no trouble in my marriage
You just used the past tense; why
His face says he doesn't know how to tell her
Did something happen to Doug
You don't remember anything else
Anything at all
Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to dial: This is preposterous
What's wrong with Doug
He's dead
This stops her cold
Time stands eerily still
She stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he will contradict his statement
No, he's not
Don't tell me that
Don't tell me that
(sickened) Are you -- sure
'm positive
(painful beat) You killed him
- Irene and   rush to Miranda's cell
her hysterical  from inside -- 19
'  - Pete struggles to contain Miranda, who howls disparagingly
It's going to be alright, Miranda
You just need to sleep
It's going to be alright -- Off Pete's nod, a nurse injects the syringe into Miranda's arm
They hold her down with great effort as she continues to cry, and we
: - blur of images and scrambled snippets of memories come at us rapid-fire, like a drug-induced dream: - Miranda's   to a stop and she jumps out, glances around
'   -  - Graduation night
School principal Douglas Grey shakes hands with proud parents and clumsily formal students
Miranda grabs a drink from a nearby tray, bored
(re: her drink) Is that number three
Yes, Mr
Principal
Special occasion -- 'm celebrating how proud  am of my husband tonight
He smiles weakly at the compliment
Moves his hand towards her, in an affectionate gesture (or so Miranda thinks) but instead fixes her bra strap
Ever methodical
- Miranda and a man exit the theater
Giggling
: 20
' Doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains
Bloodstained axe on floor in f
g
Walls covered with bloodstains
- flustered Miranda fumbles with her purse and keys, heads for the door
She tries to fix her smeared lipstick and messed-up hair
: 'm sorry
The fact is 'm married and  -- this is not me, this is a mistake
First we hear our mystery man's voice, then we see him: Pete
(Yes, the same person she kissed and went to the movies with
) He places his hand on the door, blocking her
Your marriage is the mistake and you know it
Don't
'm sorry
That was out of line
feel like a school kid hiding from the Principal
We are hiding from the Principal
He smiles
Touches her face tenderly
Torn
person used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the moment
would just like to spend some time together
We spend time together every day
meant minus the schizophrenic women
have to go
need time to think
() 21
: He nods
Opens the door for her
She starts to walk away
Don't be too hard on yourself, Dr
Grey
You haven't done anything wrong
Not yet
But  want to
'  - a quiet house on a quiet suburban street
Two Volvos parked in the driveway
Perfectly-kept front lawn
: -
' Another near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains
Bloodstained axe on floor in f
g
Walls covered with bloodstains
- Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding
It's clearly hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a handkerchief
'  - breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it
She looks down at her hand, noticing the blood -- and now we are back in -- '  -  () Miranda wakes up with a start
The darkness renders the room almost void of any color
Monochromatic
It takes her a moment to orient herself
Her eyes wander across the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched
We become aware of a   sound
Like somebody is standing over her bed
But we don't see anything
Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor
She glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and bangs on the door
() 22
: Can  get some assistance here
Hello
She waits
Bangs on the door again
Irene
Anybody
beat
And now finally we hear
light is switched on down the corridor
The  get
and
Miranda tries to appear composed
Wipes sweat off her forehead
Fixes her hair
The  now  right out side the door
goes into the lock and it
Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens
Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and peeks -- The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a pair of piercing eyes
The eerie teenage girl
Miranda jumps back, screams
And when she looks up again, the image is gone
beat
Rational thought kicking in -- (to self) Wake up, wake up
(beat) You're dreaming
It's not real
An anxiety dream, that's all
That's all
This is dream logic
If it was real, they would have heard you scream
There are twenty employees on the night shift
Fact
At least twenty
She props herself with her back against the wall
With a view of the whole cell
Just in case
Staring at the door
'm just dreaming
And now,  at first, but   -- can be heard  outside
Just like before
() 23
: 'm dreaming, 'm dreaming, 'm dreaming, 'm dreaming
Like her life depends on that mantra
The  get And her voice begins to falter -- (voice rising) 'm dreaming, 'm dreaming -- And now the  pause outside her door like before and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are hit with the sudden glare of returning light
and then   -- (
) Rise and shine, ladies
'  - Irene tries to shake Miranda awake
An orderly and nurse stand by
(shaking her) That means you, honey
Up --
No reaction
Rise and shine now
Wake up
She shakes her harder
And now Miranda's and she grips Irene's arm
Hard
Like the teenage girl did
Easy now, it's okay
Miranda stares at her, coming back to
Starts to speak but has no voice
Clears her throat -- need to see Peter Graham
And you have a session scheduled this afternoon -- Right now
() 24
: He's not even in yet, now let go my arm, honey
Doctor Grey, if you don't mind
Actually  do mind
start calling you 'doctor' and everybody else wants to be called 'doctor' -- Please
It's a bit different, wouldn't you say --
Irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup with meds on it
What do you think you're doing want to speak to my lawyer -- wait, what are you doing
My job
Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth -- 'mon, Irene, don't do this
'm calm now, look -- 'm calm --
She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates her
- the female patients at their usual activities
Some watch , play dominoes, some pretend to read, some stare out blankly
Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead named : Mallorol, Matzine, Megaphen, Meallaril-, Meleretten, Meleril, Mellaril, Mellaril-, Mesoridazine, Methotrimaprazine, Mixidol, Moban Modalina -- () 25
: Modalina
Isn't that a band
Trade name for Triflupoerazine
Look it up
Chloe shrugs, if you say so
Jenna resumes: Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress, Motival
That's it for the ''s
Not bad
High potency neuroleptics starting with '
' Trick question
There's only Jatroneural
What do you wanna bet
Bet you a soda
Chloe checks a reference book
Nods, impressed
Right on the money, cowgirl
Twenty points and a soda
to another patient, (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit) moseying across the room
Nervously takes a seat beside Miranda
Hi there, Doc
It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to react
She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out of it
never got shrinked by you but all  hear is nothing gets past you,  mean, that's just hearsay and  don't pay much attention to hearsay because now they say you hacked your husband with an axe but  say maybe it just slipped, right
() 26
: Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled Shelley catches this look and slides it over to her
Without malice, like a child
They put your picture in the paper
It reads " " Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house
Miranda stares at it in disbelief
Growing sick
How did you get this
Chloe did
Who knows how
Not me
Around here 'm on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff  don't need to know
My point is about people talking behind other people's backs
Like before  was here, everything did  thought, 'this'll get them,' wanting their approval, wanting them to say good things behind my back
But now 'm more anonymous, more myself
'm Shelley
Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has no problem holding a conversation all by herself -- You're not like, undercover here, are you
They pulled that at Spring Grove, had a bunch of doctors pretend they were patients, see if they could handle it
Most quit after day one
You're not, are you
No, Shelley
'm not undercover
Because if you were, 'm like the Fort Knox of secrets
Ask anybody
That's good to know
But 'm not
() 27
: Say no more
(sotto) understand perfectly
She hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers: Drawing is a great cover
Good luck to you
With a wink, she's gone
Miranda looks at the room around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about, arguing -- Life among the insane
-   - Patients undress in the bare-bones locker area
An uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by Irene
don't --  think 'm alright
You go in last because you're special
(off Miranda's look) It's not a Mexican prison, toots
Everybody here minds their own business
If it's all the same, 'd rather -- State law says we keep you ladies clean
And 'm a stickler for the law
(beat) Now come on
If you go downtown, you gotta dance
Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of the shower
Something vaguely concentration camp-like about institutional bathing
() 28
: The shower, like everything else in this place, is regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of patients each get their turn
Miranda feels Chloe's gaze on her across the room
She is stripping off her clothes for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last refrain from the Stones' "
" (checking watch) That's five minutes, group one
(to Chloe's group) Alright, ladies, nice and easy
The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past Miranda, in all shapes and sizes
She registers their many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls: names of men, places, religious quotes
Burn scars, cuts, needle marks
They begin to towel off as Miranda, slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in the corner
moment later Irene nods for her to go in
- Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out
The  slowly   until all we have is Miranda and her
Chloe and Shelley, the last two out from the previous group, grab towels
Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but Miranda is not staring at her
She is staring past her at the tile wall
More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out
Clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe
the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of blood emerge, following by a  sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system
The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the tile
The   , , and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall
Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers
Panic
Shuts her eyes
() 29
: (to self) It isn't real
It isn't real
Opens her eyes
Five letters are written in blood
----
Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the drain, too scared to look back up
(to self) It isn't real
You're hallucinating
Perhaps
But now blood drips by       her ankle, , , And the shooting pain she       feels is coming from her arm
What the hell --
appearing on her skin, like some invisible      knife is slicing her
Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers -- - Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked out to process anything
Fumbles for her clothes and heads straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering
Shelley
And pick up those damn cigarette butts
Jesus,  is dumb -- Shelley, can you do me a favor
Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look
The housewives will find something better to do
Can you go in the shower and tell me if you see anything on the wall
Shelley doesn't respond
Simply crosses over and heads for the showers
Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her shoulder makes her jump -- () 30
: Enough privacy for you
Yes
Thank you, Irene
But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the towel
What did you do
Nothing
It's nothing -- What the hell did you do to yourself
And now the other patients are curiously watching as orderlies   to haul her away
- a glass pane we see a  bandaging Miranda's arm
Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room
looked away for a second
It's unacceptable, won't happen again
Not your fault
Patients always find a way to hurt themselves if that's what they want
just didn't peg her for a cutter, that's all
Parsons watches Miranda through the glass
She can't look him in the eye
- Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks from the other patients as she rejoins them
Spots Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens
Scared
Oh my God
Oh my God
() 31
: You saw it
Listen, Doctor
Some people, they have a gift
And in here, because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos, they refuse to acknowledge that
It's like that Hubble telescope that sees things a trillion miles away but what it's seeing is just reflected light of a star that died a thousand years ago
It's like that
Doesn't mean you're crazy
It only means your eyes open in a different way
Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but has a sinking feeling
What did it say
On the telescope
Did you see anything, Shelley
Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear
That's not tile that wall is made out of
It's a holographic screen
All part of your mission, isn't it
Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish
Walks away
Thanks anyway
(taps her forehead) This is all we have
The rest is dust
'  - Pete and Miranda stare at each other
tense beat
() 32
: It was you  called that night
Yes
Did you mention that to the cops
No
Why
didn't think it would help you
What does that mean
It means they wouldn't have let me treat you if they thought  had any kind of involvement in what happened
And did you
Did  what
Did  make it to your place
Did see you that night
No
We got disconnected and couldn't get through to you sat there waiting all night
Figured you'd changed your mind
Why didn't you tell me this before
Because the only way you'll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own
My job is to assist you in processing that information because you're not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself
() 33
: She stares at him
Queasy
You're changing the subject
The subject is you don't trust me
Right now  don't trust anyone
She tries to read his face
Reminds herself of who Pete is and what he means to her
He points at her bandaged arm
You want to talk about today
She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head
Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare: want to talk to my lawyer
think that's premature
can't help what you think
: - doing their thing: , , The female patients are out in the gardens for their freshly dose of air
Miranda alone at a bench
cigarette appears before her, being offered to her: You a Marlboro girl
Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun
don't smoke, thanks
() 34
: All we have is our health, cupcake
(sits beside her) What  do is quit constantly, start again
Drives them all crazy
One day  quit three times
Huh
Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly
Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna rambles on
They allow me one match at a time and pretend they're not watching
Check it out: salivating goon number one at three o'clock, oh- so-inconspicuous goon number two at five o'clock
Miranda follows Jenna's gaze
Sure enough, she's being closely watched by two orderlies
What did you set on fire to wind up here
Very perceptive, Doc
burnt down the building where  worked
found a baby at the doorstep, called the cops -- of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed
It's beside the point, really
Miranda shrugs
God knows what Jenna is talking about but who is she to say
Once again, Miranda checks the building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge
She rises -- Phil
He keeps walking
Headed to the parking lot beyond
Phil
() 35
: He turns
His first instinct is to smile
But he checks himself, reminding himself of her new status
Slips into his best professional face: Hello, Miranda
wonder if  could talk to you
Of course
(checks his watch) Well, actually, 'm about to
Your staff meeting's done and Thursdays you don't schedule sessions until the afternoon
This will just take one minute
Promise
Impressive
She remembers his schedule perfectly
True
(points) But the Sheriff wants to ask me some questions
She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff Ryan emerges from his patrol car
Miranda nods
It's about Pete
What about him
Perhaps he's not the most qualified person to be treating me
His tone is fatherly yet direct
Are you complaining about his methods or are you referring to the nature of your past relationship with him
This surprises her
() 36
: What did he tell you
He explained there might be a conflict of interest because he has feelings for you
You two engaged in a kiss at one point
Am  right
Yes
told him we're all grownups here and the fact is he's the best doctor on my staff
As such, and given the severity of the charges you face, consider him the most qualified person to assist your recovery
Now, if you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is not a patient man
Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling like an idiot
Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his car
The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs past her, yelling -- Hey
Chloe
Now two  race past
Miranda looks over to see what the fuss is all about
Chloe is on top of an institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round black woman named
Punching her -- Other patients have crowded around the scuffle
You fucking cow giving me the evil eye, huh
Fuck you, you fuckin' voodoo witch --
Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo
Chloe kicks and screams like an animal
Consuelo meekly stands up
(heavy Cuban accent) Is okay, she's okay -- she don't mean nothing
You bet your goddamn fat ass mean it, you're a witch --
() 37
: McGrath, that's enough
The orderlies start pulling Chloe away
Chloe spits at Consuelo, full of venom
Take your voodoo shit back to Cuba -- said that's enough
Irene, she's okay
Pobrecita, la infeliz
It's a misunderstanding
Pobrecita
was only trying to help her -- You wanna help me
You pity me
(grabbing her crotch) Suck me
The orderlies haul Chloe off
Irene disperses the crowd
Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip
Her manner says she just wants to get back to her duties
Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they were doing
Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office window
He quickly slides the curtain shut
Odd
-    ( ) sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a  -- empty corridors
The air thick with dread -- '  - Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep
trickle in from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a from another cell, a random
She shuts her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach
() 38
: As before, somebody seems to be watching her
: - Irene escorts Miranda into the library
warden follows
How are we feeling today
'We'
Sorry  asked
Doesn't seem like the best choice of words when treating schizophrenics
Fitting right in, aren't you
The library is pretty    much empty at this hour except for the  and the    odd janitor tidying up
An efficient-looking man    rises from a desk, briefcase in place, glass of water    -- this is attorney ""
Miranda
Hi
Irene checks her watch
The warden hangs back, keeping watch
She's due back in the rec room in twenty, Counselor
Thank you kindly
Miranda sits
Waits until Irene is out of hearing range
() 39
: Teddy,  know you knew Doug well and this is an extremely -- 'm here as your lawyer
So whatever my relationship was with Doug is no longer of consequence
First things first, how are they treating you
Like 'm crazy
You know this place better than anyone
Anything out of the ordinary
Other than me being crazy
No
The  is pushing for a hearing as soon as next week
They're eager to resolve this situation because -- well, crimes like this don't happen that often around here
Doug was a hometown boy who'd done good, beloved high school principal, a role model
Our best shot -- scratch that, our only shot -- is to claim temporary insanity
As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy bandage
Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you know me
wouldn't raise a hand at my husband for the life of me
Not even in self-defense
Isn't it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some crazed high school student attacked Doug and went into shock
Teddy shakes his head
You're telling me there's no other suspects in anyone's mind
() 40
: Frankly, no
Neighbors heard screams
They have you at the scene, they have the murder weapon and they have your prints everywhere
The only thing they don't have is motive
She keeps absently playing with the bandage
The adhesive is giving
The bandage starting to peel off
Because there is no motive
And that's what's confusing them
The fact that you're a brilliant psychiatrist doesn't help either
It fills their heads with ideas
They figure if you were to plan a murder you might know how to fake insanity to get out of it
She pulls off half the bandage, back and forth
Not looking
the beginning of a pattern in her scarred skin -- 'm not faking anything
Good
pass no judgment either way
The point is -- The point is 'm the only person who doesn't believe  killed my husband
never thought 'd say this, but  feel like 'm in the middle of a conspiracy
(beat) Do you believe 'm crazy
An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering
Miranda looks down, humiliated -- and now she sees it
Perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads: "
" Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks down Teddy's glass of water all over his papers, her chair topples over
The warden and janitor look up -- Teddy tries for delicate: () 41
: It doesn't matter what  believe
Forget it
Forget  asked
her face as involuntary tears roll down and we -- '  - Miranda
Numb
Pete trying hard to get through beat
We get a good look at the writing on her arm
(The right arm
) can't help you if you don't talk to me
Silence from Miranda
He is firm but not unkind: can stand here all day
All week
You're the one running out of time
Nothing
He goes to touch her arm
She jerks it away
What does it mean
She shakes her head, at a loss
Torn between her suspicion and the need to confide in someone
Finally: didn't write this
Then who
They stare each other down
There's definitely chemistry between these two
But the moment is far from romantic
You're going to have to trust me
Why
Because no matter what's going through your mind right now, haven't done anything wrong
() 42
: Then you know exactly how  feel
He starts to speak, stops himself
Switches tactics
Their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more clinical: You admit you're having a hard time differentiating what's reality from what's hallucination, right
So isn't it at least possible that -- As a doctor  agree with you
Maybe -- and this is a big maybe -- all of this is just a deep epilepsy that extends to the limbic structures, but 'm telling you -- How about this moment right now
What about it
Is this a hallucination
You tell me
But  do know what sound like
Paranoia is the ultimate awareness, right
Which is why  suggest we simply increase your dose until -- (venom) No
Goddamnit
No
He steps back at her blowout
She catches the look on his face and forces herself to sit down
'm sorry
Is there any way we can pretend that didn't just happen
() () 43
: (') (beat; struggling) want to believe you
do
So 'll take your word for it -- you're not involved in this -- but you take mine:  didn't write this and  didn't kill my husband
He studies her
Finally nods
New tactic: Alright
Let's say you didn't write this -- Number one: 'm right-handed
Number two:  would have had to bring an -Acto knife into the shower to do this, wouldn't
Pete tries to reserve judgment
Her argument has a certain loopy logic to it
He hesitates, then pulls a from a manila envelope
think it's time you look at these
Miranda looks at the crime scene photos
Lurid
Terrible
Here's part of Doug's body
Here's the axe
And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words on it
In blood, a la Manson family
And it says: "
" Miranda immediately tosses it away from her
Repulsed -- : -
'  - Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood
Wipes her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it
'  -   () You wrote that
Any idea why
(panic rising) No,  didn't
No,  didn't
() 44
: Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it up for her to study again
You're the only person who can figure out what this means
Try to remember
Stop holding back
She nods meekly
Staring at the picture
Begins to shake as all of it finally comes flooding in -- : -
'  - breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it
She looks down at Doug, crawling on hands and knees
He moans horribly, in shock
She grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him
He reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and makes a move to grab it
He has all the speed of a dying turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles
Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands
Doug's hand grabs the phone
Miranda    over her head and it comes down straight
Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in the mirror over the mantel and stares -- The   sound
Miranda stares at the  looking for the source of it
For an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there, beckoning
But now she's gone and Miranda is left studying her own demented expression and now around her
She looks down at her feet: No fire
Blood on her clothes, axe still in her hands
Looks back up at: shows a serene expression on her face
Fire enveloping her
She slowly lifts her hands over her head
In place of the axe there are  attached to  on her wrists
She is completely naked, as if purified -- like an extreme version of Anima Sola
( Biblical icon in which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate
) Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment -- When the     and we're back to reality
Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it
45
'  - Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink
This is a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it
She stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at the marks on the door handle, towels and wall
Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the shower at full blast and climbs into the tub
She watches the blood wash off her
As if finally coming back to her body and realizing what she's done, she slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the tub
Crying
Shaking
She shuts her eyes as hard as she can to make it all go away, and we -- Silence
And now, faintly at first, but , we hear the
: '  - Miranda wakes up, still in the tub
How long has she been there, hours
Days
Impossible to know
But at some point she must have turned off the water
She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked with blood
The first thing that hits her is the stench
And it's foul, the putrid smell of decaying flesh
She steps gingerly out of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of blood, mortified at what she will find
'   - Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness the fruit of her labor
She gasps for air
Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea
She doubles over to throw up when there is a   at the front door
She freezes
and  trickle in
The  on the door  under   and she still stands there as the first  breaks in
Sheriff Ryan and his deputies right behind
concerned Pete Graham behind them
() 46
: The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns at her, but we can't hear what they're saying because Miranda's ragged  has taken over the soundtrack
Suffice to say that, at the sight of the guns, something clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees -- - She slips on blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the bedroom -- ' She locks the door behind her, hyperventilating in terror
Instantly there are men  on it
at her
She spots two officers through the window in her backyard
About to smash the window
caged animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face with her hands
Trembling
The doorknob jiggles violently, about to give
And when she brings her hands down she is staring straight into the teenage girl's face
And she and now we are back in -- '  -  () Miranda gasps for air, drowning in sensory overload
Oh God, oh God, oh God
She rocks back and forth
Finally aware of what she's done
She is the killer
No more doubts
And now that she knows, everything is much worse
long, harrowing beat
her devastated face
'  - The locks are unlocked
Pete appears at the door
Miranda glances up at him
She looks like a different person
Completely destroyed
He crouches beside her
You okay
She shakes her head slowly
He sets his hand on her shoulder
She turns to him and hugs him tight, holding on for dear life
Breaks down in sobs
47
'  - Parsons leafs through Miranda's file
Pete stands by the window, lost in thought
How much does she remember
It all came flooding back last night
Guilt
More like an uncontrollable reminiscence
Intense, over- cathected
She's not feeling guilty of her actions, not exactly
Sounds to me like last night she actually re-lived them in great detail
Hypermnesis following amnesia
Could a specific epileptic element be involved
That's exactly what she suggested
Even in her present state, her instincts remain impeccable
'd like to talk to her
- Pete escorts a fragile Miranda down the corridor
The two orderlies walking ominously behind them
Standard procedure
didn't say a word
'  - Parsons on the phone, gestures for them to enter
() 48
: (into phone) Dorothy,  can't discuss this now -- (motions for them to sit) 'm not taking it lightly, no
We will talk about it at home
Miranda and Pete sit across from him
Miranda trying hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every gesture, and of how different her last visit to this office was
Nothing casual about it now
She stares at the picture frames on Phil's desk (all facing   us), the diplomas on the wall, the books by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings Jackson, Kurt Goldstein, Henry Head,
Luria) framed quote reads: "'If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand, We'll Grant You All The Rest
' -- Wittgenstein" (into phone) Yes, dear
Me too
He hangs up
Takes a moment to look at Miranda
Tries a smile but to her it comes off condescending
Fact is -- there's nothing to smile about
'm so sorry about this, Miranda
She nods, dazed
Angles her head to look at a framed picture on his desk
Parsons looks to Pete
Has Pete told you about the hearing
Teddy already filled her in
Teddy Howard is top notch
He's going to do everything in his power -- and he's quite resourceful -- to prove you're not fit to stand trial
Miranda,  know you have no family left, so we're your family now and we're all going down to the wire to protect you and help you in any way we -- () 49
: Miranda who stares intently at something on the desk
Not listening to a word he's saying -- Who is that
Parsons pauses here
Exchanges glances with Pete
Excuse me
The girl in the picture
what she is talking about: a framed photograph on the desk is now  us
Eerie
It shows Parsons, his wife Dorothy and a young girl
Our teenage girl
My daughter
Miranda looks up at this, perplexed
She's the girl  saw
You're obviously mistaken
'm positive
She was hurt, bleeding
Is she all right
Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks
Miranda, you've seen that photograph at least a dozen times, every time you've been in this office
You're just confused -- Not about this
Is she all right
No, she's not
all right
(beat) Rachel committed suicide six years ago
This shuts Miranda right up
Mind spinning
How
() 50
: Miranda, that's none of your -- That's okay
(to Miranda) Rachel was a very troubled girl
Handicapped since birth
She was born mute
My wife and  tried everything to help her fit in but
but she ran away from home more than once, wanting to end her life
(beat) And she finally succeeded
Jumped off Ashley Bridge
She was only seventeen years old
Ashley Bridge
Mute
Ghost
Miranda hesitates here
She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full well what even her suggestion of it will sound like
'm -- 'm terribly sorry, Phil
Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore
Rises
Peter, can  speak to you
The men step outside
Miranda's face as she stares at the picture of Rachel
We catch snippets of the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her paranoia -- (
) Textbook psychotic pattern
manifestation of guilt
(
) much she knows about Rachel
(
) 'm telling you she doesn't
Concocted alternate reality
(
) 'm trusting you
crawling with cops
envelops Miranda's confused face, as we -- 51
'  - Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic light
We are   her, seeing her as if from the  of someone approaching her
We become aware of the   sound
Miranda opens her eyes, looks this way and that, then closes them again
She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard before
The strained
Miranda's eyes She slowly sits up, back against the wall
Squinting to cover every inch of the room
And now she sees it: a  crouched in the corner
Roughly the size of a person
Miranda climbs off the bed and slowly walks towards it
Scared, but determined
She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it
She gets closer
closer
The as she reaches the shadow -- She stretches out her hand and finally touches
She swipes her hand through the air, feeling stupid
This is not going to work
'm sick of being watched, and  know this place well and it doesn't smell this bad
She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head
'm awake, 'm not dreaming
'm alive -- this is not some afterlife mumbo jumbo
So-called paranormal activity can be debunked a million different ways
So whatever you are, whatever it is 'm making up here -- 'm letting you go, 'm setting you free
'm the wrong person
And need to sleep
'm not afraid and  don't believe and 'm fully aware that this is all in my mind -- fiction -- a concocted alternate reality -- and acknowledge it
And now 'm done with it
'm going to sleep now
The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous
She has psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost
And now she climbs back in bed
() 52
: (sleepy) Besides, if you really were the ghost of Rachel Parsons, you would let me out of this cell
beat
And now we hear the The door opens quietly
Miranda's face
Properly scared now
Holy shit
If proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got
From now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as
-  - Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall -- still making sure she isn't dreaming this
She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily
Nobody there
But when she looks down the other way she sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall
So quick we're not sure we saw it for sure
Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction
At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling quality
She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her head at the various sounds from  in their cells
She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing right across from: ' Where two nurses are watching
Miranda tiptoes past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen
This one is wider
Miranda is startled by the sudden sound of  behind her
The nurses laughing at their late night show
Momentarily distracted, she almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall
She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a () 53
: She looks for something, a tool
Discards a pair of brushes and finds a small screwdriver
Pockets it
Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay clear from the   sweeping the area
She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and scurries to the next floor
( ) - Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace as she heads towards her old office
She turns a corner and stops in her tracks: another  making his rounds
She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to her office
She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the lock
Starts unscrewing the screws
She does this as fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes a few tries
She loosens one screw, then another -- and clumsily drops the screwdriver
The   against the floor
Miranda sucks her breath in, waits
No footsteps
She bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for balance
It easily turns in her hand
It was open all along
She simply forgot to check
' Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her computer
Shrouded in darkness
Hits a switch and a comes to life
Now she has a view of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on
She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she waits for it to boot up
The  with his coffee cup now heading back towards Miranda's office corridor -- () 54
: Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the computer screen reflecting against the glass pane
She tries opening drawers but they're all locked
She remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath the couch, uses it to block the light
Computer powered up, she runs an online search for "
" Waits as the info appears -- (to self) Alright
What happened to you
Various listings: The archive news of her funeral, something about her search and a    about teen suicide
That's the one she chooses
Hits "
" She checks the surveillance monitor again:     the janitor now mops right outside her door
The heading says "
" quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of three local girls who have died
Rachel's name and appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and Andrea White
Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance monitor: the janitor is walking away
She watches him disappear down the hall
Slowly but surely
And now the screen is empty
But just for a second
Because suddenly Rachel is there
Staring straight at her
Makes us jump
/ - Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the stairs
Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera
- As she reaches the landing, she hears  coming her way
She detours down another corridor and hides from view
Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the staircase
() 55
: And now she turns at
Coming from inside the room immediately behind her
Room 237
She steps to the small glass pane on the door and peers inside
237 It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but now we make out   in the room involved in some sort of struggle
Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a flash of metal
Something sharp
Not a knife, but a needle
And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm
In the dim light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling
Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle - Miranda flinches, confused
Glances down the corridor to ensure she remains undiscovered
Then peers back in
237 Chloe on her stomach on the bed
Her pale naked skin marked with scratches and bruises
The needle is stuck in her arm, which hangs off the side
Her mouth is open but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or sobbing
Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his -shirt
As he discards it we see that it is yellow
- Disturbed, Miranda turns away
Except now the corridor isn't empty
There is a  at the end
Coffee cup in hand
Staring at her, disconcerted
Hey
Miranda turns and runs
Miranda bolts down the stairs
and can be heard right behind her
56
Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency exit door all the way at the end
emerge from the staircase and give chase, shouting for her to stop
holler from their cells, awakened by the
Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as she gets closer and closer to the emergency door
Twenty feet, fifteen, ten -- When a side door opens and a appears, blocking her path
Miranda tries to avoid crashing into him but carries too much momentum
Veers left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and pins her down
The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find her screaming, hysterical
They hold her down -- It's him
It's him
Jesus Christ, it's him
The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea what she's talking about
Ho-hum, just another psychotic woman trying to escape
nurse prepares a needle and we -- : - a long desk where the staff finish their morning meeting
Parsons, Pete and Irene among others
We've transferred her to a higher security room on the fifth floor
That's my final concession to any type of special treatment
And the night staff
They insist her room was properly locked, what else could they say
() 57
: Could there be any truth to her claim
Peter, we have one hundred and forty employees
Thirty-five work maintenance
They all wear yellow shirts, it's their uniform
'm holding a very discreet inquiry, sure -- but  don't want a news van parked outside day and night
It makes much more sense that she tried to escape and got caught, doesn't it
Pete ponders this
It certainly seems that way
perused Miranda's files on Chloe McGrath -- they're damn comprehensive
Maybe she was a bit obsessed with her
Irene and Parsons share a look
He wraps it up: The scariest gift God gave us is our minds
And a bright person like Miranda -- she's grasping at straws here -- who knows what her brain is telling her, now that it's snapped
'   - better room, in fact
This one has a view
Heavy bars on the windows, but still
Miranda paces
Pete is seated, observing her deteriorating state
Did you live here when Rachel killed herself
Yes
As a matter of fact,  was part of the search party that found the body
Phil must have been a wreck
() 58
: You can imagine
Actually, Phil was in Houston undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened
What was that
Miranda reacts to this
And this is confirmed
There are hospital records and so forth
'm sure there are
Can we get back on track now
Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket
What about these other dates, was Phil here when the other girls went missing and found dead
disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and Jenny Dixon
Where are you going with this
First 'm a suspect in Doug's death, now what, Phil Parsons murdered his own daughter
Rachel Parsons disappeared six years ago
week later she's a suicide
Andrew White, four years ago, same
, and Jenny Dixon, two years ago
Don't you find that unusual
He regards her
Maybe Parsons is right: she's desperately grasping at straws now
Skims the article: What same
One jumped off a bridge, one hung herself and one crashed her car
Who gave you this
Not one left a suicide note
In fact, how is anybody sure these were suicides
() 59
: You heard Phil, his daughter had tried several times before -- That's his story
need to talk to the reporter who wrote that
Frank something
Well, you can't
beg to differ
know my visitation rights
You can't because
he died
Miranda snaps to attention here
You're telling me the one local investigative reporter who connected three highly-suspicious deaths, just happens to have conveniently died
Frank Albright was an eighty-year- old retired sociology professor
(re: the article) This is a fluff piece about teenage depression and the breakdown of the nuclear family
You can find one in any local paper, anywhere, any other week
Don't be smug, Pete
That's one thing you've never been
Rachel is somehow connected to what 'm going through
don't know how -- like you said, 'm not in a frame of mind to process the information without assistance
So 'm asking you for assistance
Listen to me
You are not well had hoped once you remembered the murder we could deal with your feelings about it but these fixations: () () 60
: (') Rachel Parsons, Chloe McGrath -- are self-created distractions to avoid looking into yourself
And the longer you -- know this lecture like the back of my hand
Good
Saves me the trouble
Discussion over
He raps on the door
Triple-locks come unlocked and an  is there
Peter exits
- Peter hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse
The same one who bandaged Miranda earlier, so let's give her a proper name:
She pushes her cart into the elevator
- Claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she heads down the long corridor, reaches a door and unlocks it
a row of drug-filled shelves
Claire parks her cart and kicks off her shoes
Digs a pack of smokes out of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her
Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner type named
Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands all over her
She means to resist but he's got such boyish charm
Get off me, you dog -- Hell, don't go all bubbly with joy or anything
You can't be in here and you know it
Nap in your car
() 61
: She finally twists herself out of his grasp
Points an accusing finger, but she's grinning
Blushing, even
Now get out before we get busted
Properly reprimanded, Simon picks up his folded uniform and prepares to leave, head hung low
You slay me, Claire
Honest
Sure  do, Boy Scout
He exits
She shakes her head, slips her uniform back on
- Simon presses the button, waits
He checks inside his folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of sedatives
The doors begin to close when -- Hold it, Simon
He hides the loot behind his back, busted
She holds the door open and tosses him his yellow shirt
What do you think  am, laundry service
(relieved) Won't happen again, ma'am
She turns and exits
The doors slide shut
Meet our rapist
- Bustling with activity
The room is divided into two:          a large main area where the patients eat, plus a second, smaller upstairs area for the staff
to find Miranda eating at a long table
Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork
Jenna taps an unlit cigarette
As usual, Irene keeps watch nearby
() 62
: She'd get high on glue and make me help her try on my bras
Is that the strangest shit you've heard
Heard stranger
But she's a case
And she always put on a happy face
Man, what an optometrist
Optometrist
Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it go
You narced her out, didn't you
Boo-hoo
Bet you were a little buzzed yourself
Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of conversations and comes to rest on Chloe
Alone at another table
Heavily sedated
wreck
Miranda rises and walks over
Shelley waits until she's out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna -- All work, that woman
Work, work, work
What are you talking about
She's like an alcoholic
But with work
What work
Not safe to tell you
Wish could
Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food
Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe and starts talking
From Parson's  up above we can see pretty much the entire dining area
63
Trying to get Chloe's attention
But Chloe just stares at her untouched food, glassy-eyed
saw what happened
'm sorry
No reaction
Have you told anyone
Chloe
Nothing
Look, Chloe -- the person who did this to you is not the devil
And if you can identify him, 'll make sure the motherfucker is arrested
Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers
Doctor, did you just say 'motherfucker'
Do you know his name
Maybe you saw a nametag on his uniform
Think
Chloe simply stares
Finally shakes her head
Man, you must really hate me
What
don't hate you
You hate me because now you're just the same as me
You must feel so embarrassed
don't hate you
And  don't feel embarrassed
That's just a pat answer you have because you're new at this
Trust me,  know what 'm talking about
() 64
: (rising) Forget it, alright
Forget we had this conversation
Chloe abruptly grabs her arm
Tightly
You know what happens next
get the distinct feeling you're going to tell me
The shock wears off and the guilt kicks in
And that guilt is the real motherfucker
You'll be watched 24/seven, because they're afraid you'll kill yourself
Dr
Graham will question every harmless gesture, every innocent comment, ever twitch you make and eventually -- and it's a fucking tedious 'eventually' -- you'll stop hating yourself for what you did
But what replaces that hatred is this unbearable sadness
And you don't lose that as long as you live
Miranda
Deeply affected by Chloe's words, as we -- -   - '       -- ) Miranda and the other patients line up for meds in the rec room
) Irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get their daily fresh air
) Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at night and the lights go off
'  - Echoing an earlier scene, we are   her -- her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light
Miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert
Sensing something
() 65
: Leave me alone
Go away
Just like a crazy person
She listens for any further noise, hears none and shuts her eyes
Exhausted
've lost my fucking mind
Happy now
Silence
But now the   behind her and she whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers her mouth
Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon, in his yellow shirt
He shoves her against the mattress and presses his full weight against her
She lets out a muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and brings the plunger to her throat
Straight into her jugular
(sotto) This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me
She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down
The   violently and now he's straddling her, squeezing the plunger into her throat
Her eyes welling up: (sotto) 've always wanted to do a doctor
She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from her throat
It flies to the floor
He grins, enjoying this: (sotto) The more you fight me, the harder get, pussycat -- so pretty please, with sugar on top -- keep still
Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend herself
He finally slaps her free arm down
Presses his knee against it, immobilizing her once more
Now he produces another syringe from his pocket
Checks it
Miranda shakes her head, pleading
scream stuck in her throat
But nobody can hear her
Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we hear a   at the door
Shaking it off its hinges
() 66
: Simon looks up, confused
Nobody is there
The split- second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off the bed
She fumbles for the discarded syringe and -- squeezes the plunger -- (sotto) Take that, son of a bitch
Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body goes limp
Miranda exhales, coming back to herself beat
Rachel
No response
Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress him
: shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the corridor
to see we are in -- - bank of monitors keep watch on the premises   after dark
play cards (Uno), bored to tears
cursory glance at the monitors produces no reaction
Certainly a janitor walking down the corridor is no cause   for alarm
- Dead quiet
or whatever it is    crickets do
Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing    rows of unfamiliar cars
She clicks Simon's key-ring    button repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on   and off
'  - Miranda slips behind the wheel,  the
The at -
She nearly drops dead
- The gate  reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car approaches
The guard barely registers the driver in the booth mirror, immersed in his article
Hits a button to open the gate for him
It opens
-l-o-w-l-y
67
'  -  - Miranda, sweating, watches the receding image of the institute behind her
Turns on the main road
Free
Thank you, thank you, thank you
She glances back, makes sure no one is following her
Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror: the scared eyes, the haunted face
The new version of herself
She flips the  dial: More
She finds ' entirely appropriate " ) and lets it play
Now we are seeing her as if from the  of someone traveling alongside the car
Peering  the passenger window
Miranda becomes aware of this, slowly glances over
Sees nothing but her own reflection
Turns back forward
We  the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling off the dashboard
Nothing but a long stretch of road ahead
'  - The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night
Miranda parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house
Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around back
She finds her   behind a potted plant, takes a deep breath and lets herself in through the back door
' -  everywhere
She turns on the kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without even looking in the direction of the living room, avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether
Eerie as hell -- - Miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport, digs out some cash from a box
Quick change of clothes to get rid of the rapist's uniform
Fast, fast, fast -- 68
'  -  - Miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview mirror as she drives down the block
Shudders
Flips the  dial with shaky hands

This next honky-tonk heartbreak classic is
She looks in the rearview mirror once more
Only this time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes
Rachel's
Inside the car
Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet sound
threatening howl this time, pure venom
Miranda covers her face, jerks the car
It does a 180 and slides to a halt in the middle of the street -- Facing the direction of her house again
Miranda jumps out, panicked
Glances around
Looks inside the car: no Rachel

Slides behind the wheel and makes a -turn

Freaked
She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her   -- No

Miranda goes to turn the key but suddenly freezes
Looks at the ignition oddly and notices the key is gone
Why are you doing this to me
dead-still beat
Glancing around, she is even more startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the middle of the street
69
- Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys
We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here
The moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the glare of  and the
Miranda jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened by a  , spraying water as it goes
She watches the truck disappear down the block
Heart in her throat
Calms her nerves and now walks over to the pesky keys again
Smack in the middle of a puddle now
the posts harnessing power lines which surround the area until we   a pair of fastened around the insulators of a thick power line
From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys
And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some invisible force -- Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a and turns
The bolts pop out of their sockets
The uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings straight towards the paralyzed Miranda -- She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle, back up at the 11,000    about to fry her to a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second
The wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends flying in every direction
It looks like lightning

That was as close as close gets

No sign of Rachel
Miranda yells at the air, glancing over her shoulder, seemingly demented: What is it you want me to do

Miranda stranded
The stolen car in the middle of the road
And now the  of a abruptly
Miranda whips her head in the direction of the sound
It's the front gate to her house
And now the front door And now the living room  switch on
() 70
: Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house
can't
(softly) Please, please don't make me go back in there
But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards it
She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the road
Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost electrocuted
No neighbors have come out to investigate yet, but how long can that last
She walks to the car
' Miranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here
She's never asked a ghost for permission before: Bear with me, 'm just parking it out of the way so it won't look suspicious in the middle of the road -- okay
She  the  and pulls over to the sidewalk
' Miranda stands in her living room, staring at her handiwork
Frozen with dread
The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains
The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc
The faded writing on the wall:       "
" Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's supposed to be looking for
(piecing it together) Not alone
What happened to you happened to other girls
(beat) understand
And 'm sorry
But there is nothing  can do about it now
It has nothing to do with me

: Not knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the suddenly   , making her jump
The unmistakable  from some old  cartoon at She stares at the  screen
Is there some sign here she should be able to follow
She crosses to turn it off and immediately doubles over in pain -- Shit
She looks at her foot
big    is stuck right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin
Blood already seeping from the nasty cut -- Miranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket
She grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the cut
And now,  at first, but   -- she hears the hollow   we've come to associate with Rachel
Inside the room with her -- Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet
Did the mirror move
We watch her from the   as she holds perfectly still, listening
The  now seems to have silent beat
She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing as the alcohol burns her skin
It looks painful
And now the slow  of the    makes her look up again
And she sees herself in the mirror like the night of the slaughter: flames all around her
Naked arms raised
Wrists shackled
Anima Sola
She stares
Mesmerized
The sound of No
No
No
Miranda walks slowly to the mirror
Incredibly, the image reflecting back at her also grows bigger
As if the two versions of her are literally walking towards each other
both their faces mere inches apart
Miranda brings her fingertips to the mirror and touches it
Immediately pulls her hand back
() 72
: Miranda stares at her fingertips
The tips are burnt
The skin sizzles softly
200 percent scientifically impossible
And when she looks up at the mirror again -- the image is gone
It is now deathly quiet
And what she finds herself staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something just behind her
folded newspaper discarded in the far corner of the room
She turns to look at it now
It's opened to the page
Doug must have left it there
She picks it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank- repossessed property
The address is in Willows Creek
Her brain wires start clicking
This must be what Rachel wanted her to see
She stares at it
the picture as we -- : - " " sign still flapping in the wind
The first few rays of light break through the dawn sky
Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it the  and parks
Miranda steps out
She studies the house before walking up the drive
We watch her peek through windows and walk around back, looking for something
What exactly, we don't know
(Neither does she
) She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes her stare now on the barn
The one place he hasn't looked
Dark, empty
The  outside causes the to
It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's just the wind
Miranda covers the distance of the large room, perplexed
There is something about this place
Something she can't quite put her finger on
Beckoning her
With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops her
She moves to it
() 73
: And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both walls, holding them together
Miranda inspects the heavy padlock, the source of the glint
She tugs on the wall and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only a few inches more
Miranda peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing
Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot
She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face brushes against something hanging in the air
She stops, startled
It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light bulb
She tugs on it
And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of her
She pulls on the  and it opens with a She peers into the pitch-black basement below
Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs down
Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness
Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb upstairs does not reach here
She feels around the wall for a switch
Nothing
(to self) It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, right
Abruptly there's a sharp  as she lights Simon's key- chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast space
Rats scurry for cover
It takes a second to orient ourselves
Something metallic catches the lighter's reflection way in back
Miranda walks towards it
Hello
She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on the floor
She stops
Kneels down and in the dim half- light we make out a backpack
She unzips it and rifles through it (-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds a wallet
Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next to the : the picture belongs to a teenager named "
" () 74
: Is there anybody here
Hello
The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it click off
When it comes back on we see she has wrapped a ragged -shirt around it for insulation
Miranda steps deeper into the room
Up ahead, she can make out the metallic thing that reflected light before
It is a hook in the ceiling
And suspended from it are several heavy chains
Like a meat rack
And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down, tied around the hands and ankles
Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter away
Go away
Fuck off
(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an almost strobe-light effect:) She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's adrenaline at full tilt -- 'mon, c'mon, c'mon -- She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the girl's pupils
Inspects them
Slaps her repeatedly, clinically
The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the immediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about; wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood
Wake up, Tracy, wake up -- Nothing
She unties the wires around the girl's ankles
The skin swollen grotesquely around them
She shakes the girl
Slowly coming to the realization that it's too late
75
- Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and throws up
The bright light outside blinding her momentarily
Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to register -- parked in front of the house cautiously peering inside her stolen car
He looks up and notices her
Miranda hesitates
Nowhere to run
The officer waves
His name is
Howdy there
He says this while already strolling over
Miranda's mind races a mile a minute -- Everything okay
-yes
That your vehicle, ma'am
She stares at the young, friendly cop
His left hand resting on his belt
Right next to his gun
But it seems as if he has no idea who she is
At least not yet
Yes --  --  just pulled over was -- looking for a bathroom
Morning sickness, you know
Congratulations
But 'm afraid this is private property -- you can't just waltz on in
You understand that
She nods, nerves shot to hell
Starts walking
'll be on my merry way now
My husband will never forgive me if get a ticket for trespassing
() 76
: The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of marital dynamics
He flashes a smile but suddenly stops, whips out his gun and trains it on her -- Holy shit
(clicks the safety off) Lady, stay right where you are
Miranda shuts her eyes, busted
Freezes
Hands up where  can see them
Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands
Nice and slow, start talking to me
And make it good
Tell me just exactly who that is
confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door
Dragging herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock
Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive
But just barely
- car pulls up to the chaotic  area
Phil Parsons and Pete step out, rush inside
- '  - Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal
But even here he can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his case -- Mr
Howard -- let me simply list the events your client was involved in last night
First she drugs a janitor, steals his car and escapes a mental institution -- Hold on, there isn't even any substantial evidence -- () 77
: Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink to wash his hands -- Mr
Howard -- there isn't evidence because the overdosed janitor hasn't woken up, that's why -- and when your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a full syringe of -- (handing him a paper towel) You had no right to question my client without my presence -- Mr
Howard, this is not a courtroom
Your client was read her rights and she still insisted -- -- Let me ask you this, Sheriff: what exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my client's cell
And is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself before my client -- Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to the waiting room, Teddy following closely -- Paramedics and nurses doing their thing
The young officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of coffee
'm not a drug expert
'm simply stating the frigging facts
Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices Parsons and Pete approaching
Relief crosses his face
Phil, thank God -- this guy's driving me nuts
What happened
() 78
: An 'incident' -- for lack of a better frigging word -- involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she'll even utter another word
Who's the girl
runaway from Portland, Tracy Marie Seaver
Reported missing a couple weeks ago
We found Miss Grey in some barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up
'm just now waiting for the surgeon to give me an update
(to Teddy) Notice, Counselor, how 'm not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer
Teddy waves him off in frustration
Goes to talk to Turlington
Christ, the woman's got the entire hospital busy -- Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington -- Why are you harassing my deputies
'm only asking him where he got the coffee --
He's not at liberty to answer that
You've had enough goddamn coffee already
The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons
They walk over to the water cooler where they can talk more privately
We need to get Miranda back to the institute
She needs psychiatric care, not a prison cell
() 79
: Parsons nods, lost in thought
Sheriff Ryan returns
Phil, how well does your wife know the suspect
Why do you ask
Because she's at the station right now, demanding to speak with her
Parsons frowns at this, concerned
Pete studies him
- Bare room
desk and two chairs
Glass window         panes to insure no privacy
(50s) waits,        seated
The door opens and a  escorts Miranda in
She sits across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be
long beat
How are you
Miranda doesn't answer
Her mind elsewhere
Namely back at the barn and how it connects to Rachel
needed to see you, but 'm not sure where to begin
don't know you well,  certainly have nothing but fond feelings for you
Phil always keeps me posted on his colleagues and his work and -- in any case,  have always thought of you as a very bright, very perceptive doctor
Even though don't know you well
She pauses here
Miranda looks up now
Her face hollow and exhausted
Bags under her eyes
person who has seen too much
Wondering where the hell this is going
My point is, my point being -- when Rachel died  had, um, suffered through these spells, these recurring dreams
() () 80
: (') And eventually, once  came to terms with her death, they went away
Losing a child is the hardest, most inconceivable event a mother can -- She drifts off
Takes a beat to collect herself and resume: The past few days  have been having the same dream nightmare
Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that
That word
Nightmare
Welcome to my life
This nightmare involves Rachel but it also involves you
In the nightmare Rachel holds a box in her left hand
small box
And she repeats a series of numbers
Now, Rachel never spoke, from the time she was born -- she had a condition --  often asked God why he punished this child in such a way -- she couldn't speak, but she was extremely bright
She wasn't autistic as the doctors claimed -- Dorothy Parsons starts to cry
moment passes like this
It seems she won't recover enough to continue her tale
Mrs
Parsons, you need a therapist
Normally  would encourage you to schedule a session with me but as you can see -- Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish
She pulls out a folded piece of paper
Every night the same box in her hand and the same numbers wrote them down
() 81
: She slides the paper over
Miranda watches her carefully, then looks at the piece of paper
The numbers are: 1-0-2-2-0-1
long beat
It's a message
It's a code for something
don't know what
But she wants you to have it
Miranda studies it
Studies this woman, who quite frankly seems to have completely lost her mind
Then she looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a realization
October 22nd, 2001
It's my wedding date
She stares at Dorothy, stunned
Brain click-click- clicking
Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind this somehow
That code belongs to a safety deposit box my husband kept in a bank up in Newcastle, that's where his parents live
(beat) Dorothy,  need you to drive up there and open it
Dorothy stares at her, scared
And finally nods
- Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as pull up
Miranda is brought out of one of the cruisers by two
We can take those off now
Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser
Don't push it, Doctor
She's cuffed until your people secure her in a cell
() 82
: Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in
Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of the escort
Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she approaches
Are you alright
(quietly) was wrong
It wasn't Phil Parsons
It was Doug
Can we talk about this later
(to Sheriff) Thanks, Sheriff
Tomorrow morning first thing my deputies are here
know,  know
We'll see you then
And my offer still stands if you need added security
Thank you
She won't go anywhere
guarantee it
The Sheriff waves, whatever
Knocks twice on the hood and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive
That's why Rachel picked me
It was Doug
'm so stupid
Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on about this time
Tries to remain professional
Inside, okay
- Lunch time for the female wing
An excited Shelley rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are, whispers something to them
They glance at the door
() 83
: moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort
Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door
An uneasy Pete leads
Irene and the wardens at the rear
Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a specimen
Like somehow she's even more dangerous than them
Top dog, as it were, of the crazies
And then, halfway across the room, one of the women stands up
Chloe
She claps her hands together
Slowly
Miranda watches her, confused
And slowly Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well
All of them joining Chloe in clapping
What is this
She's a hero
Little Red Riding Hood put the big bad wolf in a coma
Pete nods
Just what he needed
The  trade looks
#1 They're not gonna start something, are they
Irene shakes her head, amused
You ain't scared of a bunch of women now, are you, Officer
The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their solidarity for Miranda
Chloe locks eyes with her, mouths the words "thank you
" And Miranda is hauled out the side door
' White
Surveillance cameras in every corner
Two separate doors with elaborate locks
High security all around
The officers undo Miranda's cuffs and excuse themselves
Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as well
#1 We'll be right outside, Doctor
() 84
: Once the doors are locked and they're alone, the conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear: pulled a lot of strings to get you transferred back
The best case scenario you're looking at right now is five years here
Five
Under my -- (interrupting) Peter,  didn't believe in ghosts before this
And neither do you
Pete is at the end of his rope
Can't hide his sadness when he looks at her
Still, he tries to get her back on track: But you know that the brain is fully capable of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things
The simplest chemical deficiencies can -- Chemical deficiencies can't get inside of you and make you do terrible things you don't remember doing
'm a very open-minded person, but as a doctor -- No, you're not
You're a close- minded academic, just like me
You told me once that  was the most logical person you knew, remember
Well, everything that's happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science
Rachel Parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago -- tossed off the Ashley Bridge by my husband
My harmless, righteous 'community leader' husband -- that's how pathetically blind 've been
() () 85
: (') Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were also abducted and murdered -- now this was before  met Doug but bet you anything that they both went to his school
Then he obviously stopped for a while: fear, guilt, distractions -- namely me -- delayed him from reverting to his sickness
That's why  didn't notice anything believe he really tried to lead a normal life, for me
Then along comes Tracy Seaver and he can't resist
Locks her up and tortures her in some abandoned property -- She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing
Here's Doug's interest in real estate, Pete
Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek
Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off ghost with an agenda, furious at her parents for giving up on her -- she's been trying to communicate with them for years but they're too goddamn logical to pay attention -- and she picked me, she sought me out that night and sent me home to fix her problem
Made sure  killed Doug because he was going to do the same thing to Tracy Seaver as he did to her
And she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way
Pete takes all of this in
Dumbfounded
Is that a threat
To whom
To me
() 86
: To you
'm telling you she nearly electrocuted me when tried to leave town and she led me to that barn and if  don't do what she wants -- she's going to kill me
Pete can see that she's petrified
He starts to speak, but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his lips
The gesture is tender, almost romantic reminder of their very real connection
need you to at least consider the possibility that 'm not insane
(beat; pleading) Not as a doctor
As the only person  trust in this world
- tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car
'm not doing it for Miranda, 'm doing this for Rachel
You're making a complete fool of yourself
Do you realize what you sound like
She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there
Takes three steps
Stops
Turns back around and lets him have it: What do  sound like, Phil
Like one of your patients
Well, it's probably because that's exactly how you treat me
And 've had enough of this deafening silence between us, this exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending Rachel never existed
walk around the argument, pretending not to hear
Phil is mortified
But Dorothy doesn't care: () 87
: 'm losing my mind
Our daughter is gone and  miss her and 'm angry
She turns and storms off
Phil takes it all in for the first time
moment later he climbs out of the car
- solemn  places the safety deposit box on the table in the middle of the room
Steps back through the gate and waits
Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a moment
Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife and opens it
He sorts through some paperwork that means nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope
He opens it and spills the contents on the table
It is a stack of
Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens
She grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit down
horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes out like the howl of a dying animal
Her husband pales, all blood draining from his face
- The sky darkens fast
The storm moving in
- ' outside, making a tray of meds rattle
to see Consuelo, the round black woman we might remember Chloe beating up earlier
She shakes her head
It's gonna be an interesting night
' Miranda looks up at the sound of the    and the handle unfastened
Through the door comes Consuelo, carrying a tray
Sets it down by the bed
She is on her way out when she pauses, stares at Miranda
() 88
: How are we doing today
That term again, "we
" Doctor-speak
Miranda doesn't have the energy for it: Just fine, thank you
The spirit is not fine
She's very unhappy
What was that
Normally Miranda would look at this woman as if she were crazy, but things have changed
How -- how do you know
(shuts her eyes) But she's only a girl
Do you know her name
Yes
Rachel
Have you talked to her
Yes,  -- you could say that
Consuelo holds Miranda's hands firmly, "reading" her
She's very, very angry
And she's not finished with you yet
'm sure that's meant to sound comforting but -- She wants to show you something
That may be so, but  want her to go away
Then you need to protect yourself
() 89
: And how exactly would  do that
Mira, first 'm gonna bring you some cascarilla, it's a powder, you get it anyplace, it comes from eggs -- you pour it all over you -- (indicates) Like this -- Look -- (reading nametag) Consuelo,  appreciate what you're trying to do, but  honestly don't think this ghost will go away if pour some egg powder on myself -- Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda
She's receiving something here
Shudders
She made you do things
Bad things, didn't she
Yes
And you carried this out for her
She used you as a vessel
Consuelo's grip tightens on Miranda as we -- : -
- We're back at the bridge
Rachel pries open Miranda's mouth
Miranda panics: What are you doing
'm trying to help you --
Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake
And as Miranda screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds
And now we see it
Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and Miranda with a  -- 90
'   -   () Consuelo lets go of Miranda's hand
Like recoiling from fire
Speaks in the simplest of ways
The truth: You were possessed by her
Yes
Ay, probrecita
You're both in terrible danger
She's scared too but she can't step back into the light until she finishes what she started here
And now you're the only person who can help her find the way back
don't know how to do that -- 'm not qualified for it
You do it
Consuelo crosses herself
sign of respect for the situation
But it has a chilling effect on Miranda
Despair is the only unforgivable sin
You'll be in my prayers, Miranda
Prayers
What good is that going to do
Consuelo exits
'  - Two   parked outside
'   - glassy-eyed Phil Parsons serves himself another Scotch, devastated
The  is  so that we see the bedroom door is open, Dorothy lying in bed, heavily tranquilized
Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs
Postcards from hell: scared teenage girls in forced poses -- gagged, tortured -- Andrea White, Jenny Dixon, Tracy Seaver
() 91
: And young Rachel Parsons
This proves that her story is true: my daughter appeared to her in some form and guided her through all this, putting things right
Come on, Phil, you of all people -- of all people hold logic, reason and facts above everything else
And seek the truth through proof and proof only
(re: pictures) And what do you call that
Has it occurred to you that maybe she knew what her husband was doing to those girls
No
Frankly, it hasn't
Maybe she couldn't stand the guilt and cooked up this far-fetched tale to tug at everybody's heartstrings
The fact remains she hacked her husband to pieces
The fact remains my daughter was murdered and Miranda stopped the killer
killer who was loose under your incompetent nose for over six years
We don't know how many future victims were spared, but we do know she saved that girl in the barn's life
And that's more than you or  can say --
Calm down
For the record, that girl is on a ventilator
The doctors don't think she'll make it through tonight
() () 92
: (') Now, you want to stand up in a courtroom and tell a judge that a ghost is behind all this, that's your prerogative -- but  have to abide by the law
And the law says Miranda Grey faces criminal chargers
So here's what we're going to do
'm going to leave a cruiser outside to make sure you don't go anywhere tonight and two of my deputies will go guard Ms
Grey until tomorrow morning
Phil
Parsons doesn't respond
His eyes far away
There will be no breakouts, no aiding and abetting, no taking the law into your own hands
It'll take an Act of God for Miranda Grey not to show up in that courtroom tomorrow
Are we clear
And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying
Quietly, miserably
And it's a disparaging sight
Sheriff Ryan exits
Two deputies follow, Parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a photograph out of a drawer
picture of Rachel in happier times
'm sorry
will never forgive myself for what happened to you
Not as long as  live
(breaking down) miss you so much
He sits there, staring at his dead daughter
Grieving
to see he is not alone
Rachel is watching him
- The  has really   now
massive streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's onset
pulls up to the guard gate
93
the bank of monitors  the same two guards we've seen before
Playing yet another bored card game
The on their glass door makes them look up
#1 Help you
stand there
We recognize one of them: We're here on Miranda Grey detail
The Guards shake their heads, chuckle
#1 Sixth floor
You can get a couple chairs from the nurses up there
pretty decent cup of joe too
Thanks, guys
The Guard points at the bank of monitors
#1 Although why the Sheriff is making you fellas waste your time is beside me
We got her right here
She ain't going no place
Miranda inside her pristine white cell
Restlessly pacing
Looks perfectly harmless, doesn't she
#1 Don't they all, Officer, don't they all
The men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly and the power goes out
No monitors, no radio, no nothing
Pitch black
#1 Shit
There goes the card game
Abruptly there's a   sharp  as come alive
94
' The  outside  the
The only light source being the intermittent  as the She paces in the dark
Sits
Waits
-  - The two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs
'   - Miranda holds her breath, listens
And sure enough, somebody else is in the room
She looks around
No
No
What do you want --
And now  streaks the room and we see Rachel in the corner
Staring with her dead eyes
Moving towards her
've done everything you've asked me to
My life is ruined can't take this anymore can't
(faintly) You have to step into the light, Rachel
You don't belong here -- you don't belong
But it doesn't work
Rachel keeps walking towards her
Miranda backs up against the wall
Trapped
Fighting tears -- Into the light -- (loudly) Can somebody come in here
need help
Somebody, please
-   -  - The cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights down the corridor
They walk towards them
And who are you
() 95
: Officer Turlington, ma'am
We're supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey's cell all night
Knock yourself out
Next floor up
(loudly) It's only a power outage, ladies -- let's call it an early night
The cops head down the corridor
'   - Rachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face -- Please don't
Why are you doing this
It's over
Over and done
Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on Miranda's eyes and shuts them -- : '  - in her school uniform
Staring straight ahead
Now the image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her half-naked, bruised
Dead
: staring  us in her school uniform
Now abruptly she is a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also bathed in the strange red and blue light -- '
'   - Miranda screams at the visions
Rachel holds her steady
Stop it
don't want to see this
can't help you anymore
Stop it
() 96
: Now a heavy  makes her turn to the door
One of the  has  and the latch itself is half- pulled from the doorframe
Relentless  on the other side
Let me out of here
Let me out
There's a deafening  like a thousand bells ringing at once and Miranda covers her ears -- Outside   , ,  -- - The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung open
Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses try to restore order
, flashlights beam and  fill the dark corridor as patients try to escape
-   - and   arrive at the scene, blazing
Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from their cars to contain the breakout
large comes to life
We spot Jenna making a run for the garden wall when the spotlight hits her
Two officers rush after her
Sheriff Ryan makes his way through the mayhem, past Irene helping a patient, past nurse Claire cowering in a corner -- Christ Almighty
Sheriff Ryan hits the stairs
Officer Turlington runs down the corridor, searching frantically with his flashlight -- - car pulls up at the scene
Pete and Parsons step out
() 97
: Miranda
Pete rushes up the steps -- Officer Turlington looks inside Miranda's cell
Empty
And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her: Seated by the elevator
Holding a biting block in Shelley's mouth as her seizing subsides
(into radio) Sheriff
have Miss Grey right here
He flashes his light at her
Miranda looks back blankly
Sorry, we thought you might have made a run for it
Page Irene
This patient needs her meds
Turlington nods
Miranda looks down at a grateful Shelley, whose head is cradled in her lap
Brushes the matted hair off her face
Carefully removes the biting block, making sure Shelley is alright
(after a beat) You're gonna get that Pulitzer after all
Shh, shh, just rest
(sotto, smiling) told you  could keep a secret
- The patients are all assembled here
Flashlights galore
Irene and Consuelo do head counts
Guards, officers, janitors -- everybody
Irene points a finger at Jenna
() 98
: You have really disappointed me tonight, Jenna -- Give me a break
You wouldn't respect me if  hadn't tried -- Parsons breaks away from Turlington, heads over to Pete and Miranda -- Everybody accounted for
We're doing the final count
Now they can't find the Sheriff
Miranda scans the near-dark room, looking for someone
Watches Turlington step aside to take a call on his radio
Parsons regards her with newfound respect: Are you alright, Miranda
Fine, Phil
Thanks for asking
Suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit -- What's going on, Officer
One of your patients is holding the Sheriff at gunpoint
She's in the cafeteria
Pete glances at Miranda
She knows exactly who it is: Chloe
Turlington is about to exit when Parsons stops him: think Doctor Grey should be the one to talk to her
- The   open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff inside
She has a gun pressed hard against his ear
() 99
: Young lady,  don't know how you think you can get out of here, but -- You're very polite for a piggy
Now take off your uniform
Sheriff Ryan hesitates
Chloe presses the gun against him
Do it quick
won't make fun of you
The sound of the      makes her glance up
She trains her flashlight at the second level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover
Nobody better fucking move up there or 'll blow this piggy's head off
Her   searches the section
Catches the reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table
That means you, fucko
Up on your feet or 'll start by shooting his ear off
beat
Officer Turlington rises
Slow and deliberate
(to Sheriff, sotto) Tell junior the grownups are talking now and he's not allowed in here
Do it
Turlington, it's alright can -- 'm just going to -- The grownups are talking
Don't paraphrase me
The grownups are -- are talking now
Just leave
() 100
: voice startles Chloe from behind, at floor level
Chloe
Can  talk to you
Chloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door
Dreadful timing, 'm real busy
You have to let him go
'm sorry
Chloe flinches at that
Like all this multitasking is affecting her
She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style -- Look -- let's not confuse things
like you
But this is my only chance
(to Sheriff) Now take off that goddamn uniform before  get really pissed
The Sheriff glances at Miranda
Miranda nods
The Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt -- What are you going to do
Put on his uniform and walk out of here
Think about it, Chloe
They know you have him
The place is crawling with cops
What are my options
To grow old in this place
It's clear they will never let me go
Never
Ever
That's not true
You have less than a year left here
That's a lie
'll never stop being sick, they'll just find something new that's wrong with me
No wonder you doctors can't help anyone -- all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we're missing
() 101
: She starts sobbing
Letting everything go -- You're right, doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of
But know you, Chloe, you've been through things that most people don't survive
And you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it
It's up to you
This gets through to Chloe
Her grip loosens on the gun
No more guilt, no more hatred, no more unbearable sadness
You have no use for any of that anymore
Your life begins this very second
'm so tired
So goddamn tired -- Miranda walks over and embraces her
Chloe hands her the gun
And that's when the power returns
Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace
Sheriff Ryan on his knees
In the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every , ,  and  that were left on Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the cruisers outside
The image a replica of the Andrea White and Jenny Dixon visions
Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning of a chest
Miranda slowly trains the gun on the Sheriff, finally struck with the realization: It was you, wasn't it
What are you talking about
She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup- style    ,  ,
Anima Sola
Miranda's recurring vision from the night of the slaughter
() 102
: 'Not alone
' That's what Rachel has been trying to tell me all along
Doug was not alone
You were with him
This whole time it's been you
You covered up their deaths to look like suicides
The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking -- You've lost your mind
Don't fucking move
The
of a  being released makes him pause
He turns to look at her
tense beat
(
) Miranda, don't do it
She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around her: cops everywhere
All guns trained on her
Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the following: And just exactly who would believe you
No proof, no living witness
Everybody knows you're crazy
Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off
Her hand starts to shake
Sheriff Ryan turns and strides off
Getting away
Further
Further
But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to do it
Finally brings the gun down
The armed policemen rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff her
want that woman in custody
She has a judge to face in the morning
-  ( ) Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser
He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her -- () 103
: 'll call your lawyer and --
Sir, not now -- 'll meet you at the station
She shakes her head
Mouths something Pete can't make out
Sir, please -- What
Turlington hits the gas
Miranda presses her face against the window so only Pete can see her say the following: The girl in the hospital
Pete locks eyes with her, nods -- as the cruiser leaves
-   - Tracy Seaver lies unconscious, hooked up to a series of machines
to find Pete with a young
Her condition remains the same
Basically that ventilator is keeping her alive
We have no reason to think she'll ever wake up
'm sorry
Pete nods, disconcerted
Stares at the girl
You mind if  stay here tonight
Hey, it's a big place
The more the merrier
If  can just ask you to wait outside
The Doctor gestures for Pete to make himself comfortable
() 104
: (
) Dr
Brooks to
Dr
Brooks -- That's me
Excuse me
The Doctor rushes off
#2 Like Tracy Seaver, Simon Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch of machines and cables
Suddenly his    and the    -- Two  rush in
The young Doctor right behind
#1 -tach
The  whipsaws
The Doctor feels for a pulse, then slaps on the defibrillator pads, places the paddles on the chest -- Clear
He begins chest compressions on Simon's heart
He spasms violently once, twice -- And then it stops
The Doctor and Nurses stare at the monitor
Flatline
Unseen by them, Rachel steps out of the room
- Turlington and two other  climb in a patrol car and drive off
the empty station
' Sheriff Ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch, slips it back in a drawer
Stares at his hands
Steady as a rock
Takes a deep breath
Knows what he must do next
religious man despite everything, he brings his thumb to his forehead and crosses himself
-   - Miranda's eyes snap open at the Hopeful
Could this be Rachel
() 105
: looming figure appears at the door
Doesn't bother to shut it
Stares at her silently for a long while
And so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game: How did you know
You tell me
This isn't one of your word association games, Doctor
Did Douglas tell you that night
Why wait this long if he had
Maybe it's your amnesia
Maybe you blocked it out
Maybe
But it seems to me that it's vital you know for sure
He studies her
Takes a step towards her
Miranda responds by stepping back
slow motion semicircle, if you will
She eyes the open door
Tempted
You think me and Doug are monsters
That this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls
But it wasn't that at all
You do things sometimes and you're not sure why you did them
Then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else
Life goes on
If you're looking for forgiveness, you came to the wrong place
She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows it
One thing about fear is it makes people say the dumbest things
() 106
: Be that as it may, you're afraid too -- because you know killing me won't solve your problems
My only problem is you
What about Parsons
And Peter
They know
And that girl in the hospital will never forget your face
You miscalculated, now you pay
Patience tested, he suddenly  her across the face
hate a bad bluffer
She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung
sure hope that felt good because you can't afford too many more signs of struggle
Can you
Go ahead, hit me back
It's what you want
No, that's what you want me to do
Back to profiling, huh
Your thought process is completely transparent
And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the conversation
Analyst and patient in session
Echoing her opening scene with Chloe
So we're even
You left that door open so 'd try and run, it's what you get off on, isn't it
guess we'll find out
() 107
: And yet you have to make me look like a suicide
With what, your belt
(off his shrug) How would  get access to a belt
Trust me, prisoners hang themselves with just about anything
don't think that's going to satisfy you
You won't be able to do this clean
You have too much guilt inside
Another slap across the face
Miranda's knees buckle
But she remains standing
Her lip trembles
You're losing grasp of the situation
It was different with those girls
bet all they did was cry and scream
Don't worry, you'll scream
(after a beat) Take off your shirt
This throws her off
She shoots a quick glance at the door
Aren't  a little old for you
Take it off
She hesitates
He draws his gun, tired
Removes the safety
That's for show
You know you can't shoot me
But  can smash your teeth out and make it look like you bashed your head against the wall
Now shut up, take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra
() 108
: Miranda is petrified now
Running out of ways to hide it
Today, Doctor
In a sudden move, Miranda shoves the chair at him and bolts out the door
The Sheriff doesn't move to stop her
- Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape
Takes quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage area with barred windows
She makes a turn up ahead and reaches another gate down the corridor
sliding gate that closes off the cell area from the main station
She tries the gate
Locked, naturally
She shakes and bangs on it, desperate
No response
And no way to disguise the sheer panic in her voice
She fell for his trap
They're all alone here
'  - Ryan smiles at that
Re-holsters his weapon and walks towards her, taking his time
Relishing the hunt
Doug mentioned you were painfully 'modest
' But enough about you, let's discuss Rachel
- Now Miranda searches for a place to hide
His -- (
) She was no crippled saint
Wasn't the first time she turned up at Doug's house all messed up
109
Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw Miranda
The gate still locked
She's not there
He traces her steps, clearly enjoying this: Sure she was a minor, but she wasn't going to let that get in her way
- Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk
The is  so we can see the doorway
She prays silently: (sotto) Rachel, where are you when  need you
Clearly not here
Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer: (
) Those other girls -- make no mistake -- they knew what they were getting into
He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room
Sensing her in there
Miranda holds her breath
'm not saying they knew they were going to die, but truth is, Doug and didn't know it was going to end that way
It was just the natural extension of that moment
So yeah, we fucked them and we killed them
And we knew it was wrong
Sure we did
He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a Miranda wasn't underneath that one
She scrambles to the door behind him as he turns -- - She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly against her, knocking her backwards onto the floor -- He looms over her
She reaches around for anything to defend herself
Nothing there
Game over -- () 110
: It wasn't some satanic pact, society didn't make us do it
But believe given the proper circumstances a person is capable of anything -- certainly in my line of work you see it day in, day out
(beat) Tell you what, keep the shirt
The bra will do
Miranda stares, helpless
The Sheriff gestures for her to begin
Like he has all the time in the world
Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra under her shirt
Petrified -- Chin up, Doctor
You wanted to get to the bottom of this and you did
You followed it all the way through
This is how it ends
His demeanor and voice are eerily calm,    as if in a trance
He takes the bra from her hand     and hangs it around her neck, as if helping somebody    with their tie
She takes a step back and finds herself    pinned against the wall -- Doug settled down once you two got married
New start and all that
Wanted nothing to do with this runaway 'd found, Tracy Seaver -- He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking her
She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking uncontrollably -- Or so he claimed
Because the truth, Doc -- is people never change
The son of a bitch couldn't resist
asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more
Go fucking figure
And now we    see Miranda's left hand ever so slowly reach for his holster
() 111
: You can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life
They're so close together their noses nearly touch
He gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her
He applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin to the point of no return -- The only soul you can ever count on is yourself -- rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood
He stumbles back, still on his feet, dazed
He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him
Struggling to catch her breath
faint smile forms on his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events
Why, Doctor
That was unexpected
He steps forward, almost playfully
She slowly shakes her head
Wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger -- You sure about this
He stares at her
Blood flowing from the side of his head
He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's open cell, weighing his options at triple speed -- You need me alive for your story to stick
Be logical now
You know you can't kill me
He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills a  through his forehead
Sheriff Ryan splays backwards and lands with a crash
Logic is overrated
-   - The door to Tracy's room is closed
Pete where we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake
() 112
: him, we     the back of his neck
So  we can actually see the hairs on the back of his neck
And as he feels the  of a cold whisper, they stand up on their ends
Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now open
Strange
He stands up and walks to the door
#1 Pete looks oddly around the room
Anybody in here --
As he turns, we  Rachel slipping out of the room
Unseen by him, of course
Pete starts to exit when Tracy opens her eyes
Groggily waking as if from a dream
Hello --
- Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of take-out food
Chatting with his colleagues
'  - Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it
Sheriff Ryan
No sight of the man
That's odd
Maybe he's in the bathroom
Turlington heads in that direction
'  - Turlington peeks in
checks the stalls
Sheriff
Nobody
He notices the back window is open because raindrops are blown in by the wind
He looks out to the parking lot for a moment before shutting it
113
- The    is trying to hold back a grim Pete, Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area
'm sorry, but nobody is allowed to visit at this hour -- Is the Sheriff here or isn't he
(reaching the scene) Help you, gentlemen
We're here to see Miranda Grey
You know full well you're not allowed to see -- Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him
That's straight from Judge Wilkinson
Take us to her cell
Better get the Sheriff out here
Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused
Sheriff Ryan isn't here
His car is gone too
Officer, unlock the goddamn door to Miranda's cell or 'll break it down myself
Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way, certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric institutes
He leads the men down the corridor and unlocks the cell
The men wait as all three locks are dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open
The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks
Sheriff Ryan, splayed
Very dead
() 114
: Jesus
Christ
Teddy Howard has to look away
Pete places his hand on Parsons' shoulder
Parsons simply glares at the dead man, eyes filled with hatred
No sign of Miranda anywhere
Vanished
Like Houdini
: - the tall gates,  the guard, the sprinklers watering the impressive gardens pulls up
: healthier, much happier-looking Chloe shakes Pete's hand at the front steps
Small suitcase by her side
Thank you for everything, Dr
Graham
'll never forget all you've done for me
It's been my pleasure, Miss McGrath
Good luck out there
Chloe smiles
Awkward
Her first day out in the real world
Well,  guess this is it
hope not to see you again unless it's for coffee or something
Hey, you never know
It's a small world, unless you have to clean it
Chloe picks up her bag, climbs down the steps to her cab
Stops midway, turns: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but -- have you ever heard anything from --
Pete shakes his head
Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab
Pete waves as it drives off
Then he pulls out a postcard from his pocket
It has a New York City postmark

- (
) Dear Pete
Hope this finds you on both feet, preferably having been promoted to director after Phil's retirement
Not that you had much competition, but a big hug to you anyway
was as surprised as anyone to read about Sheriff Ryan's suicide and the startling discovery that it was he who murdered my late husband
wish could personally thank certain people for their convincing testimonies in the case
fly  us under her
: ) "Female doctor still at large, wanted for questioning," with a picture of Miranda underneath
) "Guilt-ridden serial killer killed accomplice, then killed self: Female Doctor cleared on charges
" Pictures of Sheriff Ryan and Douglas Grey side by side
) "Authorities close case on dual serial killers: community mourns murdered daughters
"  picture of Officer Turlington, Pete, and Phil Parsons at a press conference
(
) As for myself,  have a new name now and a job working with teenage girls at a runaway shelter, trying to keep an open mind at the horrors they tell me
- a young woman kneeling down to set flowers on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy Seaver
Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired -- she's even cute
(
) Which reminds me: Consuelo the Cuban witch is a keeper, don't fire her
She knows things about the world you and  don't

: to see the gave is Rachel's, and it is positively overflowing with flowers
She's become something of a cause celeb in these parts
Tracy walks back to the retired couple holding hands, Phil and Dorothy Parsons
(
) Well, gotta run now,  have some country songs to write and lots of social invites to decline
the lush cemetery, several trees until we find Rachel watching the serene scene
She turns   now and we   her eyes, finally at peace, until it  the  and in it we see
() - Miranda walking among the throng of pedestrians
She looks confident, relaxed, down to earth
No longer the tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story
(
) And in case you're wondering what the chances are of me buying you a beer and maybe finishing something we almost started, the answer is: it's just not going to happen
Especially not at McSorley's next Friday night
Say around nine
So you probably shouldn't bother showing up
All my love,
She turns at the light and gets lost in the crowd
