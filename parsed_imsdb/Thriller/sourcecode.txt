Sunlight hits his face
He blinks
stunned beat
He's disoriented
Slowly he turns his head to one side
Filling most of the seats
Office workers on their morning commute into a city
Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window
Trees flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic strobe pattern
Colter looks to be thirty years old
military buzz cut disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt
Skin burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun
His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble
Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down shirt and navy sports coat
On his wrist is a digital watch
It reads 7:40 a

He swallows
strange, creeping panic
He has no idea where he is
- The train hurls straight at us
-- Skimming alongside as the train twists and turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it
Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely seems to touch
They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer

In contrast to the corporate suits around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button- down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and- bones cufflinks
She's busy writing in a journal
Ma'am
Nothing
Excuse me
ma'am
She looks up
Blank stare
What is this

Where am

It's more of a hell hole
But Colter still doesn't understand
He gets up
Nausea slams into him
He hangs on to the seat
Woah
() think 'm going to puke
(gestures, alarmed) Okay, bathroom's that way
Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating
Go
Seriously
Colter eases himself into the aisle
Totters down the length of the car until he finds the
The door is
The latch reads "
" Bracing himself, he lurches forward into

It's a mirror image of the first car
But no, the passengers are different
Beside him there's a small door
Thinking it's the bathroom, he instead opens it to find a ' cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors
Ticket
heavy-set  stands in the aisle
jangling of keys
Colter just stares at him
Dazed
May  see your ticket
The last thing on his mind
Bewildered, he searches his pockets
don't think

Have to write you up then
He pulls out a citation pad

From inside his sports coat he pulls out a
The conductor snips his ticket and brushes past
Wait a sec
'm a little out of it here
Where's this train headed
New York
Penn Station
New York
Why would he be going to New York
How can this be happening
Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination simply continues
Do you know where  got on
The conductor examines his ticket again
Princeton Junction
Where's that
" Bout ten minutes back
But 've never been to Princeton Junction
See
don't remember waking up or buying a ticket or getting on the train or anything else
It's just a blank
Lucky you
The jaded conductor moves on
Colter is alone with his confusion
Takes a deep breath
The nausea has eased slightly

Okay
You're gonna figure this out
-   - Entering the first car again
The rows of passengers
Must be at least forty people
As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face: pale   reviews some documents
forty-something  does a crossword puzzle
, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone: Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed
, slumped against a window, eyes shut, listens to an -3 player
An   with a faded wool suit clutches a cane
, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a guidebook
dowdy   type sorts supermarket coupons into a tabbed file box
An African American  reads a newspaper
None of them pays any attention to Colter

The  of  sound sinister
Like the exhalations of a creature
He looks to see woman
Colter cringes
Every detail, every sensory impression seems heightened, near the point of overload
He reaches Christina again
Eases back in the seat across from her
She writes in her journal, ignoring him

There's something else in his sports coat
He turns it over a few times, inspecting it
Pulls out a '
Another man's face is in the photo
The name on the license reads: "

The street address on the license reads: "58 Alexander Road, Princeton Junction, New Jersey

Who the hell's that
And why does he have this guy's wallet
He leans forward to speak with Christina again
Ma'am
She lowers her journal, annoyed
We see she hasn't been writing but
well-executed sketch of a face
Why do you keep calling me ma'am
How old do you think  am, anyway
'm having a little problem here
'm trying not to freak out, but think something's happened to me
Like what
Like, total memory loss
Complete
don't know how  got here
So you drank too much last night
So did
Unfortunately, remember the whole thing
That's not it
See

She waits for more
As if he's telling a joke

Right before woke up here  was in the middle of a mission

Wavering
Unsure of himself
His memories
Boy, you really did drink a lot last night
'm telling you the truth

Newark Station, next stop
The train begins to
few people begin to get up
The platform of Newark Station slides into view
These aren't my clothes
And this wallet here
He holds up the driver's license
One final attempt to convince her
You see this
This isn't me
Of course it is
What
Take a look in the mirror, good sir
The mirror
She goes back to her sketchbook
Determined not to be interrupted again
Anxiety ripples through Colter
This can't be happening
The train lurches to a stop

) Newark Station
Colter gets up
Through the windows, a few passengers disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College Kid and , a Middle Eastern man, who  past all of them towards the station building

Colter only half notices all this
He's intent on reaching the train's , the door of which is now
(
) All aboard
Doors are closing
Christina watches Colter go
Curious
(
) This is a New York bound train
Next stop, New York - Penn Station
The train begins
Colter reaches the bathroom

He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in stainless steel

Recoils backwards
Eyes locked on Staring back is  '
Not his own
He's frozen there
Heart pounding
Seized by cosmic panic

Wake up
The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train, obliging him to hang on
This isn't a dream
At least not one he can wake up from
The other guy's face stares back at him
Blinks when he blinks
- Warehouses go by in a blur
The train is entering New Jersey's industrial zones on the outskirts of New York City
From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which Colter left behind
Then up at the closed restroom door
: 9
Her hand knocks
Hey
You okay in there
- Colter sits on the closed toilet seat
Head buried in his hands
Scared
Desperate for it all to end
- Christina's holding Colter's messenger bag
She talks through the closed door
You left your bag on the seat
Which is a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that probably saved you a huge fine
No answer
'll just leave it right out here for you
She places the bag beside the door
She hesitates at the door
The oddness of this situation
- Colter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face
Practically catatonic at this point
And then her voice -- (
) If it'll help you remember, you've been riding this train every morning for three months
Her words rouse him
() Three months

The car rocks to one side as an   flashes by on the opposite tracks, going the other way

Colter picks up a screw

Can't quite see the object up there
Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the toilet
Grabbing onto the ventilation panel, he all the way open
Then  himself uncomfortably upward
On tip-toes, he looks into crawl space and discovers It's an enormous device
Several large  tied together, full of sloshing liquid
Barely discernible behind wires and gaffing tape is   -- the bomb's detonator

His eyes flutter open
He's surprised to find himself alive
Consternation flashes through him as he discovers that he's tightly strapped in
He now wears a military flight suit

) Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle
Acknowledge transmission
The measured calm of a mission controller's voice comes over Colter's headset

Very slowly, almost imperceptibly, Colter's upside-down face begins to turn and right itself

Listen to the following passage: "When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself
She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver

An indeterminate amount of time has passed
Goodwin is back on the monitor

Colter mulls his options
Should he talk

He turns to At the passing woodland scenery
He's back on the train
Back in the same navy sports coat
Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad
Just like before
Other commuters all around him
Everything is exactly the same as before
Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern
" Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule
Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from, the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers, the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the window, bursting with summer leaves
Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40 a

Pretty girl
Every combat simulator has one
In the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno

And you're a moron
Disregarding her, Colter gets up
Pursuing a new line of action
The only way he can make sense of this
He starts walking up the rows
Find the bomber

The conductor approaches him

Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be punched
Everything okay today, chief
Say what
Anything out of the ordinary
The conductor frowns at him
Who is this guy
Please take a seat, sir
Colter moves on
He looks for suspects
We've seen the faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on
All seems normal
He finds himself focusing on a jumble of unfiltered details -- Suits

In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses
He looks forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin
How's it going
Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed
Behind his dark glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable
What's your name
Guzman is stock still
Beads of sweat on his forehead
The conductor appears, accosting Colter
Didn't  tell you to take a seat
Goodwin
Where are you
It's over
found him
Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence
But nothing happens
Who are you talking to
An edgy silence
Other passengers looking over
Colter's about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops
It's too easy
Colter senses the uproar he's about to create
Which just might be a mistake
He reconsiders
Sorry
This guy seemed a little
anxious

Tell him to mind his

The conductor has noticed Guzman's white-knuckle uneasiness
You feeling all right, sir
With a pained smile, Guzman loosens his collar
Motion sickness, 'm afraid believe  will get off at the next stop
Very well
The conductor turns back to Colter
Okay
'm sitting down
Turning away, he finds a seat
He studies Guzman out of the corner of his eye

) Now approaching Newark Station
Newark Station, next stop
The train begins to slow down
Several rows up, he sees Christina
She looks back at him with distaste
small number of passengers get up, among them the College Student
He catches Colter's attention as he picks up a from a seat and catches up with Derek, the Stock Broker, who's about to get off the train
Hey, you dropped this
(relieved, takes back the ) Wow
Thanks
The College Student waits to get off
Colter now eyes him closely
As the train pulls to a stop, Guzman forcefully pushes forward towards the doors, moving with a barely contained urgency

Excuse me

The bathroom mirror, of course, reflects back Sean Fentress's face, not Colter's
Guzman does not seem to notice this disparity
He picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out

Cautiously, he releases his hands from their grip on the seat restraints
He looks like he's sweated off five pounds
Do you need to urinate

29
Do you need to urinate
How are you doing this
Am  on some kind of drug
Did you find the bomber
didn't find the bomber
You fooled me with the Middle Eastern guy
went for the diversion
What kind of freaky simulation is this
Let me out of here
Which Middle Eastern guy
Be specific
Guzman
Shell Oil
Look,  don't have intel experience
Why do you have me doing this
You've already been told what you need to know
Discipline your memory
Limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you
Everything else is irrelevant
Irrelevant
Killing me each time is irrelevant
You do not die

How can you do that

There was a man smoking a pipe saw him on the monitor

The man with the pipe isn't here right now
Let me talk to him
This isn't right
'm not your prisoner
Goodwin makes technical adjustments to dials and gauges
You feel unsatisfied with our relationship
What is this
Why are you talking like that
Is this some kind of script
If Guzman, the Middle Eastern man, is innocent, as you maintain, who might be the guilty party
Who cares
'm tired of this
This isn't a game, Captain
Then what is it
Don't you already know who the bomber is
Don't you have all the answers
We have no answers
Only corpses

Six miles outside of New York City
Colter's head is spinning
You're lying

What do your senses tell you
His senses tell him it's true
But how can he accept it
Where am , right now, as we speak
With Beleaguered Castle
My unit's still in Iraq

Your unit was rotated Stateside three weeks ago
The news comes like a slap in the face
Colter clearly has no memory of this
Then why do  still have Iraqi dirt underneath my fingernails
Goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls
Talk to me

've been back three weeks
How'd  get in here
Have  seen my family
Does my father know 'm home
" Cause 'd kinda like to tell him if that's the case
Listen up, soldier
Goodwin hunches forward, putting his elbows on his desk
As he does so, he inadvertently reveals a glimpse of his military unit
The insignia contains wings and a lightning bolt against a background of stars
Underneath it is written "-
" The train is just the beginning
Our intel says there are more attacks are coming today
And they're linked with the train
Time is of the essence
Do you understand
Colter barely hears
He's fixated on that shoulder patch
Captain
'm listening
Counterterrorism has come up with the five most likely follow-up targets in the New York area
() 33
(') They are, in no order of importance, the Holland Tunnel, Newark International Airport, the Brooklyn Bridge, Penn Station and the Empire State Building
It could be any of them, it could be none of them
Whatever it is, if you find the bomber and learn his plan, the next one we might be in a position to prevent
Those are your orders
It's too much information to process
Colter's head spins with questions
Wait
If 'm somehow on that train before it blows up, why don't just dismantle the bomb
Those are not your orders
But all those people dying
Those are not your orders
You are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission
Military priorities
Defying comprehension
didn't volunteer for this shit
Would you like to see the release form you signed
() How do  know it's real
How do know you didn't force me to sign it
And how the hell can  be put on a train over and over again -- a train  never was really on
He might as well be talking to a wall
don't believe in time travel, Goodwin
There's no such thing
34
Machinery begins to
Like the  of a firing up
Only one way forward, Captain
Seventeen minutes
Find the truth
Why seventeen
Why me
Why anything
The capsule begins to
Let me out
Don't send me back there
:   a   as -- - hurls down the tracks
- Landscape flies by
Colter's forehead rests against the glass window
Piercing sunlight
Shit
This is not happening
He leans back in his seat, as if just another beaten down office worker on the train
Ain't life grand
Across from him, Christina sketching
gentle smirk
He focuses in on her
Not knowing where else to begin
You an artist
went to art school
Doesn't make me an artist
Can  see what you're working on
35
Her pencil pauses
She eyes Colter
'd rather not
He looks down at his watch
7:41 a
m
He's been back for one minute
Adjusting the settings, he changes the digital display to   the remaining
He tries again for human contact
You don't look like you belong here
The way you're dressed
You certainly do
'd really like to see what you're working on
Unless you're worried won't like it
It's private
And your opinion doesn't interest me
So you scribble away on that thing so as not to deal with people
She scowls
Tosses the sketch pad onto his lap
Surprised, Colter opens it
It's full of faces -- thumbnail portraits of other passengers riding the train
They're exquisitely observed, darkly stylized into expressions of loneliness
They're amazing
wouldn't go that far
Seriously, they're really good, Miss
Christina
My name's Colter
How many of these passengers have you drawn
36
All of them, practically
She leans forward, eyes glinting conspiratorially
know all about them
You know all about them
'm a collector of moments
( ) That woman over there
She's a patent attorney with three kids and a summer place on Long Island
More important, however, she colors her hair herself and wears the same houndstooth check suit every third Wednesday
The nebbishy fellow behind her always calls into his office three minutes before we go into the tunnel
And the guy with the shaved head and leather jacket eating a scone has a profile identical to that of Julius Caesar
click of the restroom door opening
Guzman emerges from the bathroom and returns to his seat
(: ) What about that guy
Christina looks over Guzman
haven't seen him before today
( ) He's cranky
Thinks the worst of people
Dangerous
Everyone's dangerous
You see anything unusual happen this morning
Anything out of the ordinary
37
'm not sure  know what you mean
Has anyone else come out of that bathroom that you remember
She takes a closer look at him
puzzled smile
Who are you
Colter hesitates
Debating
Don't you know
Haven't you seen me here every day for, what, three months
Something's different about you today
If  told you that there's a terrorist on this train, that  was sent here to catch him, would you believe me
Most fervently
Then tell me which one you'd arrest
Christina pages through her sketch pad again
Considering different faces
They're all so utterly normal
That's what's terrifying about them
Perhaps there's more than one
team at work
The patent attorney in cahoots with Julius Caesar and the nebbishy guy
And don't forget the sullen college kid
He's the expendable one
But they're all controlled by this good- looking stock broker
She shows him her sketch of Derek, the Stock Broker
38
Blond, blue eyed, hyper alert
The perfect Machiavellian operative
Out for himself
He'll betray them all in the end
She's not taking him seriously
Never mind
He gets up
Foolish of him to confide in her
His watch now reads
(
) Now approaching Newark Station
Newark Station, next stop
The train begins to slow
Derek, Guzman, the Old Man and the College Kid head towards the exit doors
( ) He's getting away
Colter moves aside to let them walk past
( ) Thanks for your help, ma'am
Ma'am
How old do you think  am
don't know
Thirty two
Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high
- The disembarking passengers exit the platform
- The train is moving again
In the exit area, Colter watches the station disappear
He's doing this all wrong
(
) Next stop New York Penn Station
39
- The two screws rattle in the sink
Colter gazes up at the half-opened ventilation shaft -- and at the edge of the sinister bomb planted there
Back down to the mirror
Sean Fentress's face
The most baffling mystery of all
What happened, Fentress
Who are you
How can  be you
-- Back in the isolation unit
On the monitor, the glimpse of Goodwin's
The unit initials "-
" Back to scene
Colter churning over the thought
"-
" What unit is that
on the door
- Through the windows comes the blur of the whizzing past (the same train which previously ran over Colter)
Emerging from the bathroom, Colter discovers Christina there
Who were you talking to
Leave me alone
Colter walks off
Irked at his change in tone, she follows him, carrying his messenger bag
My pleasure, okay
It's just that you left your bag on your seat
(trying to be cute) It's a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that
Maybe you're the terrorist
This is too much
Colter turns on her
Paranoid
40
Terrorist
Why did you say that
was joking
Stop joking
Who are you
Are you an operative
had no idea you were so thoroughly weird
'm not entirely sure  like it
Why do you have sketches of everybody on board
Are you part of this
Part of what
can have you arrested
Maybe that's the only way you'll drop the bullshit and talk
Stay put
'm getting help
She sees he's serious and drops her arch playfulness
Speaks in a flat, sober voice
Who am
'll tell you
'm twenty seven years old
have no savings and no health insurance
He turns back
Waits
The more she speaks, the angrier she gets
Six months ago  moved back in with my parents because  ran out of money
got 's in line drawing and advanced oil painting but no one's buying my stuff
Two weeks ago  put away all my paints
My little sketch book is the last thing left
You see, 'm not a artist
'm a receptionist in a law firm
The only thing  operate is a phone switchboard

The stark reality of her life
The  of the   yanks his attention to the windows
Up ahead are the row houses opposite which the train exploded
Time is running down
Now let me tell you about you
You work at the New York Public Library
You've been eyeing me for months on this train but haven't said a word to me
You're bland and colorless and predictable
And now  see you're delusional, too
Colter doesn't hear her
He's still looking out the window
' Above the row houses, a   is climbing serenely into the blue after take-off out of Newark Airport
The view is wiped away as the   comes surging past the windows
But the sight of the plane has already caused something to click in Colter's head
Son of a bitch

" That's not army
That's Air Force
Combined Air and Space Operations Center
Nellis Air Force Base
Are you mocking me
They're running this whole thing out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada
Fucking Nevada

We catch the words "bomb threat

begins beeping
Passengers look around uneasily
Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter
Do me a favor
Don't ever talk to me again
She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away
Colter looks down at his watch

Turning to look at us
gentle, reassuring smile
Click -- click
Click -- click
The video monitor is malfunctioning
It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's face in and out of darkness
43
The capsule is nearly shut down
The controls appear non- functional
Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry
Colter hugs himself, shivering
His breath is visible in the capsule's tomb-like cold
Goodwin
What's happening
Come in
Can you read me
It's goddamn cold in here
He hits a few buttons
Almost at random
The  which had been blowing in air
Goodwin, 'm losing oxygen
The monitor fizzles out
The light from the controls
Goodwin
It's now
He  on the side of the capsule
Just a muffled thump
terrifying silence
The  of a harness releasing
as Colter falls to the floor of the capsule
Cursing
Some sounds of thrashing around
Then
The  of a   illuminates Colter's face
He's activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit
It begins to

It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule
Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the Using all his strength he
But the handles don't budge
The hatch remains sealed
He gets to his feet
Can't stand up fully
The capsule is incredibly cramped
Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers in small, almost illegible type
And a small set of
He spreads them out on the tiny ledge
Taking a wrench, he on the escape hatch
deep, clanging  in the hull
44
So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft
At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry
Daunted by the complexity
There's no time to lose
Using a miniature screw driver, he begins unscrewing the monitor panel
His fingers are slow and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out of his hands
Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents
Colter, ice crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently
Much of the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed
Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of They spark once

Nothing

There's a puff of blue smoke
He's burned his fingers
But the battery now has a tiny
Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads on the battery
From inside the engines comes a faint electric
The monitor awakens
Like a film projector it throws the image of a   onto the opposite side of the craft
Colter begins replacing the monitor components
As he does, a pre-recorded   comes on: (

Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work
The monitor switches to a real-time view of the
Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight
In a background distorted by the - , various technicians wander by
Hello
Anyone out there
It's me
He toggles an audio jack
Then a  comes walking up
Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of another world
It's the
The elusive Bohemian scientist whom Colter glimpsed once before
He will be known as Can you hear me
Rutledge is tinkering with the camera
The image shakes for a moment as he adjusts it
Then puts on a headset
Project designer initiating sequence and drives check
'm here
'm okay
Rutledge checks his headset
Not sure he heard right
Is someone there
Yeah
It's me
Colter
Rutledge blinks in surprise
The blue eyes sparkling
Wow
It's you
The capsule lost power
It's still pretty cold in here
We've been working towards you from the other side
Nice to have you with us again
You feeling all right
46
think so
Who are you
The name's Rutledge
They wouldn't let me talk to you before
No,  guess not
They're pretty anal around here
(lights his pipe) Don't tell them you saw me smoking in here, okay
His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the military environment
And then it occurs to Colter: You're the inventor of this thing
() prefer the term project designer
And sorry for all the secrecy
Goodwin will be thrilled you re- established contact
don't want to deal with Goodwin anymore
What
Don't you understand
He's torturing me
'm helpless
Can't you get me out of here
Rutledge looks uneasy
As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to deal with personnel issues
Why would Goodwin have it in for you
47
He's a remote operator
And remote operators are risk averse pussies who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their asses on the line in the field
He seems pretty devoted to the mission
And just what kind of mission is this
Talk to me, man
Why won't he let me save those people on the train
Because they can't be saved
Why not
know what's going to happen
could take apart the bomb
Stop the train
Yeah but you'd be doing it in the Source Code, not here
Not in our own past
Mystery upon mystery
What's the difference
'm not sure  should be telling you this
Telling me what
Coaxing the scientist in him
It's quantum physics
Linear algebra
Parabolic calculus
It would take weeks to explain
Is Source Code time travel
48
Rutledge sighs
Looks at his pipe
It's gone out again
Why can't  save those people on the train
Think of it like this: events in our past can never be undone
Einstein proved that
So
So Source Code opens up another past for you
parallel past
It looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world
In essence, by sending you back, an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created
It looks identical to ours, but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality
At last some useful information
Colter races to process it
What happens to the Source Code world after  leave it
don't know
You can never know that because you're not there to observe it
Maybe it vanishes
Maybe not
() should tell them you're okay
What about the bicycle
What bicycle
see it each time
Right after the bomb goes off
Like an after image
() 49
(') There's a bicycle and a stone wall and a girl
It's a girl from the train
don't know where any of it is supposed to be, but -- Rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth
Wait
You see all this after you leave the train
Yeah
Just for a split second
Rutledge is stunned
Like he's discovered some strange new property to his invention
Please tell me you're not making this up
No
It's there
What do you think it means
don't know
Rutledge looks off camera for a moment
They're here
There's no more time to talk
() Make sure he sends you back in
Find out about the after images
Goodwin appears
Rutledge reluctantly takes off his headset
Rutledge, wait
Don't leave me
Rutledge steps away
pointed look at Colter
Goodwin settles back into his seat, donning the headset
Welcome back
How are you feeling
'm alive
No thanks to you
You find the bomber
50
You're a brick wall, Goodwin fucking brick wall
Lower your pulse
The situation has worsened
The fire on the tracks caused one of the freight cars to blow up and release some kind of gas
As a precaution they're having to evacuate all of lower Manhattan
Evacuate lower Manhattan
The enormity of this
Having to take it on faith
We may have lost the initiative
What do you mean
Let's keep going
We were expecting more from you
can give you more
Let me think for a second
But Goodwin ignores him
Absorbed in paperwork
The freight car blows up from the fire
It spews gas, or what could be gas -- it might be chlorine, so they can't take any chances
Anxious now
Trying to make up lost ground
Whatever it takes to get sent back in
So they decide to play it safe and evacuate parts of New York City
And maybe that's part of the terrorists' plan, right
() So
so who benefits from that
What's vulnerable
What's down there in lower Manhattan
() Wall Street
51
Surprising himself with this insight
And now Goodwin is paying attention again
Waiting for more
Wall Street
That's what they're going to hit next
The financial markets
Goodwin considers this
For the first time, slightly impressed
want to show you something
: The video monitor shows 's  shot
Her wry, secretive smile
Did she die, too
Yes

Its burned face, like a piece of rotted fruit, fills the screen
Nevertheless, we recognize it
And it's not Christina
It's someone else
That's

) Sean Fentress
The man in the mirror
Himself, at least on the train
He died on the train
(
) As a host identity, Sean Fentress had to have certain basic similarities to you

Pondering
Would you like to see the other passenger photos
Perhaps that would help you
You still have Christina's body
The other things she was carrying

) Why
want to know about her
Everything  can
She's not just another victim
She's connected to all this
- The rich smell of steaming coffee
The glint of a polished leather shoe
The crisp click of someone uncapping a fountain pen
The scenery rushing by -- the blur of trees, the soft lavender of the morning sky
The swell and pull of the mighty machine coursing over the rails
If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it
To Colter, every sensation has become even more pronounced, more intensely real than ever

The duration of his freedom
Across from him is Christina
Absorbed with her sketching
Thirty six dollars and eleven cents

He points out the window
They're passing a neighborhood of modest homes
We're about to pass a street with willow trees
Two girls will be jumping rope
white dog's going to run out behind them Dalmatian mix
In a moment, they pass a scene exactly as Colter described
Christina's befuddled smile
You want to tell me how you're doing this
Close observation
You could say 'm a collector of moments
collector of moments
Yes
That's the cheesiest line 've ever heard
She resumes her drawing
You trained to be an artist
No response
You got 's in line drawing and oil painting
But your work didn't sell
You took a job answering phones in a law firm

(') Six months ago you moved back in with your parents
Two weeks ago you put your paints away for good
The sketch book is all you have left
Who the hell are you
Who have you been talking to
You
Me
No
haven't ever talked to you
But we have, Christina
You've drawn all these people here
You know their routines
At one point you thought you were different from all of them
But now you're not so sure
Christina has gone white
Utterly incredulous

Coffee sloshing in styrofoam cups Colter hands one to Christina and sits down opposite her

Okay, you've got my attention
Now tell me what this is all about
need your help
Are you selling something
Listen to me
can't use up any more time trying to convince you
just need you to believe everything 'm about to tell you
This better be good
56
Bear with me
(beat, where to begin
) Your sketch book
Is there a drawing of me in there
'm not sure
Please, Christina
Yes, fine
Here
She flips through it
Shows him a sketch of
did it last week
The thing is, that's not me
Give me a little credit
No
You drew what you saw, but the person you're seeing now is someone else
'm not Sean Fentress
'm not really on this train
() You're not really on this train
'm taking someone's place
Borrowing it
My name is Colter
'm a soldier
And 'm being held prisoner
And this is the only way -- the only time and place  have -- to figure out how to escape
She gives him a blank look
After three months of riding the train, this is how you introduce yourself to me
57
'm serious
Elements in the American military are using me for an experiment
'm not sure exactly how it all happened, but 'm at a facility on Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada
Right now
As we speak
It's a project called Source Code
Source Code
It's a program
It shifts identities
It also performs small amounts of time travel
Or "time engineering
"  don't know the jargon
He's not getting through to her
It's too bizarre
've been put on this train to look for someone
criminal
And need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train
Because right here's only place  can figure out what's really happening
But  have very little time
And each time  come back, you won't remember me and 'll have to go through this all over again
You are,  think, deliciously mad
Then how do  know all those things about you if we've never spoken before
She doesn't have an answer
Can't easily dismiss him
Why tell all this to me
There's lots of people around for you to talk to
Because  think you have the answer to this whole thing
58
Believe me,  don't have the answer for anything
There's a vision
keep having it
It's very powerful
And you're in it
And there's a bicycle
And this
old stone wall
And it's very peaceful
Does this sound familiar
Like where you live, maybe
Stone walls
My parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an American eagle over the door
The only bike is a Harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning
The vision must mean something
It's the only time when 'm not on the train or in the capsule
Why else would Rutledge be so interested
Who's Rutledge
Someone who was trying to help me understand something
Until they got to him
He lowers his head
dead end
No answer
The train begins to slow down
(
) Now approaching Newark Station
Newark Station, next stop
Colter looks at
Ten minutes left
saw a program on
It was about psychics
They say psychics have a lot of paranoia
don't believe in that shit

Through the window, the Old Man, Derek and the College Kid disembark
Guzman hurries past them to the station house
(
) All aboard
Doors are closing
Don't you have people you can go to for help
Friends, family
The train begins to move again
(
) This is a New York bound train
Next stop, New York - Penn Station
Most of my friends are in the military
My dad runs a melon farm in Alabama
Maybe now's the time to reach out to him
She hands him her cell phone
Colter just holds it in his hand
Me and my dad, we don't see eye to eye
We're just two different people
As opposed to being the exact same person
Are you always this sarcastic
This is so not about me
Colter reluctantly dials
As it rings -- What day is it
June 11th
60
June
One more thing to puzzle him
The call connects
An  ,  , answers
The gravelly voice of a Midwestern farmer
(
) Hello
Dad
Donald doesn't respond
Dad, it's me
It's Colter
Again, silence
Been a while, huh
'd been meaning to call you, but -- Click
The line goes dead
Colter looks at Christina
He wanted me to stay on and take over the farm but
had other ideas
You're intimidated by him
What
You're scared of him
can see it
The hell  am
Challenged, he redials
Braced for conflict
The call connects
Dad, don't hang up
We're going to talk
need your help
61
( ) Now you listen to me
Whoever you are, never call here again
Donald hangs up
He's still mad at you, huh
No
it was like he didn't even know who  was
Troubled, he hands back her phone
Outside, the flashes by
don't know how to help you
She feels bad for him
And something inside Colter closes
Retreating inside himself
Sorry to have bothered you
He gets up to go
Christina stays where she is
- Back in his seat
Lost in the view out the window
The neighborhoods have given way to Newark's industrial fringe
Bringing him closer to the inevitable end
(
) have a friend
Surprised, he turns to find her there
She works at the New York Times
Her name's Stephanie
She's just a proofreader, but she wants to be made a reporter
She's always saying she needs a good story to bring in so she gets noticed
Something like this, with a crazy paranoid angle could really interest her
Forget it
62
She could do some poking around
She's already quite suspicious of the government
Christina's dialing her phone
Colter turns back to the window
'm getting voice mail
(into the phone) Steph, it's Christina
You know that story you're always looking to write
might just have something for you
met a guy
His name is Colter Stevens
He says he's in the army
He flies helicopters in Iraq, but now they've put him into a secret project called Source Code
Maybe you can look into it a bit, okay
Call me
She hangs up
Pleased with herself
She'll call back
Just wait
None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile
Thank you, ma'am
() Ma'am
How old do you think  am
He gives her a wary look
Considers
Twenty five
She smiles, pleased
No, but thanks
() What did you mean, there's a criminal on the train
How do you know that
Colter looks away
Careful
63
just do
How can  help you if you don't tell me everything about this
- Colter enters the tiny space
Christina is reluctant to follow him into the bathroom
You said you wanted to know
Can't you just tell me
He gives her an imploring look
She sighs and squeezes in next to him
Try anything and 'll kill you
Shut the door
As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink
What are you doing
He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside
It's up here
He holds out his hand
She grabs hold and steps up on the sink
She's not quite tall enough to see into the crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest of the way
(startled, feels his hands ) What are you -- Just look
Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up
long beat as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb
64
Is that
Acetone Peroxide
It's a liquid explosive
There's fourteen cannisters of it
Simple detonator
Cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom
He lowers her
An incredulous beat
Did you put this here
No
It was someone else
They don't know who
That's why 'm here
To find out
Watching her
Will she believe him
We have to tell someone
We have to stop this
- The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away
Mounting fear
Colter falls into step behind her
It won't matter
The train's already
Already what
've been sent here
It sounds crazy, but it's true
've been sent from the future -- from five hours in the future
This train's already been blown up
She backs up
Scared of him
Every right to be
You wanted to know
Now you know
She turns and hurries for the exit doors

This isn't happening

Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule
She's stabbing at the door release button
Why won't it open
Her phone is
They both stop
She looks at the number
It's Steph

Her eyes are fixed suspiciously on Colter as she listens
Colter looks outside
Recognizes the terrain
Looks down at -- 50
It's awful
Unbearable
He dashes towards the bathroom -- - Tears open the door
Jumps up on the sink
Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the bathroom's fluorescent light
As he grabs hold of the bomb, he hears -- (
) Colter
Working fast, he unhooks the leads on the detonator, rips away gaffing tape -- jostling the cannisters of explosives -- (
) Colter,  have to tell you something
-- and pulls off the detonator cell phone
Ducking back down, he see Christina standing in the doorway
66
Look
Now the fucking thing can't go off
Reads 20
Stephanie did a computer search
Something in her expression worries him
She's got a database of all newspaper articles going back to forever
Source Code's classified
It wouldn't be in a newspaper
No

She found me
What does that mean
She stops
Not wanting to go on

He drops the phone and doubles over
She runs to him -- ' 67
Everything around him  into a hundred thousand on an array
Christina's cries become bursts of static
Flying behind the array come     - - the Source Code architecture laid bare
And then the screen itself seems to melt, giving way to a frightening series of  : - '

Then, a   appears, as if through a slide projector
The Jack of Clubs
(
) Captain
The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then dissolves
(
) Captain, allow me to introduce myself
My name is Goodwin
You're with Beleaguered Castle
You are safe
All your needs will be met here
Lines of computer code flit across the screen

And the bicycle
And the stone wall
The strange, recurring vision

The sound drives away the image, replacing it with (
) Captain, just tell me what you see
Just look and speak
Groggy breathing
ragged voice: (
) see a card

) Very good
Very, very good
On Colter's face
deep, cold knot in his stomach
Shuddering in fear
The truth before him now
Crouching there, a nightmare, ruling over him
On the , Goodwin looks into the camera
Assessing the situation
69
Are you comfortable
Are you warm
Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing entirely from existence
Do you need to urinate
Colter swallows
Too terrorized to speak
Beleaguered Castle is waiting for your report
Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard
Impatient
He flips a switch
blocky  , something out of the 1970s, comes on: (

Goodwin keys in some commands
Forever adjusting

) Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself
She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver

As you're collecting your thoughts, should tell you there's been another development

We've traced it to central Asia

It is twilight
, his face hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a flickering camp fire and a tea service
The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and approaches the camera
The wind whips his black robes
The figure looks slight
Almost spectral
It begins speaking to the camera
(on camera, in accented ) By now you have suffered a taste of divine vengeance
God willing, you will soon suffer another
Colter does not raise his head
No idea whether he's even listening
These attacks will show you that you will never be safe
You can secure your borders
But what can you do against one of your own citizens
One who looks like you, who is blameless, living already among you, who takes eighty million of our dollars, a trifle, and carries out our bidding
You cannot stop this
Time has run out
The image freezes
Then switches back to the live feed of Goodwin
Let me talk to Rutledge
So you've decided to speak
Rutledge
Get him
71
We appreciate your desire for further discussion
Perhaps at a later date
Will you let me out of here
Goodwin ignore the question
Continues making notations
Frankly, Captain, we're disappointed
Find Rutledge
Now
have to say that we expected more from you
Stop
Stop reading from your goddamn script
Perhaps we overestimated your abilities
swear to fucking Christ
Please accept the criticism in the spirit it was given
Perhaps a few memory exercises would help
don't need your criticism and don't need your memory exercises, you gutless freak
And by the way, that bomb is detonated by a cell phone
When activated, the phone's display screen displays caller information
Caller
wonder if that information would be useful to Beleaguered Castle
For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown
But the mask of the cold clinician goes back up
72
Very well
We're ready for that information
You'll have to send me back didn't get a good look at it
But will next time
Goodwin hesitates
Skeptical
What assurance do we have you'll be able to read the screen before the device detonates
Goodwin, there's no time left
Send

Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor
His eyes are unblinking
Unfeeling
Nothing behind them
- Colter prowls the aisle feverishly
He scans the overhead luggage rack
Peeks inside a bag
Doesn't see what he wants
He looks all around
up the rows of passengers
intently scanning

Looking down, the Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished
Across the aisle, a    taps him on the arm
She gestures down the aisle to Who's walking off with the guy's cell phone
Behind him, the Computer Engineer gets up
Hey, do you have my phone
People turn to look
Among them is Christina
Colter just starts walking faster
73
() Dude, give me back my phone
- The Computer Engineer hurries in
Colter is nowhere in sight
He  down the aisle and towards the next car

Sorry
Wrong turn
Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment
- Just as the befuddled Computer Engineer disappears into the third car, Colter steps back into the aisle and walks the other way

Soon you're going to find out what happened on this train
And then your own day is going to start
But not until then
Right now it's just you and me talking
And you're a different Goodwin than the one 'm going to go back to in a few minutes
You're separate from him
Separate worlds

Jesus, Goodwin, how can  get through to you
You're not just a soldier
Somewhere inside you're a human being, too

) What's your question

This is crushing Colter

The monitor is blank
He shouts from the void -- Goodwin
Rutledge appears
Drops into the seat and puts on the headset
Fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at the camera
81
How's it going
Any breakthroughs
finally get it, Rutledge
You're the good guy, Goodwin's the bad guy
Working together, you get what you want out of me
Why didn't  see it before
Believe me, Captain, 'm on your side

() Look, it's been a long day
For all of us
But now we've got to bring this home and catch a killer
What's in it for me
Come on
These guys are serious
Help me out
My ass is on the line, too, you know
You can do better than that
They sent you here to offer me a deal
If you think 'm enjoying this, you're wrong
What's their offer
What can they possibly threaten me with after so colossally fucking me
Spit it out, you spineless turd
Rutledge's face goes red
Quite possibly no one has ever spoken to him like this before
After a sputtering pause, Rutledge's mouth hardens
82
The government can decide to take an interest in people
People like your father with his struggling farm
It can discover things like unpaid property taxes
It can call in his equipment loans or tie him down for years in environmental litigation
On the other hand, it can pay him handsomely for mineral deposits he never knew were there
As distant and problematic as your relationship was, surely you'd like the chance to do something for him

Those after images  saw

Brain chemistry

And what's there is real
Maybe it's a vision of the next world, but  can see it
You can see it
But you can never get there without our help
Get there
What do you mean
Our offer
Maybe we can get you there
In return for your completing the mission

Negotiating over his own soul
You'd never do it
You wouldn't have to
You could just flip the switch and start me back up again unaware
For all  know, you've made this deal with me before
Actually, we haven't
Your operational awareness has become too great
If you found out the truth about yourself once, you might do so again
As for Source Code, 'm sure we can find other servicemen coming back from overseas with wounds just like yours
() Do you have the courage to serve your country one final time
Colter's eyes bore into Rutledge
'm going to find you, Rutledge
Someday
Somewhere
(retreating from the ) The display screen on the detonator was a useful and exciting insight you made
This time, make it pay off

We need the force of the explosion to help integrate you quickly back into the present
The Source Code machinery is already beginning to
Rutledge excitedly keying in system commands
You hear me
Somehow, 'm going to find you

84
There's barely time for Colter to grab onto the harness restraints before the machinery goes into a deafening
Colter's body convulses and goes limp
Unconscious, he sags in his seat, held in by the harness
Everything split second later, the capsule comes back to life again
As if the plug were simply put back in
Captain
Colter
Disoriented
Thrashing to get free
It's okay
Calm yourself
You're back
Colter exhales
Shuddering
He's just completed another Source Code
What happened
The tentacles of the nightmare slowly releasing
Replaced by the oppression of being back in the capsule
Back in Rutledge's power

But there wasn't time to read the screen
As soon as it rang the bomb went off

His delivery is different now
Impersonal
Distant
85
Did you make any other progress
What in heck's name did you do for those seventeen minutes
Colter does not answer
The machinery again
Colter tenses, bewildered
Eyes dart accusingly to the screen
Wait
What are you -- Again, he convulses and goes limp
Click
Darkness
Everything
And   again -- controls, monitor, machinery
Colter  and opens his eyes
Gripped by another terror
Returning from yet another trip on the train
Another bomb blast
Death and resurrection
Rutledge looks in on him with impatience
We can do this all day
Until you get it right
Please
don't feel good
don't doubt it
Who's the bomber
don't know

He's helpless
An insect on a pin
Colter tears at his restraints, ready to bash his brains out against the controls
He
- and, in sudden freedom, surges up out of his seat with a cry
Around him startled passengers look over in confusion
Hey
86
Colter, back in his navy jacket, slacks and shirt, has pitched forward into Christina
You want to get off me
The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger poised to open his can of soda
Go ahead
Open your fucking soda
-
The Overweight Man complies
Some half-muttered reproaches, then most people go back to what they were doing
What's wrong with you, anyway
She glares at him at he stands up
He can't respond
Despair surges through him
He stumbles off down the aisle
But where can he go
There is no freedom
No escape
Imprisoned in both worlds
From her seat, Christina watches him go
Sensing the torment in him
Colter is slumped in a corner
Christina appears
Taps him on the shoulder
You okay
He eyes her furtively
Like a cave man who's never seen another human being before
You're not okay
He's ghastly pale
He's sweating profusely
Ma'am, please
return to your seat
Footsteps
The sound of jangling
Ticket
87
The conductor takes up position in front of him
As implacable as Rutledge, in his way
Ticket, please
He's not feeling well
He still needs a ticket
Colter makes no move to respond
No more concern for anything
Have it your way, pal
He takes out his book to write Colter up
Wait
'll pay it
have no idea where he got on
Full fare's $22
50
All right, all right
Getting out her wallet, she pays the conductor
He eyes her with disapproval, then shambles off
see customer service is alive and well on New Jersey Transit
Why did you just do that
The ticket
don't know
You looked a little lost
The gratitude in his look makes her self conscious
She turns to go
Will you do me a favor
What's that
88
Get off the train
What
(
) Now approaching Newark Station
Newark Station, next stop
Please
Just get off the train
Her puzzled look
The train begins to
This isn't my stop
You shouldn't have been on this train, Christina
You should be living another life
Not spending it answering phones for lawyers
How do you
group of passengers approaches the exit area
We've seen them all before: Derek, the Old Man, the College Kid
And the small encounters: shuffling around, positioning at the doors, and the College Kid tapping Derek on the arm, holding out Derek's wallet
Hey, you dropped this
(relieved, takes it back) Wow
Thanks
The train stops
The doors

) Newark Station
Derek, the Old Man and the College Kid get off
second later, Guzman bursts past them, making his nauseated run for the station
Leaving just Colter and Christina there
The doors stand open, invitingly
89
Everyone has a destiny
And this isn't yours
He steps out onto the platform
Holds out his hand for her to join him
coaxing look
She's incredulous
This guy
His words
This whole moment
Who in the world are you
Just do it
Stop being afraid
Believe in yourself
He waits for her
Only two steps away
(
) All aboard
Doors are closing
She blinks
The spell breaks
Those two steps prove to be two much
Leave me alone
She retreats back into the car
Colter is heartbroken
About to pursue her, he happens to look over and see Instead of going directly to the station house, Derek continues walking down the platform alongside the train, as if intending to reboard further down
And then it happens
With a quick motion Derek   through an open door of another car, then heads quickly away towards the station house
With no time to think, Colter slips back on board just as the doors slide shut
- The train begins moving
Christina is nowhere in sight
(
) This is a New York bound train
Next stop New York - Penn Station
90
Intrigued, Colter leaves the exit door area
- Strides down the aisle of the second car
and reaches the next set of There's nothing there
Whatever Derek tossed inside is gone
Did someone pick it up
Colter looks up the aisle and then the other way into the next car
No one there
Once more he examines the exit area
Gets down on his knees
Then he spots it -- an  between the floor and one of the wall panels, only a few inches high
And there something lies
Colter slides it out
Derek's
Intentionally left here
The same wallet the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier
Opening it, Colter pulls out Derek's '
The Source Code has finished
The monitor shows just the empty chair
Finally Rutledge returns to his seat
They've searched the wreckage and found the wallet
It was under the wall panel
Just as you said
An awkward dynamic between them
They despise each other but have to work together
Believe me, he's our guy
He tossed his own wallet back on the train
Only reason he'd do that
(finishing his thought) is if he wanted us to think he died in the explosion

He's an emergency preparedness volunteer on his office floor, for God's sake
You saw that terrorist video -- they said it was one of us
One of our own
If he's really the one, you can find out the rest of his plan
How
By any means necessary
There is no Geneva Convention in the Source Code
Torture him, you mean
() Find out the plan, before it happens here
And then 'll let you die
Their grisly bargain
In the conductor's compartment there's a fully loaded 9 millimeter handgun locked in a safe
Think you can remember the combination
- Christina is absorbed in her sketch book
Across from her, Colter watches
stranger to her again
It hurts too much
She feels his eyes on her
When she looks up, he's gone
- As Guzman exits the bathroom, he almost crashes into Colter, who's waiting right there
92
Excuse me
Assalam'alaikoom
Squeezing past, Guzman does a double take to hear the standard Arabic reply
- Reaching into the overhead crawl space, Colter once again unhooks the cell phone detonator from the bomb
Sitting down on the toilet seat, he dials 4-1-1 on the cell phone
(
) What listing
The New York Times
- Christina's
She gets it out
Hello
(
) Christina
It's Stephanie
Where are you right now
Going to work
Why
(
) The strangest thing
The phone rang at my desk and some guy don't know said the train you're on isn't safe and that you should get off at the next stop
Then he hung up

) Maybe you should get off

Everything's normal

Passengers begin to get off

'll be late for work
(
) The hell with work, Christina
You hate that job anyway
It's probably a joke
weirdo guy from somewhere
She sees Colter down in the exit area
They lock eyes
And somehow she knows
He made the call
Colter quickly disappears into the other car
94
- The doors stand open to the platform
Just then Derek's goes skidding back on board, disappearing under the wall panel
second later, Colter reaches the exit area
(
) All aboard
Doors are closing
- The train doors shut
Colter is now out on the platform
Christina is not there
Concerned, walking quickly forward, Colter looks through the windows
And finds her staring back at him
Still on the train strange moment between the two of them
Once again he's failed to save her
They watch each other for as long as possible, until the train pulls away
- As the train  , Christina sits down again, lowering her phone
(
) Did you get off
No

She hangs up
Disturbed
As if she's failed some test
But what test
Why this weird feeling

Anxiety creeps into her face
Looking around, the tranquility of the passengers begins to seem ominous, hinting that she's made the wrong choice

Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on the counter
Calmer than Derek
Accustomed to trouble
There
Now you have two wallets
Take them and go

Don't treat him like this
He's not an animal

He looks down, ashamed
Colter keeps the gun on him
Piss all you want
You took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today
Eighty million dollars

Then what about the wallet, huh
Why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board

Time's up
What is it
What is the next attack
So help me, 'll put this bullet through your brain
don't know what you're talking about
'm going to do it
Tightening his finger around the trigger
Tears are streaming down Derek's face
But he's not going to talk
would never hurt anyone

guess you'll have to kill me
But Colter can't
He can't shoot him
He lowers the gun
Disgusted with himself
Why can't he do it
You see
You are a human being
Speaking gently
Trying to calm him
Even as Colter feels like he's failed
This can be worked out
We can listen to each other

Confused, he answers the phone

But then there's the bridges, right
You never know when they'll be jammed
That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind
What did you say

The bridges
You just never know when they'll be jammed
His heart starts racing
On the train
Earlier
Derek in his seat, on his cell phone
Colter nearby, overhearing him: Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed
Colter looks to Derek
His stomach sinks
"By one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed
" That's what you said
You knew
You knew there was going to be an evacuation
You knew before it happened
All those people walking across the
The realization hits
They're going to bomb the bridges
While they're full of people

) What's happening

Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call
He coldly evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood
Then calmly walks out
As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on his beeping  -- Where the seventeen minutes have

For long seconds we watch his face

We are now away from Colter's
and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code operations center
Military and civilian personnel work amid mysterious scientific equipment
102
Rutledge talks on a wall phone
Like a team player serving his country
( ) Yes
We appreciate that
just hope the information has come in time to clear the bridges
Thank you, sir
When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other Naked ambition courses through him
Whether or not they can stop the bridge attack, we came up with the intelligence
And that virtually assures all of our futures
This is just the beginning, guys
( ) You did a great job, Goodwin
You operated our captain with skill and professionalism
What's that you have
Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a
The Army investigated Colter's helicopter crash in Iraq
Apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel
What's this, then
Some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying
No
It's the Silver Star
Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's breezy good humor
Send it on to his father
It'll ease the pain of his son's death
thought  might inform the captain of the citation
103
Better not
We can't risk acquainting him with the citation in case the memory wipe isn't entirely clean
The memory wipe
thought we were going to let him die
know,  know
But now the Director of National Intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program, and until we train up another candidate, we'll need to keep Colter around to demonstrate it
Oh
This thing is much bigger than any one of us
Goodwin, please clear Colter's memories and re-initialize Source Code
Rutledge walks away
The technician gives Goodwin a look of disgust
Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the envelope
- Mission Control
Panels, consoles and screens
Goodwin takes a seat at his workstation
He swings a microphone up and goes to flip a switch
Then stops
Unsure how to proceed
Looks down at the envelope with the citation in it
Inside the capsule, the silence continues
Colter thinks to himself

Reflecting
Pleased with himself
Under his breath, he acknowledges the praises he's imagining in his head: Thank you, sir

It's a great day for our country
Colter looks out at Goodwin

How are you feeling
Are you comfortable
Just do it
Come again

At least you can make me forget all of this

Goodwin stares at his hands
Unmoving
What are you waiting for

'd do the same thing if  was you
At least you've got a shot at saving those people on the bridges

You don't think they'll save them

No

An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin
Look, someone had to be where you're sitting, and someone had to be in here
Turned out it was you and me
() Just do it
'm tired
Would you like to see Christina again
One last time
Colter's not sure he heard him right
don't understand
Seventeen minutes
That's all could give you
No mission to fulfill
Just
the two of you
() Why would you do that
As a favor
One prisoner to another
Prisoner
You were right
About me
And about Source Code
We've kept too much from each other
An odd sensation comes over Colter

Today was there early
was there when the call came in
Your call
His call
They share a long look
106
No
There's no way
There's no way you could have
Goodwin just smiles
() How
The Source Code was a parallel world
You told me so
It's hermetically sealed
Nothing did on that train would have any effect on this reality
You were on the train
was not
But
We didn't know if any bleed- throughs could occur
The implications would be staggering
That's why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events
You're saying  could have saved those people
No
Not in our world
The time currents are too strong
But minor alterations, here and there, a phone call, say, those might slip through
We didn't know for sure
But you proved it
Colter is thunderstruck
Unable to grasp it
've been thinking about the things you said on that call
As the day passed, the more  understood them
And now,  guess we've caught up to each other
Man
Just when  think understand this
107
() There's not much time
They think 'm re-initializing the system
One last look at her
That's all can give you
If that
They'll nail your ass for this
If  had any feelings, 'd worry about that
But, as you've maintained,  do not
The strange path of their relationship
Ending at last at simple, grudging respect

Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter
The noise gets louder
The capsule begins to shake
Colter touches the monitor
His fingers imparting to the last image of his world a quiet benediction

It is morning again, seventeen minutes before the destruction
He's back in the navy blazer
The slacks
The commuters, caught up in their individual concerns, ignore Colter
But he looks on them with an appreciation approaching joy
For a moment he just sits there
Simply being alive in this world
Attuned to the motion of the train
The sun on his face
And across from him, oblivious, working away on her sketch pad, is Christina

The technician hesitates

Rutledge sits down at the controls

Rutledge gives a dismissive snort
And yet he pauses
And why not

We've never interrupted Source Code in mid run
We'd have to literally pull the plug
It could damage the processors
Let it finish, then
No harm in that,  guess

As for Goodwin, he'll never make it off this base
Rutledge picks up a phone

Rutledge considers

The train begins to
(
) Now approaching Newark Station
Newark Station, next stop
The Computer Engineer begins to wake up
As he does, Colter passes by, deftly slipping the borrowed cell phone back into the engineer's hand without being noticed
Derek packs up his things
We see him hide his wallet into a gap in the seat cushions and get up
111
The College Kid, also getting up, notices Derek's wallet, picks it up and hurries after him
Hey, you dropped this
Wow
Thanks
Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet
Colter steps aside, allowing them to pass
Allowing it all to happen
The station slides into view
No one on the platform

- Rutledge runs up to a locked door and swipes his access card through the scanner
It comes up

He tries again

The door stays

Unlike before, the doors stay shut for    than usual
Derek waits quietly at the doors
Finally they open
Derek steps out onto the platform, together with the Old Man, the College Kid and Guzman

Colter remains on board, standing in the exit area, watching
As usual, Derek quickly flips his wallet onto the next car and starts toward the station house
Guzman is ahead of him, already pushing open the doors to the station
All is quiet
Perhaps too quiet
Derek approaches the station and sees 112

Derek's jaw tightens
He changes course, heading instead for an outdoor stairwell
Coming  the stairs, however, are more
Wheeling around, Derek heads the other way
Walking faster, but keeping his head
Not running, not panicking
The train, oddly, is still sitting there
As he nears the other end of the platform, appear from behind columns, cutting off his escape
The police are coming from all sides, converging on the platform
Yet no one panics
No one runs
Finally -- ( ) Derek Frost
Derek goes to get back on the train

Through the closed doors, Derek looks in at Colter, still on the train
They stare at one another through the window

Passengers watch at the windows, mesmerized

) Once again, please return to your seats, ladies and gentlemen
No way
No one's moving from the windows
Except for Colter, who stands off by himself
The first look of satisfaction we've ever seen on his face

- An  is going off
At a locked door, an Air Force is in the process of disabling the key pad

He is shaken but nevertheless going forward

No
People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and complaining
Christina accosts a passing transit employee
What now
How do we get to work
You guys have some busses or something
The transit employee ignores her and walks away
Hey

She stands there in exasperation
This whole thing has been designed to thwart her
Nearby, Colter sits on a bench
Ain't life grand
Looking over, she notices him
Yeah
Now 'm going get fired for being late
Maybe that's a good thing
She gives him a sharp look

Saved them all

Christina stands there, arms crossed, scowling at the parking lot

That train was taking you to a place you didn't want to be
But then you got off
And maybe that's a sign

Colter watches her, a quiet ache inside
Maybe some people don't want to be saved

The MPs are only seconds from getting inside
Goodman moves towards the life support equipment
As he does, we glimpse a horrifying sight: the upper half of Colter's body -- his real body -- inside a sterile tent of transparent plastic
His skull has been removed
massive apparatus has been infused directly onto his brain
Goodwin takes a long, last look

She crosses her arms archly
You can't just expect someone to change her life just like that
At the very least
you'd have to buy that person coffee and explain your reasons
She waits for his response
Uneasy at putting herself out there

He has only time enough for a final look of reassurance
Maybe some other time

Colter is standing there
Still here
Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at
He looks all around
Trees stirring in the breeze

Colter turns to her
How can this be
He's afraid to even speak
As if that alone could break the enchantment
But the world is here
It goes on
That's all he knows
Finally he swallows
Finding his voice
You're right
The least  can do is buy you coffee
This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it
Okay, well, come on then
Walking forward, he joins her
The two of them disappear down the tunnel
