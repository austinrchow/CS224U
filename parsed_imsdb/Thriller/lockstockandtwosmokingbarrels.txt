Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels By Guy Ritchie - This whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, tapping fingers and mouths
We open on a bright  pair of eyes
One is bruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their clarity
Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three cards and these you can't change
If you don't look at your cards you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake
Three of any kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty- five to one
Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and finally whatever the highest card you are holding
There are some tell- tale signs that are valuable;  am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, not make one
So you want to play
: What have you got
We cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned over: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed
That's a good hand
flush beats my pair
What about you
* Cut from completed film
Another pair of excited eyes widen to the question
We see more cards: a run is revealed
And here's me trying to explain the game to you
Hustlers, you're all hustlers
We cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up
You got some real money
:
: Ed scoops up a large pile of money
Odds chaps, you gotta remember the odds
There
a loud slam of a door
We cut to a wide shot of a policeman who has just entered
It is then revealed that two of the three players are also policemen
They stand to attention, red faced with embarrassment
hope  am not interrupting
Comfortable, Edward
haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can feel a case of the flu coming on and
(interrupts) All right, all right, don't think  wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before  do,  need to know what's going on, son
If you think you're in the dark,  am in a black hole, blindfolded
We pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in the inside of a shotgun
The barrels recede further, then `boom
' are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters
We wait for a while, as the barrels reappear through
the smoke
We then see one smoking barrel; 'boom
' the other is let off: joins the sentence
] (] - We open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery on a street corner
crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming volume at which he is advertising his wares
See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny- by-the-gas-light
If you can't see value here today you're not up here shopping, you're up here shoplifting
Take a bag, take a bag
took a bag,  took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten pounds  can tell ya
Tell me if  am going too cheap
Not ninety, not eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten pounds
Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box
The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you here today  would make more money with me measuring tape
well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd waving money
It seems he can't wait to get rid of it
Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if  ever heard one
Ten pounds you say
'll have five
Certainly sir
'll just wrap
Changing his attention
Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that
tourist spectator, rather than a buyer, has been
put on the spot
She fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of the crowd, of which she is now the focus
She passes her money like it's contaminated
Others follow suit
Buy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been paid for
This really stokes the fire
The money can't come fast enough
Just as business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first enthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first pretended
Bacon
Bacon's expression changes dramatically
series of crash zooms between Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal there is a problem
They're off:  and  run like they have done this before
They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze
(voice-over) Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz
(voice-over) The reason he is called  is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them
But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on
We cut to a shot of Ed as he lands
He has made good distance
'  - arrives at a grocer's shop
We meet Tom
Tom is talking to Nick the Greek
What are you talking about
am bloody skinny, pal
Of course you are
All right, Ed
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure
All right Tom, what you been eating
Tom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression
Please, both join me in my orifice
'    - They work their way past a maze of boxes
(fingering and admiring one of the boxes) How much did you say it was, Tom
You know how much it is, Nick
And that does include the amp
You know it doesn't include the amp
- Tom and Ed make their way through a busy, well-equipped kitchen
This is obviously a smart and serious establishment
They stop in front of the man whose uniform is covered in blood; he appears to be the head chef
Meet Soap
What have you come as
Cupid stupid
That's the last time  am getting any more fruit off you Tom
Call that fresh
There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit
You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route
~ Never mind that, what about the money
Get your fingers out of my soup
Soap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting
(voice-over) Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour
He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal
(voice-over) He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it
' * Cut from completed film
16 ] Ed looks in bag
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five
Well that depends on how you look at it
can afford it as long as see it again, if that's what you mean
You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon
Tom looks on with suspicion
Who's this fat man, then
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry
'  - hard-looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk
On this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood, poised like a judge's hammer
Harry is obviously in the sex game
Cluttered up in a hazardous way are a selection of dildos, spanking paddles, etc cabinet of fine-looking shotguns is placed behind
We have a split screen involving  and his friends (listening in) and Hatchet with one hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun
You got it all
-
hundred grand
(voice-over) You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters
(voice-over) The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him
Well if you got it, you got it
Now, if you don't mind
The phone is slammed down
(voice-over) When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons
(voice-over) Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart
Cut from completed film
What's this  like, then
The camera spins round to reveal a massive monster of a man sitting opposite Hatchet
Meet Barry the Baptist
(voice-over) Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist
(voice-over) The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet
(voice-over) But he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled and jobs get done
been shaking the knees of a lot of good players
The boy has a rare ability, he seems to make cards transparent, got bluffing dow
(interrupts) All right, all right, so we can say he is good
Better than good, he is a fucking liability
Where did he get a hundred grand
20 He has got some adhesive mates, they have tossed up between them
And  is his dad, and owns the whole property
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot
don't worry, got it under control
Good, you can get this under control now
glossy Christie's brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique hammer-lock shotguns is shoved in Barry's face
It seems Lord Appleton Smythe has run out of money, and these little beauties are up for auction, but  am not paying quarter of a million quid for 'em, if you know what  mean Barry
One of my associates has given me an address and the location of these lovelies
Make sure we get everything from inside the gun cabinet
don't want to know who you use, as long as they are not complete muppets; and don't tell them what they're worth
Changing the subject
'Ere
Hold on, what do you think of these
We are selling hundreds
Holds up one of the spanking paddles
Er, very nice Harry
What's it for
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking
The paddle is brought down hard on the desk: slap
- Meet the Dog
Dog is horrible
He is large and intimidating
Administering pain is Dog's forte
He is also the Guy we cut from the last scene `slap' to the teeing of a golf ball
Wallop
Dog pulls a sadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face
It's a dog eat dog world, lads, and  got bigger teeth than you
We see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but otherwise naked
An orange is stuck in the man's mouth
Dog is standing on another man's chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from where Dog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure
The tied-up man is Gordon
The other is Slick
Gordon nods his head erratically implying that he has reached a decision
(to Plank) think your man is trying to say something
Pause
Perhaps not; maybe  should have another swing just to make sure
Agonised muffled screaming from Gordon
Slick (who has a tee in his mouth) shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into Gordon
Yes, Gordon, is there something you would like to tell us
The orange is removed from Gordon's mouth
(rushing to get the words out) In the kitchen, under the floor
(interrupts) Shut it, you idiot
Dog swings the golf club round Slick's jaw, knocking him unconscious
You were saying
It's in the karzi, pull the fishing wire under the seat
Jesus, for god's sake let me down
Oh, Dog
think you want to have a look at this
Plank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash
Gordon starts to scream
Dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it across the room
Thunk
Silence follows
Plank grimaces
Oh, Dog
'  - Ed, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house
As they get out they pass Plank and John who have also just parked
They ignore each other, and go to their separate doors
'  - places a pile of money on a table
The rest are eating, Tom keeps looking at his plate distastefully
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound
You don't need to count it
still will, if you don't mind
(eating) So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested
That's going on previous experiences
That's going on optimism
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not
Tom is definitely not overweight, quite the opposite in fact
He examines himself to see if something has developed
Fat
Who are you calling fat
What are all these fat jokes about
The light switch above Tom's head lets out a few sparks causing him to cower in a sharp defensive action
Jesus
It's good in here, ain't it
Trains overhead, walls exploding
Why the hell did you move in
Because it's cheap like a budgie
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know
beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall
What do you mean
He means they're thieving dogs
mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping off unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs
opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips
The noise from next door immediately gets louder
Not exactly thick, these walls
(off) No you prat, that's for me
'  - Dog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his lads
How many times do  have to explain this to you, Plank
You find a job worth doing and you will find your share improving
Now do you have a problem with that
He obviously doesn't
'  - Tom raises his eyebrows and frowns to Bacon
' /SOLARiUM - Meet Big Chris and Little Chris (twelve years old)
How long has he been in there, son
About twenty minutes
Is he on his own
Just carrying a bag
Let's have a look, shall we
/ - Son, have a look under that one
Little Chris looks under one of the sunbeds
It's not him, Dad
Try that one
Little Chris returns from a peek and nods in confirmation
Sleeping like a baby
Big Chris then approaches and raises the sunbed
This is one of those high-powered numbers, isn't it
John 'Driscoll's eyes widen; Chris slams down the sunbed on top of him as hard as he can
Got some bad news for you, John
' What the fu-
Big Chris slams down the sunbed on top of John
Mind your language in front of my boy
' Jesus Christ
Big Chris repeats the earlier treatment twice more
That includes blasphemy as well
Now tell me, John
'' Tell you what, Chris
man opens the sunbed mom door
say, hold on
say shut it
You what
He said shut it
Chris pulls a mean face; the door is closed
] Tell me John, how you can concentrate on improving a lovely tan, and it is a lovely tan by the way, when you have more pressing priorities at hand
' Tell Harry
Bang as sunbed comes down again
Did  say speak
And it's Mr Harry to you
Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully
You may speak
' 'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days
have been busy, and  am nearly there
Son, have a look in his locker
' No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there
* Cut from completed film
30 Yeah, all right
Big Chris lifts it, then smashes it down again
Now, you want me to lift it up again
Little Chris pipes up
Obviously familiar with counting money he has flown through it
He's not poor
Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his wallet
Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in your pocket
The expression on Big Chris's face changes
Oi
Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't
Sorry, Dad
Right, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son
You can go home in a plastic bag tonight, John
You owe what you owe arid before this tan has faded, you want to have paid
Chris punches John unconscious and turns the time dial up
'  - 's bar is an impressive sort of uptown-downtown establishment with pretty girls serving a laddish clientele
The boys are propped up at the bar, looking straight ahead in silence
They look nervous
The silence is broken by Ed
32 am going to the john
He walks off
What you telling us for
The only thing  care about is whether you get your rest in
Tom, you're all heart
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests
(the bar owner and Ed's father) All right lads
How's things
How's it going, Soap
Cooking all right
Where's that son of mine
Each time a question is asked the lads try to answer but are just left with their mouths open, which remain open as a gorgeous girl walks through the bar (Daisy)
'   - We cut to a small, humid, artificially lit, illegal forest being cultivated for profit
Someone is smoking a joint and raising his eyebrows at his friend
These two characters are  and Charles; they have got hair down to their shoulders, small try-hard goatees and science-lab coats, with nothing much underneath
(coughing) This gear is getting heavier you know, Charles
got a suspicion we should have been rocket scientists, or Noble Peace Prize winners or something
horn blows (the door bell)
Who the hell is that
'  - The door opens to reveal Willy
Under each arm is a large bag of fertilizer
Give me a hand Charlie,  could break sweat at any second
voice comes from behind them
At the top of the stairs stands Winston
He slowly starts to walk down
Charles, why have we got this cage
Pause
Charlie shrugs
Er, for security
That's right, for security
So tell me, Charles, what's the point in having it if we don't fucking use it
Well, because it's Willy and Willy lives here
Yes Charlie, but you didn't know it was Willy, did you
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as  say and keep the fucking cage locked
Pause as the two in the door look slightly pissed off at being shouted at
Winston sighs and looks at what Willy is carrying
What are you carrying, Willy
Er, fertilizer
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer
Alarm bells are ringing, Willy
We need fertilizer, Winston
We also need a fucking money counter, William
We have to get the money out by Thursday and 'll be buggered if  am counting it
and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle
What do you mean
mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what  mean, Willy
Winston turns on his heels and walks off
35 '  - Ed returns to the bar to find Tom, Soap and looking in disbelief
(pointing to watch) What the hell are you doing here
Why, what's up
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse
game of cards and Hatchet Harry
You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy
Ed grimaces as his father approaches
He has overheard this last statement
You playing cards tonight with Harry
(pauses) Don't be silly Dad,  wouldn't have anything to do with that
'  - We calm down for a while
cool track is playing
Ed is now smartly dressed, sitting in an armchair
We have a close-up of his face
He is motionless, eyes closed; he looks asleep
The camera slowly tracks down his body We reach a single hand; he is cutting the pack skilfully and faultlessly; he is very much awake
There is a knock on his door
His eyes open
- Near-naked girls are gyrating against blue poles, which keep distracting these men's attention
Meet the two Scousers - Gary and Dean
The Scousers are in their late twenties, one big, one small
Gary (the smaller) sports a large demi-perm
They bear strong Liverpudlian accents
They are meeting Barry (Hatchet's man)
Shotguns
What, like guns that fire shot
Oh, you must be the brains then
That's right, guns that fire shot
Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet
There will be a load of guns, that's all  want
'll pay you when you deliver
Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours
(sarcastically) Oh, thanks very much
And there had better be something there for us
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there
Like what
Like antiques
Antiques
What the fuck do we know about antiques
We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple
So stop fucking moaning and rob the place
So who's the Guv
Who we doing this for
You're doing it for me is all you need to know
You only know that because you need to know
see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it
Careful, remember who's giving you this job
bit of confused eye-rolling goes on
Barry eventually looks at his watch
am off, it's all yours now
Call me when you're done
As he leaves, the two Scousers eye him distastefully
(to Dean) hate these Southern shites
(on his way out, whispering to himself) Fucking Northern monkeys
- and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their appearance
They are met by a doorman
Invitations
Invitations
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it
Will that do
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door
Samoan Jo's
Yon mean the pub
Hold on
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and do mean no one
- enters the boxing gym on his own, and raises his eyebrows at the thought of climbing into the ring
Everybody else is sitting down counting their money and converting it to chips
Ed takes the only empty chair and has a quick look around, particularly behind
Evening Frazer, Phil, Don
This is a bit dramatic, isn't it
Is it supposed to be symbolic
40 / All right Ed
Apparently it's for security
would have brought my gloves if  had known
You must be Eddy
's son
Yup, you must be Harry
Sorry,  didn't know your father
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that
There is an attractive blonde croupier shuffling the cards Evening Tanya, it has been a while
' - As the boys walk in to Samoan Jo's, a man comes tearing out of the door covered in flames followed by his friends trying to put the flames out
The lads look on in mild shock
heard this place was rough
- The Scousers make their way to the front door and unravel their lock- picking kit
' 42 Jo's - What sort of a pub is this then
Samoan one
Anything else
(receiving a monstrous, leafy cocktail) What's that
cocktail, you asked for a cocktail
No,  asked you to give me a refreshing drink
wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that
You want a pint, go to the pub
thought this was a pub
It's a Samoan pub
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the  down
You ask him if you like, but  would leave him to it if  was you
looks at Rory Breaker, the man watching the
Excuse me, could you turn the  down
No
He takes a swig of whatever he is drinking and frowns at Bacon frowns back, then Soap interrupts
This is the English-Brazil game, isn't it
- This is three card brag, gentlemen
That means that three threes is the highest, then three aces and then running down accordingly; then it's a running flush, a run, a flush, then a pair: An open man can't see a blind man, and it will cost you twice the anti to see your opponent
Don't fuck around, fellas; you all know the rules and you know  won't stand for it
What sort of shirt is that then, Ed
'Three hundred open
The type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top, Frazer
One hundred and fifty blind
Three hundred and fifty open
Fold
* Cut from completed film
Three hundred and fifty open
You're the only fella in London who wears shirts like that
Three hundred and fifty open
No Frazer, it's just 'm the only classy fella you have had the pleasure of seeing in London
One hundred and seventy-five blind
Four hundred open
Four hundred open
Eight hundred
Like that, do ya, son
When my knees stop knocking 'll live with it
Four hundred blind
- Barry, who is sitting among sweaty towels, takes out a four-inch monitor and switches it on, and hey presto we can see the card table
The camera is placed behind Ed in one of the four posts
Barry zooms in, pauses on the back of Ed's head, gets his focus and jibs down to view his cards, pauses and re focuses, because Ed is playing blind
He hasn't raised them: there is nothing Barry can do
We cut to Barry's other hand
He is pressing a button on a remote control
We cut straight to Harry's leg which is receiving the pulse
46 - Listen ladies, this is cards
Men play cards, you want to talk soft you should be at the fucking hairdressers, so shut up and play
(dramatic pause) fold
Two thousand open
One thousand blind
Two thousand open
Deep end, eh
Fold
Two thousand blind
You what
There is a pause as Don examines Ed's brow looking for a trace of nerves
Two grand
You're still blind
You have been eating too much English beef, mate; honkers, mad
Well, you going to play
Cut from completed film
Fucking right  am going to play
Three thousand, there
Four thousand to an open man, you know that
We can feel the confidence emanating from Eddy
Don continues to search Ed's forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture, but it's as dry as a desert disco
Donald, do you know how to play this game
The reason  put in half the anti is because  don't know what  have got
Now play, or fold
Silence
-
Don is thrown out on to the street, screaming and cursing
- The Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large house
Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right
All right, Kenny
Dean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste
He has a stocking pulled over only half his face
sexy thigh grip is replicating an artificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done
(Lovingly rearranging his hair) If you think  am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny
- Music starts
We cut to a montage of Ed, Hatchet and Barry at work
Ed must be about 250,000 up but the game is getting out hand and pieces of paper are being signed; IOUs
- Dean returns down a corridor carrying an armful of rifles and enters a large bedroom
There are a couple of toffs (English aristocrats) tied up in bed
The old man has bits of tissue between is toes which Gary has seen fit to light, in order to extract information
Briefly meet Lord and Lady Appleton Smythe Winston and Daisy's parents)
What are you doing, Kenny
Gary is on the point of lighting another piece of tissue
Finding out where he keeps the money
48 49 Kenny, you twat, does it look like these people have got any money
They can't even afford new furniture
We've got the guns; now if you don't mind
At that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun cartridge
The ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance
He is holding an equally ancient pair of hammer-lock guns (the ones from the catalogue) which he has obviously got little control of
The recoil knocks the butler clear off his feet
The second shot hits the ceiling covering the old boy in plaster
We cut to a  of the butler on his back
We see Dean looking down
You want to be more careful, old fella
You very nearly took my man's head clean off with that
You all right, Kenny
We cut to a shaking shell-shocked Gary, mouth agape
The gun shot has torn through the centre of Gary's bouffant hairdo leaving him with a pair of smoking Mickey Mouse ears
Shock prevents him from answering
Kenny
- Ten grand blind
We see Hatchet feeling his leg; he looks shifty - Barry zooms in again; he can see nothing
Twenty thousand open
looks at his cards: he has a running flush
Twenty thousand open
- Barrv sighs with relief and types in the relevant information
- Having received this information Hatchet pauses, then
'll fold
We hear lots of oohs and aahs
frowns slightly This is odd play
Rather than looking happy he has a discrete glance over his shoulder; satisfied that nothing can be amiss, he collects his money
Don't go spending, that all at once, boy
- Barry's phone rings
He jumps in shock and fishes around to find it
What
50 ~ 51 - The Scousers reply; Gary is still unable to speak due to his shotgun experience
thought you said no staff, Bazza
You get the guns
You should see what they did to poor Gary
Gary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state
He obviously doesn't know what day of the week it is
Gary, get back into the van
Barry frowns down the telephone
Yeah, yeah, we got 'em
Good
'll speak to you later
Barry clicks the phone off
Dean looks at Gary and raises his voice as if speaking to a deaf person
Gary, Gary, if you can hear me,  think we better get you back in the van now,
Dean takes his arm and guides him back into the van
- Stakes have increased dramatically
There is a pause as Frazer looks at his cards
Twenty thousand open
My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going on here
fold
Got some cards there, boy
Thirty thousand
Back to you already Eddy
Hatchet looks impatiently at the door
Fifty grand
Hatchet scours Ed's forehead
It is still dry
Eighty grand
- Barry, who is trying as hard as he can to see Ed's cards, frustratedly zooms in and out; eventually Ed raises them just enough; Barry jibs, hey bingo he sees Ed's cards
Ed's got nothing but a pair of sixes
Barry excitedly starts tapping away
53 - One hundred grand
Hold on fellas,  know
(interrupts j know you're not in, which means nobody cares what you know
Two hundred and fifty
Hatchet and  minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a nervous droplet to appear
Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills frame
Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow Eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the pause is broken
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred
Yes
and is there something else you want to say As you know, this puts us in an awkward position
don't have enough to continue
Pause
We will have to see both your cards if no one loans  the money to continue
It's a loan or we see both your cards
Silence follows
lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary dirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining company
It doesn't look
(interrupts) will
You will what
will loan you the money
Silence
The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a second, then unattaches itself
Very slowly it falls
We follow its long silent journey
Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's cards
It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this worrying news
think  would rather just turn them over
am not interested in what you would rather;  want to keep going am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow
need two hundred and fifty grand
No, you need five hundred grand to see me
Ed's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat
That's if  want to see you
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha
The pause is painful
55 You can still fold
doesn't like the sound of this
There is sympathy in her voice
Harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier pleads with Eddy
'll see ya
For half a million
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid
And still got a sense of humour
That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold
(Pause) , before  loan you this,  expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal
That's Sunday,
These last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours)
He is committed, but has now left the world of the conscious
Hatchet turns over the first card; it's a seven ushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three; then the third: it's a four
There is an anti-climatic silence
After a loud pause
Is that it
* Cut from completed film
56 He was bluffing
Hatchet looks content and rather nonchalant
Let's see your fucking cards
Nobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on expectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh
They contract to the size of pinheads
His world has changed for ever
(voice-over) knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted with a grin compared to this
Ten minutes earlier,  was two hundred thousand pounds richer; now  owed half a million
Harry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear
know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so 'll give you all a week to find it
After that, 'll take a finger off each of you and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; and when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what
Ed gets up
We stumble with him in slow motion
He is hardly able to stand
He wobbles over to the door
Harry continues to talk over the top
Business is business, and  am good at making mine work
like your dad's bar, 's, so don't get clever or lethargic
If you can't pay in a week, a few fingers and a bar for starters
Ed stumbles out of the door, doubles up and vomits all over the f door
' - Ed has made his way into the bar
All his friends have fallen asleep
One of Bacon's eyes opens to see Ed cleaning himself up
This doesn't look good
The others wake on this statement
We cut between the lads and their frozen reaction
(voice-over) then explained the unfortunate position we were in
Harry was going to start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was no way  could raise that kind of money on my own
Harry saw it as their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table hate to admit it but  could have kissed the old bastard for that
If said  wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie
Listen,  wish he would let me settle it on my own
Tom drops his drink and rushes Eddy
58 'll kill him
(intercepts Tom) Stop fucking around, Tom, and think
What are we going to do
What's all the fuss about Harry
Why don't we just boycott the payment
They all look at Soap like he is mad
''  - (voice-over) Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry
Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry
It was rumoured that he was on the take
Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation
Smithy didn't do a very good job
Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock
He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go
Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe
'll think of something, don't worry
- Ed, who looks like he is close to suicide, has developed a two-day stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets
He stumbles along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket
He stops outside 's, looks at the entrance and decides not to go in
60 '   -  The ridiculous door-bell horn blows
Who the hell's that
It's only twelve
Use that cage, that's what it's there for
(off) Who is it
(off) Plank, open up
This is done without the use of the steel-caged security door
This weed is getting quite a reputation, you know, fellas
Gloria remains motionless in her chair
Plank waves his hand about in a sort of `how you doing' way to everyone and goes to take a seat
At the last minute, poised like he is sitting on a potty he realizes he is about to sit on this girl
Jesus
Never saw you there
Hello, love
Enjoying yourself
Gloria doesn't respond
Plank waves his hand over her face
Still no response
Plank looks around for some acknowledgement
Is she, er, compus
(doesn't look up) What do you think
Plank takes a close look at the girl
61 Plank jumps back, completely taken by surprise, knocking over a pedestal of shoe boxes stacked up against a wall, full of fifty-pound notes
Fuck me
Charles, pissed off, looks at William like it's his fault
Fod God's sake
Clean that up, Charles
Sod you, you clean it up
Sorry fellas, but that stupid cow
Never mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way
Anyway, how much do you want
(trying to look like the money hasn't had an impact on him) am after a half weight
That's one and a half thousand
Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out the gear, Charlie
Any chance of seeing your money
'   - Cut to Bacon, Soap and Tom sitting and talking in the back of 's bar
They don't look a lot better than Ed
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand
would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse
The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, it won't win
So where is Ed with all the bright ideas
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard
It's hit us all hard
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar
Tom, who has not really been listening, suddenly interrupts
Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club
You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and greatest in sexual technology
Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks
These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients
They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five
You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear
Now this is the clever bit
Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out
Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques
There is a long pause while  considers this
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return
Probably no longer than four weeks
month
So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six no, five days
Well, it's still a good idea
Listen to this one
'  - We see the back of a head
So do you know these geezers well
Well enough
have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years
What they like then
Poofs
Nothing heavy, four public school guys
Soft as shite
'  - Soap is finishing off his suggestion for raising money
And you keep all the money' Pause
and Tom frown at Soap
have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes Bacon's sound inspired
'  - Ed fumbles with his keys at his front door
He enters his house in a sort of zombie state, takes off his jacket and opens the cupboard doors
He hangs his coat up (it promptly falls off" the hanger) and he collapses in a pile on the floor
The cupboard doors now being open, he can clearly hear next door's discussion
We track in very slowly on Ed
They ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day, talking bollocks
They're just good at growing weed, that's all, and business has got bigger than what they can keep up with
'  - If you're so fucking clever why don't you come up with a suggestion
am thinking,  am thinking
'  - (off) Listen, they can't be all stupid if they got a container load of cash sitting in shoe boxes, a skip-load of Class  gear and you don't think there is anybody sensible involved
We reach the end of our track
Ed's head is on a pitiful angle in full close-up
It straightens and his dark eyes widen immediately on this news
'  - What about security
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it
What do you mean, never
Well what have they got it for, then
must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious
Everybody who goes there are toffs
They're all into that karma crap: `If  don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff
Is there no way they can get back to you
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared
They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots
66 ~ 67 '
'  - Barry and Harry are talking
Harry is polishing a shotgun
It is very different in appearance to the hammer-locks
Is Big Chris on his way
Should be here any minute
think you're making a mistake, Harry
That's a lot of money for Chris to be running after
wouldn't trust him to bring it back here
Hatchet's speech is laced with cut-aways of Big Chris in action, and on the ascent (with Little Chris) of Hatchet's stairs
'  - (voice-over) What do you know about Chris, eh
You put Big Chris on a job and he will make sure it gets done, no matter what's in his way
His dad used to collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy will after he has gone
It seems that the Almighty himself requested them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old Nick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment
But he has never nicked a picker in his life
Straight as an arrow and as strong as the bow that fired it
If you dropped your tenner he would search till he found ya
the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a runaway train, and he hits twice as hard
Heaven protect anyone who touches that boy, not that the boy needs protecting
We see Big Chris walking up the stairs
He reaches the top and knocks on the door
'  - Big Chris is sitting in front of Hatchet, Barry behind Chris
Want a drink
Hello son, would you like a lolly
Piss off you nonce
Oi, watch it
No thanks Harry, we are both all right
Nice shooter
Like it
One of a pair, Holland and Holland
Here, you want to hold it
Nah, not my thing, thank you, Harry
Business good
imagine that's what  am here for
Harry leans the gun against the side of the desk and takes a seat, does a breast-stroke movement to clear his desk of all the sexual debris, takes a big breath of air and begins
want you to forget about any other debts at the moment; there are fresher fish to fry
Go on
It's a bit of a priority
Four young fellas who got in deeper than they could handle; they owe me half a million pounds
68 ~ 69 How much
'  - Tom, and Soap are sitting in front of Ed who looks as though he is about to launch in to a speech
What's the flapping about
You told the old man yet hope  won't need to
got a plan
So listen carefully
'   - Look, he set us up
That means he put money into us, which means he expects money out of us
You don't need to be an economist to work that out
He might think we smoke a lot and burn a bit of profit, but he can't have any idea about the hard currency we've accumulated
We can just slice it off the top
You guys, you've got to realise who this chap is
He's a fucking lunatic
If he gets the slightest inkling that we are not throwing straight dice, you - and fuck it, me - are going to know what the sharp side of a kebab knife feels like
* Come on, we are in this for the cash however it comes
The phone rings
Winston picks it up
* Cut from completed film
70 Hello
(she is upset) Winston
Yeah
It's Daisy
know who it is
What's the problem
'  - The situation has been explained
There are thoughtful frowns on all foreheads
There is a pause
Well, what do you want us to do about it
Hit the fuckers
Pause while this is digested
know it sounds a bit heavy, but it's not like you are doing anything illegal
don't know how you've reached that conclusion
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they
71 How heavy are the fellas anyway
They don't look all that
Hitler didn't look all that
All right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the silver spoon
If you can think of another way to get out, let me know
It's not like we've got all the time in the world either
Dig
Silence falls over them
] am game
Me too
S0AP Oh, god
Well, we hit them as soon as they come back
We'll be waiting and prepared for them
Pause as Ed's voice drops a little
And they are armed
What was that, armed
What do you mean, armed
Armed with what
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster
What do you think they will be armed with
Guns, you tit
Guns
You never said anything about guns
minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer
thought about that and
And what exactly
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them
Carrying them
They could all be carrying them for what we know
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job
So  assume he will still be carrying when he comes back from the job
Oh, you assume, do ya
What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets
72 ~ 73 Soap, if you got a better idea to get five hundred grand in the next few days you let us know
In the meantime, Tom, speak to Nick the Bubble about moving the weed
'  - Tom and Nick are stuck away in a corner playing on a fruit machine
Weed
Not normal weed
This is some fucked-up skunk class
can't think let alone move shit
Doesn't sound very good to me
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses
You'll need samples, Tom
No can do
Where's that
place near Katmandu
Meet me half way, mate
Listen, it's all completely chicken soup
It's what
Kosher as Christmas (rolls his eyes) Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom
Never mind that now
also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns
Bloody hell, Tom
This is a bit heavy
This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think  am
think you're Nick the Greek
'  - There's a cacophony of seventies funk and football filling the room
We meet Rory Breaker
Rory is a very well-dressed cool-looking black dude
He is in his own way sophisticated, considering what he does for a living
His help, however, are less well-informed
Rory has Nick the Greek in front of him
Nick,  don't have anything to do with weed, normally, but if it is what he says it is, 'll give him three and a half thousand a key, that's if it is what he says it is
don't want to see it after a sample,  don't want to touch it after a sample
'll leave you in the capable hands of Nathan here
He will work out the details, but let me get this straight
If the milk turns out to be sour,  ain't the kind of pussy who will drink it
Know what  mean
74 ~ 75 - The Scousers are handing over all the shotguns from their previous job to Barry and assistant
Dean has got a complicated hair arrangement to disguise his accident with the butler
Barry raises his eyebrows at this new look
Is your hair supposed to look like that, then
Gary ignores this question
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars
Where're the others
Barry is looking with same concern for the hammer-lock Purdeys
There are no others
Now, stop fucking around
The others, the old ones
don't know what you mean
(dead serious) There were two old guns there; where are they
Not in the cabinet there wasn't
There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em
77 Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish
They were
(interrupts) am not fucking interested
Shouting
If you don't want to end up counting the fingers that you haven't got, or sharing a bed with the anti-Christ,  suggest you get those guns, quick
- We are facing Nick's large behind, builder's cleavage poking out of the top of his trousers
Nick is unwrapping two long implements from a sheet: the hammer-lock Purdeys
Jesus, if  pick them up, will they stay in one piece
Where did you get them from
got contacts
Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me 'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do
Either way you still get the desired effect
They look nice,  agree
but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they
might get laughed at
How much do you want for these muskets
Seven hundred each
78 What's that, a pound for every year they have been around
know they're antiques, but  ain't paying antique prices
Pause
And they're a bit long, aren't they
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays
Range
don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either
want to look fucking mean
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary
All right, let's forget about them for the time being
What about your weed man
Rory Breaker is standing by
You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy
'  - We are looking directly at 's shell-shocked face
He gently lays down an empty glass on the bar
understand if this has come as a bit of a shock, but 'll tell you how this can be resolved by the good father
* Big Chris in completed film
Pause
The camera spins round to reveal Hatchet and Barry the Baptist
Go on
like your bar
Yes
want your bar
And
Do you want me to draw a picture
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink
This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it
What, and  care
Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life
And you do have a reputation, so 'll choose my words carefully
But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry
Barry pulls a kind of mock-scared face and clutches his heart
80 Oh, careful , you'll give Barry a heart-attack
We crash-zoom again into Harry's eyes to see the pupils contract
It's time to look mean
'll put that down to shock, but only once, only once can or will  let you get away with that
Your son's still got three days to find half a million, but make up your mind which one you prefer: your son, or your bar
We have a slow-motion close-up of the drink being slammed down, proving a point
'  - has rigged up an amplifier to the hole in the cupboard along with a ridiculous amount of recording equipment
The house lights still flicker on and off
We start the first part of the conversation looking at Bacon, who has his headphones on
We cut to Dog halfway through the second sentence
'  - There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick
It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy
'  - has a kettle next to where he is sitting
It steams away quite happily but a worrying noise starts to come from the plug socket prepares himself
-
He disappears into black
'  - They react to the
Dog looks at the wall with suspicion, misses a beat, then continues
What's that idiot doing next door
(Points at Paul) We use your van
It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog
Plank is going up first
There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank
No
And it better bloody not be
Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in
We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em
can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy
When the job is done we'll come straight back here
It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother
Everybody savvy
Yup
Right, tomorrow, eight o'clock we'll do it
Apparently these stags don't get out of bed till midday, lowest ebb and all that, and that's how  like it
'  - is now lit by candle
Jesus
(off) So no messing around tonight
We leave eight a
m
,
Yes
It's happening tomorrow morning
Get back here now
'  - (staggering) Where did you get those from, a museum
Nick the Greek
How much did you part with
Seven hundred for the pair
Drachmas,  hope
would feel safer with a chicken drumstick
They could do more harm than good
Jesus, Tom, do they work
dunno, but they look nice
rather like ' em
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look
Ladies, if you don't mind, back to a more important issue
We've only got two real guns
apparently that's what they are
We find a good place to hide next door
When it sounds like the right time, we jack in the box, look nasty and stuff, cocoon them in gaffer tape, then we nick their van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back here
As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last thing they'll expect
If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them around a bit  am sure it won't do any harm
bit of pain never hurt any one (thinking about it) if you know what  mean
Also,  think knives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones that look like they could skin a crocodile
Knives are good because they don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to use them
That'll shit 'em up and make us look like pros
There is a pause as they look at Soap with suspicion
Is there something we should know about you, Soap
am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past
'  - Ed and Bacon, etc, are all mounted up on top of one another looking out a crack in the curtain
They are observing Dog's party en route to work
They are dressed as kebab shop assistants
Where the fuck are they going
To butcher a sheep
thought this was a robbery
Where did they get those outfits from
Haven't we got some like that, Tom
Well, not exactly like that
'  () - Dog and troop load up
'   - Cut to Sloanes
They are up and unusually awake
Today is the day to move the money so they are comparatively alert
There is lots of activity
You fucking jelly-heads, move it
You have been up for two hours, you should have got somewhere by now
The gear and the money has got to be out of here before twelve
The horn blasts
Who's that
, don't you dare open the door until you use that cage am serious, and find out who it is first
86 '   - (raising his voice for the door) Hello, can  help you
All right, it's Plank
Is Willie there
No, 'm afraid he's not
He's out at the moment
Well, perhaps you can help
Well, perhaps  can't, Plank, if you know what  mean
Look, could you just open the door so  could talk without shouting
can't help you, Plank
think you'll find it is in your interest
'   - Hold on
(Whispering inside
) Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest
87 don't care if it's King fucking Kong, he is not coming in here, not today
Hold on: we are in business and correct me if  am wrong, but that is business
Corrected; that's a walking accident that we can do without
Jesus, he's ; he knows only to buy weights now, so we are looking at least a couple of thou; just one last time
What do you think, Winston
Pause
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick
We have work to do
'  - (frustrated) What the fuck is going on
Do you want me to have a look, Dog
No, you silly fucker, stay still
(Whispering) What's going on
Come on,  can't wait out here all day
Starting to get anxious that the whole deal could be off Plank looks down the stairs and waves at Dog as some kind of reassurance
(off) All right, just coming
unlocks the door after getting the cage ready
There's an external door, and then a small corridor before the cage
is inside the cage
Two, or at a push, three people could fit in this space before they would be poking out on the outside world
'  - thought you were going to leave me out there all day
didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank
(taking the piss) Lives and learns doesn't one
Then devastation slaps him hard
Keep the gates locked now, do you
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days
know
(Suddenly turning very nasty whispering
) Now shut it
You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left
(confused and believing it's a joke, until he sees the gun
) What are you doing, Plank
What do you think  am doing
Hold on
What are you doing
Unlock that gate
Oi
said unlock that fucking gate
has found it all too much and has passed out with fear, collapsing on the floor in an awkward contorted position
Plank is desperately trying to find the right key
Things are not going as well as planned
Dog, in the meantime, has decided it's time to start the show '  - Go
Go
Go
Fucking run, you two
They all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into Plank
The keys go flying out of Plank's hands and through the cage
Plank cries with frustration, reaching out with his hand to retrieve them
Dog, finding the gate locked, is none too happy They are also still exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space between the outside door and the inside cage
90 ~ 91 '  - (mesmerized} The fucking gate's shut, you prick
Just hold on,  got the keys
Having clawed them back with the end of his shotgun
(seeing an unconscious man at his feet) What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy
(fumbling and panicking) didn't touch him, he just passed out
'   - , what's going on out there
(Realising) Get the rifle out, Charles
We're being fucked
'   - Get the sodding gate open now, Plank
Plank is busy fumbling about, not really getting anywhere because of the pressure being applied
(trying to convince himself, as much as Dog) It must be this one
Just give me the keys
The gun with which Plank has been entrusted is pointing straight at Dog's groin
Point your gun in there, dick, not at me
Mick has unwrapped his gun from his case
Dog turns and looks amazed at the size of the weapon
What the fuck is that
It's a bren gun
You could have brought something a bit more fucking practical, couldn't ya
Pop
We hear the sound of an air gun pellet hitting the bars
(trying to salvage some credibility) Don't you stags move or 'll kill the lot of ya
(amazed by this stupidity) Who are you going to kill Plank
There's no one there
We hear another pop and Plank gets shot in the neck
This understarulably sends him into a real panic, thinking this is curtains
(gurgle) They shot me
Panic unashamedly exposing itself
Trickles of blood start flowing from in-between Plank's fingers
(unimpressed) Well shoot them
Plank shoots at everything and nothing
Smoke fills the corridor, leaving them in a cloud
bit of coughing goes on, then silence
Jesus Plank, you could have got smokeless cartridges,  can't see a bloody thing
Pop
Another pellet is fired hitting John in the chest
Ah, Jesus, shit, 've been shot
don't fucking believe this
Could everybody stop getting shot
Sit down John, you cock, patch yourself up; it's only a fucking air rifle
Dog is interrupted by an enormously loud blast of machine-gun fire
Dog and the boys panic, cover their ears and hit the floor
After this outburst Dog looks up at Mick and sees he is the culprit
Mick looks down at Dog expecting a congratulatory nod from Dog; he doesn't get it
What the fuck was that
That was the bren gun
94
~ 95 If you use that again, you're a dead man, do you understand
He speaks softly but he is quite shaken
He then raises his voice; he has had enough of all this mincing
Right fellas
He shouts to the Sloanes while dragging the semi-conscious body of  up to use as a shield
Before  go any further  am going to shoot your mate's toes off
No sooner said than done; his toes go
The smoke problem repeats itself and  faints again, but an unfazed Dog continues
Now if you want us to be gone in two minutes, open the fucking gate, now
'   - He'll probably kill us if we do
Well,  will certainly get it if we don't; he's serious
Look what he did to his toes
(off) Right, his leg's going now
All right, all fucking right,  am coming
(Turning and whispering) Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out,
Willie slinks off with a `like what
' look on his face
'  - And all your friends, there's a good lad
There is only three of us here
Do you want me to take his leg off
Where's the fourth
mean it, there is only three of us here
Plank
(gurgle, gurgle) Yeah, one of them's out
, open the gate
No sooner said than done
Dog hits one straight on Winston's forehead with the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs
97 '   - Up boy, up, up
They reach the top of the stairs
Tie 'em up John and, Plank, you come with me
Where's the money
There, in those shoe boxes
Dog opens them
There is nothing in them
If looks could kill Plank would be pushing up daisies
(gun to the head of Winston) Where
Out the back
And the weed
Out the back
Point
With what
Your hands, now
can't,  am tied up
98 Well, well, shake your head or something
All right Plank, get Paul out of the van
This is done on a walky talky
'   - The door opens
Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete
He turns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight into Mick's arm
Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger as he tries to push the barrel to the side
He starts screaming uncontrollably (to Plank) Give us your knife
Dog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to its source
William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand
(the point of the blade resting on William's throat) Enough
Mick, how you doing
How do you think  am doing
He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off
Dog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly packed and stacked
(in doorway visibly shocked Gordon Bennett
What's been going on in here
Shut up, you idiot
You got the bags
Can you get it in
There's a lot here, all right
don't think we will be able to get this all in the van
Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips
'  - traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you
'll only be a minute
You've already been fifteen
Paul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are necessary to despatch this nuisance
He looks down both sides of the street: the coast is clear
Look
Go on, look
At what, exactly
My van is half full
So
So 've just got to put you in, and  am off
Having made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back doors
Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head
The momentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious
Paul has another quick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper into the vehicle
'   - My neck, Dog
(Dog shows no sign of pity) That's the last bag
(Turning to Mick
) How about you
All right
'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit
Mick grabs the machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun
Do it quietly
Gloria, who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and troop, has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising the gravity of the situation
She is kick-started into action by the sure demise of Willie
The machine gun has been placed not too far away from her
She picks it up, and fires it into the already wounded body of Mick, who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat
Gloria, who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself, knew existed, destroys everything she points at
Bodies jump for cover and Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best
Eventually the gun, which seems to have a limitless supply of lead, goes quiet
We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes cautiously
Looks of relief come from everyone, not least the Sloanes
Dog, who is closest, stands, walks straight up to her and punches her on the jaw Gloria is knocked out
What was that
Where did she come from
That's fucking it
Tie her up
We are getting out of here
'  - Eh, bunk us up over the wall
forces one of the windows open
He looks pleased and beckons the others over
They keep in contact with Soap by cellular phones
'  - Everything all right out there, Tom
(on phone) Right as rain
Where the hell are we supposed to hide
Ed looks into an almost empty room in which they are to find cover
He shrugs, and goes to sort himself out a cup of tea
What are you doing, Ed
Do you want one
No  fucking don't
You can't make a cup of tea, Edward
Why not
The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea
And look what happened to that
If you think  am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate
'  - Dog turns to admire a full van
You won't get away with it
Dog turns around and sees the tragic warden
Paul, what's that
That's a traffic warden
(looking straight at Paul) What's he doing in the van
Dog and the others look at the tragic warden mercilessly He was about to call the cozzers
Paul hits him again, sending him back into unconsciousness
We will deal with him later
'  -  Tom is on the mobile phone
They're here
'  - Dog opens his door, enters the front room, dumps his two bags down and is met by a bleeding Plank (who is grunted at) and John, who is rubbing his chest
Dog sighs and turns to get more bags
The action starts
It's hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas
The lads jump out of their positions
Down, down, get fucking down now' This is like d
vu
There is no response as the three of them seem not to believe what's going on
hits Dog with the butt of his gun, establishing who's boss
Dog does down with a thud
Plank hits the floor immediately
'  - Paul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run
He is met by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead pipe
This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged in screaming by Tom
It all went rather smoothly Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth
Keys,  want the keys
'll find you
Of course you will, sweetheart
This one, search this one
Ed finds the keys without any trouble
'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there
'  - There is silence
For a few seconds all we can hear is the noise of their breathing
107 Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it
When the bottle in my arse has contracted 'll let you know
Bacon, see what we got
Let's have a butcher's
Jesus, there's lots of everything
We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a
traffic warden
what
traffic warden
Look, what's this
He holds up the hat
Shit Ed, we've got a traffic warden
Pause
think he's still alive
He's got claret coming out of him somewhere
What did they want with a traffic warden
dunno, but  don't think we need him
Dump him at the lights
'  - It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris
Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and  can't have that now, can , Chris
No Harry, you can't
'  - Dog struggles free and unravels the tape from his head and gets the other three out
Dead
Dead
don't know who they think they could be, for me not to find 'em
Of course 'll find 'em
don't give a flying fucking fish who they think they are
'll kill - fur and feathers, burning wheel South African style, kebab 'em, peel 'em, slice 'em and dice ' em, hang draw and fucking quarter ' em
- Two vans are parked back to back
We see Ed and the boys putting one last trunk into the back of the new van
That's it all done, we are off
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look
Anyway the battle's over and the war is won
Ed passes a handful of grass to Tom
Tom, take this to Nick, and let's get rid of it, quick
'  - Nick has given the weed to Rory for inspection
Lenny has stepped in
It is skunk
and it's as good as it gets
, 'll take it off you; half price
don't think he'll like that
You said three-five a key, that's what he wants and you know that's a good price
It was yesterday  said three and a half grand and today is today, if am not mistaken
Turns back to the
'll take it tomorrow for half price
If he wants to move it quick he'll take it
Now, 've got another game coming up in a minute so if you would be kind enough
Pointing at the door
Nick exits
Lenny, take this to Snow White and the three little chemists; they should have a gander at this
want a proper opinion
110 '  - Lenny and Nathan, Rory's minders, pull up outside the Sloanes' house to have the weed analysed
For the first time it is revealed that Rory Breaker owns the Sloanes
Hold on
What
something's not quite right here
Go in slowly, Nathan
Fuck you funny man, you go first
'   - Shit
Winston is tied up and squirming
For Christ's sake, get us out
'  - Well, not a bad day's work
That takes care of Harry
Pushing a massive pile of notes to one side
What's left over
' Hold on, give us half a chance to count it
What about all the gear
'Ere, have a pull of this
Passes Ed the joint
don't want that horrible shit
Give it to Soap
Can we just lock up and get drunk now, please
'  - We see Winston, Nathan and the torso of Lenny, standing in front of Rory Like naughty schoolchildren
We had the gates up but they stuck a shotgun through
Poor bloody  got shot; it was a right mess
The gravity and reality dawns on Rory
It will cost you more than your life's worth if you jest with me
Some girl took one of 'em out, but he's a bit of a mess
(proudly j We shot one of them in the throat
112 What do you want, a fucking medal
'll shoot you in the fucking throat if  don't get the gear back
He pauses, rubs his forehead and continues, slightly calmer
You shot the one that's in there now
No, another one
This is more like it
So where's he
They took him with them; he was still alive
Well, what did you shoot him with, an air gun
There is an embarrassed pause and a look of `how did you know
' Rory doesn't need an answer and slaps his forehead
We grow weed, we're not mercenaries
You don't say
There is a pause while Rory searches for the right words
The silence is deafening
(stupidly) Who could it be
Where do we start, Rory
Rory looks up amazed
Mr Breaker
Today my name is Mr Breaker
You think_this is a coincidence
Not many, Benny
This white shite steals my goods and then thinks it is a good idea to sell it back to me
They got less brains than you, Lenny
Get Nick cum-bubble round here now if he is stupid enough to still be on this planet
'  - Dog has all his boys round
want you to search the house for bugs
mean  want you to strip it
What is the point in that
Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em
It is too late for you to start thinking John
It is a possibility and that is good enough for me
And after you strip the house,  want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly
want to know who is responsible, otherwise  will hold you responsible
'  - All kinds of characters have made an appearance
game of cards is in motion, the forfeit now being alcohol
Barfly Jack the barman is sitting at the table
They are already on the road to being comfortably comatose
Rory Breaker
114 Yeah,  know Rory
This next section is subtitled
This is to keep everyone, even those familiar with cockney rhyming slang up to speed with the narration, of which even Tom is unsure
As with the police scene earlier this is a voice-over and we cut to the relevant scenes
(voice-over) Rory's got few interests in life; darky music, football, bees and honey and kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist
few nights ago Rory's Roger iron rusted, so he has gone to the battle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game
Nobody is watching the custard so he has turned the channel over
fat man's north opens and he wanders up and turns the Liza over
`Now fuck off and watch it somewhere else
' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to miss the end of the game; so, calm as a coma, he stands and picks up a fire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are ready for action, then he plonks it outside the entrance
He then orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and switches back to his footer
`That's fucking it,' says the man
Rory gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty; he flicks a flaming match into his bird's nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe
Rory, unfazed, turned back to watch his game
The flaming man and his chinos ran outside to extinguish the flames, and Rory cheered on
His team won too, four-nil
'  - After a while Ed sees Daisy making a sneaky sharp exit and tries to pursue her, running out on to the street
Daisy is nowhere to be seen
115 '  - Nick is blissfully ignorant of the situation
He is sitting in front of Rory
Your one saving grace might be your stupidity
(looking quite petrified) Er
Don't fucking er me, Greek boy
How is it that your so-fucking-stupid, soon-to-be-dead friends thought they might be able to steal my gear
And then sell it back to me
Is this a declaration of war
Is this some sort of white cunts' joke that black cunts don't get
'Cos  am not fucking laughing, Nik-ol-as
Er
There are four interests  have, Nick
Football, music, money, and the annihilation of anybody who interferes with that shortlist
know you couldn't have known my position because you're not so fucking stupid that if you did know, you would turn up here scratching your arse, with that `what's going on here' look slapped on your Chevy Chase
But what you do know is where these people live
We look at the white faced Nick
He doesn't open his mouth
The penny has dropped
If you hold anything back, 'll kill you
If you bend the truth, or if think you're bending the truth, 'll kill you
If you forget anything, 'll kill you
In fact, you're going to have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick
hope you understand everything have said
Because if you don't, 'll kill you
Now, Mr Bubble and Squeak
You may now enlighten me
'  - Paul, John, and Plank are lined up like naughty schoolchildren in front of Dog, who is black-eyed and pissed off: So we have a bit of a problem, don't we
Er well, yes we do
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it
You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you
And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you
Dog, we have been up all night
It's no one round here
We have had them all against the wall
If it was a toe rag from the area we would know
Dog starts slapping his troops round their heads
You wouldn't know if it was the next-door fucking neighbours, you prick
You find 'em, you hear
And find 'em quick
Now get out and start looking
Out
Out
Dog Loses his temper and throws Plank across the room
Plank's head breaks effortlessIy through the wall
'  - dust-covered Plank blinks in confusion as he looks on to a heap of recording equipment
'  - Recovering from the night before
Scarface,  have watched Scarface
You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface
That inspires confidence, that does
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling
It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse
would take a pain in the arse for half a million
You would take a pain
the arse full stop
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get
Jesus, would you two stop flirting for one minute
After we pay Hatchet, this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each
Not bad for a day's work,  think you will agree
118 '  - seventies-style split screen
very shaky Nick answers his cartoon telephone
Yeah
'  - That's no way to answer the phone
Is that you, Dean
Sure is
What can  do for you
You know those shotguns  sold ya, well  need 'em back
Not likely  am afraid;  don't think 'll be seeing them again
got the money to pay for 'em
am sure you do, but  don't think you understand;  am not going to see them or the guns again
Gary looks at Dean
119 If we can't get 'em, we can't get 'em
'  -
Barry is on his mobile, moments later
You fucking well have to get 'em
' - We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet
Inside, out-fuckin'-side
don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't
Yeah, Bazza, what
You heard of Harry Lonsdale
Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits
Dean pauses for a while, a look of concern coming over his face
Well this is `James Bond need to know' time
They're his
When you dance with the devil you wait for the song to stop, know what  mean
Hatchet has had enough
He grabs the phone from Barry's hand, waving the infamous fifteen-inch big black cock in the other hand
Hatchet goes on to put the shits up the Scousers
Do you know who  am
am split in two; there is me, and there is my patience, and patience has gone to the hospital; you are not far behind, know what  mean
mean, find ' em, torture 'em, kill 'em, and bring back what belongs to me, because if you don't
you are
bang
in trouble
Hatchet slams the phone down
Dean looks at Gary in horror
Who was that
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry
Jesus,  have heard about him
We're in the spite
They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em
Dean dials Nick immediately
No fucking about, Nick; where can  find those guns
'  - Dog and boys have made a Large hole in the connecting cupboard wall which they have crawled through
Dog is holding a large bag which he has found
Dog,  have found the cash
The stupid bastards
Count it
Shit, Dog, there's a lot
Don't you want to do this next door
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking
Count it out the back
don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in
But
(interrupts) Give it us here, you dozy sod
You hide and get the guns ready
Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em
'  - Rory Breaker is amassing his troops and preparing to go round to Ed's
We are going to do a proper decoration job
want the grey skies of London illuminated;  want that house painted red
Winston here is coming along, see if he can recognize any of 'em, then we bring what's mine back here
Watch out for these fellas; they've got a bit of arsenal and they don't mind using it
Now you know what you're doing, yes
'  - Big Chris and Little Chris are waiting outside
Dog's gang are waiting for Ed's gang inside
Rory's gang are going to Ed's
122 '  - Six heavy-looking black guys are loading their weapons
'  - Dog's gang are also loading their weapons and concealing themselves among the furniture
Dog is counting out the money in the side room and has the two antique hammer-lock shotguns resting on the table in front of him, which were found with the rest of the bounty
'  - Rory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door
The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with gun) prepares to do his worst
'  - There is a loud bang and the front door disappears
In its place is a large black man pointing an even larger machine gun
Nobody seems to be at home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax
long pause follows as both gangs don't quite know what to do
Rory's guys jump over the machine gun to explore further
(under his breath) What the fuck is going on here
Dog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into their own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use them
We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa
He can see numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying
At last Plank can't take any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger
' '  - We see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through
'   - Dog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than aware of the seriousness of the situation
He quickly closes his suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door, gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it
He then checks his escape route out of the front window and exits
Dog looks quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit
'  - Big Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks straight into him
Got something here for me, have ya
(Dog is stunned by this) Come on, chop chop
Before Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt
Dog moans, not knowing what day of the week it is
Chris opens the case, sees it's full of money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves
Thank you very much
On reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on the back seat
Count that son, and put your seatbelt on
'  - Follow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns
'  - Ed's place has been shot to pieces
Only Rory and Winston (in shock) seem to be left
Rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his van, then he kicks over one of the bodies
It's a blood-covered Plank
This is one of them
Winston nods in confirmation
Lucky, that
Bang' Bang
Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun
Rory and Plank despatch each other simultaneously
'  () - Tom, Bacon, Ed and Soap look hung-over Ed is driving
126 There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road
How many beaks have they got between them
Six
How many wings have they got between them
Twelve
How many feet
Er, well, twelve
That's right
So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got
How the fuck should  know
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy
] The end of this joke is interrupted by a van swerving past them, dangerously close
The lads lodge a complaint and then they stop outside Ed and Bacon's so that they can pick up the money
* Cut from completed film
127 '  - What has been going on here
They look into a smoking, blood-covered house
The money, the gear
That's fucked it
What do we do now
No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses
, don't panic; let's think about this
Bollocks
You can think about it for as long as you like
am panicking and  am off mate
'   - Big Chris is about to walk in to Hatchet's office
The door opens and out walks John 'Driscoll with a serious sunburn
Hello, John
Nice holiday
' won't be seeing you again Chris;  have paid him every last penny
am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John
128 (off) That you, Chris
'  - How did you get your hands on these
He drops a vagina-shaped penis massager, realising that these are the guns he has been after
He then tries desperately to conceal his excitement
The boys had 'em
know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them
Er, yeah, sure, 'll have 'em
Was it any trouble getting the money
Well, not especially, but they seem to of upset a few characters
Have you counted the money
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound
They were going to pay, then
It looks like
, but who knows
The opportunity was there
In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there
Good job, Chris
Chris exits, pushing his wages into his inside packet
Harry is ecstatic about the guns and starts chuckling to himself
'  - The Scousers watch Big Chris walk out of Hatchet's empty-handed We gotta get those guns
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there
Listen,  don't care who lives in there; all as  know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet
Furry muff, let's go
'  () - hope this is the right move
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily
am going to call him
As if he'll care
130 He'll care all right
That was going to be his money
Whether he cares about us is different
Pass your phone
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice
'  - The two Scousers with guns in hand creep their way up the stairs
There's only one door in front of them
Dean gets ready to kick it open
Gary leans against the wall and delivers a Professionals-style kick
'  - Harry is in his offtce playing with his guns
The phone rings
That you, boy
(on phone) It's Ed, if that's what you mean
It's pay day, ain't it
(on phone) wanted to talk to you about that
bet you did
have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't
You must have upset a few people, boy
but that isn't really my concern, is it
But what does concern me is the guns you had
want to talk to you about that
Get your arse over here now, and  do mean now
'  - Ed puts the phone down after a pause
His state of shock is obvious to the rest of the lads
Well
Well what
(impatiently) Well, what did he say
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns
now
You what
What are you on about
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money
think we should go and see him
think you're a sandwich short of a picnic, mate; you want to start making sense
133 '  - We cut to a time Lapse
Hatchet puts down the phone while resting his bum on the front of his desk
He is ecstatic with the guns
He loads and plays with them, aiming at imaginary moving birds
The door is suddenly kicked wide open and, lo and behold, there is a Scouser standing in the door
Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying through his troubled mind, most of which are based an regretting the decision to kick this door in: `shit, what the hell is that, and why is he holding a shotgun'
Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the doorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver, holding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail
The pair are blissfully unaware that employee has met employer
Hatchet Harry has effectively contracted his own demise
The pause is eventually shattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual triggers
There is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective targets
Both barrels are emptied into Dean's chest
The Scourer is airborne by the sheer power of the cartridges
One of Dean's bullets,finds its way into Harry's shoulder
Gary can do nothing to stop this atrocity
He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past him
Overtaken by emotion or fear, Gary charges in, gun blazing, and proceeds to perforate Hatchet who is now unarmed
Hatchet flies over his desk
Gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one last bullet into Hatchet, who is lying on the chair side of his desk
It is then revealed that Barry is sitting in his chair behind the door
The Scourer can't see Barry and Barry can't see Gary's face
Barry throws the hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butcher's block
It hits Gary in the back
Gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet in Barry's stomach
It is then clear to them both that this has all been a terrible mistake
/ What are you doing here
Then both collapse into dead lumps on the floor
'  '  - You and me, Tom
What do you mean, me
They stand outside Hatchet's door and are just about to ring it when Tom notices it's open
'  - Oh Jesus, not again
The two pause while they build their confidence
They enter Hatchet Harry's room
It's still smoky
There on the table is the money
That's it,  am off
Ed tiptoes over to the bag containing the money
Tom, this is our case
What
This is our money, Tom
Now  think we should go
Tom sees his guns
His eyes widen in surprise
'll meet you in the car
am taking these guns
136 Tom, don't mess around, let's go
'11 meet you in the car
Tom
'll only be a minute
' /'  - job well done son; we made a few quid out of that one
As he puts the key in the ignition, there is no reply from his little boy Son
Made a few quid, did ya
Now where is it
We can't see Dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along the front of Little Chris's throat
The Dog is Lying down in the back
Big Chris assesses the situation
You all right back there, mate
Very fucking funny
Where's what  want
It's in an office;  have just left it in the office
137 Well, you had better go and get it from the office
That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday
Now chop-fuckin'-chop
All right, furry muff
Big Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem
He shrugs and starts the car
What are you doing
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive
You had better be careful
Big Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road
He gets faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife
Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle
' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen
'  ()   '  - Another time lapse
Well, what's going on
don't know, but what  do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead
think, if  get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear
Bang
Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear
The bag of cash goes flying through the car, landing on the dash
The lads are knocked unconscious
'  ( ) - Big Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to smash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing so
Never, never, not as long as  can remember has anybody been as rude to me as you have
Dog is being thrown around like a rag doll
- , We are looking through a two-way mirror
Don't think  wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before  do,  need to know what's going on, Edward
If you think you're in the dark,  am in a black hole, blindfolded
The camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a policeman
There is a long pause far consideration
Eventually he shakes his head
No, that's not one of them
The policeman then knocks on the door
- The  looks round to see the policeman
They exit and Ed is left on his own
After a short pause the door bursts open
All right son, you're outta here
And you want to stay outta here
'  - All the lads are sitting in the bar
Ed is talking to Tom who is interested in whatever he has to say
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear
They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us
Apart from those shotguns
And Tom took care of them
Pause while Tom looks embarrassed about something
You did take care of the guns, didn't you, Tom
Ed looks at Tom, who looks even more embarrassed
wanted to talk to you about that
Well, talk
Well not exactly, no;  got 'em sitting in the car, actually;  thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but  am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him
You dippy bastard
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns
They could hardly trace them to you, could they
don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge
And, throw yourself off while you're at it Now, Tom
There is a pause
Now, Tom
Tom leaves, looking a little sulky
The silly sod
Big Chris walks in
He approaches the bar
Chris
(Pause) You come to collect something, Chris
Should  have something for you
Nope
Can  help
think  can help you, as it happens
Yes
have got something for ya
Well, for your boy, actually
Well,  suggest you speak to him, then
They all look rather shocked
He is carrying their bag and he places it on the table, which increases the shock factor
It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have cost him
am not going to make the same mistake, am
have decided to bring your bag back
Pause
The words you are looking for start with thank you
Thank you
Now you have presented me with a problem
don't have an employer any more
So  have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be waving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last little visit you lot ever make
That's all  had to say
It's been emotional
Big Chris turns to walk out
The lads stare at the bag and then at each other
'  - Big Chris walks out into the street
We see a shiny new sports car
Little Chris is sitting in the passenger seat
That should take care of that lot
We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son
All right, Dad
Well, put your seatbelt on then
'  - Ed goes forward to open the case
The rest are still in shock
Ed opens the bag
There's nothing in it
What do you mean
mean it's fucking empty
lunges forward and stares in
He sticks his hand in and extracts an A4 envelope
They look puzzled
Ed feels the package and starts to tear the top off
As this is done it creates a split screen
On the other side of the picture, Tom is on a London bridge with the car boot open
He looks at the guns with regret and give them one last polish
Then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a handrail
Simultaneously Ed extracts a Sotherby's brochure on shotguns
They still look confused
They turn the brochure upside down and recognize the shotguns
Slowly they start to turn the pages
Torn pushes the shotguns over the top rail: they fall
He starts walking but stops for some reason
He retreads his steps and peers over; the guns had just fallen on to a shelf
Ed sees the price of the guns: a series of alarming zooms cut between eyes and prices
They panic and reach for their mobile phones
Tom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail with one arm
Ed starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and asks them to put their phones down
Tom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail
His mobile phone starts to ring in his top pocket; he has either to drop the guns or let go of the rail to answer the phone
The shot freezes
