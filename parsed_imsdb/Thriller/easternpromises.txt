30pm in late December and rain is pouring
The scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain
young Turk () runs through the rain with a Turkish newspaper held over his head
He ducks into a traditional barber's shop called Ozim's

'   -                              2 The shutters are drawn
(a plump middle-aged Turk) is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day ()
Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown
During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands
Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters
Soyka speaks with a Russian accent
Guvenilmez
daginik
bloody kids, you know
he says - `but Amca it's Christmas
Christmas
We're Islam
Oi, how much are you taking off
Christmas
So  said to him
alisverise cimac
The kid's sixteen
Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door
Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'
(') They don't want to work do they
Shicma
(hesitantly interrupting) Uncle Ozim
We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold

Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror
Soyka nods at Ekrem in the mirror
He looks  to me
how you doin' Ekrem
Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted
He looks , yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me
Here, look
Ekrem, take this
Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified
Ozim
memnum etmek
We had a deal now he's backing out
(laughing) Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone
It's obviously a psychological thing
Take it Ekrem
Ozim, it's

Ozim yells `kabuka
And Ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat
Soyka's scream bubbles in the blood

-                                  3 We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road
We pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are hurrying through the rain
We see a young girl () hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it
Her hair is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop
She is barefoot

The trolley is accompanied by  , a and a midwife, ( )

Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean
The theater is full of people in scrubs, including an anesthetist
Monitors and drips are being attached at double speed
We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering needle marks
nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and we can hear frantic activity from the operating table

Baby's very distressed
Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the contents of the bag
We see a business card from a restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St
Christopher necklace and a tiny battered diary
Anna grabs the diary

Doctor Aziz joins the junior doctor, who looks out of his depth
Speak to me
Before the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to Aziz
(softly) We need to get the baby out now
Aziz knows he can take Anna's word
, let's go
All hell is let loose
As the Caesarean process begins at frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious face and hear her voice in
a young girl's voice speaking with an Russian accent
The crosstalk between nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic
(
) My name is Tatiana
My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died
We were all buried there
Buried under the soil of Russia
That is why  left to find a better life
We hear

Helen is peeling potatoes
Anna peers at Helen
and sees tears
They share a moment of stifled emotion
Helen wipes her eyes with her sleeve
It's the chicken
(pause) The smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him
You should have done beef, then
They look at each other and giggle
They both have potato peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave of emotion
It wouldn't be Christmas without tears in the gravy, would it
We hear a gruff Russian voice calling out from the living room ( )

) (angry) Anna
Anna
Where did you get this
Anna and Helen roll their eyes
(whispering) It's your own fault for giving him something to play with

Uncle Stepan is early seventies, Russian
He is reading the tiny diary that Anna found in Tatiana's bag
Anna breezes in
told you, Uncle Stepan,  found it in the handbag of a girl who died in my ward
Do you always rob the bodies of the dead
(suppressed, familiar anger) Of course, we all do it
It's one of the perks of working in a hospital
Stepan grumbles, accustomed to this teasing
Helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts which she places on the table
Pause
Stepan looks pointedly at Helen
Did you know that your daughter robs the bodies of the dead

Stepan lays the diary aside, obstinate and prim
You have an uncle who doesn't steal things from the dead
Not even their secrets
Oh, don't go all momentous on us, Stepan
(she straightens the table cloth) Lift your elbows
You should put this in her coffin, Anna
Bury her secrets with her bodies

Stepan leaves in a huff
Anna picks up the diary and begins to study it
She sees the `Trans-Siberian' business card between the pages

We should begin to sense that this is a kind of release for her
We hear Tatiana in

It has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively and recently finished

As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark

-                13 The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome Russian man (), who stops to groom his hair back from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges into daylight
He steps into a small courtyard, where a fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of a chain
Nikolai is followed by , who is a little younger, slim and pretty but hard-looking too
Kirill is dressed in a crumpled -shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy night
Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian curses
Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street
So you pick up Ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here
He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly
(') Then 'll think of an excuse and we can get away
'll think of an excuse
Your excuses are like fucking fairy tales
Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys
The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response
Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of the restaurant

She walks towards the front door
(in Russian) Maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for Christmas
(grinning) You're so
fucking unbelievably disrespectful
Kirill sees that Nikolai is studying Anna and his grin fades
We sense jealousy
(') Hey, you've got work to do
Go
Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than playfulness
Nikolai gets into his car
Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant

He is wiping his hands on a tea towel, dressed in a spotlessly white apron
He has the sparkling piercing eyes of a falcon

Family members, some dressed in their party outfits, others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots, laughing, arguing
Children play and yell
You can almost smell Christmas
Anna enters, dazzled by it all, overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas kitchen
Semyon calls out to everyone
Come, come, hurry, hurry
They will be here any moment
(to Anna) Ok, show me this card
Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans- Siberian' business card she found in Tatiana's bag
Semyon angles his head to look as he stirs
(') It is the old card
From before the renovations
But even so, if she had worked here  would remember the name
Perhaps she ate here once

Semyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy
She sips it

The rear windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the driver's seat
He gets out of the car and opens the rear door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in her fifties
Nikolai goes to the other rear door
The portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges
As Ozim gets out he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note

Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place
Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap of paper
This is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff
Maybe you will have more luck there
But  think they will be closed until New Year
As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around the door and yells through the noise

Ozim's wife is at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a cigarette and peeling glazed figs
As Anna walks by, Ozim and Kirill stop talking
The scene has a much darker mood to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna feels no unease

The women are all wearing furs, even the little girls
The men wear leather or dark suits

Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which has a gold ring on it
The parts of Soyka's shirt and jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood
Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves
As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee
Ozim is watching this scene with horror
Kirill has his arms folded, mightily impressed
Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove the gold ring
He studies an inscription and then offers it to Ozim
Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a contagion
Nikolai shrugs and pockets it
He then turns the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the crisply bloody chest of Soyka
He tugs at the frozen lapel of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket
Within a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening, thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood
He opens it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows hot air onto the money inside
He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all stuck together by drops of frozen blood
He offers this money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously
Kirill hoots with laughter
Ozim is now staring at Nikolai as if he were a devil from hell
Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it, then pockets the frozen wad
He tosses the rest of the frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it
You'd better burn that
Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror of it, drops the thing on the floor

Aren't you going to weight him down or something

Kitsch paintings still decorate the walls
Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts
Their eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but they are painted with so much make-up they almost look like tiny, sad clowns
They sit in silence as the music blares out

All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving awkwardly and painfully
The Albanian approaches the one girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet
He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian
She tries to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again
Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she begins to dance, sobbing as she does

Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his hands against the cold
The Turkish bath building is a Victorian red-brick edifice

Nikolai is pulling off his shirt and Ozim reacts to the sight of the fresh eight-pointed star tattoos
Ozim chuckles

Ozim disappears into a steam room, naked
Nikolai watches him go, a private agenda bubbling beneath the surface

The Americans

The television sets are one in ten
That means one in ten have cargo inside them

Ozim grins

Ozim chuckles as he leaves in a swirl of steam
Nikolai leans back against the cold wall, his tattoo almost the only visible thing through the steam

They head towards the steam room as Ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit

The steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he can't see who has entered
Ozim
He sees a shape
a clothed body
He realizes immediately
Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a head lock
He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if this were confirmation of who this is
He grunts an instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with an open razor
Nikolai is naked, alone
Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother
In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and fingers flying
Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one brother and throw another against the wall
He obviously has serious combat training but the brothers are strong and angry
Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor and blood oozes into the steam and hot water
All the men are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water
Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open
All the men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the temple
As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes their throats
He lurches to his feet, drops the razor, and staggers out of the steam room

Anna runs out
99
-                     99 Anna runs fast down the corridor towards the hospital exit
She spots Nikolai ahead of her
She pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him
Where have they taken Christine
Nikolai reacts
(') You bastards
Where will he take her
Tell me
People back away as Nikolai grabs Anna's arms and holds her still
What are you talking about
Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion
She calms down a little
Kirill
Kirill has taken Christine
saw him here
thought he was coming to see you, but he wasn't, was he
Nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast
You brought your bike

-                         100 The same dockside where Nikolai dumped Soyka and recommended this as the best place to dispose of a body
Kirill pulls up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes
The car is parked for a long time before finally the headlights are switched off
101
-                101 Nikolai and Anna race to Anna's motorbike
'll drive
'll drive
Anna and Nikolai leap aboard the bike and it starts first time
With Nikolai riding pillion, they roar away
101A
-                                     101A Anna and Nikolai ride through London streets
102
-                         102 On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the zip-up bag before him
Suddenly fireworks begin to burst over the Thames
It is the stroke of midnight
Kirill unzips the bag
When he looks inside Christine stops crying
He peers at her, wiping away tears
She's a little girl, Papa, a little sweet fucking girl
Kirill sobs then Christine cries
(') Shush, shush
Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline
He looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused
He whispers
(') (in Russian) 'm sorry, my little sister

Instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her crying stops

In a firework flash we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike
They approach cautiously
Kirill stares at the man he loves
pause
Christine begins to cry
Kirill, let me take the baby
You stay where you are
She's cold, Kirill
Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks explodes
Nikolai doesn't move
Kirill is dangerously close to the edge of the dock
Maybe he'll throw himself in too
Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little babies
Kirill is motionless
(') Something like this would be bad for all of us
Your dad has gone too far, Kirill
pause
(') (in Russian) It's our turn now
Nikolai steps forward slowly
As he gets closer Kirill hugs the baby
Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him
As he does he edges him away from the dockside
The three of them are locked in a long embrace
Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his arms
He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close
Kirill turns to Nikolai
swear  didn't know my dad was setting you up

When he's gone the family business will be yours
pause
(') We can be partners again
Thunder and lightning, right
Kirill smiles through his tears and nods
(') Get into the car
'll drive you home
pause
Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car
Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby
He waits a long time before realizing he must leave her
(') You're , yeah
Anna nods
Who are you really
Why have you helped us

There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable lie
How can  become King if the King is still in place
pause
He laughs
Anna studies him, unsure
More New Year fireworks explode over the river
Kirill yells from the car
You come on, Nikolai
We're missing the fucking party of the year out there
Get here and drive
(in Russian) That's a fucking order
Nikolai and Anna peer at each other
Maybe  can drive you somewhere
She shakes her head
There's someone  can call
He'll come and fetch us
Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it
Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face
He smiles
Kirill is hooting the car horn
After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently before Nikolai heads for the car
103                                                          103* 107 104
'
-                              104* summer's day
Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing to eat Sunday lunch
Stepan is carving
The conversation is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the table
Then we hear a baby crying
Anna goes to a small crib and lifts a six-month-old Christine out
She hands her to Helen who hugs her
Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana in
, a repeat of the first words we heard her say
(
) My name is Tatiana
My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died
Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to peer outside, staring across the park
105
-  -                       105 Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka, staring back across the park
He peers out at ordinary life going on in the streets outside
Tatiana's
continues
(
) We were all buried there
Beneath the soil of Russia
That is why left to find a better life
Nikolai finishes his drink
