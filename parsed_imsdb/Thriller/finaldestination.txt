The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches
Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions
Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action
Alex, Tod, George and  , heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust
can't believe they let that dickhead on this trip
His parents bought a ton of those trip certificates we had to sell, just to get him out of their hair for ten days
Excited, Tod speaks in a convert tone over Alex's shoulder
Dude,  so worked the ticket clerk so you're sittin' next to Christa and 'm next to Blake
Alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors
'  - Attractive and they know it,   and   appear clearly out of Alex and Tod's league
(') That's seven hours and most of it is in the dark
The boys dump their change in a plastic bowl
Dude, if we don't get someone going on this flight, we should just call Dr
Kervorkian and put ourselves out of our fuckn' misery
As Alex and Tod pass through the metal detector, their eyes performing reconnaissance on Christa and Blake, the opening drum  of Boingo's "No One Lives Forever"

The class is squirrely and  excited
Mr
Murnau, Ms
Lewton, and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate, hoping for a calm flight
the awaiting passengers
Carter and Terry are making out, a step away from heavy petting
Blake and Christa are flipping through Parisian fashion magizines
Billy Hitchcock lays into a Burrito Supreme
to an empty seat
Clear Rivers   and sits, struggling with her Walkman, coffee, books, and a cassette box handmarked "Boingo" (a cheat that We hear the song) As she places her stuff on the unoccupied seat beside her, a Paris guidebook falls on the floor, opened but face down

Thanks
The student continues down toward the observation deck
Clear looks at the opened guidebook
'  - Princess Di's Mercedes is totaled in a Paris tunnel
Besides the photo are two portraits of Diana and Dodi Al Fayed

She looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her, the identity of which is fully  to be Alex Browning
He stands at the gate window, looking out at the plane

(
) Dude, let's take a dump
Tod    beside Alex
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay
Dude, get wisdom
We're about to board a seven hour flight
The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets
What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torgue a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake
You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes
Alex takes a beat to consider

He died in a plane crash
breaks into the song
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank-you for your patience, at this time we would like to begin pre-boarding of Euro-Air Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39
Really for the first time, Alex appears a bit tentative and pale
It is intensified by the return of the song

Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock
How'd we lose him
Tod nudges Alex toward the tunnel, the three boys start down the ramp, passing Mr
Murnau who checks his list, counting heads
Vingt huit, vingt neuf
Alex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited
As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane
Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane
'  - The enormous engine
The expansive wings
Behind the tail, distant, a bolt of lightning
looks away
Just ahead, in the plane,   greet the passengers
He is next to enter the plane
- a slice of opening from where the ramp meets the plane provides a sense of how high up one actually stands
as he takes his first step into the plane
- Alex's Nikes land on the carpet
747 -    -  -  - Its parents desperately comfort the child

Alex and Tod wince at the screaming child
George, however feels comforted
Good sign
Younger the better
It would be a fucked-up God to take down this plane
- 747 - In the first row slumps a young man with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

The kids sneak sympathetic yet anxious glances at the man while continuing in their seats
George whispers over his shoulder

He turns toward the aisle
'  - Man, they look great and they're workin' the sex appeal
Could you trade seats with Blake so she and  can sit together asked Tod, but he says he's got some medical thing
sneaks a quick check with Tod

" He looks to them and knows he is just plain overmatched
Alex shrugs, "Sure
" In front of him Tod throws up his arms, disgusted
Alex climbs out of his seats
The girls are touchy-feely thankful, but only know guys dig that
You're so sweet
Thanks, Alex
Alex crames up into the aisles, making his way to Tod, sitting two rows up in 22
Alex climbs over Tod to take the window seat
Clear Rivers sits in the seat directly behind Alex

'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something
Because of you,  gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom

He lifts the tray back up, but as he turns the latch, it   in his hand

Then
- across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge
Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds
Dead students sit lifeless in their seats
Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows
and a  clutch their seat in terror,  before they are pulled into the sky
Wind

Dying engines, a deafening blare

The cabin begins to tilt downwards

Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake
They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal
Could you trade seats with Blake so she and  can sit together
asked Tod, but he's got some medical thing
Alex turns sickeningly disoriented
His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe
There are none to be found
Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls
He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned
Dude, what up
Frenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat
Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a    who makes his way to the row
grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat
,
, terrified
He begins to hyperventilate
Is there a a problem, sir
Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem
" The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode
Directly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions
What's your fuckin' problem
Mr
Murnau and Ms
Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex
Alex
Qu'est-ce se
Qu'est-ce se

In the b

, attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin
Shut up, Browning
You're not funny
frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle
We have to get out
This frightens everyone
Not the "prophecy," but his panicky, irrational behavior
(') We have to get off this plane
, hearing Alex's declaration

Alex is desperately climbing over Tod, who is trying to calmly restrain his friend
Across the aisle, Carter Horton stands ready to quiet Alex, with force
Sit
Browning

Alex
Easy, man
Take it        Sir, if this is a joke, easy

The flight attendant restrains Carter with an extended forearm

Ms
Lewton and Mr
Murnau move to the seats
Flight attendants try restraining Alex from reaching the aisle
Alex, Knock it off
It's alright
Settle down, Alex
Listen to me
This plane will explode on take-off
Sir, we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues
'll remove him
Fuck you
'll remove myself
Carter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out
Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee
The Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation
He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle
male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back
Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage
He begins removing Carter from the plane as well
He didn't do nothin'
She follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend
Just arriving in the cabin, Billy Hitchcock tries to fight past a to get to his seat
He is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out
(he's had it) Anybody in the aisle is off the plane
No, wait,  was late
that's my seat right there
Under protest, Billy gets pushed back off the plane
Mr
Murnau and Ms
Lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit, calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles
Everybody just stay where you    Mr
Carpenter, keep an eye on are

Murnau, Ms, Lewton, Terry, Tod and Billy proceed down the tunnel
Billy is confused by the chaos

Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers
- You got this
The officers nod
One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex
Terry sits behind Carter
The co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane
Ms
Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive

Murnau attempt to calm him down
It's alright

You're off the plane
You're off the plane
Rattled, Alex attempts to compose himself
Ms
Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr
Murnau
Airline's not taking this very well
They'll let one of us back on and the rest can grab a six-ten flight
Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle
It's alright
It's not that big of a deal

Murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door

Lewton

as he hands it to Ms
Lewton seated next to Alex
The teacher places it on Alex's forehead

Alex, talk to me

Alex looks at Tod, who nods
His friend's expression is soothing and open
With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him

looked down and saw the ground
Ms
Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances
(') And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded
The the whole plane
blew up
It was so real
Exactly how everything goes
Been on many planes that blew up, have you
Good point
Alex looks away
You must have fallen asleep
We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris because Browning has a bad dream

It's going to explode
Fuck off, Horton

then Carter's
In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms
Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him
The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in  as he looks out, frozen with shock
upon the doomed  180
: -   #10 - pair of Airline  sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock
Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion
They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights
Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe
each feels uneasy by Alex's presance
The others sit away from Alex and Tod
Alex appears wrought with guilt
He checks the others out of the corner of his eye
'  - Ms
Lewton, Carter and Billy glare at Alex
Terry averts her eyes from Alex to bury her face in Carter's shoulder

With softspoken strength
You're lookin' at me as if  caused it

With strained apprehansion, as if not wanting to "dabble in the occult," but needing an immediate answer
Is everyone dead
Are there any survivors

All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being
Special Agents  and
and   are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board
and   are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team
" The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time
Hello
'm Howard Seigel, National Transportation Safety Board vice chairmen
We've notified your families and they are on their way
Does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time
Although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre
Ms
Lewton reacts, snapping
Have they found any survivors
What's going on
Seigel is calm, yet honest
carefully honest
The cause of the explosion is undetermined
Nassau county authorities are on the scene
Naval search and rescue are en route
He gestures
"and that's all we know
" The group slips deeper into despair
We understand how you must be feeling at this hour
and although we know it may be difficult, we must ask you some questions
regarding today's events, while it's still fresh in your minds
The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co-operate
It may be valuable to our rescue attempts, or any potential
criminal investigation
The agents,
badges displayed in their pockets, turn their eyes, suspicioulsy, toward Alex
reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the Agents are focused on him
: -  -  -  -  & are direct and professional, with no hidden agenda in searching for the truth
Seigel and Hawks from the  are behind them taking notes
You said
(checks notes) "Listen to me
This plane will explode on take-off
" (to Alex) How did you know that
as he looks up, nervous
not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand
got this
feeling
a weird feeling
can't explain it
Did you take any seditives before boarding, or on the plane
Sleeping pills
No
saw it

Tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience
Being trained, veteran officers, Schreck and Weine obsereve; allow him to talk
Not like a dream
more than that
experienced the plane exploding
it was so horrible

The officers remain quiet, gauging his explanation
(') 'm not a pyschic
've never had this happen before
The officers study him, unsure yet carefully
Did this "weird feeling" have anything to do with you saying you wished Carter Horton was on the plane
just before it exploded
Alex looks up, stunned
He didn't even recall this until now
No
Why'd you say it
He considers, owing them an explanation
The he realizes
Because
never thought it would really happen
Weine leans foward
If that's the case, Alex
why did you really get off the plane
as Alex considers, confused, emotional
: -  -  - on Tod
as if just realizing
My brother
told me to keep an eye on Alex
He stayed
and  went to make sure Alex was okay
(a whisper) He told me to get off the plane
-  -  - displaying a similar sickened expression as Tod
Larry Murnau told me to get back on
but  told him to go
(pause, guiltily) sent him back on the plane
-  -  - No one forced you to get off the plane
You told us you aren't friends with any that did
so, why did you leave the airplane
as she looks up
With total resolve
Because  saw and  heard Alex
And
believed him
: -   #10 - The surviviors have all returned to the room
They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts
The door is opened by Ms
Whale
Alex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room
Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child
Barbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight
The mother begins to cry
Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes
Alex does not cry
While holding his mother, he watches the others

Without introduction, he begins Neil Young's "Long May You Run
" Two other students remove a cloth, unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed
The gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial
Carter and Terry appear
Terry holds a rose
As they move slowly up toward the memorial, Alex gets in line behind them
Carter knows Alex is there, but will not look at him
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall
that  owe you anything
don't
(re: victims) All  owe is these people
(turns to Alex) To live my life to the fullest
Alex winces from Carter's breath
Then maybe you should lay off the Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm
Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold
Don't ever fucking again tell me what to do
control me
Not you
Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip
Terry finally gets him to release
'm never gonna die
He moves off
Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence
As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off
Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial
He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line

Alex turns to him, increudlously
Got a 70
Lowest score, but passed
When  was done with the test, the guy who drives with you during the test, he goes, "Young man, you're going to die at a very young age
" (beat) That true
Not here, not now
(beat) Not
Billy sighs, and moves   , only to quickly -
If  ask out Cynthia Paster, will she say "no
" Alex flashes Billy an angry glare
He gets the message and moves off, for good
Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial
Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her
Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names
- Linda Krauss
Thomas Lewis
John McConnell
Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain
Ms
Lewton
Her eyes fill with tears and fear
Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him
Don't talk to me
You scare the hell out of me
Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away
Tod  and faces the memorial
(a greeting) Hey
Alex notices Tod is in line behind him
Alex looks around for Tod's father
He is not in line
don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but
miss you
Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial
- Tod's hand moves across his brother's name
As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend
Me, too

When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City

That's a plan
Tod nods
The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium
gotta go
This thing Ms
Lewton showed me in her class, they're gonna let me read it
It says what 'm feeling
Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes
Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose
She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex
Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity
As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him
He looks up, puzzled
Because of you
'm still alive
Thank you
Alex takes the rose and she walks away
as he eyes
feels

: -  - Tod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve

(') But when we say this, we imagine that the hour is placed in an obscure and distant future
As he speaks, the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow
looks up at the sky

as, troubled, he looks back to Tod
as he continues to read

and which has every hour filled in advance
-   - lone light glows
Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in "dad's chair

Tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents
Tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his father's scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs

Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed
An
paper  draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan
He reaches out and grabs it
Headlines and photos report on the memorial service
as he sighs, troubled
'  - Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and mysterious
closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction
He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk
Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer
Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash
the April 1997 issue of Penthouse

The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat

As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses

this is more than a wayward autumn breeze

The door is softly pushed closed by the breeze

He unzips his pants, then pauses
his eyes returning hesitantly to the newspaper photo of Clear

Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby
What
what happened
Mr
Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly
Didn't you
"see" it
Alex is stung, guilty
He averts his eyes
Schreck and Weine note this reaction
(') Couldn't you "predict" it
Couldn't you read his mind
Alex remains silent, hurt
Mr
Waggner
You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane that
(breaking down) He took his own life
Alex is stunned, defensive
He wouldn't do it
Mr
Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof
" He
he told me we would be friends again after you got better
After you got over George
Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself
All my wife and  will ever know is we wouldn't have lost our youngest son
if you'd told our oldest to get off the plane
Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face
Mr
Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle
Alex eyes the
agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle
The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers
'  - Clear is gone
everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone
Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle
As the ambulance doors  on the body of his best friend

Tod
" (
) Almost Autumn
Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods
In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools
Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low
Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket
She wears heavy black work shoes
dog rests nearby on the floor
It's only the end of June
(shrugs) Yeah, but everthing's always in transition
If you focus, even now, one week into summer
you can feel Autumn coming
(beat) Almost like bein' able
to see the future
Alex reads her intention loud and clear
She returns to her artwork
The dog  softly as Alex appraches the garage
/
-  '  - Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork
It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that
Know what this is
She gestures to him to approach her
He tenses, awkward, but moves closer
Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas
Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated
Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal
Like, um
you're mad about something
She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal
piece of debris
from the plane
went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach
You went there
've wanted to go there, but  thought it was off limits
It is
But that didn't stop me
Shouldn't stop you
Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal
He looks to Clear
Why were you there last night
While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine
Look, 've seen enough
to know the
doesn't investigate teen suicides
But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash
Two, they haven't ruled out anything
And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious
And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide
Alex eyes her for a long beat
She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf
Why were you there last night
Clear turns to Alex
The two couldn't appear more different
She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center
Know what this is
Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess
" but tactfully shakes his head "no
" It's you
Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable
Not a likeness
It's how you make me feel, Alex
'm
really sorry
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is
Reluctant to take form
And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction
Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens
(') Before that day, you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life
And 'm sure you thought  was some Marilyn Manson body-pierced freak, or whatever
(beat) But at that moment
on the plane
felt what you felt
didn't know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out
Alex sighs, embarrassed
(') didn't see what you saw, but felt it
Okay, 'm not into all that -Files bullshit
but it was a psychic connection
Why to me
Why to you
Jarred, he eyes her, frightened
And you can still feel it, can't you
Something from that day is still with you
know, because can still feel you
Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding
Lowering his tone
That's why  was there last night
've never dealt with death before
wasn't alive when my grandparents died
wish  could know
mean, all this
could just be in our heads
Now it feels like it's everywhere
"It
" What if Tod
is just the first
of us
The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear
Is that something you're "feeling
" don't know
wish  could just see him
one more time, then, maybe
would know
Then, let's go see him
Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting
: -  - is , moving across the paisley carpet
Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns
,   to the ,  a stained glass skylight
Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear
The skylight hinges  open
Clear leads the way
lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window
Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus
Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet
Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels
bronze plaque identifies: "
'
-
" (whispering) Gives me a rush
This place
Doin' somethin' 'm not supposed to
With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway
Alex anxiously sighs
then follows
-   - An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers
Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile
Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor
faint light spills from beneath a doorway
Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand
From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on
Good call
Very "Quincy
" Alex tries the doorknob
Locked
He looks at her, defeated
Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart
From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle
He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob
-   - lone desk lamp shines
Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod
sheet is pulled up to his shoulders
He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician
Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red
As Alex and Clear approach
That
him
think
But why'd they make him up like
Michael Jackson
That's him, but
he's not here
That
whatever
that whatever made him Tod is gone
Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches
Ahhh
fuck
You fucking		 Ohmygod
asshole
You think this        He's not dead
is funny, you fucking dick
Tod, if you're not dead 'm gonna fucking kill you
(
) Please don't yell
Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice
,  ,   , an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie
You'll wake the dead
He flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun
Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth
Why
Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body
Bludworth nods, understanding
Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm
As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted
He nervously offers an explanation
'm
a friend of his
His best friend
See, his father
(ominous) know who you are
The mortician eyes Alex, understanding
Alex senses this and eases
Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area
They said he hung himself, but there's no marks
crafted a reconstruction of the Laryngeal prominence region with Velvetone Surgical Wax and Permaseal
Clear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body
After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck
What are all those tiny marks
'  -  - ' The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint
At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire
(
) Cuticle lacerations
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide
Why would they say it was a suicide
if it weren't
Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer
He eyes Mr
Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation
His father's pretty fucked up with denial
Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident
taking another son
In Death
the mortician
In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance
he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject
there are no accidents
No coincidencess
No mishaps
(smiles) And no
escapes
You saying Tod did kill himself
Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals
Suicide
Murder
Plane crash
What does it matter
He was going to end someday
From the minute you're cut loose from the womb
it's a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb
Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail
Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental
the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of
is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave
Design
The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table
He shrugs then continues his work
If Life is like a box of chocolates
Death
Death is like a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse Trap
" The day you're born is just the boot, hanging from the streetlamp, kicking the marble to get things rolling
Growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute
You feel immortal having survived school, sex, drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub
Marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see-saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel
In the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures
the mouse
(beat) Game over
Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked
" Alex moves toward Bludworth
Maybe there's no way to win
but
if you figured out the game
you knew where the "steel ball was rolling" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time
Couldn't you
cheat Death at Its own game
Mr
Bludworth looks directly at Alex
, this between the two of them
You already did that by walking off the plane
Now you gotta out when and how it'll come back at you
(beat) Play your hunch, Alex
If you think you can get away from it
(beat) But beware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design
could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper
(beat) And you don't even want to fuck with that Mack Daddie
Alex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile
The mortician yanks on a tube,  a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column
The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex
'm sorry we broke in
No harm
No foul
Alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door
We didn't find what we were looking for
Alex looks at Bludworth
Yeah, we did
the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved
'll see you soon
: - , startlingly, a public bus    and stops
The doors  open
(
) The mortician was whacked
as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street
(') He was trippin' on formaldehyde
Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off
safely
He nods, "it's safe to go
" Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly
He said Death has a design
Even before he said that  had been seeing patterns
(sarcastic) As in flannels and plaids
Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored
,  and    from above
In the f
g
, tools and metal spikes
After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled
How many died on Flight 180
From our group
Thirty-nine
Remember the gate number
As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move
No
Thirty-nine
This is a creepy fact
Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way
Remember the departure time
Like
4:25
Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb
the halting red hand is lit
(
) Do you know when  was born
Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex
4:25
Right
April 25th
Wait
thought you meant the time of your birth
Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day
that's a reach
the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man
Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street
Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge
My birthday is the same as of the time  was meant to die
That's a reach
car indeed makes a right,  through the intersection
Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street
You're sounding like those people who, you know
"Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and hid in a warehouse
" an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating
Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear
- Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle
- sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious
Clear listens; expression skeptical
'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this
'm talking about indications
omens
that day, that we were meant to die
That, if, we have been aware of
would have saved everyone on the plane
That's total bullshit
You can find death omens anywhere you want to
She picks up her paper coffee cup
(') Hey, look
"Coffee" starts with a "" and ends with an "
" So does the word "choke
" We're going to choke to death
Oh no
Starbuck was a whaler
We're going to be harpooned
Alex angrily glares at Clear
Clear drops her tone
(') You'll go nuts if you start with that shit
Ms
Lewton appears from around the corner
She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex
He cautiously flashes a greeting smile
The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop
Alex sighs, guiltily
Clear sympathizes with both of them
She's leaving the school
Moving away
Alex studies, appealing to her
Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street
we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death
Fifty years from now
Ten years
Tomorrow
(beat) You don't unless
you're able to open yourself to the signs 'm willing to show you
He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket
- ' slides across the table
Opening his hand  the piece of paper reading, "
Tod
" Clear's hand '  to take the paper
raises it, her expression obviously puzzled
As she eyes Alex for an explanation,     to the empty paper cups on the table
a slight approaching  knocks them over
- somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks
Carter Horton is driving
Terry Chaney rides shotgun
Carter looks out the window
'  -  - She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story
' scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems
Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him
don't understand
did you see Tod die
Did it happen again, like 		on the plane
No, but it might as well be the same thing
This was a message
from someone, or something
hinting
at the design
Alex, on the plane
you must have experienced
some kind of hyper awareness
But here
you're suggesting Tod's death
and maybe our own
will happen because of
an active Presence
Alex nods, feeling she's understanding
The mortician said Death has a design
Now
if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms
Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason,  was able to see Death's plan
then we cheated it
(beat) But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane
What if it is still is our time
If
It
is still not finished with us
We will all still die; now, not later
Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex
(') Unless
we find the pattern
And cheat it again
Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex
After hearing you, just now
do believe
Alex leans back and sighs, relieved
(') that Tod killed himself
Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry
Then there's no one left who can help me
' His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight -Turn
rides his bike
He reacts, startled by
'  - ' barreling down towards him
The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the -Turn
Billy  to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car
The car  right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist
The oncoming car
Carter's car pulls up to the curb
Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop
Inside the car, Terry sighs
Baby, come on
not now
But her boyfriend continues
She gets out and hustles after him
Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk
Carter
At that moment, Ms
Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink
Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself
Kind of have a reunion, here
Let it go
Carter steps before Ms
Lewton, blocking her exit
When are you moving
couple of weeks
She can't wait to leave
While trying to walk around Carter
We're losing our favorite teacher
Look, there's something you should all know
Alex
Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt
He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict
(')               (') Lived here her whole life
This'll be hard to believe
Ms
Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him
(')                (') And now she has to move
Listen to me, we may all All because of Browning
be in danger
Shut up
The both of you
The two boys stop their heated exchange
(') They died
We lived
(beat) Get over it
won't let that plane crash be the most important thing in my life
'm moving on, Carter, and if you're gonna waste your life beating the shit out of Alex everytime you see him, then you can just drop fucking dead
Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk,
a bus suddenly speeds   and,
plows directly right into her
, , are  with  before they can even recoil
: -  -  - in the glass, while
, a
has crashed, watching
It's a tense recline
Red circles rim the lids of his eyes
He sips from the glass to settle his stomach
Ken appears from the kitchen, hand over the reciever
It's that girl
Clear
No response from Alex
Ken sighs, then into the phone
He's in the shower, Clear
Can have him get back at ya
Sure
bye
Ken returns to the living room, concerned about his son
Alex averts his eyes, stressed and ashamed
Ken sits nearby
(') She's concerned about you
(beat) 'm concerned about you
Alex turns his eyes to the glass
(') Why don't you want to talk to her
or me
Dad
you and mom have helped me out, so much
But there's
some things  need to understand before can talk
to anyone about it
The father respects this young man's wishes
Ken nods "fair enough
" In the silent moment,
, from the television
(
) The National Transportation Safety Board has a new theory tonight on the possible cause of Euro-Air Flight 180
Alex quickly grabs the remote and turns up the
computer graphic illustrations the area of the lower fuselage

) Deterioration of silicon insulation on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump may have leaked combustible fluids
Alex remains riveted to the screen

) spark in the fuel switch
The graphic  into the area in the rear right side, nearly above Tod's seat
(
) That's Tod's seat
as he listens
(',
) may have ignited the fuel line
And proceeded to the fuel pump
The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane
red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes
Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane
: '  -  - 747 drawn in Alex's hand, and hundreds of steps down from  computer image, yet accurate as Alex's finger traces the path, away from the seats marked "" and "
" The path starts over "," then moves to "
" The line moves forward away from "" toward the fuel pump
The corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the "hand of Death," seen earlier in the lightning
It is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of Death
is amped, intensely more frightened as he believes
The path of the explosion
(a whisper) That's Death's design
It instantly, frightfully, occurs to him, he now knows who will be next
- Alex's finger quickly moves along the fuel line
After "," the seat intersecting the path of the fule line, over the fuel pump, is marked "

(
) Some nights 'm woken up by the sound of my own voice, you know, inside my head, goin', "No, you know the whole French thing
Get on the plane
" Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of relocating
The house is old, been in the family forever
Dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed
(') Everything here reminds me
of sending Mr
Murnau back on the plane
Right, 'm hoping a change will help
lived here my whole life and wherever  looked were great memories, you know
but now all can see is Mr
Murnau
those kids
Just looking out my own front yard
makes me feel mothing but fear
She peeks out of the front curtains and looks sadly upon her front yard
Her expression alters
alarmed
'  -  -
'  - The figure is Alex Browning
'  - Ms
Lewton steps away from the curtains
(quickly) Laura,  gotta call you back
She immediately hangs up and speed dials
(') This is Valerie Lewton
need Agent Schreck
: '  - Alex has moved closer to her house, remaining in the shadows
He checks for any passers-by
Being sure there are none, he creeps toward Ms
Lewton's car
He visually inspects the exterior
As he kicks the tires
an unmarked sedan  up
Doors open
Startled, Alex turns to find
Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car
What are you doing
is nervous but determined
He tells the truth
Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe
after a beat of incredulity
Get in the car
'  -  - is watching, peeking out her front curtains
,
The vehicle
She releases the curtains and moves back, feeling somewhat better, but still rattled
Then
The curtains billow as if blown by a breeze
Ms
Lewton appears puzzled as she moves the curtains aside to find the windows closed
As     , tensing and uneasy
: -   - Alex sits behind a table in the cinderblock room painted police station green
Sitting across from him, with a good cop tone, is Agent Weine, while Schreck stands with a hard-ass posture
believe that
Ms
Lewton's next
"Next
" Yes
see, there's this
pattern
that's occuring
(sarcastic) Oh, you've noticed it, too
: '  - Ms
Lewton moves to a closet door, opens it and  on an overhead light
Kneeling down, she tugs on a heavy box and opens it to check the contents
Her expression warms, as if recalling a far off memory
Oh
mom's favorite
She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust
Valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album
, although spinning around and around
the bold letters of the center label can be read
the opening acoustic guitar of "Rocky Mountain High" has never sounded so eerie
(
) He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year
Pleased with the feeling of a pleasant memory, Lewton moves off
-   - Schreck moves closer to Alex
Where'd you get this "pattern" from
You have another "vision
" Maybe saw it in some
static
Alex is insulted by the condescending tone
didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane
You can make fun of me
You can think 'm a nut
'm used to it
saved six lives but the entire school acts like 'm a freak
Fine
Alex takes a nervous breath
'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress
haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex
'm not going Dahmer
(beat) This just is
There's a pattern in place for you
And you
There's a design for everyone
The agents study Alex
(sighs) And 'm not sure yet how
but intend to break this one
: '  -  - held in a wooden block, sits atop the kitchen counter
In the b
g
, Valerie removes the chrome teapot from the stove and moves it to the sink
in the next room
Ms
Lewton turns on the faucet, pours water into the kettle
Some water spills on the side of the kettle
As she wipes the pot with a blue checked hand towel, a dark shadow appears to cross behind her
Lewton turns
,  as she looks about the room only to find she is alone
Unsetteled, she absently tosses the towel on the counter the edge which, catches a knife blade held in the cutery block
Ms
Lewton turns on the gas, adjusts it, however
the flames blow out
She pauses, nerves on edge
Her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing
She grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one
(
) He left yesterday behind him/ You might say he's born again
the burner as the flames re-ignite and
: -   - Weine sits across from Alex, symapthetic, but professional
Alex, you got our attention, at first, because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion
Alex tenses, but Weine shakes his head
(') know you didn't blow up that plane
Alex sighs, eases
(') don't believe you have magical powers
No one has any
control over life and death
unless
that person is taking lives and causing death
Weine leans forward toward Alex
(') Alex
can you promise me that no one else will die
No
can't
As long as 'm in here, it's outta my control
The agents are taken aback by his answer; unnerved by his sincerity
Weine sighs and looks to his partner, who sighs, frustrated and turns away
Alright, go on
Get outta here
Alex stands and, with no urgency, moves off
He exits the room
Kid gives me the creeps
We got nothing to hold him
don't mean that
(beat) There's a couple of times, there
almost believed him
Weine considers, yet remains skeptical
Sometimes, you give me the creeps
: '  -  -  - Whistles
(
) When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away
- two tea bags are dropped inside, then the steaming hot water
picks up the cup, raising it toward her lips
She pauses, her expression turning tragic
On a reflex, she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain
She sits the mug down
displaying the logo of the Mt
Abraham Fighting Colonials
Trembling
She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself
You gotta stop this
Stop this
It's just a stupid mug
(composed) You're outta here
Pretty soon
you'll be gone
Opening the refrigerator frezzer, she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure Polish Vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug
the ice cubes
The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug
as
it slightly , Vodka dripping out of the base
Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack
She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol
: - Alex exits the police station, walking
He checks over his shoulder to see if he is being watched and increases his pace, legs whipping across
: '  - Valerie Lewton tears off a piece of plastic bubble wrap
She stands over her desk, placed against the wall
On the desk is her desktop computer monitor
(
) It's the Colorado Rocky Mountain High
She pauses to swig from her cup of vodka
- alcohol drips from her mug
- fluid drips inside the circuitry
sets the mug out of the way on the back edge of her desk
- The remaining vodka oozes from the crack, pools, then drips off the edge of the desk
've seen it rainin' fire from the sky
to  the moniter cabel inserted into an electrical wall socket
The vodka drip
drip
drips
Then, Lewton's hand  and pulls the monitor plug, creating tiny  at the connection
the alcohol ignites
her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box
In the b

turns, holding her sheet of bubble wrap, shocked by the flames
On the screen, the reflection of the approaching shadow passes before the monitor
a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat
Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap
Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock
(
) Rocky Mountain High/ Colorad-oh
She reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat, creating a flood of spurting blood
She drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen, blindly banging the turntable as she passes
The needle skips,
and settles
umercifully at the start of "Rocky Mountain High
" : - Alex walks quickly up the street
Smoke wafts before him
He turns to see a man burning leaves in the backyard
The breeze intensifies, lifting the burning debris
The smoke swirls around him
as he senses the Presence
He looks ahead
'  - mystically float past him, each on fire
senses the taunting message and breaks into a full sprint, passing through many of the burning leaves that break up into the bright orange cinders against the black sky
: - '  -  - reach the coffee mug, igniting the trickling stream leading to, and away from, the crack in the cup
Flames ride the small trickle of vodka back toward the kitchen
- '  - Valerie Lewton races in, desperately pressing her hand to her throat as she  and  on the blood from the wound
She leans over the now red sink
She turns pale from the blood loss
the flaming stream shoots up the stove, lighting the burners
behind her, the stove  in
They jump, leap like a tiger, landing on her shoulders and hair, which catch on fire
: '  - Alex approaches the front of the house
From here, nothing appears to be wrong
As he catches his breath, sweating, visually examining the house
From , a hoarse, macabre
, stunned, before he races off toward the house
'  -  - , hair and sweatshirt aflame
She desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames
On her back, on the floor, she is badly burned
Her open neck wound continues to bleed
Blood pools on the floor
In shock and moving on pure survial instincts, she reaches up
'  - ( ) - the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top
Her hand grabs it, and pulls
the draped edge of the towel pulls over the cutlery block
The knives spill out, entangled with the hand towel
(
) Ms
Lewton
Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms
Lewton pulls the knives over the counter
a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body
(
) They say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out
Alex quickly kneels next to her
She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading
Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade
As he's about to remove it
a gas line , creating a small
the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter
the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms
Lewton's body
'  - descends, the   until her face, eerily peaceful, but lifeless gray, horrifically decays
flesh rotting, worms feeding on muscle until only a skull remains
as Death arrives, her eyes are macabrely focused above her
Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death
Ms
Lewton
Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire
Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out
He quickly removes another and another
yet there is no reaction from the woman
Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt
He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear
In that moment, another small  from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet
He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house
to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood
: '  - Alex runs with all his strength away from Valerie Lewton's home
Billy Hitchcock is riding his bicycle in Alex's direction
He stops and gets off his bike
Hey, Alex
Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street
, the
Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms
Lewton's house
from inside, an intense  propels glass from the windows
Flames engulf the entire house
even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast
In the distance,  from approaching    trucks are
He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy
then opts to run off away from the scene
Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood
: /
-  '  -  - Tense, her eyes look left, then right
don't know where he is
He's not talking to me
Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage
Why
She studies the men before averting her eyes
Because  didn't believe him
The agents study her
Weine accepts the explanation
Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash
Clear tenses, however
If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us
Schreck hands his card
She takes it and nods
Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car
as she looks at the business card
: - Flight 180 Memorial, lit for dramatic effect at night, but only achieving an eeriness
Carter Horton and Billy Hitchcock  , moving toward the monument
Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders
Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument
Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone
Clear Rivers appears from the shadows
What are you doing
Terry's name should be on this wall
Clear is touched by the action
(') So, why'd you want us to meet you here
Now
They're watching me, see if  go to Alex
Are you
They'll follow my car
(beat) That's why you're taking me
Why would  want to see him
Clear eyes the two of them
With the memorial standing behind them
Because he knows which one of us is next
As Carter and Billy feel the chill of their inner fears
: - The muscle car  onto
17 on ramp
sign near the road indicates: "Middletown - 25 mi
New York City - 105 mi
" '  - Carter checks the rearview mirror
Clear looks out the front passenger window
She shakes her head, as if "no one's following us
" Billy leans forward from the backseat
Um
okay
drive the speed limit, right
He sits back,   , but quickly darts forward
(') And don't pass on the right
Billy
'm gettin' a vision
You're the next one
(nervous) Hey, man, why'd you say that
'Cause if you say another word, 'm gonna fuckn' kill ya
Billy sits back, gesturing, "hear ya
Got it
" Clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness, her thoughts a million miles away
-     - posted sign indicates "
(212)555-
"   Carter's car pulling up to a stop
Clear opens the passenger door and pauses in the car a while
He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the shore
You guys drive down there, start this way and we'll meet around the middle
It'll take half the time
Clear closes the door
Carter and Billy drive off
As she looks to the beach
: - ,  the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic
The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome
Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea
Behind him,
, approaching in the sand,
He listens, notes them
Yet rather than turn around
he looks up into the sky
'  - The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above
(
) Are they up there
Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand
He neddn't turn to know who is behind him
(') Somehow
is 180 still in flight
Somewhere
are they still safe
Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky
When  was a kid, like, six or seven
used to worry so much about my parents dying
Like lying awake at night
just worrying loved them so much
didn't want them to get hurt
And what would happen to me
What would life be like
(beat) Every night
it seemed
She looks out at the stars
He doesn't eye her, either
Most kids do,  guess
Most kids never have it happen
Alex hangs his head
When  was ten
my dad went into a 7-11 for cigerettes
guess he heard somebody say "Don't turn around
" So on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was jokin'
he did
And the guy blew his head off
She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying
(') And, let me tell ya,  had every reason to worry before
because life became shit
don't blame her, guess, but my mom couldn't deal with it at all
She married this asshole, who my mom with my real dad would cross the street to avoid this guy
He really didn't want a kid
And so my mom didn't either anymore,  guess
(beat) If that was the design for my father
and my family
then fuck Death,
The waves continue to shore
Clear looks up at the sky
(') And so, anyway
've thought of that "somewhere," Alex
It exists, that place
He looks at her
(') Where my dad is still safe
Where he had a full pack of cigerettes and kept driving
place where me and my dad and my mom
are still together
and have no idea about this second life, here
(beat) place where our friends are still in the sky
where everyone gets a second chance
She looks at him
(') But that place might only exist in my heart
And maybe, now
yours haven't experienced too many second chances in my life
haven't seen any
But because of all of this, believe
because of you
will get a second chance
Because of me, you will
With you in my life
that place, right now existing in our hearts, will spring out
and become a real part of this life
Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair
And that is the only way we can beat Death
by making something special out of Life
His eyes well with tears
Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional
they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation
They dive into a deep feverish kiss
Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer
She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head
This won't be safe
Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away
No
mean,  don't have anything on me
This won't be safe
(sadly) Nothing is
anymore
Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death
He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms
as the young man and woman make love in the sand
consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them
including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above
: '  - Carter drives
Billy rides shotgun
Alex and Clear are in the back
Everyone anxious, looking for cops
can't go home
After Lewton's, they'll be after me
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house
(to Carter) Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us
Carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex
Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock
did you know about Ms
Lewton, or what
Why do you think  was hiding
Billy told the
he saw you runnin' away from her house
They blame me for everything
Her, Tod, the plane crash
Your shoe prints were in the blood
Your fingerprints on the knives
already told you
(interrupting) 'm not talkin' about if you did it
Or if you knew she was dead
(beat) Did you know she was going to be next
before she was
Alex looks at Clear, her expression asking the same question
(quietly) Yeah
(almost to himself) When she died
at that moment, could tell she saw something
horrible
The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be
Out of us
who's next to see it
Alex eyes them
hesitant to respond
Please tell me 'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl
Me, right
That's why you're not saying
Billy looks out the window, despondent
Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool, that time
(to Billy) Whatta you whinin' about
He said 'm next
He didn't say nothin'
Just drive
You have a responsibility to tell me
Is knowing going to make it easier
It makes it harder
You get off havin' control over me
Let me choose how to deal with it
It doesn't matter who's next
we're all on the same list
The three are silent
Aww, fuck
really
Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this
He counters with an irrational bravado
Then why bother
What's the fuckin' point
Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer
Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the
- The muscle car  past a stop sign
'  - The interior bounces as the car clears a dip past the intersection
Alex, Clear, and Billy tenses
Knock it off
May as well go out under my own free will, right
Not with us in the fuckin' car
- The car   through another stop sign
'  - Every passenger hangs on as the car  from the next dip
Stop it
Hey, c'mon, man

Only me, right
No
Knock it off
- Red light
car approaches with the greenlighted right of way
Carter's car   , just missing being -boned in the intersection as the other car   , fishtailing
'  - And  fuckin'
Carter, stop it, you          Get control of yourself
fuckin' maniac
That's what 'm doin'

It's alright to be scared, Carter
You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are
Not now
'm not afraid
' control my life

Watch it

- Carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection
'  - ' flying down the road, appears to be heading straight towards him
'  - Carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air, like a terrorized child on a roller coaster
- The turning car ,  through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car
'  - Cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat, driving; no hands
Stop the car
Let us out
am
so close to puking, you don't wanna know
We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're not going to quit
Maybe you are
You act like you're not, but you are
Carter eyes Clear in the rearview mirror
So, stop what you're doing and Right fucking now
- In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease
just as a railroad crossing arm drops   in the
, the    of a
The front crossing arm drops   before the car
Carter turns and flashes a "that's why  stopped" smile
Move it
Carter turns off the engine, then sits back into his seat and folds his arms, indicating he has no intention of moving
Billy, get out
Scared to death, Billy fumbles with the car door handle
From the front passenger seat, he looks up and to his left
'  - ' locomotive headlight arcs across the trees
approaching
Can't you open the door
Easy, Billy, just open it
Billy collects himself
- ' open
- The train appears around the blind bend
'  - Billy opens the door and pours out
Clear and Alex are quickly behind him
Carter remains in the drivers seat
- The train    as Alex, Clear and Billy hustle away from the car, on the same side of the tracks
They quickly turn around, desperate to convince
Carter, get out
Don't do it
Don't do it
It's coming
It's coming
'  - Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat
As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is
With a beam of cocky definace
It ain't my time
He cooly turns back to the ignition, grabs the key and turns it over
only to be met with the   of a dead engine
his   with tension
- he turns it, again and again
nothing
looks up
-  - '  - is moments away
, assess the situation
Get out
Get out of the car
Get out
Get out of the Get out of the fuckin' car

'  - As he turns away from them, Carter sees something in the rearview mirror
'  - the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness
as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and  the button
He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move
He's strapped in
He tries to open the door
it won't open
He pulls at the door handle
tugs at the seatbelt
panicked
Horrified, he whips towards the others
can't get out
- Alex, Billy and Clear look at one another, equally frightened
Man, he really is next
Alex takes off toward
' Alex hustles around the drivers' side
as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt
the
tense, as the train nears
Alex grabs Carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the driver's window
- ' the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle, however, after it passes
the seat belt begins to
As    to  and he releases a deep
The train   the front end of the muscular car
and   as the locomotive
must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass
Alex holds Carter by the shirt at the shoulders, dragging him away from the wreckage
The two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to
as the heavy train wheels  and , a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris  upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels
run to the two survivors
runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight
, , Carter lies on the road, urine stains around his crotch, hyperventilating and near tears
Scared now
Carter looks at the piece of seatbelt
It broke
No one's that strong
(to Carter) Bullshit
He saved your life
again
- continue to kick around the chunk of twisted metal
The   intensifies the situation
'
' ' Billy begins backing away from the others
,
'
Billy continues backing away, horrified
' '
- the debris rattles beneath the wheels
still on the ground
,
'
backing away
'
' the debris bounces directly on the track
With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half
It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile
(') ' '
The metal tears  , ripping Billy's head from his shoulders
, The  of the  seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock
- The train   and is gone
, across the tracks, Alex, Clear and Carter can do nothing but watch Billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground
Jesus fucking Christ
For a beat, there is
until, in the distance,  can be heard, approaching
As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs
none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body
(to Carter) You should have been next
After Lewton, you should've been next
That's the only pattern
You should be dead
You're the fuckin' devil
(to Clear) But  saved him
intervened
Just like the plane
That's the design
Police are coming
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy
Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany
(') My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design
"Intervention
" What are you, God now
Of course not
Gods aren't afraid to die
Gods don't die
We do
You're losin' it
The police will be here
We have to go to the cabin
You can hide there
Get your head together
Alex considers, mind racing
then realizes
After Billy
it's me
And then you
Clear grabs Clear and touches her face
(') (to Clear) Hey,  won't let it happen, okay
Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes
or will help
Then, get out of here
As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter
She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods
In the , a   , eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment
: - The windows are boarded
The front steps are worn and dilapidated
In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly
the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves
In the distance
-  - final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges
Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled
The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light
a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat
finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach
Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible
An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern
Dark circles, from lack of sleep
Thin, from lack of food
Pale, from lack of sunlight
He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread
With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls
Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can
Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat
as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until
after steadying himself
prepares to swallow
then, carefully does
Pause
he's alright
He takes the spoon
Scoops some more
And the process begins again
: -  '  - pink circle fills
- ' look downward, anxious and full of thought
the results are positive, two pink dots, confirming
Clear sighs, frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests
You can never be too sure
Outside,  of an approaching storm blows
tensely    Clear
: -  - The resulting
breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves
the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter
, sitting in his safe chair
Paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events
Following the path of the breeze, Alex turns around
'  - the brown shopping bag tips over
Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor
tenses
He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going
'  - rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner
The pole teeters and falls over
falls, hooking a closet door
The door begins to swing open
is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards
Alex slams the door shut before it can open
Behind the door, a  as something falls
Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition
Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor
He cautiously opens the door,  an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware
Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor
a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor
Alex bends down and examines them
(as if to Death) Rusted
Tetanus
Nice touch
(defiant) overlooked it
You tried to capitalize
But  caught you, you fuck
can beat you
Not forever, but  got this cabin rigged to beat you
, a sound
Like a  near the cabin steps
He freezes, like an animal sensing danger
The light around him begins to flicker and sway
a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure
The flame, dancing
: -  '  - , Clear peeks out the window, careful not to be seen
'  -  - ' The unmarked
sedan maintains surveillance
Schreck and Weine sit inside
-  '  - Distant
as she steps away
The weight of the world on her shoulders, Clear paces, considering her options
She looks to a bookshelf
- man, early thirties, holds a six year old girl in his arms, waving at the camera
Both appear happy and alive
They are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods
The photograph is turned over
On the back is marked in a young girl's handwriting, "me and dad at the cabin
1986
" As
considering life
Then, now and what is to come
: - Weine sits in the passenger seat looking through the pair of binoculars
Schreck is behind the wheel
She was up there a minute ago
figure steps into the drivers side window, from the rear
The two agents are startled as Clear Rivers leans into
She pauses, gauging their trustworthiness, then
'm not turning him in
There's another life that needs him now
The two agents remain respectful
go with you
You can't
She considers
and understands
Don't hurt him
Tell us where he is
Wait at home, and  promise
we'll bring him back safe, in protective custody
As she senses the agents' sincerity
- Distant
Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers
He begins to crumble the local news
then pauses
headline catches his attention
, tense, while
As he unrolls the paper, his expression is rocked
anxious
he cocks his head to consider
recalling
as
- "
" Besides the headline are two yearbook photos; Christa Marsh and Blake Dreyer
his expression reflects a terrifying revelation

Christa asked me to move, but  didn't change seats
would've moved up
next to Tod
How could  not remember
that

: '  - Clear paces in her living room
She moves to the curtains and checks out the window
Although it is not raining,   across the sky
'  -  - The lightning  the top of the pole,  two power lines, which whip in the wind
'  - The power goes out
The room turns dark
Outside, brilliant bluish white arc lights
Clear moves to the window
'  -  - '  - violently striking the ground and each other
Each line whips unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full
And yet, there's a mean, angry and taunting personality to the two power lines
As if Death were within them
'  - She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic
, from the backyard, a
Clear brings the candle through the small house
-  '  - Clear moves quickly to the kitchen, holding the candle
Outside,
She looks out the backyard
-  '  -  - ' An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind
In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool
In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree,
An old tire swing rocks in the storm
From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard
The power line  the ground, "closing in on" the dog
-  '  - Clear considers the danger of venturing out to get the dog
Although no window is open, and the power outage has shut off any air conditioning
the candle flame whips, then extinguishes
The blue smoke swirls ominously into the room
-  '  -  - Sharp metal edges spin
Glinting blue arc light
: - Alex charges out the front door, leaping over the steps
,   , headlights pan across the trees
Alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods, just as the
umarked sedan and three Sheriff 4x4s  up to the cabin, siren lights swirling
- Weine is driving, leading the other vehicles
Schreck points out the passenger window
There
-  - '  - Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest
the cars  to a stop,  in the dirt
Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles
High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction
The officers take after the suspect
: -  '  - The backdoor opens
Clear charges out into the backyard
Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree
continues to run

as the base pole snaps in two
the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her
She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree

Water streams from the rupture

holding the pool frame begin to  and
Water floods into the yard
: - Alex, blindly running through the forest, sheriffs' flashlight beams crossing behind him
in pursuit
Looing back to check the postition of the agents, Alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope
He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside
As he nears the base
stops with a
his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch
No time to catch his breath, he's up and running
: -  '  -  - ' water floods, pooling the backyard, cascading over Clear's feet
She looks down, in the reflection of the puddle, the dark shadow passes
Clear whips up, checking the position of
coils, like a cobra, ready to
Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside
Run
The dog starts to tear off toward the house
Clear runs toward the hanging tire
Leaps
whips, the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water
in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life
, the dog
Clear turns back
'  - convulses in the small pool of water, burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity
: -  - Distant flashlights reflect in a small stream, barely two inches deep
Alex's foot splashes in the water
races along the path of the stream
continue their pursuit through the dark trees
Lightning  a tree branch
The tree tumbles down the branches
The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him
He's knocked to the ground and pinned
face down in the creek
his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move
His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles
battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water
As he struggles in the f
g
, Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him
They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest
'  - the lights actually expose the area where Alex lies
From their postition, however, he is covered by the branch and out of sight
struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting
believing Alex is not in the area, move ahead into the woods
: -  ' Clear pulls herself up to a tree branch
Lighting and   amongst the ,
She searches for an escape
'  - extends toward the house
straining in the storm, begins moving up the branch
: -  -  - ' dart open
Taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength, all his courage, he arches his back, pushing with his hands, anything to lift his face out of the stream
With a  , he does so
Drinking up the air
It appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch
He pauses only for a couple gulps of air
and is off
: -  '  - Clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window, grabbing the sill awkwardly, she dangles outside the house
With a breath, she pulls herself inside, just as the power line bites, , at her feet
: - Weine   , looks around, frustrated
(into radio) Lost him
- deperately scans the area
From the direction
there's only one place he can heading
: '  - The power lines strike the rooftop
'  - Clear River's stands in her bedroom just as it fills with blinding blue light
Her television screen
Sparks jet across the room
Blasts of  erupt from the electrical outlets
She quickly turns, racing toward the hallway
-  '  - ,    as    the lamps and electrical outlets
She cuts and leaps three steps at a time down the staircase
: / - Alex tears across the fenceless backyards towards Clear's house
Blue  light glowing from the front yard
: -  '  - mid-eighties Corolla is parked amongst Clear's artwork

Clear hustles through, running to the car and entering via the passenger door, for the sake of expediency

- Clear scoots into the driver's seat
She  the automatic garage door opener
connected to a metal arm, attached to the door, remains motionless - there is no power
- Realizing the motor is dead, Clear takes a beat,    and
-  '  - Alex reaches the backyard
as he quickly tries to deduce the deadly situation
-  '  - Clear guns the small car in reverse
as the rear of the car makes impact with the door
trembles, the long metal arm collapses, falls
-  '  - In reverse, the Corolla  through the garage door
of the garage door opener  through the windshield, locking upon the windshield wiper grille
The other end remains attached to the garage roof interior, essentially acting as an anchor

The electrical system of the samll car erupts and the engine dies
The car stops
-  '  - From the rear of the house appears Alex
as he reacts to the situation
Don't move
The power line sadistically rests atop the automobile
The exposed end of the cable flutters and whips like a cat's tail, , , as it hits the ground

You're grounded in the car

Suddenly, a
reacts, shocked
He realizes
the underbelly of the Corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid
step forward
atop the car, whips, , warning everyone away
Clear can see the flames, her instinct is to grab the handle to get out
'  - The fire roars angrily in the f
g
, on the garage wall, however, the shadows do not match that of the flames, rather, the approaching form of Death appears
steps closer
as he quickly considers, then moves toward the hood of the burning car
Get back
You'll both die
hearing this, Alex's mind is made up
He looks to Clear
You know what to do
No
No
Don't
When  do this
it'll have skipped you
and it'll all be over
At that moment, Clear doesn't understand
She looks to him, scared
You know what to do
'll always be with you
He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car
The cable  furiously
Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car
is engulfed in the flames
'  - the edges of the  are collapsing
Alex's face, gray and emotionless appears, yet, before it can transform into decay
through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image
He looks toward
- ' She
is the last sight he'll ever see
The power line
Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway
Schreck, Weine and  rush to the girl
Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car
Is he alive
' flash open, horrified, answering the question
a web of   across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation
on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right
- As a pair of paramedics work on her, a soft breeze blows across the girl, and only the girl

He's here

Clear begins to laugh euphorically through the tears

When the baby was born

like the night he died
Clear lifts her head up, still battling the pain of labor
'  - covered in goop, eyes shut
a new life arrives

Another nurse cleans up the baby, wieghs him and places him in a hospital bassinet

Exactly a year
to the minute
Everyone recognizes the eerie, yet beautiful coincidence
Clear leans her haed back, relieved, euphoric
We beat it, Alex
Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms
The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the
braclet

billows the cutains, posters and photos on the wall
until seemingly settling over the bassinet
The lace trim and blankets rustled by the breeze, it is hovering over the child
, but her expression does not reflect fear
She knows Alex is here
and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes
the bassinet trim settles, as if the presence is leaving
Before it fully departs
the wind softly and rapidly passes over Clear
He smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room

Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve
Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller

He hesitates, then turns back to Clear
Alex was right
Clear looks up

Clear smiles
As she takes the baby out of the stroller

that's what Alex believed
But how do we know
