"  " by Tony Gilroy Based on the novel by Robert Ludlum 9/20/00 -- The darkness is actually water
arcs across heavy ocean swells
Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging struggling with a gaff -- something in the water -- -- sprawled there
The Sailors all talking at once -- three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence of death -- #1 -- Jesus, look at him -- #2 -- what
-- you never saw a dead man before
-- #3 -- look, look he was shot -- (nudging the body --) #1 -- don't, don't do that -- #2 -- he's dead, you think he cares
-- #1 -- so have some respect -- it's a -- (stopping as --) -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as -- begins to breathe
-- wreck
Too small for all the people in here right now -- sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying down -- -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the door as -- tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical kit buried in the shambles
is sixty
bloodshot soul
-- it's here -- hang on -- it's here somewhere -- give me a minute -- get some blankets -- get some blankets on him -- (finding the kit --) -- here we go -- here it is -- with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as -- Giancarlo
(Giancarlo turns back --) We pick him up
Okay, we have to pick him up
But that's as far as it goes
He needs a doctor
Fuck that
He lives
He dies
don't care
We've wasted two hours on this shit already
You do what you can, but we're not going back
(pure steel now) You understand me
Yes, sir
(to the rest of them) Let's get back to work
watching them run out
Snagging a quick pull on a pint of rum he's got stashed and -- --  -- Transformed into a makeshift operating room
light swings overhead
layed out across the table
Sounds -- groans -- words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages
playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron
Cutting away the clothes
Turning   on his side
Two bullet wounds in the back
Probing them, judging them
Now --  with a flashlight in his teeth --  -- --  -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out olive jar
Now -- something catching '  -- '  -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- tweezers extracting    , not a bullet at all, and as it comes free -- '   down onto ' and we -- -- we are staring up at -- You're awake
Can you hear me
(we're blinking --) You've been shot
'm trying to help you
(we're trying to find our voice --) You were in the water
You've been shot
It's okay now
Where am
(switching to English) You're American
thought so
From your teeth -- the dental work -- Where am
You're on a boat
fishing boat
Italian flag
We're out of Vietri
(he smiles) It's the cold that saved you
The water
The wounds are clean
'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay
It's clean
How did  get here
You we're lost at sea
They pulled you out
(we say nothing) Who are you
(still nothing) You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back
You understand me
(we try to nod) Who are you
Long dead pause
don't know
-- The Trawler plows through heavy seas
-- is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of 's hip
is bandaged
He's sitting up, and it must hurt like hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right now
He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the walls -- haunted -- What if it doesn't come back
(still working that tube) told you
You need to rest
Silence
can't rest
Too busy trying to make sense of all this
can read
can read that sign on the door
can count
can talk
(focusing now --) What are you doing
rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass -- What is that
--   -- a slip of plastic from the tube -- written there -- 000-7-17-12-0-14-26
, It came from your hip
Under the skin
(turning back --) You have a bank in Zurich
(waiting) You remember Zurich
No
staring at him now
Different suddenly
Suspicious
Look, 'm just on this boat, okay
'm an engineer
Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay
don't remember Zurich
pulls his pint
Takes a hit
(offering the bottle --) You drink rum
don't know
-- stands at the rail, staring out to sea
So lost
He turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped against a locker
picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- now he's casting far out into the darkness
And for the first time, he smiles
-- ratty old espresso machine
standing there, staring at the thing like it's a test
Then his hands begin to move -- trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on the steam and -- The whole thing explodes
-- alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail
He's still bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing himself
Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping that it will hold some answer for him
-- chess board
Wooden pieces jumbled in a box hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers for a moment -- and then places it on the board
He's off and running
He knows this
Placing pieces faster and faster -- still setting it up, as we -- -- One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet
standing before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror
Staring at himself
And then he speaks
(in perfect French) don't know who  am
Do you know who  am
Do have any idea who  am
And then he stops
Blinks
Wipes away the perspiration just beading on his forehead
(in perfect Dutch) Tell me who  am
If you know who am, please stop fucking around and tell me
No answer
Just that face
His face
Who am
And what else is inside there
-- hauling in the nets
-- still bandaged, but healing -- working beside them
Earning his keep
Getting healthy
-- small, colorful fishing village
The trawler motoring in
-- buttoning up borrowed clothes
pulling some cash from his pocket -- (offering the money) It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland
won't forget this
gives him a look
Shakes his head, and -- -- The ticket window
and a
Una sola via
Si
One way
Una sola via
-- -- a bullet train speeds through snow- capped Alps
We move in on a window -- and staring out is
-- People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- normal people going about their lives
turns back to the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking at his reflection
So lost
His face suddenly plunged into darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel
-- and out of the darkness into night and the , as the train races toward
-- --   -- meet
He's an African ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu
He's in some sort of throne room
And he's angry
Bodyguards and a translator hovering nervously around him
What this is, is -- an interview conducted by a German  station
(he speaks english) no, no, no -- the time is not right, my enemies are too strong
'm telling you to wait for this, you understand
'm telling you this, and 'm making a warning to all those peoples out there that think that my powers have become so weak that they can play with me as they wish
You will see --  will tell you when the evidence is clear
Then you will have a story
My old friends will hear about themselves
(stopping, freezing on that image, and --) , a  bigwig has the remote control
And the floor
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris the day before yesterday
'm sure most of you have a passing knowledge of Mr
Wombosi
Some of you on the African desks have worked with him over the years
Some of you very closely
sitting around the table like kids in detention
We will tour the faces as  continues, but the guy we're interested in is named
Picture a sawier, slicker John Poindexter
He was an irritation before he took power
He was a problem when he was in power
And he's been a disaster for us in exile
(the tape --) Wombosi likes to send us messages through the European media
This is an interview we pulled down from a local German television station in Dresden
We've been getting these little broadsides every couple of months
He knows this -- he knows that -- he's writing a book about the Agency's history in Africa -- he's going to name names
It's basically a shakedown
'  says this is news to him
suggest otherwise
This interview -- and 'll make the tape available for anyone who wants it -- he goes on to claim that he has just survived an assassination attempt
He says it's us
He says he's got proof
(beat) The overwhelming negative ramifications of this should be obvious
(hard and dry) The Director wants to know if there is any possible shred of truth in this accusation
Long pause
No hands go up
-- wandering through the terminal
Passing closing up for the night
checks his funds
Just enough for one cold slice
-- walking aimlessly
-- trying to get comfortable on a bench
It's chilly but this will have to do until morning
Just settling in, when -- #1 (
) (authority German) Can't you read the signs
turns
coming toward him
#2 On your feet
Let's go
Right now
makes his feet
They're on top of him now
#1 The park is closed
There's no sleeping in the park
#2 Let's see some identification
not sure what to do
Eyes moving
Mouth shut
#1 Come on
Your papers
Let's go
've lost them
've
(German now) My papers
They are lost
#1 (not sympathetic) Okay
Let's go
Put your hands up
#2 (pulling his nightstick) -- come on -- hands up -- up -- raising his hand slowly --   #1 reaching up to pat him down -- -- look, 'm just trying to sleep okay
-- (German again) --  just need to sleep -- #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with the nightstick -- into  's back -- and that's the last thing he'll remember because -- is in motion
single turn -- spinning -- catching  #2 completely off guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat and -- #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and -- #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to fight back but --   -- like a machine -- just unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down- down and --  #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and -- #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air -- struggling with his holster --   -- his foot -- down -- like a vise -- onto  #2's arm -- shattering the bone -- #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because -- -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's got it right up against  #2's forehead -- right on the edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him -- #2 (gasping, pleading) -- no -- please God no -- please don't -- please no -- my Go -- stopping as -- slams the gun against his temple and -- This fight is over
standing there
In the silence
Two unconscious cops at his feet
Blood on his pants
What just happened
How did he do this
And there's   in his hand
And God, it just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done a million times before
This is something he definitely knows how to do
And then he stops cold
Throwing down the gun
Running off into the darkness -- -- deep, inner office
An ops office
Operations
Unlabeled and anonymous
backwater project center hidden deep within the Langley facility
Utilitarian
Several rooms linked like a suite
Small staff
One or two for communications
couple for research
People are at their posts
And it's all quiet
But they are busy
Quietly urgent
This is a place under siege
is the number two here
Brilliant bloodless lapdog
He's coming through the suite
Coming through quickly
Heading toward the boss's little office at the back -- Ivy League Ollie North
Buttoned down
Square jaw
Everything tucked away
But there's tension in the air
Work on the desk
Cot in the corner
(looking up) What
Abbott wants to talk
Tell him we're busy
tried
-- with coffee
not lingering
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted
It looks like rain and  don't have a thing to wear
don't know what we're talking about
We're talking about Marseille
We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi
And 'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone
(silence) Was this Treadstone
You're asking me a direct question
Yes
thought you were never going to do that
Silence
Pressure drop
They're putting together an agency oversight committee
They're going to look through everyone's budgets
Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger
(beat) What am  going to do about that
You'd want to make that go away
You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization
That it's all theoretical
You'd want to sign off on that
And what if  couldn't do that
Then 'd have to explain Treadstone
And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far
(silence) Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-, does it
(Abbott staring) We'll clean up the field
You clean up your budgets
-- Morning in the financial district
Upscale
Uptight
just one of many elegant fortresses on this street
Everything just now opening for business unlocking the front door and -- across the street
Tucked in the shadows
Checking for cops and trouble
Looks clear
He's walking and -- -- Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time
Can  help you
standing before her
Looking very out of place
'm here about a numbered account
nods
Pulls a pen and bank card
(instant English) If you'll just enter your account number here 'll direct you to the appropriate officer
takes the pen, as we -- -- -
piece of ultra-tech amidst the Baroque
manning the equipment
standing there, staring down at this machine
Something ominously decisive about this
What if it's him
What if it's not
#1 They've been waiting your hand, sir
focuses
Here we go --   #2 guiding his open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface
catching his reflection for a moment before a wave of white light passes beneath his hand and now -- -- being led by    to a special elevator
-- Elevator doors open
steps out
-- anal Zurich banker -- waiting there
Good morning, sir
assume you're here about your box
yes
(what now
) The box
nods
Gestures down the corridor -- -- Sterile and kind of odd
But total privacy
sitting there, as    places a large before him
leaves the room
Closing the door behind him
is alone
And there it is, right in front of him
This is it
Here are the answers
He lifts the lid
There's a shallow tray on top
In this tray: a beat- up passport in the name of Jason Bourne
French driver's license with a Parisian address
Credit cards for Jason Bourne
Holding these objects close -- as if by holding them he might absorb their essence
Forcing himself to believe
This is him
His picture
There it is
He's Jason Bourne
My name is Jason Bourne
(sounds good) Hi, 'm Jason
Jason Bourne
Jason Bourne, nice to meet you
--   -- the shallow tray on top
There's Kleenex
Several sets of contact lenses
knife
comb
Three sticks of gum
ring
pair of sunglasses
Rolex
setting these things aside
Lifting the top tray
Staring into     and -- First of all
Lots of it
Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds
Lots of them
Close to a million dollars
There's very good gun
Several clips of ammo
And
All clean
Crisp
Brand new
All with his photo inside
Five different names
Three different Countries
Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a piece of card stock that says: : : : : And a bar code
Two Dutch passports
French
South African
Belgian
And
There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in place
And no passport
This card reads: : John Michael Kane :
: Paris, France There's a signature sample
And a bar code
But no passport
This one is missing
sitting there
Trying to push his confusion away
Bourne
My name is Jason Bourne live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris
But there's something hollow about this
He came looking for one identity and now he's faced with six
The money
The gun
Suddenly, it's all fucked up
into gear
Looking around the room -- there -- there's a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner
grabbing one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except
The gun
He doesn't want the gun
No guns
-- is done
Handing the box back to    -- 'm trying to think how long it's been since  was here
'm not sure
Must be three weeks
--  -- exits the bank
The red bag full to its limit
He's walking briskly now
Looking for a taxi
Nothing in sight
crossing the street
Shit, there's   on the corner -- turn -- change pace -- make it look natural -- around a corner
And it's looking good for a moment -- but only a moment --    walking a beat -- walking this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street -- heading down a boulevard
Trying to look small
Pulse starting to race
Fighting the paranoia
Where the hell is a cab
Turning back fast as   starts bleeding in from behind him -- It's just an ambulance
turning back
Forcing himself to focus
And fuck -- there's   , and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- she's staring at him and -- trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but -- -- she's watching him go and she's pulling her radio and -- hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing himself not to run -- glancing back and -- '   -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- he's got his radio out and -- -- bailing on the street -- disappearing into -- -- Big gates
Speed barricades
standing guard near a gate house
An American flag
Lots of people coming and going
playing it as normal as possible as he heads for the entrance
--   -- The passport and visa office
Big room
No windows
Unpleasant on purpose
Two lines:  short one for
Citizens, a marathon for everyone else
stationed in open cubicles along the back wall
And it's a zoo
American tourists who've lost their passports
Foreigners looking for visas
Asylum seekers
Everyone here has a problem
on the
line
Standing there trying to think
What's he gonna say
What can he say
With the cops outside, and the incident in the park, then the bank
(
) -- no, this is not my current address
It was my current address two days ago when  started standing in line outside -- Meet
German
Big energy
Real beauty hidden beneath the armor
And armor it is, because this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode
-- and so now  lost my apartment, have no address, and  have no visa, and you keep telling me how much help you cannot give me
caught in her headlights
Miss Kreutz, please
'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for --  brought all the papers -- Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States -- You only know that because  told you
(she's incredulous) Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers --  told him all this myself
-- (tearing through the papers now --) -- it's not the source of the information that's important here -- --  paid this fucking guy --  paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay
--  told this to the case officer last week
(she's found it --) here -- Mr
Thomas
told Mr
Thomas  didn't know this guy was already married --  admitted this
-- Miss Kreutz, please -- -- 'm the one that got ripped off
-- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- 'm the one being ripped off
So now you're asking for a student visa
That shuts her up
Yes
Today she's a student
--  (  ) Motion --  racing down a staircase --  chasing after -- -- and they're sure it's him
-- -- he accessed the account -- -- but it was him -- -- yes, sir, it's confirmed -- --   -- on line
Fear meter rising by the minute
' Scanning the room -- the perimeter -- the people -- almost in tears as he tries to explain his case to a --    that have lost their passports --  still in the midst of her madness -- high on the wall capturing everything -- lots of data -- too much going on and -- (
) (from behind him) You're up
comes to
Shit
It's his turn
waving him forward
trying to think -- what the fuck is he doing
-- what's he gonna say
-- now he's at the window, and if he was looking for a friendly face, he came to the wrong place -- (cold shit) You're a
Citizen
Yes
(pause) mean,  think so
Yes
Yes
Well, either you are, or you aren't
Right
You have your passport
have a passport
've got
(the bag there, but
) Actually, it's a little complicated
Do you have your passport, sir
Look, maybe  should just
Sir, you waited on line
Yeah,  know
But he's already bailing, walking away from the woman, the window, the room -- he's out of here -- -- on the move -- hustling back toward the lobby -- trying to snag a view out to the street -- there's a window just ahead and -- '   --   -- outside -- on the street -- half-a-dozen of them lingering around the entry gate and -- stalled for a moment -- options dwindling -- he can't go back to the passport office -- he can't go out the front and -- The lobby looks tough -- there are two other points of entry into the main building, but they're both guarded by and   -- As he gets closer -- it gets worse -- near the door, in deep conversation with   and     and -- trying to burrow through the human traffic -- trying to get to        -- this one the farthest from the front door and the passport office corridor, and it's the most crowded --    lined up here -- waiting for one of       to check their bags and pass them through a metal detector and -- (
) -- stop
-- stop right there
-- turns back -- as does everyone else in the lobby -- (from across the lobby) --  -- red bag -- the red bag -- stop right there
-- hands up
-- glancing back --        -- the guy's raising his -16 -- -- you heard him -- let's move it
-- down -- let's go
-- nodding -- total compliance -- starting to drop -- but only starting, because now -- He's swinging the backpack and -- -- nailed -- blind-sided -- no chance and -- -- all motion -- all forward -- all perfect -- vaulting the metal detector even as he pulls around to shield his back and -- -- right there -- trying to grab him -- making his move --  -- almost an afterthought -- his boot -- like a knife -- out of nowhere --
-- the guy's arm just shattered and -- -- freaking out --     -- they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby and -- -- no -- no -- hold your fire
-- -- landing hard on    -- rolling away from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the backpack and -- -- he's got a gun
-- he's got a gun
-- And he does --  with the -16
-- coming up with it -- coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches for an escape route and   -- it's like a magic wand of hysteria -- --  -- diving away -- everyone dropping for cover and -- -- bailing -- on the run -- sprinting down a hallway -- tossing away the -16 as he sprints into the building -- (frantic on his radio now --) -- red
-- red
-- red
-- code red
-- South side entrance
-- male -- five- ten, brown hair -- black jacket -- red bag -- -- Quiet for a second -- offices on either side of a carpeted hallway -- - doing their thing, when suddenly -- #1 Excuse me
Can  help you
(but backing up as he says it, because --) Here comes  -- coming fast -- and he definitely does not belong back here -- /  -- Panic -- people fleeing the lobby --   hustling in from outside and -- -- Door flies open --  bombing in -- shit
-- it's a dead end -- no way out but up the stairs -- -- --   -- sidearms drawn -- jogging past the   -- running beside them, a frantic guy in a suit -- -- what're you talking about
-- -- we're evacuating the building -- -- we're in the middle of a trade meeting
-- -- call the code
--  want everyone out
-- -- you gotta give me more to go on -- -- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and  don't know where
-- -- climbing fast -- two -- three -- stairs at a time -- racing up as a     -- bleet -- bleet -- bleet -- -   -- ringing everywhere --   -- sixty confused and frightened people -- spilling out into the corridor -- -- flying open -- it's  -- ready for anything, but there's nothing -- he's in a butler's prep area off the main conference room -- momentum stalled for a moment -- nothing in here but tablecloths and silverware and coffee cups and -- -- -- armed and stoked -- staring up the stairs -- leapfrogging -- point-to-point assault procedure -- -- Carpeted and grand --   with    -- charging up -- pushing past   trying to come down and -- -- Completely clogged now --    all over -- -- trying to herd them toward the main stairs -- everyone talking at once --     and -- (
) -- no
-- the other way
-- take the backstairs
-- the backstairs
-- he's on the other side -- there's a bomb
-- And as the crowd reacts -- as they mob back away from the main stairway -- we see -- holy shit, the guy yelling was -- -- -- still climbing -- weapons out -- clean and fast -- one more flight to go -- ready for anything -- completely freaking out as the door above them on the fifth floor flies open and -- --
--
-- swinging up -- trigger fingers tense and -- '
and now '  and this combined with   and and        and -- -- -- he's    behind him -- he's jamming -- wedging it in tight so the door won't open and -- -- --   -- coming from the main stairs -- weapons drawn -- fighting their way through the pandemonium and -- -- scanning for options -- the room is huge -- empty now -- the massive conference table covered with the meeting papers left behind -- windows along one wall and -- rushes to the window staring down and -- ' Fifty feet below there's a courtyard -- it's a sheer drop -- completely fucked and -- -- --   -- just outside -- trying it -- it won't budge and -- -- blow it -- shoot it open
-- -- -- shattering -- eaten up by
-- -- ----
and -- -- through the door -- guns -- eyes -- adrenaline -- everything ready and -- -- -- dangling fifty-feet above the stone courtyard
-- he's gone out the window
-- hanging there -- hanging with one hand -- one hand clutching the corner of a ledge and -- -- Utter confusion --   --  --  -- all piling in -- ready to rock but there's no one to shoot -- no target -- -- check the closets
-- get those back doors covered -- there's a kitchen back there -- go
-- go
-- go
-- scanning the windows -- looking down and -- -- all clear -- no way he went down there and -- -- still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's no choice -- he has to go down -- finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching down -- it gives way -- crumbling and -- hesitates
Does he know how to do this or not
Stalled for a moment, then
starts climbing down
And this is all one shot
No cutaway
No cheating
We are watching a master at work
Handhold to a drain pipe
Swinging to a better ledge
Dropping to an air-conditioner
Grabbing a window frame just before the air-conditioner gives way
Teetering there
Now he's on the fourth floor
Below, there's an open window on the third floor
Struggling to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight of the bag, and as he does -- falls
Thump
Into the courtyard
Forget the open window
Now he's got to go all the way
Timing his next move and -- He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and -- letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough to slow his fall and -- Letting go for the last fifteen feet and -- -- -- pumped-up and listening to -- -- we're gonna go room by room until we find him -- so let's get teamed up -- -- storming away
Pissed-off -- broke -- illegal -- ruined and -- (German) Motherfucking sonsofbitches
(a new problem --) beat-to-shit Euro car
shitty little red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich parking ticket on the windshield
grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces on the ground and stomping on them and then -- (looking up --) What are you looking at
standing across the car -- on the passenger side -- need a ride
What
need a ride out of here
Oh, Jesus
(backing away and --) Please
don't want to scare you
It's a little late for that
've got a situation here and -- Get the fuck away from my car
'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris
Great
You know what
'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before  start screaming my head off
You don't want the police any more than  do
tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car into her hands -- she catches it
Looks at it
Jesus
Get me out of here
Please
looking at him
At the money
Back at him, and -- -- --   -- fast forward -- a speeding blur of images from a surveillance camera outside the Zurich bank -- it's two days worth of footage -- they're scanning for Bourne's arrival and -- go -- keep going -- go
wait -- stop -- you went past it -- #1 working the console
Freezing the image
Punching it up
There it is --  leaving the bank with the red bag
(staring at the monitor) It's him
My God, it's really him
the phones across the room
#2 at his console -- #2 -- we got a cross-ref ready to go here, sir, we're running hotel, airline, train, and medical variables, anything else you'd like
No
(still staring at Bourne) Go ahead
Run it
(coming to --) Let's get a map, let's get a grid map on Zurich
(holding the phone) Sir
up from the console
waiting for him -- What
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag
Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night
Silence
Like the floor just fell away
So heavy
What the fuck is he doing
Maybe it's a game
Maybe he's trying to send us a message
It doesn't matter now
We've just got to be the first ones there
(decision time) Get everybody up
want them all activated
All of them
moment between them
all steel here now
You heard me
#2 (from the console --) Sir, the cross-ref is coming up cold
breaks away -- back to the console and -- -- Establishing shot
grand house
over this -- someone butchering a piece by Haydn and -- -- Meet
He's a piano teacher
Late fifties
Deceptively fit
He's sitting here, listening to a - -  struggle through the music
And then,  -  starts pulsing -- hum -- hum -- -- boring, marathon business meeting are trapped around a German sales presentation
Meet
Bald
Fifty
He looks dumb and piggy
Anything but
Sitting here -- And then,  -  starts pulsing -- hum -- hum -- -- Meet
He's thirty-five
Slender
Clean-cut
Easy to miss
He's here alone
Reading the paper
Sipping espresso
And then,  -  starts pulsing -- hum -- hum -- -- The little red car parked
pacing around
poring over a map spread out over the hood
So what's in Paris
want to go home
For twenty thousand dollars
looks back from the map
said ten thousand
You have blood on your pants
Okay
(beat) Twenty thousand
Ten now
Ten there
No
No, that was too easy -- (pacing away --) Wait up -- (after her now --) -- just wait up -- -- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer,  mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- (stopping because--) just grabbed her
Both of them shocked that he's done this
He immediately pulls back
Look,  want a ride to Paris
(wide open now) That's all  want
swear
You swear
(cold here) That's great
feel so much better now
don't want anything but a ride
All  want to do is go home
Silence now
She looks back
Measuring him
You could buy a car for twenty grand
You could buy this car
don't want to go alone
want you to drive me to Paris
Like we're a couple
Like we're a couple and we're travelling together
That's all we're doing
And  don't get hurt
get twenty thousand dollars and  don't get hurt
won't hurt you
What if  say no
Then 'll find another ride
-- through the streets on a motorcycle
Whipping to a stop -- stepping off the bike in front of -- --
-- and    -- rising slowly through the dark warehouse and -- '   -- Darkness -- a key turning -- door opening -- light goes on to reveal  standing there and we're in -- '
What's in here
Like nothing
Like a stack of old newspapers in the corner
Some mildewed books piled along one wall
Some shitty plastic chairs
working fast
Closing the door
Moving to the pile of books
Taking the top book off
Opening it
-- a timer
small bomb
booby-trap
An light stops flashing as '  code in his password and -- moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner
Pulling away the top pile and -- Hidden here
pulling it out
Opening it
An empty tray on top and -- taking off his watch
Taking off his rings
Taking out his wallet
His Spanish passport
Emptying his pockets
All of this goes into the empty tray and -- lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and -- -- there's more -- a much larger bottom compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the Zurich safe-deposit box
First of all
Lots of it
Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds
Lots of them
very good gun
dozen clips of ammo
And
All clean
Brand new
All with his photo
Five different names
Four different countries
Each one of these pristine clipped to a piece of card stock that says: : : : : : Two Italian
Two Spanish
Portuguese
going for the Portuguese passport and -- -- The little red car driving through The Alps
-- staring out the window
driving
Long silence until -- Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me
(Bourne looks over) was supposed to have this car back three days ago
It's not my car
know that
staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck -- Shit -- (trying to settle) Can  tell you how much you're freaking me out
Okay
Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out
'm sorry
Really
What do you want me to do
don't know
Smile
Sneeze
Something
You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris
Fuck it, don't know
(the radio) What kind of music do you like
don't know
What does that mean
Listen to what you want
(out of nowhere) Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris
There it is
And she wants an answer -- don't know
don't know who  am
Yeah, well, welcome to the club
No
No,  mean,  really don't know who  am
can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago
(it's not flying) 'm serious
What
Like amnesia
Look, go ahead
put the radio on
Amnesia
(total incredulity) You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago
That's what 'm saying
(German) Give me a fucking break
staring at her
She's furious
She's downshifting -- she's accelerating -- pulling out to pass the truck on a blind turn, as we -- -- / emerges from the bank
Leaving work
Turns the corner into a quiet side street and -- Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit
It's walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation
Barely noticing Apfel as they get closer and -- As they pass --  -- it's completely out of the blue -- he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and -- -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street and -- -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and -- --   -- '  working to retract a syringe into the device and -- striding away
Disappearing into Zurich
-- Not the best morgue in town
Cold tile
wall of freezers
Death lighting
Now add some color
Meet   in the flesh
Meet   -- eight or ten of his thirty children -- two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole crew spread out in this horrible basement room are chatting
are playing, fighting and eating candy
-- three of them here -- are white
These guys are French/Corsican mercs
Not quite the -Team
The guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named
Into it
Too into it
hanging back
-- who's clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the freezer lockers
(French) Okay, Monsieur Kane
number 121
And he pulls open  #121
And thank God we can't see it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible barely takes a glance, standing back as quickly as possible
-- lead bodyguard -- moves to clear a zone for his boss -- Get the fuck out of my way -- (pushing Deauvage aside --) moves to the freezer box
Stares down
As if it were nothing
He's seen -- he's made -- much, much worse
And now he reaches down into the box -- hands on -- literally feeling around this dead, awful corpse with his bare hands -- feeling around for something -- feeling and feeling and not finding -- (turning to Deauvage --) It's not him
looking pale as  slams shut the freezer
(quiet hard fury) So who's crazy now
-- - driving towards Neuilly
Two security cars
van full of kids and mothers
And one big Mercedes stretch
-- alone in the back
Looking haunted
-- It's a weird spot
Open all night
But Euro-style
Quiet tonight
few Alpen-truckers chowing down
local or two at the bar and -- at a back table
Drinking coffee
He's got the red bag open
All the passports -- the personal junk -- the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's been showing it to her -- And he's got her attention now
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that
No
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see
Nothing
It's just not there
Well, this is great
(she sits back) 'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are
kept trying things,  thought if could find all the things  could do,  could -- -- you could put it together -- -- which was okay for a while,  was okay with it
(hesitating now) But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and
(suddenly flat out --) think something bad happened
What are you talking about
don't know
Sounds like you were in an accident or something
was shot twice in the back
Okay, so you're a victim
There was a gun
Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports
Lots of people have guns
You're American
Americans love guns
fought my way out of an embassy
climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- went out the window and  was doing it --  just did it
knew how to do it
People do amazing things when they're scared
Why do
--  come in here -- instinctively -- first thing  do -- 'm looking for the exit -- 'm catching the sightlines --  know can't sit with my back to the door -- You're paranoid
You were shot
It's natural
She's not listening
He leans in
Flat out now
can tell you the license plate numbers of all three cars out front
can tell you that the waitress is left-handed and the guy at the counter weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself know that the best, first place to look for a gun is the cab of that grey truck outside
know that at this altitude  can run flat out for half a mile before  lose my edge knew that you were my first, best option out of Zurich
How do  know all that
How can  know all that and not know who  am
How is that possible
Long dead pause
God, you're not kidding, are you
-- '  -- a video image frozen on    -- it's Bourne looking at the camera -- Bourne looking up at the camera in the consulate passport office and -- -- and lots of shots of Bourne -- twenty angles -- twenty different locations -- twenty candid perspectives of Bourne and his mad scramble through the consulate -- and   #1 poring over these surveillance tapes downloaded from Zurich -- And that's the best angle of the courtyard
#1 That's the only angle
What do they have on the streets
The area
They must have something
#1 Hang on
(typing away --) rubbing at the tension in his temples as  enters -- What
Abbott
He knows about the embassy
He's coming down for a show and tell
That'll solve all our problems
#1 (he's hit paydirt) Sir
(turning back --) What's that
#1 It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just
Enhance it
--   -- as the image enlarges to fill the screen
And there's Bourne
And the little red car
And Marie
(
) Who the hell is that
-- drone barn
Practically on the runway
-- One of those rooms
Just a plain functional box laying on the bed
Fully dressed
Suit and tie
Just laying there, staring at the ceiling
Who knows how long he's been like this
Just waiting
--  gun
knife
His e-phone pager
His fresh credentials
And a photo of Jason Bourne
'   -- Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off the Bois Du Boulogne
But once inside you could be back in Brazzaville
It's just a buffet of oddness
Home to fifty children and nine wives
The decor blends money and nouveau riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic
It's a visual treat
Not condescending or stupid, but flat- out strange and menacing
It's late
And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry all that through this next series of quick shots -- Just inside the door
#1 slouched before a bank of Littered with toys
Children's crap everywhere #3
Snoozing on a Louis Quatorze chair draped with African cloth
-- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing set of doors
He's trying to stay awake
Reading a spy thriller
' And there he is -- the emperor himself --  on his throne
Except the room is dark and empty
And he's sitting there by himself
king without a country
Sitting there
With a gun in his lap
Drinking hard from a bottle of Jack Daniels
Stewing
-- Beautiful morning
The red car parked along the road alone in the passenger seat
Deep asleep
Nestled there
And then, he wakes suddenly
Starts
Freaked for a moment
Instantly feeling for the red bag
There it is in his lap
He looks around and -- sitting away from the car
She's got a loaf of bread
soda
Smoking a butt
Same clothes, but her make-up's been washed away
Clean
Simple
Gorgeous
steps out
Morning legs
needed a break
Where are we
We're about an hour away
can't believe  slept
You were tired
Here
(bread and soda --) For twenty-thousand  like to throw in breakfast
(he takes it) So what do you dream about
dream 'm asleep
dream that 'm asleep and  can't wake up
(he takes a hit from her smoke and coughs --) don't think  smoke
Another silence
She's watching him
You ever think maybe you have a family
thought about it
don't know
She looks away
Was she hoping for another answer
guess it's like Christmas every day for you, huh
'  -- '  --    -- she's eighteen -- she's smiling -- really alive and fresh and -- behind his desk
staring grimly at the picture -- Who is she
Marie Helene Kreutz
She's twenty- six
Born outside Munich
Father was a welder
He died in '91
We don't have the mother
There might be a step-sister, we're trying to track that down
(apologetic) It's tough
She's a wanderer
She pops up on the grid here and there but
mean, the last time she paid an electric bill in Europe was '94
No taxes
No steady employer
She's got three arrests
Two shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one in Germany
And she actually did three months in an Italian detention center for credit card fraud
No political affiliations
She's a gypsy
If it's a cover, it's a great one
'm assuming we're exploring that possibility
We're exploring every possibility
(tighter by the moment) We are in pursuit
How much more do you want me to tell you
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is
No
Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is
Yes, well,  think we need some fresh eyes on this problem
'm bringing in some people from upstairs
hesitates
Inside he's screaming
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall
We've been sleeping down here
We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now
-- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here
(real steam) 'd rethink that
want a second opinion
This is an operations desk
'm not asking
'  -- cruising through town
-- driving
checking building numbers as they pass -- Slow down
No, don't stop
Just
(looking over) That's it
Is that it
Big building
Elegant but cold
Four-fifty
That's the address
Looks familiar
No
(staring back as they pass --) No
Go around
Keep going
pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she does
But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it all in -- Where
Yeah
Pull in here
Park it
angles into an alleyway
Cuts the engine
So this is it, right
guess
Dead pause
She's waiting
He's still scanning the street
should go
don't remember any of this
Jason
He turns back
She's staring at him
Sorry
The money, right
Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack
He pulls out another stack of hundreds
Hands it over
She takes it
It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being disappointed
Fighting it
Okay, so
Thanks for the ride
Anytime
Silence
That moment
He focuses
Getting it
Look,  don't know what's up there
You got me pretty fucking curious
Look, you could come up
Or you could wait if you want
could go check it out
You could wait
Nah
(hide the pain) With you,  mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right
How could  forget about you
(he smiles) You're the only person  know
smiles
We've never seen it before
Worth waiting for
-- and  standing at the directory
Five apartments
One per floor
Five names
buzzer
An intercom
There it is
Bourne
presses the buzzer
After a moment, he presses again
Nothing
guess you're not home
checking the door
How to pop it open
Just about to get into it, when -- (
) (from the shadows inside --) Monsieur Bourne
'm coming
is sixty
Plump and proper
(opening the door --) Mr
Bourne, there you are --  was wondering --  haven't seen you -- Here  am
looking at  like maybe she's never seen him look like this before
And she's looking at  like here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit
(he tries a smile) seem to have lost my key
nods
Instant chilly disapproval
've been ringing your bell
It's good you were away
We had some trouble with the hot water
It's been repaired
Great
We could use a shower
(they look like shit --) It was a long drive
steps aside and -- -- and  at the apartment threshold
He has a key now
Turning it
And the door opens
Nothing
No bombs
No wife and kids
No one
-- huge, rambling flat
Large entry hallway
Large rooms beyond that
It's obviously expensive
But cold
Completely impersonal
No photographs
No mementoes
No human history
' and  exploring
It's big
silent
Struggling to get a feel for the place
This is like a real apartment
(she likes it) This is really yours
guess so
taking it in fast
seems paralyzed
Trying to soak it all in
Willing himself home
Touching things as he passes
As if a texture, a smell -- something will become familiar
He's deep into this as we go to -- in the doorway
Checking it out
It's so clean and simple
But it's not the decor she's most interested in
opening an armoire
Nothing but men's clothes
No competition
She's feeling better by the moment as we go to -- Like a stage set
Lots of props and no sign of food picking up a frying pan
This is my frying pan
(and then --) This is my spoon
(trying harder) 'm Jason Bourne and this is my kitchen
still on the prowl
Mirror city
Big tub
One toothbrush
There's a desk
Chair
Phone
Basic
with a folder in his hand
Staring at the bookshelves
Binders, reference materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime law
Ship schedules
Registry catalogs
All about boats
This is your office
(from the doorway) God, you live like a monk
All this stuff -- it's all about boats
(looking up) think 'm in the shipping business
See
It's starting to come back, yeah
(he sort of nods) You mind if  take a bath
Go ahead
backs out
alone again
Standing there for a moment
Dealing with it
And then he sits down in a chair
sitting there
Staring
The room, the desk -- it's all so devoid of personality
And then, something catches his eye and -- --    -- a faint silhouette through the dust and grime
Outlines of where a computer used to sit
reaching suddenly under the desk
Bingo
Pulling out a retractable computer keyboard tray
But it's empty
No keyboard
Now he's really confused and -- --  /  --  pressing the playback button and -- "You have no messages
" leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker phone -- and then hitting redial and -- stars dialing
and
/ Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf
quick grabbing the receiver
Taking it off speakerphone and -- yes -- oui -- uh
/ Yes, sir
Hotel Marboeuf, Paris
How can  direct your call
Paris
/ Yes, sir
(switching to English, thinking that's his problem --) How can  help you
Yes, 'm
'm looking for Mr
Jason Bourne
/ One moment, please
(a long pause, and then --) 'm afraid,  have no one by that name registered, sir
'accord
Merci
(about to hang up--) Un moment -- un moment -- / -- sir
-- -- hang on --  need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait -- grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where is it
-- where is it
-- shit and money falling out and -- There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it -- (reading it) Kane
Do you have Mr
John Michael Kane
/ One moment, sir
waiting
And then there's muzak -- holding music and -- Water running in the tub
pulling off her boots
Checking the temperature
Bourne still on hold
And then -- / (a new voice suddenly) Bonjour
Monsieur
Allo
Yes, 'm here
/ You call about Monsieur Kane
John Michael Kane
Yes
Is he there
/ You are a friend of his
Yes
/ have some very bad news for you, sir
'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago
Silence
is rocked
But the Manager, it's natural, he interprets the silence as grief
/ There was an accident
On the motorway
Apparently, he was killed instantly
Really, 'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this
understand
/ we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened
When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see
Who
Who came
/ His brother
You know his brother
Right
Yes
Of course
/ It's very bad this
Terrible sad
Such a young man
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number
/ think not
(quick French to someone in the office there --) No, 'm sorry
It was very sudden
He was here very briefly
just hands up the phone
Just like that
Not even goodbye
Standing there frozen
Stunned
John Michael Kane is dead
And he had the passport
Suddenly, everything's changed
They shouldn't be here
This is bad
Danger
playing with her hair in the mirror
Checking the water -- (calling out to him --) She wasn't kidding about the water
It's freezing
frozen there
On alert
He forces a smile
Decoy mood
Hang on
'll check the kitchen
(moving out of the office --) Maybe it takes a while to get all the way upstairs
moving to the sink
He's smiling
Upbeat
But it's an act
His eyes are everywhere
Turning on the water
But ignoring it
What he's really doing is searching out a weapon
Pulling   very quietly from behind the stove
Holding it
Feels pretty comfortable
Hiding it down by his side
On the move again, now -- Yeah, it's cold in here, too
(calling to her as he goes --) Let's give it another minute
like we've ever seen him
Like an animal
Every sound -- every breeze -- everything carries information
Standing still
Taking it all in
Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that face out to the street below
The hallway to the bedroom and bath feeds into the living room from one side
There is a large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall
Simple furniture
(suddenly --) -- omigod
-- (she's behind him --) -- what're you
-- no -- no -- backing away -- completely freaked --  standing there with the knife in his hand and -- -- no -- Marie -- no
-- it's not like that -- -- please -- Jason -- omigod -- -- quiet -- quiet -- -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment -- glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- motioning for  to get down -- do it -- now -- down
hesitating and -- -- what's he doing
-- he's unscrewing a lightbulb from a lamp beside him and -- about to say something -- he shakes her off -- -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other -- putting his foot on a chair in front of him and -- what are you doing
waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up -- get under the window -- go
-- -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it -- she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill -- looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now
-- -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room -- over her head -- into that frosted window and -- As she ducks down -- As it  -- -
-
-
-
-
-- silenced automatic weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and -- peppered with holes and -- on the floor as    above her and -- -- he's in the airshaft
-- hanging from an abseil rope -- but off guard --   -- strafing the apartment and -- kicking that chair across the room and -- reacting -- instinct -- moving target -- just strafed to shit and -- rolling away and -- -- he's coming in -- last pieces of window frame as he swings into the apartment and -- -- right below him -- shit raining down as he flies in and -- throwing the knife and -- -- turning -- too late -- the knife catching him in the neck and -- -- in motion -- attacking and -- -- knife impaled in his neck -- clawing for it with one hand -- trying to get off a shot and -- --
-

-
-
-- gunfire tearing wildly around the room and -- -- full-stop -- kicking the gun -- kicking it up -- and -- --   -- trying to crawl away and -- -- no chance -- off balance --  -- his open palm driving up into '  -- the body wants to fall backward, but  has the guy's arm in his free hand -- jerking it like rope -- tearing it from it's socket and -- across the floor and -- -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into ' -- and then down -- his foot -- down into ' , shattering it and -- is on the floor -- stunned -- wiped -- knife pouring blood from his neck -- arm hanging like a rag doll -- bone torn through his pant leg above the knee and -- omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing
-- what're you doing
-- (incoherent fear and confusion, German and English and--) -- what is he
-- what've you
-- omigod -- what is this
-- ignoring her -- grabbing the guy's backpack -- -- what're you doing
-- Jason, please, tell me what's happening
Open it -- (tossing Castel's backpack behind him --) -- do it -- what's he got in there
-- eyes wild -- tries to make his feet -- Who are you
(kicking him down--) -- who are you
-- crablike against a wall -- bloody hands leaving a mess as he struggles to get to his feet -- -- who are you
-- tell me who you are -- who sent you
-- (bearing down) -- what is this about
-- ' -- -- staring back -- eyes wild -- mouth shut -- his expression -- is it terror or pure steel
-- (suddenly from behind) omigod, no
-- the guy's backpack -- something in her hand -- and as freaked out as she was a moment ago -- this is worse -- What
-- what
-- (attention split --) -- what is it
this is my picture
he's got my picture -- (holding it up, in horror --) -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this
this
this is yesterday -- -- just -- -- where does this come from
-- (to Castel) How do you have my picture
Marie, just -- (waving her back --) -- just stay there
-- just -- -- he's got my picture
-- this is yesterday
-- this is me
-- (out of control now --) -- where did you get my picture
-- -- let me do this, okay
-- -- do what
-- what are you doing
-- he's got my picture -- (just apoplectic --) -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look
-- he was trying to kill us
-- omigod -- Now there's     and -- (muffled but urgent) Mister Bourne
Mister Bourne
What's going on
Is everything all right in there
(-- and she keeps banging and --) is past the point of rationality and  is bleeding and shaking and  is trying to think and it's just impossible and -- Suddenly --  is moving
-- and fast -- it's superhuman -- unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and -- bracing himself but -- isn't attacking
-- he's running away -- he's crossing the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely nowhere -- except -- hurling himself into the glass and -- -- --  -- in a cloud of broken glass -- sixty feet above the street -- Falling and falling and
-- landing on the roof of a parked car and -- -- --  in motion -- five things at once -- checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and -- (still outside the door--) --'m calling the police, Mr
Bourne -- you give me no choice -- 'm calling them right away
-- -- your shoes -- Marie
-- where
-- where are your shoes
-- Marie -- standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just happened -- He's dead isn't he
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this -- He went out the window -- why
-- why would someone do that
-- we can't stay here --  can't stay here -- it's not safe here -- He came to kill us
-- we can go --  can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- You knew he was coming
No
trusted you
You're wrong
didn't know
don't trust anybody and  trusted you
didn't know this would happen
He had my picture
He knew  was here
He came here to kill us
And where is he now
(that gets her quiet) You believe what you want, but 'm telling you the truth --  never would have brought you here if thought it was dangerous
(totally overwhelmed) Oh, Jesus
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better --  don't know -- (starting to back away --) But  can't stay here
can't
But the police -- -- there's no time -- -- we'll explain it -- -- how
-- -- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just -- -- forget it -- -- we'll tell them what happened -- don't know what happened
(huge here) don't know who he is
don't know what he wants
don't even know who am
The only thing  know is that if  stay here, 'm never gonna find out
-- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it on -- just about to make his move -- She's standing there
Just utterly swamped
Lost
Come with me
(she turns back, he's waiting --) can get us out of here
know it
Then we can think
Then we can work it out
We'll explain it then
Once we're safe

He's not lying
He's very highly stressed, but he's not lying
He's confused
He's aggressively searching for a way out of the chaos
This conversation, the video from the consulate -- the body language, vocal pattern -- it's my sense he's really lost here

Is that a medical term
She turns
Battle lines drawn
You want clinical terminology
It's called, "conversation hysteria

Smoke
-- It's a shitty little room
sitting on the bed
And the smoke is coming from
-- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire holding it as it burns away
Bourne's face -- melting -- bubbling -- finally disappearing, --  letting go just before it burns his fingers and -- sits back
And there's  standing there
And she's holding out her passport -- He looks at her
Big moment
No

Almost
He doesn't know what to do
Doesn't know how to react
in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening
-- she's taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this happened

Coming through the terminal as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and -- -- This is the place that answered the phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment
This is the place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died
" And so begins, the investigation
Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene is not finished
The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne would have to be very nervous about being recognized
If he was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever "social engineering" needs doing
Long version
Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods
Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi
Fast version
It's all results -- we see them execute a plan rather than work it up

Well
(really thrown) must admit, when my assistant told me you were here  was, really -- was quite --  was surprised
Really
We thought you were gone for good
Did you
Well,  mean it's a tough business, isn't it
Cutthroat
long awkward beat
Neither of them sure where to go
(finally) Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better

Yes
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you

found the body
Let's go -- (already standing --) We got to get away from this phone

#1 (picking up the cash) What was the name again
Kane
John Michael Kane
#2 It's number 121
want to see the body
#1 Our boss could come back
We're not supposed to
pulling out another hundred and -- It's showtime
back by the door
right on it
#1 pulling open the freezer and
sags

What
--  #121 -- it's empty
(
) (from behind them --) What the hell's going on here
Here comes the boss back from his break -- a little drunk
#1 This guy, he came to see the American, but the body, it's missing
They came last night
His brother
#2 It's not in the book
Who are these people
(now English to Bourne) Who are you
What's going on here
Where did this body go
said, someone came last night -- (big attitude now) Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like -- (like a shot) Shit, we didn't sign in
So get the hell out of here
Fine
But 'd like to sign in
In fact,  insist on it
Where's the book
gotta sign in -- (off and running now --) Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into -- there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out -- Is this it
-- (the book) -- this is it, right
-- -- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that -- -- don't sweat it,  have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page -- (then quick to Marie) -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay
-- trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's doing -- -- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- 'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay
-- -- what do
--  put the name of the person  came to see
-- -- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going -- -- here we go --  found it -- But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out of the book -- -- what are you
-- what are you doing
-- you crazy fuck -- you ripped the book
-- you stupid fucki-- (no chance to finish this, because --) just slammed him against the wall
Hard
Like a tractor hit him
And fast
And that shuts up the room
rushing to help their boss -- grabbing  and pulling her out the door -- -- Moments after the morgue
striding away struggling to keep up
And  is different now -- zoning in -- he's close -- he's hardening -- What are you doing
-- (he's scaring her) -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me
ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security brochures -- scanning them as he walks -- --  don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for
-- what just happened in there
-- Nykwana Wombosi
(he stops, holding up the brochure --) What is that
It's a name
Mr
Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht
He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package
(handing her the brochure --) He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane
(the ripped-out page --) What does that mean
(but he's walking again --) Jason, what does that mean
(she's trying to catch up, but he's walking really fast --) Jason, please
who is he
don't know
(he's not turning back again --) So what are we doing
Go back to the hotel
just stops
Reeling
walking away
Into Paris night and -- '   -- /
alone here
On the phone
Looking up to see -- They found him

Eyes never leaving

You better come in

On the street
Bathed in a streetlight
Staring up at a security camera
Total hero moment
'm here
'm waiting
know you're watching
-- Confusion to say the least --  -- pistol in hand -- moving as fast as he can through the clutter -- scattering as he follows  -- racing for -- -- --  --  --   -- everyone plugged into the tension here -- -- how long
-- #1 -- minutes -- he's close -- -- on the speeding cycle -- closing in fast and -- '  -- standing there as the   opens
The moment
The big deep breath
He's walking in -- -- Uglier by the second -- desperation madness -- -- he went inside
-- (to Abbott) -- if we can get a clean shot -- -- inside the house
-- -- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike
Forget it
What do you want to do
We don't know what we're into
We're in the shitter, man
Pick your poison
Maybe he's in there to finish the job
Maybe he's working for Wombosi
Maybe they want to go on together
Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move
-- and  #1 giving  a serious pat down
Is he here
doesn't answer -- spinning  around -- they're really going over him -- -- on his feet --  beet red -- this is getting loud -- You don't have the stones for this
You people come down here and wink and whisper and we send these guys out and get it done
And you're clear
And the guys upstairs get what they want
And the whole bunch of you are so stuffed on deniability it's coming out of your ears
(gauntlet) Well, you know what
You're here now
What do you want to do
just shaking his head no
And  snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's the button -- and he's pressing it and -- -- in position -- roof of the house next door -- hum -- hum -- hum -- It's the -  -- he's just been activated and -- '   -- being marched toward the throne room doors -- and  #1 flanking him --  and  staring as he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to the gallows -- thrown open wide and -- on the throne
Come in
(an imperial gesture) Please
steps up to the plate
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight
It was tax shelters, wasn't it
Swiss debenture-swaps
Capital
think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea
(beat) How does it feel to be dead
It's a lot more stressful than thought
have started sneaking into the room --  is trying to scoot them out but -- -- no -- no, let them in
-- let them in
(to the kids) Come in -- on y va -- come in
(to Bourne) think everyone wants to see the dead man
watching the kids -- they are all staring -- What do you do
(on his feet now --) You get an appointment with me
You make sure it's on the boat
You come visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit investment package
You drink my water -- eat my bread -- play with my children -- and what
-- two nights later you come back and you put this death -- (slamming something down onto the throne --) -- you put this in my engine room
There is   on the throne now
So this is a different kind of meeting
(steam building) Maybe now we talk some truth, okay
One dead man to another
-- caught off guard as --  suddenly rips away his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the shirt -- '  -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw -- You see this
(calling to Deauvage --) told you my shot was better
He went in the water -- how did he live
No, no no
(and he means this --) This is a strong killer
This is a crazy strong killer
Oh, yeah
(circling) To make a killer that looks like you
This young
This face
(he means this) It's bloody fucking amazing
imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him -- Who do you think sent me
know who sent you
don't know why
(this could get physical at any moment now --) learned many, many things from the Many things
learned the way they think
(beat) Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not
distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's
You didn't set the bomb
Why
not sure -- about any of it -- Was this a game or a fuck up
don't know
Get the kids out
He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- they're gone
And the door
closing the doors and as he does -- It's a shootout
The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the bodyguards
Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy -- No children are harmed
As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still sitting there on the throne
There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion
This might not want to be very long
There is an extensive action sequence just around the corner
So Bourne escapes
Physically he's just weary
Emotionally he's fucked
All of that happens and we cut to -- -- flipping out --   is not responding -- -- code him again -- punch it in -- #1 -- he's not responding -- -- the paging unit must be damaged -- #2 -- we just ran a remote diagnostic, sir, it's not the unit -- looks like he might puke
watching his career burn to the ground around him
What are you doing
grabbing shit -- like a madman -- 'm going to Paris
No you're not
You're not going anywhere
'm shutting this down
You're not doing shit
You're so scared you can't even think
You just blew up a house in Paris
This program is over
Call it off
can't call it off
He's not responding
Get out of my way
splits and -- -- It's really late
enters the room
in the corner
Smoked out
Cried out
Lifed out
Silence
Not a word
His shirt is torn to shit
He scraped-up -- blood here and there
He moves past her into -- His hands shaking as he tries to wash them
He bags it
comes out
And there's a long silence until -- It doesn't matter who you were before
It's who you want to be
That's all that matters
(is he listening
) We have this money
We have what we have
had nothing before and now, don't know, maybe  have more, maybe it's nothing, but
(he looks over) say we leave here
We leave this place
We go until we can't go anymore
You could do that
Yes
That's who  want to be
nods
Turns off the light
Takes her hand
And they lay in bed
Just laying there
-- cooping somewhere
Tending to his wounds
Ignoring his pager
He's slipped off the grid
-- and  packing up to hit the road
Together

Hope hangs in the air -- xxxxxx
xxxxxx enters
He's got the black duffel
Car keys

Something doesn't feel right for  -- and then he notices -- Stop where you are
What
Bourne turns back to the
Where's the dog
My husband's out looking for him
He run away often
That old beast
Miss his breakfast
Not a chance
(returning to cleaning) It's always something, right
Suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different -- Get in the basement
What
(to Marie) Get everyone down in the basement
Now  doesn't need a second warning -- What the hell're you talking about
You're in danger
All of you
have no time to explain
Wait a minute -- 'm sorry
-- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her purse, clearing out of the room
Slamming the door behind her -- click -- it's locked
Jason
No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk, coming up with --   , an old one, but nonetheless a gun -- Who is it
Who's out there
And now  is moving, pulling open a drawer
box of shells
Filling his pockets
xxxxxx xxxxxx won't let that happen
And he is moving down the small hallway
Away from the front door -- towards the back door under the stairs
--  -- -- kicked open --  coming out of the house -- coming hard -- and -- The small courtyard is empty -- but now the  is going off -- and  turns back to  -- races to grab her as -- -- The   --  --   and -- here comes the

To a wall --  is up, on it -- reaching down for  -- grabbing her -- swinging her over the wall as -- The

Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to explain -- he turns back -- The  is just vaulting over the wall --
But the spray is too wide from this distance
Windows are shattered to both sides of him but -- the  stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face now --  -- has to move
Reloading his almost useless gun
Reaching -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- around them but they make it -- now -- -- right -- then left -- through a small staircase
a wall -- landing on a   -- sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in -- -- steep walls on all sides
But there's a large window -- and it's open
And they step through and find themselves -- --  -- They close the window behind them -- catch their breath -- Did we lose them
shakes his head
Tucks the gun under his coat
Who is it
We have to keep moving
And now he is opening the door -- they step into -- -- stare as  and  calmly walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door of the empty restaurant
Quiet
And then they open the door to the street and -- --   -- The first thing we notice is noise
The street is burgeoning with life
The second thing we notice are approaching
and  head down the street, blending in
Up ahead --    snaking through traffic steers them off this crowded street
xxxxxx xxxxxx --   -- And  and  are hurrying down this street when -- -- The  comes out of a building -- across and down the street
No time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's tackles  to the ground behind a car
-- The  is literally shredding it
And now  is moving -- What are you doing
And  is on the offensive
Moving towards the who is ducking behind cars on the other side
They are shredding the street --  ruthlessly at each other and --      --  both ends of the street
are drawn -- 's vulnerable on two flanks
The  are
And now -- the  -- And now things have changed
and  grabs  and they dive into -- -- And the  shreds the store as  attemps to fire back

And he is reaching into his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their car on and -- ' unlocks the door -- pops 's open
And -- '   -- yelling at them and --  hits the gas -- they fly out of their parking space --

And now we are into -- ,  and the  leave a trail of totaled cars that the cops have to try and navigate through -- finally saying fuck it and hitting a few cars themselves and now we are into -- '  and the  can pass where the police cars cannot
may be able to shed the cops, but not the
And now one quick move and they are -- -- Racing against traffic up the Seine
Past the Louvre pursuing on the other side of the river
and the leaving behind a trail of carnage
And now -- The  is pulling up along side them -- one lane over
Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and -- --  --  out a few windshields
The fires at the same time -- '   --  -- she's totally exposed but -- -- his  is   -- one of the pellets nailed his tank
-- xxxxxx -- No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and -- -- the side of the car is completely gone -- the  is gaining -- across the river dozens of police cars are racing alongside
Many more can be seen on their side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and -- turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies down a side street
pulls out behind them -- the  can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and into a    which shatters
And he's up -- lifting up his bike and -- on their tail -- more joining
Every street they look down has   racing in parallel
Running out of options and in the background -- is back in the game -- passing the police cars and up ahead -- -- cops with guns
Gotta act quick and --  turns hard left -- there's a metro staircase -- only way out and -- down the stairs
through the doors down below
-- no way he's following
on his brakes
to a halt --  sideways -- gonna stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then -- isn't braking -- - the first car -- -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down
-- he's turning -- heading for a different set of stairs
-- crashing through the turnstiles -- people diving out of their way and -- --   of the   is kicked out and --     emerge -- pull their guns out -- head into the station
and 's world just got a lot more dangerous and -- is racing down the other staircase -- an up escalator -- people diving out of the way as -- and  slalom through the station -- suddenly -- there's the  -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades keep them separated
-- a horizon line --  guns it -- a steep staircase and --   down the steps -- landing on -- The  lands on the other side -- both racing down the platform --  tearing up the wall behind them and --     -- on  and 's side -- travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge
Not for long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform
They skid to a halt -- just as --    -- stare at  and  as they stop onto the platform -- take off running
has to turn his bike around
He's quick -- but it gives  and  a two second head start
almost at the other end of the platform -- gunfire ripping up the windows behind them
Gonna go for the steps -- but here come -- -- remember them
-- the ones who took the ride down the steps -- they're firing now and -- turn back -- the  is firing and there is only one option -- -- and  into the conductor booth
People diving off the train as  hits the   and -- the -- doors still open -- they disappear into the protection of the tunnel walls -- then  hits the button to close the doors and --   -- watching the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of the train and -- here comes the end of the train and -- throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing into the station and --   onto the back of the train in the nick of time
His   to the tracks
The window is shattered and the  lets himself in -- wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows
And -- and  finally getting a breather
keeps looking back -- nothing -- the train is deserted
Finally -- xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx And ahead -- daylight -- the train tracks go above ground and as the train hits daylight -- we see the directly behind  on the other side of the glass and -- The  grabs  through the glass, ramming his head into the metal as -- grabs the knob, swings the door open and  the --  him again and now he is free and -- turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the  kicks it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we have a beat --    races across the Bir Hakeim bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them
and the squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing there's no chance for either one of them to get it and -- breaks out
's motivated -- the 's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match
Looks like it could go on for a little while when suddenly -- The  drops to the ground -- behind him -- wields the shot gun
xxxxxx xxxxxx And  takes the gun from her -- standing there -- reloading -- both barrels -- raising the gun -- aiming it -- -- sitting there
Like a dummy
Like a puppet that's been propped up
He's fucked -- his whole side ravaged with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood flowing fast -- Who else is coming
staring up at the gun
Stunned
Doomed
Mouth dry
Eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos
won't ask again
work alone
Like you
(confused beat) we always work alone
What do you mean
Who are you
Rome
Paris
(Bourne is just staring --) Treadstone
both of us
was warned but
Treadstone
which one are you
lowering the weapon -- head swimming -- Paris
live in Paris
headaches
you have that get such bad headaches
Yes
it's a problem
He's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up -- Treadstone
or in a car
when it's dark
something with the headlights
(circuits exploding) pills, right
Treadstone had those pills
What is Treadstone
what did you do
you must've really fucked up
think so
someone said caffeine -- for a headache
doesn't seem
What do they want me to do
they won't let you go
Why
-- coughing -- a spasm -- helpless -- Look at this
(all the blood --) least you have a woman
And he's gone
Like that
Sitting there
And  looks paralyzed too
Kneeling there
Stalled out
Jason
doesn't answer -- can't, because there's this sound -- this pulsing hum --  reaching into  ' and -- --  -  -- covered in blood -- hum -- hum -- hum -- '  wiping at the blood that covers the display -- staring at it
Very familiar to him
We've got to go
-- and  racing back through the cars -- away from the scene of the crime and -- -   -- pulling into the station -- doors opening -- through the station from up the platform and -- and  getting off the last car and -- /    -- Two minutes later
and  -- exhausted -- beat -- Everything all at once -- Take this
She turns
He's holding the locker key
Take it
But she doesn't move
And that's it
If you're lucky
(it's hanging there) Take it
(beat) There's enough in there to make a life
Any life
Just get out now
Get low
Stay low
(beat) Take it
She takes it
Staring at him
Simply refusing to cry
What was  thinking, right
can't protect you anymore
What about you
'm gonna find the end of this
(beat) can't protect you
takes one last look
And she's running -- hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and then he pulls out  -
And it's pulsing like crazy
flips open the shell
There's a keypad in there
Holding it
Like a missing organ
-- Remember
He's still there waiting
And his pager goes off, and -- -- safehouse --  filling a burn bag -- racing -- everything's going -- -- done with the dirty work -- out into the street -- As he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar sound -- hum -- hum -- hum -- He cross the street -- looks down to the Quai below -- Holy shit -- there's one of his -  -- He goes down -- picks it up -- And now -- What did you do to me
wheels around
There he is
Right behind him
What did  do
What've you done
Do you have any idea
Any conception
What you've destroyed
Do you have any idea how much time and work -- how many people have their lives wrapped up in this
So now you know
Are you Treadstone
Am  Treadstone
Me
(peering at him closely now --) What the hell're you talking about
showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to
What did you do to me
What did  do
spent thirty million dollars on you
spent three years finding you -- four years training you -- (incredulous) What did  do
(staring now) What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason
don't know
They're right about you, aren't they
You're fried
(on it now) You really don't know what's going on, do you
know you've been trying to kill me
Of course
We had to try
We didn't know what was wrong
(warming to this --) We didn't know you were in trouble
So now you know
So it's time to go home
That's all  get
We'll make you better
We can put the pieces back
We can do that
don't think so
We have to go home, Jason
Jason Bourne is dead
There never was a Jason Bourne
(that gets him) You have to come with me
It's the only way
We can give it back to you
Keep it
(and he's walking --) Jason
(trying to follow --) They can't let you go
That'll be their second worst mistake
And with that,  scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing -- just left there -- on the Quai -- in the dark -- -- walking away -- faster and faster -- -- --       -- sitting alone with his briefcase
Opening it
There's his gun
-- walking -- deeper into the darkness and -- -- in the dark car -- loading the weapon -- calm -- steady -- methodical and -- -- walking and -- -- stepping out of the car -- closing the door quietly -- deep in the shadows and -- -- still coming -- the darkest part of the path just ahead and -- -- raising the gun and -- -- '
-- just climbing back up from the Quai -- -- the gun -- phftt -- phftt -- phftt -- -- three holes -- head -- heart -- gut -- his body dropping like a stone beside his car
walks over
Looks down
Point blank -- phftt -- that makes it four and -- -- and  alone in the dark
As a red light begins pulsing on the console
That red light means Conklin's dead
After a moment,  moves to the console and shuts the light off
-- still walking
And he's just gonna keep on going, as we -- : -- at the head of the table

(
) The Treadstone project has actually already been terminated
It was designed primarily as a sort of advanced game program
in the hot seat
right there beside him
We'd hoped it might build into a good training platform, but quite honestly, for a strictly theoretical exercise, we thought it was far too expensive
The cost-benefit ratio was just too high
It's been all but decommissioned at this point
All right, what's next
handing  the next hundred pages
Okay, this is Blackbriar
Blackbriar is a joint, , communications program that we really feel has good traction to it
is just gonna go on and on and on
