" " -- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen " " -- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale, beautifully proportioned
The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her features as fragile as porcelain
Her eyes are closed in sleep, or in death
or in something in between
Now    emerge out of the darkness
They are male, and they float into position on either side of the female
They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale, and like the female their eyes are closed
The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch
Her features, which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like, into the face of a woman in fear
Her eyes open
The male face on her right contorts too
His features warp into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged
His eyes open
The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young boy, a boy who is terribly frightened
His eyes open wide
As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a sudden and unnerving exchange begins
(frightened woman) , (mocking man) "Johnny, please
Johnny please
" You're scaring me
(child's voice) , ' (considering) don't like you any more, Carol
(imploring) Put the scissors down
You're scaring me Please
Oh, Carol
Johnny
Stop
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2
Don't grab at me
Let Daddy
No
All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream, the whimpering cries of their son
And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state
Their eyes slowly close
They do not move
So that when they do move again, it is startling
In abrupt unison, the  flash open
Three pairs of eyes stare straight at us, accusing
Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one
Murderer
The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and the dark reaches forth, and takes them
: Morning in America
Just look at it
America in the midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into the sun drenched distance
White house upon white house
Emerald lawns, glistening with dew
In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome, long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships
Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on trikes
Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways, watching
The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go back into their houses
Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height, boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes
It is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are safe
family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone fireplace, a console , a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger, a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3
young mother, , her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly at the scene outside
'  - little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk
The ball gets away from her, and rolls into the street
At the same moment, a two-toned , lush and huge, rounds the corner
The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball
Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door
She watches
And smiles a little
The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street
The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of the car
Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel
Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him
Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road in front of him, going for her ball
Watches, her smile in place
The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears down on her
An alarm suddenly
The car automatically brakes to a halt
The man looks around the edge of his paper to see what is happening
The car has stopped, inches from the girl
The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink
She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4
The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on its own, starts up again
The car rounds a corner, and disappears
Carol turns away from the window
She startles when she sees her husband, , is there behind her
He is in his pajamas
How long has he been there, watching her
(gruff) Why'd you let me sleep so long
It's Saturday, Johnny, you always -- (beat) Why are you staring at me like that
He takes a step toward her
He stands there, his thick black hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw, considering her
'm unhappy that you let me sleep so long
He takes another step toward her
She doesn't move a muscle
little  suddenly enters the room
Johnny turns, looks at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife
Then, without a word, he begins to walk out of the room
On his way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which sits beside a sewing machine
It is not the sewing that has caught his attention, but a large pair of garment which lie across a fold of colored cloth
-- Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching
He walks down his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper
Carol stands in the doorway, watching him
slides over Johnny, cast from above
The air fills with the piercing  of an engine
Johnny looks up, alarmed
In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban trees, is a black
The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable drama
Racing  down the street toward him, are , lethal and efficient looking -- they seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to process them
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5
Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars
More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses
Their uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light
Their left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some sort of complicated glove
- The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger ending in an open barrel
Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not America in the 1950's
It is the neo-past, the retro world of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is intermeshed with hypertechnology
And all of that hypertechnology is focused on , as he makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering behind him
He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out of the way
Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard
From a backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a handle grip and an ovoid screen
It is a holographic scanner
He activates it, scans the  in front of him, and an takes three-dimensional form
The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver a dozen times
In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning like living beings -- has been created
An overwhelming police deterrent presence has been established
The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house, too
It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and which are scanned holographs
The juxtaposition of the futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting
Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his wife's dresses
Two , standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands out in front of them, palm out
When the first officer points his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove softly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6
The officer looks at his
red thermal  appears on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching man
The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second officer
The room is packed with police -- how many are real
Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat
He calls out through the door
didn't do anything
Every  in the room lifts his gloved hand and points his index barrel at the closet door
The effect is deeply accusatory
An  speaks, his  electronically manipulated to be as menacing as possible
1 Come out of the closet on your hands and knees
Nothing happens
Two officers aim their barrels at the perimeter of the door
In repeated, small  , the closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among the dresses
Johnny starts to rise, and , a section of floorboards is blasted away beneath his feet
1 Hands and knees
Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops
He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches
He lifts his head and looks up at the officer
didn't
Another  2 bends down with a  -- the words "IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises
The officer nods affirmatively to the other officer
2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7
1 (to Johnny) John Palmer, if you were being arrested for any other crime,  would now read you your rights
(beat) But you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife, Carol Palmer
You have no rights
Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp
-- In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police vehicle as the neighbors look on
Carol and her son stand in the doorway, stunned
remove their helmets
The first man is tall, sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is  , late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington The second man is  , Anderson's second in command, late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the shoulders, short brown hair
The two men are deeply comfortable together
They can speak, or not
It doesn't matter -- they still communicate
Two good cops, good together
They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the holographic decoy cops
Thought we might a had a runner
Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer
Yeah, a runner
little chase -- that'd been good
Fifty cops on the scene takes the chase out of them
(smiles) But only eight of us were real
Witwer dematerializes the last decoy
We ever get a runner, 'd be too old to give chase
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8
You'd chase
You'd love it,
Man
They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime vehicle holding Johnny zoom  away
love it more Johnny boy doesn't get to murder his wife
(beat) It's a beautiful world
-- The children play on their trikes
The wives talk among themselves
The birds sing, the dogs bark
The little girl bounces her red ball again
She stops a
minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her, unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape
-   ( ) Decorated in a 1950's style
Anderson lies in bed beside his wife, , a pretty, green-eyed brunette
It is early morning, they are both awake
Her hand caresses his chest
Maybe they will make love
Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest
Jesus, Paul
Your heart's hammering
(playfully) excite you that much
He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile vanish
used to love being a cop
You're still a cop
'm a factory worker
We don't catch murderers
We process them
Lisa takes a long breath
She's been down this road before
She speaks reassuringly
You're the best homicide cop in the country
snorts disdainfully
Great -- except there's no such thing as homicide
What  do best doesn't exist anymore
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9
(beat) You're the Director of a perfect system
Cop with a perfect record The Precogs have a perfect record
They identify the accused --  just put on my monkey suit and go round them up
Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck
And then prosecute them
And they go to jail
And lives are saved
Thousands of lives
(beat) And that's a cop's dream
Anderson is silent for a time
He sighs, then smiles, and turns to his wife, takes her in his arms
No
You're a cop's dream
-- Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself dry- He glances out a casement window
He tilts his head, curious, then wipes at the steam on the window
' Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a cell phone
She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house
Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off
-- Checkered linoleum floor
Appliances out of the 1950's
Except there are little differences
When Lisa puts a skillet of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light
Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket
Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt, wingtipped shoes
He doesn't look up from the newspaper as he speaks
Who called
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10
Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs
She touches her long brown hair
No one
called about my hair
Getting it done this afternoon
Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when suddenly someone  on the back screen door
Anderson and Lisa both turn and smile
Come on in, neighbor
Want some coffee
', 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before coming in
thin   with a red laser light arches quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his , scanning the irises
The arm lifts out of view, the screen door
Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes
' Brought these for your supper
Oh, Frank
That's so sweet
Thank you
' Sweet, nothing
gotta get rid of these things
One plant, and 'm invaded by tomatoes
When  was a kid
Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back, teases him
Before all this genetically engineered crap
Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile
' Yeah well, it's true
It used to be a challenge to grow things
An art
Now you put one plant in the ground -- then jump the hell out of the way
Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down
Coffee
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11
' Nah, thanks
Can't stay
You guys are rushing off to work anyway
Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson
You and Ellie come for supper then
We'll barbecue
Frank nods and pushes on the screen door
' You betcha
We'll bring some more tomatoes -- a new batch will have grown by then
They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper
-- Anderson waves to Lisa
Her big Studebaker drives off down the tree-lined street and away
Anderson approaches his Chevy
He doesn't take out a key to unlock it
There is no lock
He slides in behind the wheel
Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no ignition
thin   arches down from the sun visor, scans Anderson's , identifying him
seat harness wraps around him, and the car
Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to read through the papers
The Chevy backs out of the driveway and takes him to work
95 - ,  -- vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the spillover from Washington
across the Potomac River into Virginia
Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts of the Capitol
It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs
Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars
Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them
In the sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles, holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports
On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to flash: "
" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12
Then a picture of the smiling President appears
Then the words: "- " ' Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic road sign
reads: " Headquarters 1 mile Headquarters 1
5 miles
Headquarters 2 miles
" Anderson goes back to his papers
Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair
He abruptly rises and begins to pace
The room is large, but he paces like a lion confined in a cage
He punches an intercom
female  responds
Yes, Director Anderson
Where's Ennis Page
Why hasn't he delivered this morning's Precog discs
Ed Witwer opens the door to the office
, and casually walks in
'll find him, sir
Ed shakes his head, smiles
Bullying the staff again, Director Anderson
Screw you
Anderson turns away and stares out a large window
Witwer joins him
(') Was that fun for you, yesterday
The Johnny Palmer bust
Yeah
It was okay
We got our man
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13
Anderson takes a long breath
When do we not get our man
They turn as Ennis , 44, a thin, tight little man with burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room
He carries a black  marked: "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria,
" The case is cuffed to his wrist
Sorry 'm late, sir
Precogs put out a heavy national volume this morning -- four for our zone
() Put the case on my desk, Ennis
Page hesitates, doesn't do it
Anderson moves quickly to Page
(') What was  thinking
Anderson leans over the
small panel recedes, a red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, affirmatively, then clicks off
The cuff on Page's wrist falls open
Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk
Page hesitates
Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do
Page reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers strewn on Anderson's desk
Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles
When Page looks up they try to cover, but are not quick enough
He frowns tightly, and heads for the door
Anderson calls after him
Thanks, Ennis
Witwer turns to leave, too
Now that's a guy who really cares
Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office
Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens the briefcase
Four small bright  sit in rows
He removes one, places it in a   that lifts into view from the center of his desk
He sits back, weary, and watches
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14
young black woman stands in a hallway
She stares at a door, gun in hand
She opens the door, enters a bedroom
She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping
She lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form
pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new disc
white woman stands at a stove, cooking
man comes up behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands
He raises the necktie toward her neck He's not watching the screen
He is out of his chair now, looking out the window
tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations tours run by present-day
The  , a pretty, smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the building
Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime
Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States
The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby
(') Precrime was established in 2030, with the harnessing of the remarkable talents of the Precognitive mutants
She points cheerfully to a stubby little man,
(') Mr
Harris, can you tell me how many Precogs there are
Three
Uh, right
That's exactly right
lot of people assume there are Precogs in every branch office
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15
(') But there are only three Precogs, right here in this building
And the information they give us, we send out to all the other branches
(beat) And what is that information -what do the Precogs do
An eager boy,  has the answer to that one
They protect us
The guide tousles his hair
(chipper voice) That's right, Timmy
Because of the Precogs, you're going to grow up murderfree
Isn't that something
They ever wrong
The Precogs ever screw up when they predict a murder
The guide laughs tolerantly
Never, sir
It's an infallible system
The Precogs predict a homicide, and our Precrime police then apprehend that future murderer before the event occurs
And right next door is the Judicial Center, where we prosecute the future murderers
Can we see the Precogs
No, 'm sorry
That part of the building is not open to the public
(beat) Now, if you'll just step this way She waves the group on toward an elevator
The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs
They are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16
Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees
The bodies of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed, groomed
The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright metallics
The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces seem to flow and shift, like oil on water
network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe computer
The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas
They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces
Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes from murders only they can see
Life for a Precog is an endless cycle of death
- we recognize her fragile and perfect  from the opening scene of the movie
She floats in a glowing nutritive bath
Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or eternally old
The technicians lift her from her bath
She is dried, dressed in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair
Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side of her
Not once are their helmets removed
What they feed into the mainframe is too valuable
It must be gathered twenty-four unrelenting hours a day
Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber
He can see them through a large window
He works a large computer console, the gathering point for the information the Precogs constantly feed the computer
Perhaps every ten seconds, a small  is released by the computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under Page's watchful eye -- into a black case
is in the room standing quietly behind Page
As Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in the room as an intruder in his special domain
Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs
What would they think about if we unhooked them
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 17
Page looks up from his work
They don't think, sir
They just see
Anderson is silent
(') They're not even alive, really
Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on
The female Precog sits in her chair
Her eyes are open
She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room
In the window we see Anderson leaving the room
The female Precog's eyes drift closed
: -   -- trial is in progress
The defendant is Johnny Palmer
He sits, ashen, at a table, his   beside him
There are no jurors in the Juror
There is a , 55, and stern
There are a few people in the public seats
The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson
She wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime, Anderson, who sits in the witness stand
Director Anderson, do you swear that the disc you now present to the court is the only and authentic disc of the future murder of Carol Palmer by her husband, John Palmer
It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of times
Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the Yes
This is the only and authentic disc of the event seen by the Precognitive mutants and recorded by the Precrime Division
This is the immutable evidence of the infallible system
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 18
The murder of Carol Palmer will occur In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at 10:33 in the morning
Lisa steps back
The judge reaches out and Anderson hands him the disc
The judge inserts it into a special video machine on his desk
Anderson steps down, his ritual part in this trial completed
huge  comes to life behind the judge
He does not turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor
Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide
We now see, in detail, what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning of the movie
The Palmer's family room
Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing basket for the scissors
Carol stands defenseless in front of him
Their son cowers in a corner of the room
Johnny, please -- "Johnny, please
Johnny please
" You're scaring me
' , ' Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace
(considering) don't like you any more, Carol
(imploring) Put the scissors down
You're scaring me
Please
We cut away from the monitor and stay on  ' as he sits at the defense table
He winces at each terrible exchange
(
) Oh, Carol
(
) Johnny
Stop
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19
(
) Don't grab at me
Let go
'  (
) Daddy
No
Johnny Palmer cries out as the  goes blank
didn't do it
'm innocent
It didn't happen
The  hits his gavel
How does the defense plead
The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual
The defense acknowledges the infallibility of the system
We are Guilty
We throw ourselves at the mercy of the court
No
No
The Precogs are wrong
No
The court guards are on him in an instant
They lead him out of the courtroom
-   -- Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and enters a disheveled room
The fifties interior is drab: a Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in front of a
Ed Witwer is already on the scene
He stands a few feet from the  of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun on the floor nearby
(to Anderson) Looks like the old days
Anderson nods to his former partner
Anderson leans over the body
That would be bad news for an infallible system
Witwer is suddenly bored
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 20
We know it can't be a murder -- the Precogs would've seen it
Why do you insist on coming to these things
Keeps the system honest
And besides, like to pretend 'm a cop
Anderson turns to an officer
(') Who's got the Coroner
Another  steps forward with a large blue case
Right here, sir
The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the latches
Inside the case is a large metallic : the "Coroner
" It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises crab-like, and steps out of its case
Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move
His projected image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his back
He is the interface, the way the humans communicate with the crab apparatus
Hi
Hello, Director Anderson
The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down on the floor
It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord
This a homicide, Doc
'm presently analyzing neurohormones, Assistant Director Witwer
have not concluded my examination
The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound
(') 'm detecting carbonization of skull fragments around the entry wound
Witwer whispers to Anderson
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 21
Bingo
The guy put the gun to his own head
have not determined that yet, Assistant Director
Witwer grins
You have good ears for a ghost, Doc
The coroner crab steps away from the body
Please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position
Two officers turn the body face-up
The crab inches close to probe the face
Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids, and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive
Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it comes to a standstill
The holographic Doctor closes his eyes as if in thought
Can you imagine if this was homicide
Who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more
Anderson gives him a hard look
know how, dammit
You know how
Easy, partner
(beat) But you know what 'm saying
The state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives
God bless the Precogs
The Doctor opens his eyes
This event is a negative homicide
mortal wound was generated by a 22 calibre bullet self-delivered to the parietal 'portion of the skull on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm, () ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22
(') Eastern Standard Time
This event is a positive suicide
The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears back into the coroner crab
The crab crawls back into its case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and shuts down
Witwer turns to Anderson
It's time to stop coming to these, partner
Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a stretcher
Yeah
You're right
- ,
-- Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level government officials and politicians
little bit of me dies every time come to one of these things
It's only a party, Paul
'd never have let them appoint me to Precrime if 'd have known this was going to be part of it
You're exactly what Precrime needed
An amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job
Exactly
The public loves the Precogs
But they give people the creeps, too
You're something they understandp a regular cop running things
Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed banquet hall
Let's invite all these irregular assholes over for a barbecue
Burgers and beer - think they'd come
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23
barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair, , 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from behind
'd come, Mr
Director
And 'd make all the other assholes come with me
Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough
The Senator laughs and claps him on the back
(') Nice job this morning
Another negative homicide
The Precogs never let us down
Mrs
Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases Anderson in the opposite direction have a dream, Paul
know you do, Senator
Hundreds of Precogs
Not just predicting murders, but predicting all crimes
Burglary, arson, assaults How about jaywalking
Littering
Now there's a crime
The Senator smiles through his teeth
don't want a police state, you know that
But we have an opportunity here, and No sir, we don't have that opportunity
There are only three Precogs
They're a lucky accident of nature
There are no more
(beat) We can make more
Just give me your support
Help me increase funding for the Precog Engineering Project
Precogs aren't sheep or pigs
Seeing into the future is a gift, a nonreproducible event
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 24
(') There was only one Mozart, and there are only three Precogs
Fuck Mozart
The people want to be safe
They want that more than they want food or love
He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers
(') Look at us -it's 2040 and we've wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's like a big security blanket
Why
Because we want to feel like they felt
Safe
Senator, a world filled with hundreds of Precogs is not my idea of a safe place
The Senator gives it one last shot
Sure could use your help, Paul
decline, Senator
'm sorry
(icily) Don't think 'll come to your barbecue after all
The senator moves off
Anderson stands stiffly among the sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses
-  , Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, , , 60, the head scientist
It is not a place that warms Anderson's heart
Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting and examining protoplasmic tissue masses
Other technicians peer through massive microscopes
Still others use robotic arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass barriers
You don't get out here much
Not my sort of place
Dr
Resfield emits a dry little laugh
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 25
The head of Precrime squeamish
When it comes to needles and scalpels, yeah
promise we won't use any on you
What do you use them on
(beat) On bits of this and that
Anderson looks at him
The doctor pauses outside a thick door
An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and the door opens with an electronic hiss
Anderson looks around the lab
Technicians lower mesh cylinders into some sort of chemical
Another technician turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the roiling liquid
What's happening here
We're in an interesting phase
What's in the cylinders
Neurotissue
From
fusion of sources
From the Precogs' deceased mother
From the Precogs themselves
fusion of
In lay terms, we mated sperm from the brothers with ova from the mother and sister to create new growth
The  shudder as the voltage is increased
(') And then we add mutating variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26
Anderson stares into the roiling vat
Dr
Resfield waits for more questions
But it is clear from Anderson's expression he has already learned enough
'  -- Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for premurders in the local Washington area
We stay on him as he watches the monitor
He pops the disc, jots down some notes, slides in the next disc
Anderson's mouth slowly opens
He leans close to the monitor, his face ashen
''  -- Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden
He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich soil
He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate
He lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile
It's ' What are you doing, playing hooky
Anderson tries to smile
But it won't come
He looks around the abundant garden
It's great out here, Frank
You got the touch
Frank straightens with a grimace
' got the arthritis, is what  got
Anderson reflexively looks up at a high  sound from over head
Frank follows his gaze
Precrime glides into position overhead
Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground
He takes a long sad breath
' (') Ah shit, neighbor
(beat) Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat, do they
(beat) Can we do this inside
Ellie's not home
Anderson's voice is full of pain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27
Sure, Frank
Yeah
'  -- Frank wanders the kitchen, trying to focus on his situation
Anderson has trouble meeting his friend's eyes
Through a window we can see black suited police officers with mirrored helmets swarming outside Frank's house
' (distracted) thought 'd buried it all
Thirty-five years -- all those minutes and days to bury it
(beat) But suddenly you see the man who murdered your daughter walking the streets -- my God it throws you
Frank stops pacing
He stares at a kitchen drawer
He'd served his time, Frank
know it's not fair
It's way beyond not fair
Frank looks
At Anderson bitterly
' (yells) God damn the Precogs
You know
Why couldn't they have been around to save my girl
(softly) Now they're catching me
Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun
' (') really shoot the bastard, huh
When
Next Wednesday, at noon
' Good
Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun
It's not in you, Frank, to kill anybody
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28
' Tell it to the Precogs
It's set in stone now, right
Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter
Anderson relaxes
' (almost inaudible) don't want to be a part of this world anymore
know, Frank
Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter
' (beat) So
Tell me, Paul
Do the Precogs see everything
No
' Then they won't have seen this
Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own head
On Anderson's anguished , at the  of the gun going off
-- Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's front porch
Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa comforting Ellie 'Ignazio in the living room
Anderson is deeply shaken
Witwer tries to talk him through it
() We had to bring him in
Anderson doesn't respond
(') He was a future murderer
(angrily) You blame him
The guy killed his daughter
Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in
(') Yeah
know
know
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29
Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body into the back of an ambulance
Anderson's bitterness erupts
(') hate the Precogs, Ed
believe in them absolutely and  hate them absolutely
Jesus
Witwer listens to him
(') And that goddamn lab trying to grow more of them
Put a Precog in every home, you know
So we can have more Franks - people shooting themselves -- over who knows what
Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing tones like you'd calm an agitated horse
Precrime did the job it was supposed to do
The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house
(') You know it
And you believe in it
() Yeah
It's not easy
It beats us down
Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates you right now
Anderson turns to Witwer
That's why  got into this business -- to be hated
Anderson almost manages a small smile
Witwer puts his arm around him
Walks him away from the scene
They hated us when we were regular cops
Now we're Precrime, and they still hate
It's one of the little perks of law enforcement nobody knows about
Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness
Anderson looks into his partner's good, open face
Then they both look away, their understanding of each other complete
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30
'  -- Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated by the moon
It's a mournful sight
Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed
: -- - Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber, picks up a black  marked: "Zone 218 Washington / Alexandria,
" He approaches the door, and his eyes are scanned
The door opens with a
We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office
Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach
She nods
He nods
He walks around her desk
His eyes are scanned, and the door to Anderson's office opens
looks up, wearily
'  -- Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost absently
As we have seen him do before, he swivels his chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington
across the Potomac
Hovercrafts and transports skim through the sky above the Washington Monument
The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the Precog disc begins
He hears his own voice speaking in strained, agitated tones
(
) Let's not do this, Ed
Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and horror at the monitor
shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing guns directly at each other
Their eyes intense and panicked
Who murders whom
Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red seconds tumble away
Oh, Ed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31
Witwer lowers his gun
He stands unresisting before Anderson
Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always seen it
Anderson  his weapon, puts a bullet straight into Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall
Witwer slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads: 5:20
Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank
His hand goes to his mouth
His body begins to shake
He hugs himself, but he can't stop the shaking
The  pops out of the side of the monitor
It is a small , but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it
His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside his desk, like a man in need of prayer
There is a single thought that screams through his brain
It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly
Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate
(') kill you
(beat) Oh god, kill you
As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for the disc
: In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie, the three  of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness
Their closed eyes open in
They speak as one
Murderer
After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs fade into the mists
: ' Anderson looks up sharply at the  of a knock on his door
Every normal sound seems grotesquely , the traffic outside, his own breathing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32
His senses are on overload
The door begins to open
stockinged leg is the first thing Anderson sees
His secretary,
Sir
She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs at the incriminating disc
He sees his  reflected in its alloy surface
He pushes the disc deep into his pants pocket
Somehow he finds his voice
Come in
Angela
She looks at him, uncertain
Then she places a small stack of papers on his desk
Need you to sign these
And your eleven o'clock starts in five minutes
My
eleven
(beat) Budget coordination with the
(beat) You okay, sir
Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast enough
He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case
He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks
Have Page take this
Angela steps back, disturbed
But sir, the procedure () make procedure
Call him
(long beat) 'm not okay, Angela
you're right
My head and stomach
'm going down to the clinic
Or maybe just home
Angela looks relieved at the explanation
Yes sir
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 33
He moves past her
His  fidget against the hidden disc in his pocket
'll speak to Witwer, put him in charge for the rest of the day
He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and at his view of Washington
Then he is gone
'  -- Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office
He takes a step inside
Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling him
Breaking and entering
That'll get you five to ten, hard
Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face
(') What's wrong
Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes
He into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the light
If he could just do that, show it to Witwer
Paul
Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket,
Take over for me today
You sick
Yeah
Witwer makes a show of backing away
Don't give it to me
You probably have that Trans-10 virus going around
stomach thing
hate stomach things
Anderson Almost smiles
Ed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34
Yeah
Witwer looks at him
Anderson almost reaches out for him
Run the place, okay
(smiles) Sure
Right into the ground
(beat) Go on home before  call Infectious Control and have them spray you down with something
Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway
Witwer calls out
(') You want me to do the discs, or hold them for you to review when you get back
Can't let them back up
Do 'em
Call you later
Take it easy, all right
Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that last image -- Witwer waving goodbye
-- Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar and pulls out a cell phone
He hits a button
/ Lisa sits in a meeting
Her phone  softly
She glances at the display, then rises to take it
She goes to a corner of the room
Paul
Listen to me
Lisa presses her phone close to her ear
can hardly hear you
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35
'm underground
Weakens the signal so it can't be picked up
Alarm moves across her face
But we're on Secure Listen, dammit
'm going to murder Ed
The Precogs picked it up
On Lisa -- can she have heard right
Paul
Paul His crackling voice faintly comes through the phone
' home
Lisa's phone goes dead
Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground transports
They are sleek and menacing, the black shells lumpy with dangerous gadgetry
In the distance, a , holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of one of them
He looks up at Anderson's approach
He puts his equipment down, and salutes
Hello, sir
Anderson nods, moves close
What's your name, officer
Bob, uh, Robert Smythe
These the new Python transports
The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride, is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova stun gun to the base of his neck
(') (sincerely) Sorry, Officer Smythe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36
The officer buckles
Anderson catches him, rolls him gently into the back of the transport
Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess at
Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey
They approach, then fade away
Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then aims a nozzled cylinder at them
He shoots a spray of blue BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor of the transport in an adhesive glob
Then he leaves the scene, running
' Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95
The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now
From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his steering wheel
Anderson slams it with his fist
Through his windshield Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a passing red and black Ford
His mother sits in the passenger's seat, blithely reading
The boy mimics Anderson, gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs
Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance, at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in there
Anderson stands on an embankment
He holds the Precog disc in his hand, ready to throw it into the river
He stands like that
and then slowly lets his hand drop
He doesn't do it
'  -  -- Lisa enters the house, in a rush
Every shade is drawn
Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely motionless, like a man who has died suddenly
Don't move
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 37
Lisa doesn't get it
She continues toward him
(') Stop
Moving heats you up, makes it easier for them to pick you up on their thermals
She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks
She is suddenly suffocating
It's a hundred degrees in here
turned the furnace all the way up
Your hair dryer
The oven
If they come, it'll buy me twenty seconds
Maybe thirty
Nobody's coming for you
Anderson stares at her
(') On the phone -- what you said
It's impossible
She shakes her head in disbelief
Anderson speaks, choking on the words
'm going to kill Ed Witwer
It's not true
Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair
We see the bright  cupped in the palm
He seems about to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet
He keeps staring at her intently
Something is holding him back
(') You're upset
You've been unhappy
There's a lot of pressure on you
And then Frank
One week from today
Tuesday, June 25, at five-twenty in the morning
shoot him, Lisa
(beat) You need to take time off
Anderson laughs harshly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38
You don't have to worry about that
She steps toward him
(gently) want to hold you
If you love me, stand there
And don't move
Tears well in her eyes
(') saw the disc, Lisa
shoot him
In the chest
And he dies
've watched a thousand murders
This time  star in one
Something's wrong
You wouldn't do it
The Precogs are never wrong
They emit a single disc
"The immutable evidence of the infallible system
" The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway unsteadily
Anderson focuses on her
Her face
Her hair
We'll figure this out
We'll review the system
There is no review
There's only the disc
It Shows My guilt
There's no defense
Her long hair
He stares
You can't run
Please, let's -- outside
They both turn
deep silence
The furnace churns out heat
And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair and finally understands
Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the  back into his pocket
He rises from his chair
For the first time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39
Last week
It was strange
watched from the bathroom window
You went out in the backyard to make a call
She looks at him
(') An appointment, you said
For a haircut that afternoon
Lisa's hand jumps to her hair
(') You didn't get your hair cut
You went to the trouble of calling first thing in the morning
It was that important
She reaches for him
He pulls away
Stop it
Paul, please
You're panicking
Everything's going to look wrong
You're going to distrust everybody and everything now
Lisa implores him
(') You can't distrust me
(beat) It was Ed  called
Anderson cocks his head
Ed
why outside
Why lie about it
Stop being a cop and listen to me
booming, electronically altered  suddenly penetrates the walls of the house from outside
(
) Director Anderson
There is no escape
Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife
She's frantic
Your birthday's tomorrow
We wanted to
But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40
(
) Drop to your hands and knees and stay there
Precrime is entering your house
Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically  off its hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets hurtle in
Paul
They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the stairs like a disease in fast motion
Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out, scanning rooms for thermal presence
An  1 steps out of a small room
He speaks, his voice electronically altered
1 He's got a hair dryer going
Screwed up my reading
The others nod
2 We're not picking up shit
They rush into rooms, with increased urgency
We follow 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the stairs
He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is awash in personnel
Lisa stands against the wall, pale and shaken
He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over the shattered door and out into the sunlight
Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm
But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has kicked
Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it, engines
Black Python transports are all over the street out in front, and more keep coming
And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police approaches a Python ground transport
Another officer guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left
He settles on  1's approach and raises his weapon
1 doesn't even break stride
He walks right up to the guard -- and then right through him
holograph decoy
1 enters the Python
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 41
1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson
And then comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet
little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes a red beam into his eyes
Anderson presses his lips together
The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him
Paul Anderson 0256 clear
Anderson grips the steering wheel
But his time, since it is a law enforcement
Vehicle, the steering actually works
Anderson pulls out
, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos
, and we see that the direction the Python is headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl
-- Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber
He stares at an oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor
He runs both hands through his hair
He is tired, his eyes weary, lost
voice comes over the intercom
Enter now please, Assistant Director Witwer
Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door
Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table
Powerful men sit at the other end of the table
, sharp-boned, the  Director
, awl-like eyes, the Director
Senator Malcolm
Chief Justice , whose face reveals nothing
Vice-President , whose tongue darts across his dry lips unsettlingly
Unpleasant looking men in an unpleasant mood
Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares at Witwer
The central question is: Why does Anderson want to kill Witwer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42
Cronin holds up the printout
(') We checked your finances
His finances
Nothing irregular, you don't steal from him, he doesn't steal from you
You haven't done anything that he might have discovered, and vice versa
Swanson holds up another sheath of papers
Personnel checks reveal no ambitious coups planned by you to topple him
(beat) He's done nothing to you, or you to him
Witwer presses his lips together
- You fucking his wife
No
Witwer gives him a bad look
(') Okay
There we are
So, you are friends, partners, and soul mates
Anderson has no motive
can't think of one
(beat) Maybe   The Precogs are mistaken
Witwer looks away
Jesus, he wants out of this room
You don't believe that, do you
(barely audible) No
The Precogs are infallible
Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43
You're goddam right
So, gentlemen -screw the motive
We got a pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty little  problem
The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer
- And here is our solution
You are now Director Witwer
Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest
Almer silences him with a raised finger
-  (') Precrime must demonstrate its willingness to go after one of its own
Total impartiality
Now look -- Cronin talks right over him
The public must believe that every future murderer is pursued with equal vigor
Therefore, Precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job
And who would pursue a murderer harder than his intended victim
You went after Anderson yesterday -because it was right, and because you believe
Almer speaks with a tight irony
- And your belief will certainly grow stronger with each tick of the clock
Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred
But he does not deny their words
Haw long will it take, Director
Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the task he can't avoid
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 44
He knows Precrime, of course
And the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll remember how to work them
It'll come back to him fast
He's
the best
Witwer almost smiles
Justice Pollard's not smiling
We're not here to praise Caesar -- we're here to bury him
Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his right eye
He can't avoid iris identification
Every door he opens, every  he uses, or taxi or transport he boards -- he'll get scanned
(quietly) It won't take long to find him
The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking
The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all feels different than it did in the suburbs
Where the burbs were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy
The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them
The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's suits have some shine at the elbows
You look over your shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less
And some streets you don't go on at all
Anderson's Python moves down one of them
He stops under a blackened suspension bridge, gets out
He's still in uniform
He holds a duffel bag
He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates
He's left the door open
He shakes his head at his sloppiness
Goes back and shuts the door
Walks away again
He's left a small  on the passenger's seat
Digital numbers shoot by in reverse
Something
Anderson continues walking away
He doesn't look back as the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame
It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode
It just ceases to exist
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 45
- -- Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and dresses hanging in clear plastic bags
He gets to work on the door
'  -- Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark
She listens to an almost inaudible sound, a high
' Precrime  floats high above her house, a dark moon in the low clouds
-- worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the clean clothes piled on the floor
It almost looks like a nest, like someone slept there Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel bag, stands on a subway platform
He takes out a cell phone, dials a number
He looks up at the  of a train
The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front car: "33rd Street Express
" : Search and Command room
Witwer moves up and down the aisles, past technicians who man computers and holographic tracking displays
Precrime  1 suddenly sits upright
Witwer picks him out of the crowd and zeroes in
It's Anderson
Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button Paul
The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a Glowing holographic
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 46
Anderson, holding his phone, is IdentiScanned along with everyone else as he steps onto the train
: Another  2 calls out to Witwer
Witwer covers his phone mouthpiece
2 He's been Scanned
He's on the 33rd Street Subway
1 Calls from the other side of the room His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl
We got him on the Subway, too
: Anderson sits on a seat in the rear of the car
Why am  going to kill you,Ed
:    / There's no motive My wife calling you before breakfast
We were planning a surprise party
It was going to be today
(beat, ironic) Happy birthday, partner
This party's no fun, Ed
It's a hell of a surprise, though
(beat) 'm having trouble trusting people, Ed,  gotta tell you
At Precrime, they upload a   of the Express train's route
We see a blue light moving -- the train
And two separate red dots along its route
An  points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low voice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 47
The train makes two stops, here and here: 20th, then 33rd Street
Witwer covers the Mouthpiece (to the officer) Split the units, go to both We'll never make 20th Witwer waves him away -- do your job
Now
You there, Ed
'm here
You gotta come in, Paul
'm a Cop, Ed
need a motive
Come in
We'll figure this thing out together
: Precrime transports zoom through the city : Anderson looks out the window into the tunnel dark
He talks to Witwer
: / It'll get ugly if you keep running
And your eyes, Paul -- every move you make a Scanner will pinpoint you for us
saw a news flash
You're the new Director
Is that the point of this
Fuck you
Anderson smiles
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 48
Didn't think so
But it has to be something, Ed
Witwer looks at the
We see the blue train nearing its first stop, 20th street
We see two waves of lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and 33rd
Paul
Come in
Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next Stop 20th Street
If  come in, it puts me close to you
If  get close
may kill you
can't risk that
(beat) Anyway, they'd force you to lock me up
And that'd be it -- 'd never get my chance to solve this thing
Witwer needs to keep him talking You're kinds liking this, in a way, aren't you
The action
And you get to be a real cop again
We get to flex our muscles
: 20TH Precrime vehicles pull up
Hovercrafts appear in the sky above
: 20TH Anderson's train is just finishing off-loading passengers
The doors close and the train begins to pull out as the first helmeted Precrime officers flood the platform
One of them points
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 49
Anderson is visible through the window, talking on his cell phone
: Witwer stares at the map
The train has stopped at 20th street
But Anderson's still talking
He isn't getting off -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop
Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls over to Witwer
Witwer covers his mouthpiece
2 We have visual verification -- he's still on the train
Witwer gives him a thumb's up
We   Witwer as he listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd on the
' want to tell you something, partner
You listening
Witwer nods
Now the  shows all the Precrime units swarming toward the 33rd Street subway station
Yeah
' gotta do this
have to figure this thing out
(beat) But listen to me now
If it was you running, 'd come after you, Ed
Witwer stares at the , at all the units he's sent after his friend
'  (') You're a cop
And 'm a future murderer
(beat) Do your job, Ed
Come after me hard Because, Jesus Christ,  wouldn't sleep or eat until  had tracked you down and put a gun to your head
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 50
33RD Precrime officers pour down the stairs toward the train platform
: Witwer watches on the  at all the little symbols merging together, like a gameboard -- but this game ends in a reallife confrontation between one man and an army of them
You wouldn't shoot a cop would you, Paul
(beat) Paul
Paul
He looks urgently to the phone technician 1 He's still on the line
Witwer presses his ear to the phone
He can hear the subway make its
Then he hears a chorus of mechanized -the voices of the Precrime police, the  of panicked passengers ' Police
Everyone down on your hands and knees
(then) Oh, shit
: The Precrime officers aim the index barrels of their gloveweapons at , who sits blithely on a seat, holding his cell phone to his ear
Anderson begins to shimmer, then dematerialize ghost-like, into nothingness
He was a holographic decoy
What is actually there on the train seat is Anderson's cell phone
Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice recorder
: 20TH Anderson trots up the stairs and safely out onto the streets of The Sprawl
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 51
-   -- Every city has its underbelly
If you lifted the fat dark underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up
The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight
There are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its source, never makes it through the sour air down to the ground
The retro fifties look comes apart here
The people that you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting tech-fibers
' caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black
Anderson has him pinned up against a wall
They're having some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder against the wall
Finally, the guy does something odd
He lifts a finger and pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid
Anderson lets him
Then the guy does the same on the left
Has a long look
And then nods
Anderson releases him, and they go off together
-- An oppressive brick thing on a side street
The facade is crumbling
Nothing good happens in a building like this
The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off into the night
-- stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink
But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia console
Anderson sits in a chair facing
is a big man with delicate fingers
He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into a handkerchief
Got a cold
Anderson looks at him uneasily
It's not just  -- it's the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing, which Anderson truly does not care for
Doc sneezes again, then looks up at his patient
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52
(') Don't worry
could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there, and you'd never get an infection
Not with the spectrum antibios 'll be shooting into you
'm not here for cat surgery, Doc
Doc chuckles
Then he waits, expectantly
Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card
preset cash card
slides it into small console, watches the numbers flash up
He frowns, sighs
(') It's all  could safely move He waits
Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods
Yeah
All right
Time to got down to business
Doc walks over to a large medical cabinet and opens the door
It's full of , and parts of eyes -- 611
cryo-jars
Anderson tightens
(') You understand what  told you then
can't just give you new irises
The Scanners will read the scar tissue
Alarms will go off
'm a cop,  know gotta take your eyes out
Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up Yeah
(') And put in new ones
Yeah get it,
Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the operating table
He lies down
(') Do me quick before  run out of here
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53
Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling
He listens to Doc preparing instrument trays
It's a bad sound
-- The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the Python transport
Witwer stands watching as a Precrime techno-unit sifts through the white ashes
Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the Potomac
It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing the air for a scent
-   -- We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see anything either
He's in a deep post-surgical haze
' voice comes to him
It's warped and ugly
' Don't take the bandages off for twenty four hours
You'll go blind if you do
Anderson makes an affirmative grunt
Now we see his surroundings, even though Anderson still can't
He lies in a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings
Doc stands over him
You're in a room
had you moved here, a couple miles from my place
If they find you, they don't find me
Anderson grunts weakly
(') guy will come in, feed you once
(beat) juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes, 'cause  know you're in a hurry
(Fuzzily)) Nano-re
construction
Organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and blood vessels
It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs
Don't scratch
Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages
Doc forces them away
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54
(') 'm giving you a bonus, might come in handy
Feel this
Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to Anderson's hand
(') It's a temporary paralytic enzyme
Someone spots you, you duck into an alley, shoot this under your chin
Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's chin
Anderson jumps
(') The enzyme turns your facial muscles to mush
You won't look like the same man
Jesus
You tighten up again in about thirty minutes
Hurts like nothing you ever felt
It's vicious, but effective
'll put it in your bag
Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed
(') 'm setting up a timer
When it buzzes tomorrow, take off your bandages, and get the hell out of here
Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone
-- The Precrime presence mounts on the streets
couple of units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop
-- Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold
He looks like a hostage
He is sweating
Keeps reaching for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to
He speaks to someone we don't yet see
The guy  said would come
'm hungry, but sick to my stomach
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55
(') Guess  should eat
(Beat) You gonna help feed me
Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent to help Anderson
It's the rat guy, the thin bald man Anderson had roughed up the day before
The guy has a bowl of hot soup in his hands
He stares contemptuously at Anderson
(') So how do we do this, pal
The rat guy doesn't say a word
He simply tips the hot soup and it splatters down into Anderson's lap
Anderson cries out in pain and surprise
The guy walks out of the room
- Twenty hours gone by
Four more to go
Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch, looking for leads, looking for anything
The  shows one hour to go
Anderson sits in a chair, squirming miserably
His dressings are wet with sweat, and frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked at them
(to himself) Fuck
He is this close to ripping the dressings off -- Precrime transport stops
Two officers get out
One of them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and does a read on the boarding house
The other does a read on a pawn shop and bar next door
The  1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the other officer
1 Got 27 warm bodies in this place
What should it take, three or four Spiders
2 Do four
Speed things up, so we can go eat
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56
The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out a box
He removes four round
They are silver, as big as billiard balls
He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and the front door opens
He rolls the balls down a dark hallway
Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against it, bored
He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits for the data to come in
The  roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to autolife as they spin
They open like flowers -- flowers with legs
: fist-sized Spider takes shape
On its head is an IdentiScan lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna
An   sits at a card table eating a bowl of something unidentifiable
She looks up with annoyance as she sees a spider scuttling across the floor toward her
It makes a sound on the floor as it comes
She's poor, living in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill
She continues to eat as the  crawls up the leg of the card table
She barely watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand
It's nice to have a little company She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder
It grips her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes
Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and  away across the linoleum
The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column with his laser pen, and waits for the next one
' Anderson sits in his chair
He cocks his head, listening
His body tenses
Something feels wrong
The  shows ten minutes to go
Blindfolded for a day and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left
Three seconds, four hours
flattened  squeezes under his door
Anderson tenses as it  across the floor toward him
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57
He knows that sound
Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair
He starts to grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops himself
The  waits for him to settle, then toward him again
Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider
He is dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard
The Spider comes faster
Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down
Falls across the bed
The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard
One of the Spiders is taking too long
He adjusts his thermal scanner, and sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room
The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1
They both watch the screen
1 Stinking drunk
2 (beat) Or a guy who doesn't want to get read
' Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the consequences
The Spider advances, starts up his leg
The  has not buzzed
Anderson can't touch his dressings
The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face
It and  trying to adjust its antenna against the dressings
The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in
' The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get past the dressings for a read
Anderson has no choice
None
He starts to lift at his dressing
The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in place
Anderson wants to scream
He unwraps his head, tugs the eye pads away from his eyes
He rips them off
The Spider sits on his shoulder, waiting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58
Anderson's eyes are tightly closed
He opens them '  - Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear flashpoint
Light to buckle the knees and push the brain beyond endurance
And though all this the faraway sound of a  going off
The  has finally sounded
Anderson's open eyes are streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment
'  - It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his eyes
Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps off his shoulder, and crosses the floor
It flattens, scoots under the door, and is gone
The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read
They pull off their helmets
1 Let's eat
They start putting their equipment back into the transport
' Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror
His new eyes are tender and bloodshot
And they are not blue, like the ones he was born with, but a deep brown
Anderson is exactly the same, and utterly different
He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there
' -- Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office
Witwer isn't looking too well, either
They told me to move into Paul's office

Lisa nods

So do  -- you won't bring him in dead
Yeah
But if he shoots a cop
(beat) Which is what he does four days from now, isn't it
Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a  on his desk
He'd never hurt you

But the other thing know is -- the Precogs are never wrong
The words are leading them no place good
They stop talking, and just sit there
Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with several people waiting for the N0
6 Turbo Tram
The double decker Tram comes
People get off, then the line starts to move forward as people get on
Anderson fidgets
He's last in line
Each person gets IdentiScanned as he boards
Anderson's putting his new eyes to the test
If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself to run
The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare
Anderson's turn
Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam reads his eyes
The Tram  glances at a monitor beside his steering wheel, then nods at him
Welcome aboard, Mr
Symington
Plenty of seats in the back
Anderson nods, moves casually to the back
But his jaw muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension
-   -- Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den
He wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos adorning the cherry wood walls
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 60
He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford to
No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors
No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand
Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small at ear level, coming from just behind him
It's a metallic -
He turns amiably
His eyes instantly widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into the barrel of ' cocked gun
Time to upgrade your alarm system, Senator
Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure
His fear embarrasses him
(') Your work-up of Witwer
The Security Panel would've done one
(beat) Why do  kill Witwer
The Senator finds his voice
There's no motive
There's, always a motive
Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead
He slides the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty skin
It makes a greasy red mark
(') could've come to anyone on the panel
But  picked you
(beat) Of all the shits on that panel, like you least of all
So if this gun goes off, 'll feel bad, but not, you know, devastated
You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm
And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns and walks to the other side of the den
His tone is mocking
What the fuck was  worried about
You can't kill me
The Precogs would've seen it
Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun
The Senator is even laughing now
For a moment Anderson does nothing, then he moves toward the Senator again
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 61
The Senator stands his ground smugly
(') Witwer's clean
You're clean
There's nothing
No motive
Kind of like something Kafka would've cooked up
(beat) You like that, cockroach
You're fucked and you'll never know why
The Senator is laughing hard now
Anderson lets him
Tell you something about the Precogs, Senator
They're great on murder
But it's the little things they fail to see
Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the floor and into the cherry wood panelling
Several of his beloved photos crash down onto him
(') Little things like that, for instance
Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room -- Search and Command room
Witwer stands there amidst all of the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers
He hasn't shown up on one goddamn IdentiScan in three days
No one says anything, and then  , 30, speaks up
He's found a room -- he's going to sit it out
Yeah, except for holding a gun to senator Malcolm's goddman head in his own goddman house last night, Anderson's sitting it out
(beat) Why hasn't he been scanned
The officers look at their shoes
(') Why is he invisible
He's moving around but he isn't being seen
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 62
Lieutenant Glaser tries again
Hes beating the scanners No one beats the scanners
Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with his hands
The fingers dragging across his eyes stop
Then his hands drop away, and he looks at his men
(') He's done his eyes But the scarring always He went the whole way
The crazy bastard had his eyes removed
New ones sewn in
That takes weeks to heal
If you're prepared to go blind, a street surgeon'll juice up the repair cycle

Witwer's eyes flick to a digital  on the wall
It's something he can't help doing now

He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts the carton down in front of him
There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton, about the size of a playing card

Nothing unusual, they always do that
For advertisements, lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins
good one
The kid straightens up

-   -- big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn perched on his belly
He stares at a  monitor that's the size of a twin bed
Anderson's face fills the monitor
The  image is so big that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence
It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to avoid Him you can't
The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that
He surfs through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is omnipresent
-   -- Anderson's face fills the skies, too
Witwer and Precrime have pulled out all the stops
Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it
Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air
There are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the weather, a special type of cloud
People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go about their business
- One person who is paying deep attention to all this is Anderson himself
He stands on a street corner, wearing dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk
The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a Precrime
The United States Supreme Court has issued a special injunction allowing the unprecedented public viewing of former Precrime Director Paul Anderson's future murder of Edward Witwer, the current Director
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64
His mouth slowly opens
He steps back against a wall and slides his hand into his pants pocket
He looks at the Precog  in his cupped hand, then quickly puts it away
He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather around excitedly
look into the sky, in store windows, at other video kiosks
They have the enthralled anticipation of a mob at a public guillotining
She continues her declamation (') The video you are about to see, generated by the Precognitive mutants, is the immutable evidence of the infallible system

Shakes his head in confusion and disbelief
But he has the Precog disc
The   him nudges him This oughtta be good, huh
And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing guns at each other
The whole thing just as we saw it before
All the way through to the fatal moment
Oh, Ed
Anderson shoots him
Witwer slumps, dying
The video stops
And then begins to play all over again, right from the start, the 1-800- number scrolling along the bottom of it

-   -- Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting life
But it supports the kind of life Page is interested in
An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool beside Page
He gives one shake of his head, and she slides away again
His eyes cut to a group of females
He waits for the next approach
: as a  reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc on the bar in front of him
Page makes a sound and tries to jump away, as if the disc is something lethal
Which it is, in a way
Anderson presses him back down on his stool
Sits next to him
Page stares at him, scared
Anderson looks straight ahead as he speaks
"Ennis Page engages the services of prostitutes because his relationships with them compound his feelings of selfloathing

Something's out of order, Ennis
Deeply out of order

Lets Page work through it
(') It's the basis of the system
The immutable evidence
Copies are impossible
(beat) You went home
little later, came in with a disc for Mr
Witwer to review
wasn't halfway out the door when he cried out
Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard
(') He was in shock
He showed me
It was you shooting him
Then all hell broke loose
He had to send the Precrime units to your house
Ennis -- you gave out the same disc twice
Less than an hour apart
The one  stole
And then another one
Of the same event
It's impossible
The Precogs can only move forward to new events
Into the future
They never repeat
Anderson looks around
Patrons are beginning to look over in his direction, eyes lingering
He rises
Page seems in a daze
As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the concept of an untidy system is disorienting
Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't
On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned
An automatic calls out after him
Have a nice night, Mr
Symington Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The Sprawl

Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground
High in the sky, a  , everpresent in Lisa's life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible
Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers
Her hand drifts near a white

Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car
The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars

It's Anderson
Isn't it
She looks into his eyes
And it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now
But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for him
Knows she can't
He's already moving on
He's risked everything for a look

Precrime has the second
Duplicates

He gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to drink
He waits in line
He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting
The woman ahead of him argues about change
He presses his lips together
And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera attached to the ceiling
It gives him a fish eye reflected  of what's happening behind him
Precrime police are happening behind him
He doesn't stop to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store
Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the clerk to the floor
Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can
He hears the mechanically altered  of a Precrime officer calling from the store
Paul Anderson
Drop to your hands and knees

Chunks of brick fly off the walls on both sides
But he is full of adrenaline, and there is no stopping him

-   -- different part of the city
Anderson hunkers low in the back seat of a tram
He looks up, as the  swears What the hell -- Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the windshield
Precrime transports are heading straight at the tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue
They've even taken radio control of the
system on the tram
Paul Anderson
Drop to your hands and knees
Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing him
The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare at him, terrified
Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street
He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into his bag for a glove
He pulls the weapon onto his right hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament
Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the street
He looks up
He is surrounded by skyscrapers and buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban canyon
People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into doorways where they can
Passengers in trans and taxis or cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching
Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in
The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically altered
(') Lower your weapon, or we will neutralize your threat potential
The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men
Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building closest to him
'  - The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71
Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement
(') Do not move
Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the building, right beside the high pressure hydrant
He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing
It is a moment for prayer
Anderson doesn't have a moment
He spreads his feet and fires a massive   down at the sidewalk
The effect on the underground water main is immediate
of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen feet into the air right alongside the building
The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's bouncing at the top of the geyser
And they can't fire, anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement from every window in the building
All this in a time span of seconds
The world spins crazily for , but he manages to grip hold of a metal support beam holding the building's sign, one story up
The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of water from the water main break obscures his moves
He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along it toward a second story window
The office building gawkers lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to sparkling dust and leaps inside
The building covers almost an entire city block
Anderson, dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way
He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field, jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever he must to get to his goal
And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime ambushed him
He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream of traffic
It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers
Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of the bus
It is a bone-jarring landing
He loses consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof, and slides off it onto the pavement
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72
He lies there, trying to rouse himself
Traffic brakes to a stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in the road
No one wants to touch him
single car horn , and then a chorus of them
Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a limping run
Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at the far end of the passenger platform
There are tracks on either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other "Downtown
" He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that the Downtown train is coming in
And on his left, too, the Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view
Which MagLev train will lead him to safety
Which one won't they pinpoint
He runs up to a teenage  who has his arm around his girlfriend
They step back, startled
He's got a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle shoes
The trains pull in
Pick one for me
What
Point to the train  should take
Please
don't know
The girl lifts a nervous finger and points
The Uptown
He runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to the Downtown
He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the dark rush by
train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible they could find him
station Stop
He starts to get off, is actually on the platform, then steps back onto the train
The rushing dark again
When the MagLev eases to a halt at the next station he gets off this time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73
He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people
He eases back and lets them go up first
Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching people out of the way as they come into view
They wait -but Anderson does not come
And he does not come
On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs
hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling, adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam
'  - as they run below him down the stairs
They go out of sight, he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for him
The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him
He reaches up
With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve, releasing himself from the glob
He drops to the stairs, and instantly slips up them
He surprises a helmeted , just around the bend
He slams  against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds the laser knife against his throat
The  1s clearly terrified
He speaks hoarsely through Anderson's choking grip
Don't kill me
Jesus
Please
Anderson looks at the panicked officer
Anderson closes his eyes trying to put it together
He opens them
But the Precogs would've predicted me killing you
You'd know whether do or not
The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy
Anderson suddenly gets it
He tightens his grip on the man
(') They shut down the system
Haven't they
They've shut down the Precogs
The officer nods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 74
They're off homicides
They're redirecting them to help us locate you
Which is how they knew where he'd be every time
Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull, knocking him out
And then he runs, because what else can he do
-- Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled: 17
She holds a briefcase in one hand
Down the hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one
She enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17
17 Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom
The lights are dim
She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase
She turns it on
The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and over in a continuous loop
Flashing at the bottom is the hotline number: "1-800-
" Then- "Call Now
Call Now
Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the first disc
She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench
The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side
The tv plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc
She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from one version to the other
They seem absolutely identical
When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again
Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend, endlessly
-  -- gas station right out of the fifties
An attendant in a uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield of a sky blue Rambler
In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 75
' Anderson looks at himself in the mirror
He reaches out and touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown
It is still startling to him, the color of his eyes
Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air syringe Doc gave to him
He looks at it nervously
It is filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid
He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin
He closes his eyes
Then he screws up his courage, and hits the plunger
The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a searing
Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall of the bathroom
His hands reach up for his face -- which looks like it's boiling from within
' The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker
The muscle tone around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old man's
That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years
His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop
Healthy pink is replaced by bloodless gray
' The  knocks nervously on the door You all right in there
When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom
Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches after him uncertainly as he wanders off
-  -- The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around the headquarters
There may be a massive campaign to find Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues to run without interruption
There are ten people in the group, and the physically transformed Anderson is among them
They all wear glowing nametags
Anderson's reads, "Mr
Symington
" He keeps his hands in his pockets, and his head low
We have heard the tour guide's spiel before ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 76
Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime
Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States
She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson
He is fidgeting uncomfortably
(') Are you
all right, Mr
Symington
Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close
He whispers to her, embarrassed
She gives him a professional smile, and points in the distance past the elevators
Anderson nods, and heads off
She calls after him
(') We'll wait right here for you, sir
Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor
Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping
" Above the doorway is an IdentiScan device
Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small cryo-jar
:  - Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs -the irises a luminous blue
-- The operations room in Precrime
The technicians sit at their computers and holographic tracking displays
Witwer paces among them
His eyes keep flicking to the digital clock on the wall
Then they cut back to the men and machines that are telling him nothing
Witwer does not look well at all, When a  leans close to his computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get to him
He looks over the man's shoulder
What is it
Must be a glitch
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 77
What
Anderson just got IdentiScanned
Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair
The technician types the data through again
(') It's him -- he's been scanned
Where is he
The technician looks up at Witwer
But he's had his eyes done
Right
Sir
Tries to think it through
(barely audible) He had to have
The technician's computer flashes the next piece of information
When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer wants to hear
Jesus Christ, sir
He's in the basement of this building
All eyes turn to Witwer
The unspoken question hangs in the air
Anderson's come to murder Witwer
Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement
Four officers stand guard in the chamber
They listen to the orders coming in on their earpieces
Three of the guards rush out of the room, one stays behind
The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female in the middle, the males on either side of her
Their eyes are open
and they are deeply alert
Two technicians tend to the Precogs
At the back of the chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting at the huge mainframe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78
ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around Witwer
Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all
This is ridiculous
Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully Standing orders from the Security Panel, sir
If he wants to get to me, he'll get to me
No, he won't, sir
Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly
Then his eyes flick to the wall clock
Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting defensive searches of one room after another
All they are coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers
In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three Precogs
And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as the power is cut
The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite flashlights
The Search and Command room suddenly looks exceedingly vulnerable
technician calls out from the darkness Don't worry, air -emergency generators will kick on in five seconds
The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room seem alive with fireflies
Five seconds go by
Then ten more
Explanation, please
Uh, sir
It seems
he got the generators, too
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79
There is a long moment of silence
And then Witwer begins to laugh
The room is utterly dark and silent
The silence is broken by the  of something rolling across the floor
Somebody speaks, probably the guard
Shit
An explosion of light fills the room in - blasts
And leaping through the light is
The temporarily blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees
Anderson stun guns them quickly
The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor
We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features are returning to normal
He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs
It is the equipment he is after
Through the observation window we see   watching in horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the Precog helmets to the mainframe
Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing it out and knocking Page unconscious
Then he reaches into the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of blasts
Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a behind him
Perhaps it is because the movement is so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection
, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes hold of his hand
Anderson whirls around, weapon out
And there before him, is the  Precog
He looks at her, then beyond her to the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in their chairs
Her helmet is off
She is young, but her close-cropped hair is silver white
And when she speaks, her voice is like the wind whispering through time
Save us, Anderson
Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way
have to get out of here
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80
She grips his hand
Save us
It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading
And her eyes, she won't let him go
She is beginning to weaken, to sway on her feet
sudden realization floods over Anderson
You let me get here, didn't you
You stopped giving them information, so they couldn't track me
The Precog female is fading fast
She tries to reach out for him and her legs give way
Save -- And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls
What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom
Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen for over an hour
The two versions of Anderson murdering Witwer play over and over
(wearily, to herself) Help me, Paul
She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's fills the screen
Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes
And it is his , finally, that tell her everything
Lisa's hand rises to her open mouth
(') They're blue
She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800 number scrolling along the bottom
When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen, she leans close to it and squints
Anderson stares right back at her
And for the first time, Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical
His eyes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 81
(') And now they're brown
For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile
Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters
Witwer walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber
teams work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson has left in his wake
Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the brothers
Their eyes are closed and they are limp
Their lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other
Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is almost to himself
Why didn't the Precogs know he was coming to do this
The Lieutenant has no reply
Witwer runs both hands through his hair
It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the clock
(') The next time he shows up it'll be to kill me
We won't let that happen, sir
Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the Lieutenant a withering look
You won't, huh
When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs
He stares at the Precogs
(') (to a technician) When can we get these things operational
They're a hive mind, sir
It takes three for their predictive abilities to be fully operational
Which Witwer does not want to hear
Witwer leans very close to the technician
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82
These two are all  have to find the man who is about to murder me
Hook them up, and flood them with whatever kind of fucking chemicals you have to
They are a machine, and  need that machine at my disposal
The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin their silent movements again
'  -  -- Ennis Page is a man unglued
He sits on a tidy little sofa, in a tidy 1950's style living room
But his movements have become untidy
He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue
When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his chin onto his shirt
Not like Ennis, at all
When his doorbell , he slowly looks up, then looks down at the floor again
He doesn't answer it
It  some more
And then Lisa is standing there before him Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis could just walk in here

To turn it on
She sits down beside him
You don't look surprised to see me
She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside him, three gone
(') need your help
Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes
He took one of my babies
He's desperate, Ennis
He had to
(beat) We have to help him
Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes
He closes them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83
(') It's a fake Ennis
Ennis's eyes open again
(') This is the first disc
You delivered it to Director Anderson
He reviewed it
And then he stole it, and went on the run
Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze
His words slur
delivered
a fake
to him
But he thought it was real, and ran with it
The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing it
(') An hour later, you delivered a second disc of the same event
Witwer reviewed it
It was real
(Beat) How do  know this
Ennis just wants her to go away
He wants it all to go away
Tears stream down his face
(') Director Anderson had his eyes changed
They were blue
Now he has brown ones
Ennis is sliding away
Lisa takes hold of him
Makes him listen, dammit
She points to the disc in her hand
(') This disc, the fake one, shows a blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer two days from now
He doesn't have blue eyes anymore
The person who faked this disc had no idea he would change his eyes
Lisa shakes him
(') Listen
But the second disc has to be real, because he has brown eyes when he murders Witwer
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 84
(') (beat) Somebody tried to frame him with a fake
And somehow it all became real Why, Ennis
How could this happen
Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of comprehension
(') You handle the discs
How did a fake one get delivered
Ennis's eyes roll back into his head
Coffee
(') You want--
He spilled coffee everywhere
Everywhere
What coffee
What are you --
But Ennis sags unconscious
She shakes him hard, even slaps him, but Ennis is out
She lets him drop down on the sofa
From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes the  of a hovercraft
Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there -   -- small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance
Which is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog
The female Precog lies on a cot
Anderson sits on a metal folding chair watching her
Her eyes slowly open and look at him My brothers aren't here
You didn't even look around
You knew
(beat) We can sense each other
You must save Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85
Stop
saved You
It was the best could do
She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall
There is a fading pink cabbage rose
She traces the outline of it with her thin finger
She turns back to him
Thank you, Anderson
It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog
What am  going to do with you
Her eyes grow very serious
Name me, Anderson
What
Give me a name
've never had one
Anderson rises, moves around the small room
He is shamed, embarrassed
Listen
She turns to the wall
(') Listen to me
(beat) Listen to me
Rose
It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when she faces him again
Rose
Rose
They shifted your precognition so you would locate me
(beat) Yes
And it hurt us, physically
Did you know that
The helmets, the controls
It hurts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 86
(guiltily) didn't know
For a long moment he can't say anything
But there are things he needs to understand
(') When they shifted you to find me, you didn't reveal everything
That was going to break into Precrime
We saw our chance
You would need to shut us down, you would have to come
We wanted you to come
You used me -- to save you
have been used all my life, Anderson
Anderson can't meet her eyes
(') No one cared that we were human
From a human mother
Taken at birth
Hooked to machines
(beat) We have been alive, Anderson
Enslaved, for the greater good
Her words are unbearable, for both of them
She traces the outline of the wallpaper rose again
(') But now  have a name
And  know the man who has named - me will not allow me to be enslaved again
Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully watches the street below
Rose
What's going to happen to us
Can you see that
'm weak
And away from my brothers
see glimpses and hints of things nearby
But it's all
scattered
(beat) 'm tired of the future, Anderson
She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her
He sits carefully on the side of her bed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87
Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek You didn't know  was going to do that, did you
She is almost too overwhelmed to speak No
Oh, Anderson
It was lovely
And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed ' If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page to see the state of his living room
Precrime officers everywhere
Blood on the rug
gun beside the sofa
Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner crab walk Page's body
It  and  as it probes and takes samples from various sites
The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab makes its determinations
Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer Who else could it've been
The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head (') He grabbed a Precog so he could commit an undetected murder
(beat) Page worshipped the system
He fell apart
Shot himself
The Lieutenant rolls his eyes
Anderson
Witwer doesn't say anything
He just stares at the body The crab finishes
The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and turns his head to Witwer
He is only a computer interface, but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his digitalized voice
Director Witwer
This event is a positive homicide
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 88
(') (beat) mortal wound was generated by a 38 calibre bullet delivered to the left occipital portion of the anterior skull, on June 16th, 2040, at 1:24 am, Eastern Standard Time
Phase Two Investigation is in order
No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself back in its box
At last, someone moves
It is Witwer
He lifts his arm, pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his watch
'  -- Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer
Lisa points
There
She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on the two monitors
- On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he has brown
The one on the left, the first disc -it's a fake
He doesn't have blue eyes anymore
Witwer stares for a long time
fake
() But the Precogs predict the infallible truth
They don't emit fake discs
And now Lisa smiles
She has set her lawyerly mind to the solution
It is her moment Exactly
You can't tamper with the Precogs, induce them to make fakes () ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 89
(') (beat) But that doesn't mean someone couldn't have made a fake disc on their own and inserted it into the delivery system
The simplicity of it is inconceivable
Witwer speaks carefully, trying to process it Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake disc in with that day's real ones
(excited) We're all programmed to believe anything we see on a Precog disc
The system has never been wrong
Witwer stares at the proof before him
-- the different colored eyes of Anderson
He ejects both discs and holds them in his hands
(') You have to call off the hunt
He was set up
Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding (long beat) It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes her head, shocked at his response He was set up
You both were
If Paul kills you, you're both out of the picture
Who wants us out
Of what picture
Jesus, Ed
Stop this thing
And then we can investigate Witwer's mouth opens and closes
He tries again
Ennis Page was murdered last night
The blood drains from Lisa's face (') Everything points to Paul
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90
He's not a murderer
think he is
murderer
and a future murderer
(beat) Lisa
What does it matter that the first disc is a fake
if the second one's real
Witwer's hands close tight on the discs
Lisa stands there, motionless
Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly
He watches her go
-   -- Rose sits in a chair near the window
She is chewing lightly on a cracker
Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's texture and taste
She holds it up and admires its shape
Anderson's mood is less wondrous Rose
Listen to me
'm going to leave you here
have to keep moving
' No
You must save my brothers
It's impossible
There's no time
've done what  can do
Rose waits for him to finish
She looks out the window at the street scene
Come here, Anderson
He does, reluctantly
(') Do you see that boy in the blue hat walking with his mother
(beat) In sixty seconds he will walk beneath those workers installing a window on the tenth floor of that building
'  - Two men struggle to lift a large window in place
Way below the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk holding his mother's hand
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91
(') They'll drop the window, killing him
It is impossible to save him
Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door, hurls it open, and disappears down the hall
Rose listens to his  crashing down the stairs Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the have lost their grip on the window
The little  in the blue hat and his  walk unwittingly toward disaster
They do not appear to hear the ' cries
The  falls end over end above the boy's head
The sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it looks like a star falling from the sky
across the street sees what is happening, and cries out
But what Anderson does is run
He runs faster and harder than humanly possible
He does not care if he is recognized or hit by a passing taxi
He is going to get to that boy
He has to get to that boy
rams the  from behind just as the corner of the window frame kisses the boy's blue hat
He knocks the boy to safety as glass and metal  into the sidewalk
The mother does not even have time to scream
She is on the ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy
He rolls away, and gets to his feet
Before anyone can put together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley, and is gone
- Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small cuts on his face and hands
He stands across the room staring at Rose
Rose considers him
When she speaks her voice is near and distant at the same time
For Anderson, it is as if the words are coming from a place inside his own head
It was impossible to save that boy -- but you did, Anderson
It's in you
It's what you are Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a wall
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 92
You knew it wasn't impossible
That 'd get there
Rose reveals nothing
You are a man who saves others
(beat) Save my brothers
Anderson almost laughs
Her persistence is unbelievable 'm in a lot of trouble right now
My brothers are in more trouble
They've moved them to
an awful place
Rose
Ed Witwer -he's in the most trouble of all
Who saves him Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her head
She curls into a fetal position
Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder
Her eyes roll into the back of her head
Whose pain is she feeling
Her own
Someone else's
Anderson doesn't want to think about it
- ,  -- Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two Precog brothers have been brought here
The room is makeshift, uncomfortable
a place for experiments
The brothers are strapped into chairs
They are helmeted
But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in their jugular veins
Connected to the needles are long twists of  tubing
There are several IVs running at high drip rates
Witwer has his back to all this
He stands with Dr
Resfield, watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge mainframe
Dr
Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at the Precogs, uneasy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93
We're not really set up for this type of He stops talking when he looks into Witwer's hollow eyes
Witwer is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words
-- Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water
Her skin is translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat
Rose
Try to drink
She pushes the cup away
She closes her eyes, as if even the dim light of the room causes her pain
Your wife
We have to get her here, Anderson
She opens her eyes
Anderson doesn't like the feel of this
Why
don't know
What are you seeing
Glimpses, Anderson
Please
We have to get her here
You're scaring me, Rose She covers his mouth with her hand Stop talking
It uses me up
For a long time, Rose says nothing, Her gaze is locked onto a distance beyond the room
At last, she speaks
(') In three minutes your wife will take a walk
: -  -- Lisa sits in her office
But she can't stand it, the sitting and waiting
She has to move
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 94
She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office -- Witwer walks past Lisa's  toward the open door of Lisa's office
Sir
'm sorry, she stepped out for a few minutes
(beat) Sir
Witwer stares into the empty office
There is a clock on Lisa's desk
His eyes fix on it
Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble building
She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson Boulevard toward the city
sleek black  with two Precrime officers in it follows her from a discreet distance
In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft Lisa walks down the street
She hugs herself, barely aware of her surroundings
She passes by stores, restaurants, payphones, video kiosks
oblivious
People push past her
On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone beside her begins to
If she hears it, she gives no indication
reaches for it, listens, hangs up
She walks on
Stores
Restaurants
An art gallery
As she comes abreast of another , it suddenly starts to ring
This time Lisa glances at it
But again, walks on
The  weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past the
Lawrence Graphics Museum
And another restaurant
And a
And this time, finally, when it, too, , she turns and looks hard at it
man begins to walk over to it
Lisa almost knocks him out of the way to get to it
She grabs at the receiver
Hello
Hello
' need you
Lisa's forehead sags against the side of the payphone
She basks in the sound of him
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 95
'  (') It's 1:03
Set your watch, exactly
Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens Okay
'  (') This is what you have to do
We now hear  continue in   as we follow Lisa through a
Lisa walks up the steps of the museum (
) At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter the Lawrence Museum
Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine advertising
The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese graphics
(
) At 1:13 the two Precrime officers following you take a wrong turn into a different room, losing sight of you for ten seconds
The officers start toward the entrance way to another room, then hesitate uncertainly, and go for another entrance way
Lisa hurries down the steps Lisa boards the "" MagLev train (
) An undercover transport officer will have received emergency orders to follow you
() He's wearing a red tie
He has short blond hair
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 96
The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far end of Lisa's car, watching her
At the next stop Lisa gets off
He follows, not too far behind
Lisa starts up the stairs
She looks at her watch, then makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's time frame
She starts up again
(
) As you come around the bend, cry out and turn around and slap the officer
Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised
At the same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into view, and see this happening
Lisa starts to run
When the undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the officer, and they get into a fight
Lisa escapes
- Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver to stop
She gets out

Underneath Ninth street is the main power feed for The Sprawl
It'll mess up the navigational beacon on the hovercraft

But stay on Ninth
She hails another taxi
She holds her hand over the IdentiScan before it can read her
The taxi driver looks at her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds out to him
Two hundred dollars if you don't scan me
It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened
He grabs the card, and jerks his head for her to get in
They take off

Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky
It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets, dirigibles
Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft
And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale
(
) The hovercraft will try to drop altitude, but the air traffic will slow it down
(beat) Precrime loses you
You'll have to walk two miles
Don't get scanned
Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street
She stands out in her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of black
Too vulnerable to pass up
in a gray overcoat slides out from between two buildings in front of her
He is not coy about his intent
He comes straight at her, all business
Lisa freezes in place
She looks at her watch
The man grabs her by the shoulder
When she starts to scream, he claps his hand over her mouth, hard
You bite me, bitch, 'll pull your teeth out
Her eyes look around frantically
He starts to drag her backwards into the dark
leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a light post
It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens his grip on Lisa
His legs at last collapse under him
Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground
She hugs him hard
Then pulls back from him
She gives him a look
Cut it a little close there, honeybunch
Rose got the street wrong
She's getting weak
Rose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 98
-- Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson together
Lisa needs to touch him
She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes back a loose look of his hair
Rose is mesmerized by her actions
She drinks in everything, every bit of life
Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation
They speak to each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room
Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him
Two discs
One fake
One real
don't think there were supposed to be two
Whoever planned it, wasn't counting on two
They are silent for a long time
Rose watches them work it through
An infallible system
Every disc ever generated has been true
Somebody wants you out of the way -- so they make a fake disc
Who ever doubts the discs
never doubted it
saw it
And believed it, absolutely
was certain  was going to murder Witwer
Anderson is shaking
Lisa wraps her arms around him
His voice is a stunned whisper
(') saw the fake, and believed so much in the system, that  saw myself as a murderer
(beats) And the Precogs picked up those thoughts
And generated the second disc
The real one
self-fulfilling prophesy believed it was true
And that made it true
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99
Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose
She lies curled on the bed, her face to the wall
(') Rose
If all this is based on a lie -the fake disc -- then do  really kill Witwer
(beat) We see what we see
'm sorry, Anderson
It's been predicted
Such a small voice, delivering a message of such finality '  -- Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer
Witwer's back is turned to him
We can't take chances, sir Witwer doesn't move or answer
(') It happens in less than three hours
(beat) We put you in a hovercraft and keep you airborne -- until after the event
The event
Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably 've been ordered to get you onto the craft
By force if necessary
The event is inevitable, Lieutenant
Witwer doesn't turn around
(') The Precogs are never wrong
The event will take place
'm a believer
Aren't you
don't leave this room without you, sir
The Security Panel insists
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 100
Anderson and Lisa keep working it, peeling away the layers
Rose lies silent
Nobody could slip a fake disc past Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head
He was the weak link in the perfect system
Obsessive compulsive niners can't allow changes in the routine Something threw him off
(beat) He tried to tell me
It didn't make any sense
Something about "spilled coffee
" (beat) Someone was in his office with him
And coffee spilled
We stay   Anderson and Lisa as Rose's voice cuts in
(
) We were always treated as if we weren't alive
As if we weren't there The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she continues to speak
(') Even now
You forget that 'm here
You talk between yourselves
And when you need me to see into the future, then you turn to me
Rose
What is it
(beat) We weren't just lost in the future
We were in the Chamber, too
Our eyes were open
In the present
And then Anderson gets it
He kneels beside her bed Your eyes were open
What did you see, Rose
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 101
Who would  have told
Who ever talked to us
Who cared that we could talk
Rose
Who spilled the coffee
Straight ahead
Rose stares stright ahead
Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber
Her brothers sit in their usual places on either side of her
The technicians tend to them
Rose's eyes are open
She sees everything in the room
The technicians, the machines
and across the room a large window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe computer
Rose watches through the window
As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them (
) Ed Witwer entered Page's office
Witwer carries a mug of coffee
Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee
Speaks to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee
We can't hear the words
(
) (') Page was so upset at the sight of the coffee
Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table
It tips, and spills
Page looks like his head will explode
He pulls a neatly folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the coffee stain on his spotless rug
(
) (') Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket, reached over Page and put it in one of the open cases
Witwer closes the case
He looks through the window into the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose -- and what does she matter
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 102
Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug
Witwer shrugs in apology and leaves the room
Page stares after him
Rose is weeping
She looks at Anderson and Lisa
(') didn't understand what 'd seen
And  had no one to tell
Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend what he has heard
Ed
Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband
The perfect system -brought down by a cup of coffee
My god
(long beat) He set into motion his own death
He didn't know it would go this far
(to Rose) What makes me leave this room
If stay here  won't kill him
Right
But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question for him
: ' Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch
Witwer is still in his chair, turned away from him
You see, if you think you can put me on a hovercraft and save me, then you don't believe in the infallibility of the Precog system
Lieutenant Glaser has his orders
He begins to approach
And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant Glaser in the forehead
(') And what  do not want around me, are nonbelievers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 103
Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks out of the office, locking the door behind him
-  ,  -- Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete building that houses the lab
The lights are out in all the windows except the back section of the second floor
There, the lights burn brightly
Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it
He smiles as if he knows something they don't
He looks at his watch
It is a cool night, but his face is slick with sweat
He walks to the entrance of the building
An  1s startled to see him
Things quiet
Sir
Should you
be here
There's been a development
body's been found in the Sprawl
Anderson's
They're checking it out
need to see what the Precogs have seen
Witwer is IdentiScanned
The door opens and he goes in
Dr
Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying a tv under his arm
Witwer is the last person he wants to see
Borrowed this from the technicians' lounge
You don't think they'll mind, do you
You shouldn't be here, Director
Dr
Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall, the red numbers ticking off time in seconds
Witwer looks for a plug, finds one
Plugs in the tv
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 104
No, no
This is exactly where should be
You're under a lot of strain, Director
Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of his murder by Anderson
"Call Now
Call Now
" And tv's so good for that -- soothes the mind
Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a bright smile
The scientist looks like he wants to run out of the room
Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the Precogs
Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting 's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets
The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial
But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too weak for that
(') Bring me up to speed, Doc
We're getting nothing from them
And that's because
Witwer still grips him by the elbow
don't know
Do you think they know where Anderson is
It's impossible to tell
(beat) We've done everything
Maybe even too much
They know how to find Anderson for me
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 105
(') (beat) They're the perfect machine, Doctor
You just have to know which button to push
- Rose looks like she's on fire
Anderson wets another towel, wrings it over the sink
Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's face and arms
Rose's lips are moving soundlessly
Her eyes are shut tight
She begins to writhe in bed
Jesus Christ
Come on, Rose
One hour
We hold it together for an hour, Witwer lives -- and 'm not a murderer
She won't last an hour
It suddenly looks much worse than that
Rose's body contorts horribly and she arches up off the bed
Lisa can't control her
Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to hold and comfort her
Rose
She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms
He's killed him, Anderson
Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes slack
Anderson eases her back on the bed
He stares at her, stricken
Her voice barely leaves her now (') You didn't save my brother
Anderson reels at her words
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 106
Did he kill both of them, Rose
Rose
Rose manages to speak, one last time
Her whispered words damn him
Does it matter, Anderson
Anderson rises
Looks down at Rose
It matters
He starts to move, quickly
Lisa takes hold of his arm
If you leave this room
Anderson kisses her
Then 'm a cop, just trying to do hisjob
He reaches for his duffel bag
When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly and looks
And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a place deep within her own mind
-   - He passes by several cars on the street
But they're all auto-drive, they won't do him any good
So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a city police transport zooms up, lights flashing
Two city officers leap out of the transport
They approach the smashed-in store window, weapons drawn
Which is a mistake
Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on
As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with BindFoam
Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof
Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness
The   races through time
Witwer reaches his hand up and touches the vanishing numbers
The camera pulls back, and we see Dr
Resfield and the two technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 107
And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers
small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of his skull
The other Precog sits very still in his chair
He is still connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs drip into him
His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves, the Precog's eyes follow him
Witwer can feel them on him
He turns around
Is he coming
No
Yes
Maybe
(beat) think yes
The Precog looks at him
(') And you think yes
Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of Witwer
Witwer smiles triumphantly
(') Infallibly, immutably yes
The Precog looks at him
Witwer's smile vanishes, and suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over the Precog's eyes
Then he turns, and stares again at the clock
Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons cradled in their arms
Behind them is a line of yew bushes
we watch, the officer on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes
Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the officer on the right
The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right
Then he looks hard
He grips his weapon tight, and swings left
No one there, either
drops him hard, from behind
The officer crumples onto the cement
But Anderson's not done with him
Anderson lifts him up, struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance
Anderson holds him upright in place
The man's head lolls backward
Which is
Perfect for what Anderson needs to do
Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes
He pulls up on the eyelids
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 108
An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's eyes
Access granted, the doors  open
Anderson enters the building, dragging the officer with him
Anderson enters the lab
The very building sickens him
What he sees sickens him even more
The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair
Witwer sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother at his feet
Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet
His hand is in his lap, holding a gun
He grins when Anderson appears
He takes off the helmet, drops it on the floor
figured, since  can see the future, too, maybe  could get a little disc action going
(beat) Just kidding
Anderson stares at his old partner
Then he looks up at the digital clock
Five-seventeen
Witwer looks too, then turns back to Anderson
(') You find you been doing that a lot this week
Looking at clocks
(beat) Three minutes to go
Anderson turns to the tv
There's never anything good on, you know
Now Witwer smiles
There
That's the old Paul
You're not the old Ed
You've lost it
Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand
You lost it
You went weak in the knees, partner
'm not your partner
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 109
Witwer looks at him sadly
The air went out of you when Frank 'Ignazio killed himself
He was guilty
accepted that
No you didn't
The doubts were creeping in on you
The lab trying to engineer more Precogs
Malcolm pressuring you to expand
Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog brother's cheek
(') Belief is the basis of the system
It was your job to be the ultimate believer
Witwer is breathing hard
He lifts a hand and wipes the sweat from his face
(') And when Frank died, you faltered
'm a cop,  see into the hearts of men
(beat) And the thing about you is, you wouldn't have just walked away
Never been my style
Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile Precrime needs to grow
You would have stood in its way
The Security Panel wouldn't have understood that
What you're capable of
What a bulldog you are
(beat) Look what you've been doing to us all week
Amazing
You're the best
So you took matters into your own hands
understood the threat
understood Anderson looks at the dead Precog ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 110
You killed a Precog
You ended the system you wanted to protect
Wrong
This lab will make more
Believe it, Paul
They look at the
Five-nineteen
Knowing the exact moment of your death -it's made you crazy, Ed
Witwer looks at the tv
The   is almost in synch with what is happening in the room
Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is terribly wrong
Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the disc -- except there is a major difference
You sonofabitch
Anderson lifts up both hands (') You didn't bring your gun
That's right
No gun
You see
That's exactly what 'm talking about
You don't Believe
Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him
(') The system is infallible Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and pulls a second gun from out of his belt
(') guess that's why 've always carried two
He tosses the gun to Anderson
It clatters at Anderson's feet
You can't have it both ways
You don't want to die
That's why you lured me here -- to kill me first
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 111
(') (beat) But it you don't diet the system is flawed, and you couldn't live with that
Witwer  him once, in the right thigh
Anderson cries out, falls to the concrete floor
Pick it up Anderson speaks through his teeth  It doesn't happen
Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock
He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back feeding into the Precog's main line
thick, yellow fluid begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein
(') You're killing him, partner
And what choice, finally, does Anderson have
He reaches for the gun
Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains his gun on Anderson
Anderson trains his gun on Witwer
(') Oh, Ed
Witwer lowers his gun
And stands there between Anderson and the doomed Precog
The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular
Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart
Witwer is thrown back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock
Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow out of the main line
The yellow drips onto the floor, mingling with Witwer's red
Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him
Witwer whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him
Now do you believe
Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last breaths alone
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 112
And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale, beautifully proportioned
It is Rose's face
The camera pulls back and we see that she is lying on a grassy hillside
Her brother is lying beside her
They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with stars
Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to her brother
James
Can you guess what 'm thinking
(beat) James smiles
And then, after a long moment, so does Rose
