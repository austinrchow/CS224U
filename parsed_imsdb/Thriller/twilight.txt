Fast

And we're speeding up, chasing something
It's exhilarating
Terrifying
Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey - -- running for its life as it darts through this maze of a forest
It sprints forward, but we gain on it
Beyond the deer, the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the trees
The buck races for the light
We're just behind it, about to emerge from the shadowy darkness - The deer  into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly ) against the   of the sun

He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene's head with kiss
Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella
Phil heads to the old station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm through Bella's, clinging to her as they walk to car
Now, you know if you change your mind, 'll race back here from wherever the game is
But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great sacrifice that would be
Bella forces a smile
won't change my mind, mom
You might
You've always hated Forks
It's not about Forks, it's about Dad

Taciturn, introverted like Bella
Their strained silence contrasts Bella's relationship with her mother

,  - As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this logging town every storefront has a wood carving
The Timber Museum's sign is two loggers sawing a stump
The   is a small wooden building across from City Hall

'  - The cruiser pulls up to the old two-story house
woodshed full of firewood
There's a small boat in the garage, fishing gear, an old buoy
Bella climbs out
home

'  - Bella and Charlie carry in her bags
The house isn't stylish (the only new thing here is a Flat Screen
), but it's comfortable, lived-in
Lots of fishing memorabilia; photos of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian
Handmade cards to Daddy and photos of Bella
She winces at herself, age 7, in a tutu, sitting stubbornly on the ground
put Grandpa's old desk in your room
And  cleared some shelves in the bathroom
(grimacing) That's right
One bathroom
Bella's eye lands on a  of a much younger Charlie and Rene, on vacation, beaming with love
'll just put these up in your room can do it They both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly
Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs
10
'  -  10 An antique rolltop desk sits in a corner
The room is filled with childhood remnants that have seen better days
As she unpacks her case, loneliness finally overwhelms her
She sits heavily on the edge of the bed, tears threatening
Then we hear a  outside
Bella runs across the hall and looks out the window to see 11  -    ,  1960 pulls up

'  - Bella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver,  , 16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of childish roundness in his face
The two of them help Jacob's father,   (from the photos), into a wheelchair
Bella, you remember Billy Black
Glad you're finally here
Charlie hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming
Keep exaggerating, 'll wheel you down the hill
Right after  ram you in the ankles
Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges
Jacob shakes his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella
'm Jacob
We made mud pies together when we were little kids
Yeah
think  remember
(re: the dads) Are they always like this
It's getting worse with old age
Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella So what do you think of your homecoming gift
No way
The truck is for me
Just bought it off Billy, here
rebuilt the engine and - It's perfect

She beams
It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her
She rushes to the truck
Jacob eagerly joins her
Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but - He hands her the keys as she climbs in
Maybe  can give you a ride to school
go to school on the reservation
Too bad
Would've been nice to know at least one person
As she starts up the truck we 12
- '  -  12 Loud, belching and turning heads as Bella parks, mortified
All eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in , soaking her sneakers
She slinks toward school, as we begin 13
-     -  13 -- Bella (never without her ) makes her way thru kids who stare openly; a few brave ones say hi
They're all talking about her
This is her hell
-- Bella wanders the walkways looking for room numbers, lost
-- Constant stares at Bella, the outsider
when a sweet, nerd-cute, motor mouth boy, , appears in her path
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl
Hi
'm Eric
The eyes and ears of this place
Anything you need
Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on
Bella just looks at him
Is he for real
'm kind of the suffer in silence type
Good headline for your feature 'm on the paper, and you're news, baby, front page
8
-- no, 'm not news -- 'm, seriously, not at all Whoa, chillax
No feature
(relieved) Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr
Varner's class
He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes from them You've missed a lot of the semester, but  can hook you up - tutor, cliff notes, medical excuse
-  14 The boys' basketball team runs drills on half the basketball court
girls' volleyball game occupies the other half
Bella, in gym clothes, avoids the volleyball like it's radioactive
An energetic, athletic team captain, , motivates the players
Block it, Chloe
Yeah
Good attack
Unfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella
She closes her eyes and flails at it,  it
It flies off court -- and beans a basketball player in the head
He is , good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair
Ow
(hurries to him, embarrassed) Are you alright
warned them not to make me play
It's only a flesh wound
Mike grins and she smiles, relieved
, class over
You're Isabella, right

Just Bella
'm Mike
Newton
He looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her - Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them
Subtle, but possessive as she nudges Mike
She's got a great spike, doesn't she
(to Bella) So, you're from Arizona, right
Aren't people supposed to be tan down there
That's why they kicked me out
Mike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does
Bella just feels uncomfortable with the attention
15
-  15 Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to table
Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella
Mike, you met my home girl Bella
Your home girl
(to Bella) It's first grade all over again, and you're the shiny new toy
Bella smiles awkwardly
Suddenly, a  blinds Bella
She looks up at the photographer, , Jessica's sweet, low key, insecure friend
Sorry, needed a candid for the feature Feature's dead, Angela
Don't bring it up again
(to Bella) got your back, baby
10
(disappointed) Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking
Sorry
There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team -- Wait, that's a good one
But Bella's attention is now riveted to '  - They swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella's ever seen enter (  ):
Two guys, two girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes
and all devastatingly beautiful
They move through the room with effortless grace, and take a seat at a table furthest from Bella's
Bella leans over to Jessica and Angela
Who are they
The Cullens
Jessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode
Doctor and Mrs
Cullen's foster kids
They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago
They kinda keep to themselves
Because they're all together
Like, together together
The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett
, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it
Alongside her is , 17, big, brawny, like a weight lifter, but a playful glint in his eye
they're a thing
'm not even sure that's legal
11
Jess, they're not actually related
But they live together
And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird
, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, black hair going in every direction
She hovers over, , 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured
she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain
mean, Dr
Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker
Maybe he'll adopt me
Bella laughs, liking her
then sees the last Cullen to enter , 17
Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair
He seems inwardly turned, mysterious
More boyish than the others
But the most striking of all
Bella can't take her eyes off him
Who's he
That's Edward Cullen
Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from across the room
His eyes meet Bella's
But he seems
confused
Bella quickly looks away
He's totally gorgeous, obviously
But apparently, no one here is good enough for him
Like  care
(she obviously does) Anyway, don't waste your time
wasn't planning on it
But Bella can't help but peek at Edward again
He's staring at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves Bella
She hides behind her hair
16
-  16 room of black-topped lab tables
Two to a table
Bella and Mike enter
12
Mike takes his seat and points her toward
, Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class
As Bella moves to the teacher with her class slip, she notes -- his back to her, sitting at a front table
But as she passes Edward's table
-- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts piece of paper next to Edward
We're still on his back as he inhales --then abruptly stiffens
He grabs onto the edge of the table, crumbling it slightly
No one notices
Mr
Molina takes Bella's class slip
Welcome, Ms
Swan
Follow along as best you can till you get caught up
Mr
Molina gestures to the only empty seat
next to Edward
But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when '  -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury
If looks could literally kill
Bella knocks someone's book bag off their chair
Replaces it, mumbling an apology
Then slinks reluctantly into her seat
Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair
(to the class, animated) Today we'll be observing the behavior of planaria, a
k
a flatworms
As Mr
Molina distributes two petri dishes per table We're going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms
Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over his nose as if he smells something horrible
Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing
Then she sniffs her hair
It's fine
She's perplexed
Mr
Molina hands Edward two petri dishes
Yes, folks, zombie worms
They just won't die
Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the table to Bella as if she had Ebola
She takes her dish, and makes a dark curtain of her hair between them
13
She can see '  under the table
Clenched into fists
Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure
17
-  -  17 -- as the  , Edward bolts out the door
Other kids and Bella exit a moment later
Bella looks down the hall; he's gone
18
-  18 Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees sweet-talking the enchanted female , 40's
He doesn't see Bella enter
There must be something open sixth period
Physics
Biochem
No, every class is full
'm afraid you'll have to stay in biology
'm so sorry
Bella blanches
The Administrator sees her and gestures for her to wait a minute
But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella
He slowly turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes
She backs to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled
with fear
(to the Administrator) 'll just
endure it
He strides out the door
Off Bella
19
-  19 Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck
The many eyes still watching her add insult to injury
Finally, she reaches 20
'  () 20 -- and closes the door
Her eyes well
but she fights it, getting mad
Jerk
As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to hear a ' , : 14
21      -    21 Extremely tight on his terrified , sweat dripping, breathing in short gasps, trying desperately not to make a sound 22
-   22 --He's crouched in a dark corner
But then he sees a move blindingly fast past him
He jerks around, then another flies past, too fast to follow
He
He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of the mill striating him
He moves as fast as humanly possible - charges after him at an   through this maze of pillars and walkways
We dodge skull-crushing beams, from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to -- who desperately runs for his life, looking over his shoulder with terror
is closing in on him, but then he out a door 23
() -   23 -- The guard   onto a stair landing, but loses his footing and , breaking through the rail and pitching over the side, into the air -- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing
grips his shirt, then  him out of the air and out of frame with incredible strength
His guttural  is choked short as
24
-   24 as it is set in front of Charlie
He shares a table with Bella
the waitress, , 30's
She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her
Several  at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles
She shrinks in her seat at the attention
Charlie's oblivious
Can't get over how grown up you are
And so gorgeous
Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak
bearded, hippy logger,  , 50, appears behind Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella 15
Member me, honey
was Santa one year
Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four
Bet  made an impression, though
You always do
Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon
(to Bella) When you're done, 'll bring your favorite - berry cobbler
Remember
Your dad still has it
Every Thursday
(doesn't remember at all) That'd be great, thank you
Cora shoos Waylon away
Left alone now, Charlie and Bella both reach for the salt, knock hands
Charlie goes for the ketchup instead
Silence as they eat
burst of  from a nearby happy  only serves to emphasize their discomfort
Bella tries to bridge the gap
So
you eat here every night
Easier than washing dishes
can cook
He looks up, as if confused by the concept
do the cooking at home - in Phoenix
Mom's not great in the kitchen
remember
They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner
How was school
Meet anyone
16
few people
Do you know the Cullen family
(looks up sharply) Are people talking about them again
No
well, a little
Just cause they're newcomers
We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr
Cullen at our podunk hospital
Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town
Lucky his kids aren't like lot of the hell-raisers around here
Okay
just don't like narrow mindedness
And he returns to his food
Silence

But her eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull in
She's waiting for Edward
Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball nearby
They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, declining
and returns to watching for Edward
Her face tells us she's ready for a confrontation
28
-   28 Bella strides in
but stops, surprised to find her lab table empty
Off Bella, frustrated
: 29
-   29 Bella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video on their phone
Bella gives it a cursory look, but is focused on the Cullen table --only four of them
Edward's seat is empty
30
-   30 Bella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled to find Rosalie and Alice behind her
They study Bella, Rosalie with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity
Bella, uneasy, hurries out
31
-   31 Bella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part of this circle
18
She now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 , as it drives past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward
Bella returns to her friends, finally forgetting about him
as we go to 32
'  -   -  32 It's neater, rearranged more attractively
Clearly, Bella's given it her touch
She sweeps through, folding Charlie's fleece jacket, straightening up
She grabs her book bag Dad, 'm heading out
33
'  () -  33 '  as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her
It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen
Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight
Great
to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck
Dad,  can drive myself to school
As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's watching her - - --tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on patch of ice - - fallen on her ass
Charlie climbs out of the truck, helps her up
You okay, Bells
Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated
That's why  got you new tires
She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires
The other ones were nearly bald
19
You got me new tires
No one's ever done that before
Charlie looks at her, confused
mean
nothing
He clearly doesn't get it as heads toward his Cruiser
'll be late for dinner
'm heading down to Mason County
security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal

An animal
You're not in Phoenix any more, honey
They've been hunting it for a week with no luck
Thought 'd lend a hand
Be careful
Always am
And thank you
For the tires
He sees emotion in her eyes
Doesn't understand it, but nods, heads inside
Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved

/ -  35 Rain beats on the roof as Eric walks Bella into class
She brushes water off her coat as he chats her up
and yeah, prom committee is chick thing, but  gotta cover it for the paper anyway, and they need a guy to help choose the music - So  need your play list 20
Bella is about to respond when Mike comes up behind her
Come on, Arizona
Give it up for the rain
And he shakes his wet baseball cap onto Bella's head
Terrific
She heads toward her seat, brushing off her hair
But she freezes when she sees --Edward
Bella straightens, girding herself
Then strides to the table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to address him
But he looks up at her Hello
Bella stops
Stunned
He is direct, precise, as if every word is an effort for him
didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week
My name is Edward Cullen
She's too shocked that he's talking to her to answer
(prompting) You're Bella
'm
yes
Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits
He abruptly moves to the extreme edge of his seat
She's even more baffled now
(to the class) Onion root tip cells
That's what's on your slides
Separate and label them into the phases of mitosis
The first partners to get it right, win
the golden onion
He excitedly holds up a spray painted onion
Everyone just looks at him
He's disappointed by their apathy
Come on, people
Tick tock
21
Everyone sets to work
Edward pushes the microscope to Bella, keeping his distance, his voice controlled
Ladies first
She grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide in, adjusting the lens
She's curt as she addresses him
You've been gone
Out of town
For personal reasons
She glances at him but he just leans far away, his face tight
She looks back into the microscope
Prophase
She begins to remove the slide
May  look
She slides him the microscope
He glances through the lens
Prophase
(muttering) Like  said
He writes it on the worksheet
Then he takes a breath, as if trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort
Enjoying the rain
Seriously
You're asking me about the weather
It appears
No
don't like the cold
Or the wet
Or the gray
Or parkas
Or turtle necks
Is that a smile playing on his lips
For the first time, he seems more intrigued than agonized
He studies her
She still can't tell if he despises her or not
It's infuriating
22
What
He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out the slides
She looks at him
And keeps looking
'  -   ' His cheekbones, his lips
So perfect, like a sculpture
Anaphase
She snaps out of it
Covers with a dry look
May
(she looks through the lens) Anaphase
Like  said
She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk
She simply holds out her hand for another slide
(handing her the slide) If you hate cold and rain, why move to the wettest place in the continental
It's complicated
think  can keep up
He actually seems interested
She looks into the microscope as My mother remarried
Very complex
So you don't like him
Phil is fine
Young for her, but nice enough
(re: the slide) Interphase

36
-  -   36 Bella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs into Edward, who's directly in front of her
Why didn't you stay with your mom and stepdad
He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher her
She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled
Alright, Phil's a minor league baseball player, so he travels lot
My mother stayed home with me but it made her unhappy
So decided to spend time with my father
But now you're unhappy
No
--  just
Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable
'm just trying to figure you out
You're very hard to read
He's clearly trying to read her now
their eyes meet again
But now she looks more closely at him
Did you get contacts
no
Your eyes were black before, now they're this golden brown or It's just the fluorescents
He abruptly turns and walks away
As he does, Bella notes - clenched into tight fists
Off Bella, utterly bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated
37
-   -  37 The rain has stopped, but the parking lot is full of water and patches of black ice
24
Shivering, Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion, carefully navigating the icy puddles
As she reaches her truck, she looks across the lot stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to climb in
moment as their eyes meet
then he looks toward the sound of a high pitched , that quickly grows
Bella turns to see a  -- skidding on the ice, careening out of control, heading directly for her
suddenly fractures, compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as --      - in shock, seeing what's coming
--  '  -, desperately trying to gain control, then shielding his face
-- '  - looking at Bella with horror
is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning her to the ground
She looks up - Edward is on top of her
The world around them  -- in this fraction of second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying
He breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face
Abruptly, we     as several things happen so quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on: --    into the back of Bella's truck -- Then  around, once again careening toward her and Edward, then suddenly --'  are creating a deep dent in the side of the van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella
-- Edward literally pushes the van away
Then silence
long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at Edward, trying to absorb what just happened
Edward's fear for her is still alive on his face
She starts to speak but
begins, yelling, calls for help
People leap to Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward
Bella  the onion on the ground, smashed as she would have been
As everyone sweeps in, Edward moves into the b

Mike and Eric run to Bella Are you okay
Are you What happened
Did anyone hurt
see what happened
Amid the chaos, Bella sees '  looking at Edward
But they show no hint of concern for his safety
Instead, they look at him with disapproval
and fury

-   -  38 The double doors  open as Charlie runs in, face white with terror
He spots 25

looking into her eyes with a pen light
On the next gurney over, Tyler, the van's driver, lies with a mild head wound
Charlie rushes up
Bells
Are you alright
'm fine, dad
Calm down
'm so sorry, Bella
tried to stop
It's okay, Tyler
It sure as hell is not okay
Dad, it's not his fault- (stern, cutting her off) We nearly lost you
But you didn't
He'd hug her, if that was who he, or who she was
Instead, he glares at Tyler
You can kiss your license goodbye

You have a nice knot growing back there, but your x-rays show no indication of concussion
'm so sorry, Bella
'm really Charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them
It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way
Edward
Your boy
Dr
Cullen quickly looks back at the chart
Bella's intuition flickers, sensing he knows something
She presses
It was amazing he got to me so fast
He was nowhere near me
(smiles) As long as you're safe
-  -  39 Charlie and Bella exit the treatment area
just have to sign some paperwork
You better call your mom
You told her
She's probably freaking
He shrugs and hurries off
Bella shakes her head, pulls out her cell phone
Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall
'  - , , Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground
Dr
Cullen plays intermediary
This isn't just about you, it's about all of us - Dr
Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie Let's take this in my office
27
Rosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr
Cullen
Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined
Can  talk to you for a moment
(off his nod) How did you get over to me so quickly
was standing right next to you
You were next to your car, across the lot
He steps closer to her
His expression turns icy hard
No,  wasn't
She won't be bullied
Steps closer to him
Yes
You were
You're confused
You hit your head
know what  saw
And what, exactly, was that
You stopped that van
You pushed it away
No one will believe that
wasn't planning to tell anyone
This registers with Edward
They're inches from each other, the tension thick
just want to know the truth
Can't you just thank me and get over it
Thank you
28
long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive
and without a doubt, attracted
You're not going to let it go, are you
No
(turns, walks away) Then  hope you enjoy disappointment
Why did you even bother
He stops, a beat
Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable
don't know
And he keeps walking
Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth
(
That was the first night  dreamed of Edward Cullen
40   -  40 Bella swims, white skin aglow, hair floating weightlessly, sensually
suddenly, something  past her
She spins
It's gone
Something  behind her
She spins again - to find herself face to face with Bella reaches for him, but he abruptly springs backward, just out of reach
: 41
'  -   -  41 -as she bolts up awake
In that split second, in the darkness, she  Edward, watching her
She  on the light -- the room is empty
Was she dreaming
42
-   -  42 Bella stands in the exact spot of the accident
Behind her on the lawn, several  congregate, gathering for field trip
Mr
Molina is in charge
Make sure  get your permission slips
29
'  staring at the skid marks on the pavement
' ,  , , blushing at the memory
Then she  Edward arrive with Alice and Jasper
She watches him, barely noticing as Mike trots up to her - (ala Dr
Frankenstein) Look
You're moving
You're
Yeah, false alarm
Actually, 'm glad you're not dead cause - well, that would suck, plus wanted to ask you - even though it's, like, a month away
But Bella's distracted by Edward
Mike's   as
'  - Edward, head down, is in quiet conference with Jasper and Alice
Abruptly, he looks up, as if listening to her and Mike, though he's too far away to hear
Bella quickly refocuses on Mike
So what do you think
(off her blank look) You want to go
To prom
With me
(realizing, horrified) Prom
As in dance
, uh - have to go -somewhere
To Jacksonville
Yeah
You can't go another weekend
Non-refundable ticket
Maybe you should ask Jessica
Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lawn to Jessica
She smiles at them -- Suddenly Edward crosses in front of Jessica
He seems to be smirking
30
43
-   -  43 Mr
Molina and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through the greenhouse
Bella keeps an eye on Edward who's up ahead with Alice and Jasper
Mr
Molina demonstrates the compost machine as the students mess around
c'mon, Eric, stuff that compost down deep
that's it
(the machine gurgles and spins) now Tyler, take a big steaming cup of compost tea
This is recycling at its most basic level - hey, don't drink that
When Bella sees Edward pause by an ancient staghorn fern, alone, she takes a breath for courage and strides up to him
Hello, Edward
He glances at her, merely nodding
We notice his  clench, and unclench
Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness
Really
No response
She turns, starts to walk away
What's in Jacksonville
She turns back to him
How did you know about that
You didn't answer my question
You haven't answered any of mine
You won't even say hello
Hello
And how did you stop that van
Adrenaline rush
Very common
Google it
31
(not buying it) Floridians
That's what's in Jacksonville
She turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation hose
Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so powerful
He clenches his jaw
It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet
Insulted, she keeps moving
He keeps pace, serious now
know 've been rude, but it's for the best
She just looks at him like he's crazy
He walks away as Jessica suddenly rushes up
Guess who just asked me to prom
Bella smiles
totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella
Is it gonna be weird
No way
Zero weirdness
You guys are great together
know, right
Giddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela
Bella heads out the door that leads to -   ()44 --where everyone's looking at the   , grossing each other out with the slimy creatures
As Bella backs away, Edward steps up
Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends
(wounded) Too bad you didn't figure that out earlier
() 32
(cont'd) You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret
(snapping, angry) You think  regret saving you
know you do
(furious) You don't know anything
His harshness stings her
Suddenly, Alice appears at Edward's side
She eyes Bella with curiosity
The bus is leaving
(to Bella) Hi
Will you be riding with us
No
Our bus is full
He purposefully walks Alice away
But he glances back at Bella with, is that
remorse
She doesn't see it
'  -  -  45 Bella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry
She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen
Your mother called
Again
Your fault, for telling her about the accident
She always did know how to worry
(hint of sadness) But
she's changed, too
She seems happy
Phil sounds all right
He is
She continues upstairs, glancing at her parents'
Off Bella's , we   - 33
46
-  -  '  -  46 -- as she pushes through the doors
She glances over at the , Edward with his siblings
He doesn't look at her
Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, Jessica, Mike and Angela
She drops her book bag on a seat La Push, baby
You in
Should  know what that means
La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez
We're all going after school
Big swell coming in
And  don't just surf the internet
Eric, you stood up once
On a foam board
There's whale watching, too
Come with
La Push, baby
'll go if you stop saying that
47     -   47 Bella artfully designs an architectural salad
As she reaches for an , Edward is suddenly next to her (charmed) Edible art
Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin
He presents it to her with small smile
Thanks
but your mood swings are giving me whiplash
said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that  didn't want to be
34
What does that even mean
It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me
Edward inadvertently glances at his four inhumanly beautiful siblings, who wait for him, expectantly, at their table
She notes her own, very human friends monitoring this conversation from their table
Mike glowers jealously
So let's say, for argument's sake, that 'm not smart
Would you talk to me
Tell me the truth
Probably not
'd rather hear your theories
Okay
how bout radioactive spiders
Kryptonite
(levels his gaze, challenging) You're talking about superheroes
What if 'm not a hero
What if 'm a bad guy
(beat, looking closer at him) No
don't believe that
You're not bad
You can be a jerk, but it's like this
mask
To keep people away
He's taken aback by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her
Look, why don't we just - hang out
Like
come to the beach with us
It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes
(small smile, considering it) Which beach
La Push
35
His smile lessens almost imperceptibly
Is something wrong with that beach
Edward glances over at Mike - the two exchange cold looks
It's just a little crowded
Off Bella, as Edward walks away
48
-  48 It's freezing, but Mike, Tyler, Jessica and others suit up for a surf
Eric hangs with them
Bella wanders by the driftwood with Angela, who takes photographs
keep thinking Eric's going to ask me to prom, then he just
doesn't
You could ask him
(off Angela's flustered look) Take control
You're a strong independent woman

(
Bella
She looks up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; Jacob Black, and  and
Bella smiles at Jacob
Guys, this is Jacob
Are you stalking me
You're on my rez, remember
You surfing
Definitely not
(teasing) Keep her company
Her date bailed
What date
36
She invited Edward
(embarrassed) To be polite
think it's nice she invited him
No one ever does
Because Cullen's a freak
You got that right
You know them
(sharply) The Cullens don't come here
Jacob shoots Sam a look, shakes his head
Bella registers this
beat, then she casually pulls Jacob aside You want to go look at tide pools
She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile
He grins, infatuated
As they head toward the water
-   49 Bella and Jacob wander near the water, looking out to sea for whales
The surfers are out on the waves
She nudges him, continuing her attempt at flirtation
So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here
Oops
Caught that, huh
He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy
'm not supposed to say anything
Bella gives him her best alluring smile
can keep a secret
37
(laughing) It's just an old scary story
Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves
Like fur, fangs
doggy breath
Jacob chuckles
Bella smiles and prompts him to continue
So the legend about the Cullens is
Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like
(in a spooky voice) enemy clan
But they claimed to be different, so we made a treaty with them
Didn't they just move here
Or just moved back
Riiiight
So what was this treaty
(whispering) If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they really were to the pale-faces
Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers
(
) Bella  at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean
Jacob smirks and starts back to the group
Wait
what were they really
(laughing) It's just a story, Bella
Off Bella, with more unanswered questions

-   50 collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by wood plank sidewalks
Waylon Forge (the hippy logger who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman
His old  lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and river chirp and buzz
Waylon sings along to his Walkman
Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly  themselves
The dog raises his head, starts to

until he looks up and realizes the dog's gone

Waylon pulls off the headphones
No dog
Waylon walks up a walkway
then sees a  , sticking out from under a bush
Come on, Jerry, you old mutt
He pulls at the leg
It's detached
He reels back, stumbling onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely
'  -   lining the river
Ominous darkness
He jerks around
Nothing
Then suddenly, his boat  violently; he spins - now stands on the bow
, 30, pale white
vampire
But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, sinister , and absolutely lethal
His catlike movements are always on the edge of a crouch
-how did you do that
Always the same inane questions
Waylon turns but a woman  onto the bow --it's , 26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods
Terrified, Waylon spins around to see , 28, glossy black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat
All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot
What do you want
39
Why are you doing this
(sighs, slight French accent) James, must we
The question should be, will it hurt
Victoria grins sadistically

She shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula
An  pops up, Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles
Bella, intrigued, clicks on it
53
-   53 The sun has come out and so has the skin
Kids are in shorts though it's still barely sixty degrees
Everyone eats lunch outdoors
Bella searches the crowd for Edward
(
He's not here
She looks down to find Jessica sitting on the grass
Whenever the weather's nice, the Cullens disappear
They just
ditch
No, Dr
and Mrs
Cullen yank em out for hiking and camping and stuff
tried the idea out on my parents
Not even close
Bella registers this as Angela suddenly jumps on them
40
'm going to the prom with Eric
just asked him,  took control
(hugs Bella) Are you sure you have to go out of town
It's a family thing
Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the dresses get cleaned out
Port Angeles
(a plan forming in her mind) Can  go with you guys
Thank God
We need your opinion
Off Bella, that's not really what she had in mind
54
,   - ' -  54 -- antsy, distracted, as Jessica and Angela try on dresses
Bella pulls a Mapquest print-out from her purse -- it reads, Thunderbird and Whale Book Store
Jessica flounces out of the changing room, posing provocatively
think this halter makes my boobs look big
What do you think, Bella
Outside the window, a group of rowdy   head toward bar
Two of them stare at Jessica in her low-cut dress
Embarrassed, she turns back to Bella
Bella
(absently) It looks great
You said that about the last five dresses
(empathetic) You're not very good at this, are you
41
Maybe  should just go check out the book store and meet you at the restaurant later
You sure
Bella nods, heads out
Jessica's looks in the mirror again
She was right about this halter, though
It does look great

/ -  57 Bella exits, thumbing through a  she just bought
She heads down the sidewalk, but then hears  behind her
She turns, doesn't see anyone
She puts the book in her shoulder bag and continues
-   -someone's following her
She looks around, changing course to cut across a parking lot
Unknown gets closer
and closer, until she reaches 58
-  58 Isolated
Bella, breath short, scared, turns around just as - emerge from the shadows, not vampires, but the Frat Boys, really wasted now
# Wanna beer
She looks to her left; the other   are there
She's cornered
She takes her purse from around her shoulder
Look, just take my bag
# We don't want your bag
She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her wrist to use her purse as a mace
They chortle derisively
But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in the groin
The  in her bag doubles him over
The other three laugh, and start to close in
But suddenly blind them
silver Volvo screeches up
The Frat Boys dive out of the way
The passenger-side door opens
It's Edward
She's too stunned to even move
42
Get in
She finally does
But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and rushes Edward's side of the car Edward  to a halt and is out of the car and facing Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it
Nor does Bella see Edward's , so chilling, so animalistic in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off
As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him
59
'  -  -  59 Bella continues to stare
She sees that he's seething with anger, hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched
What -- no, how did you find -- (through gritted teeth) should go back and rip their heads off
No
Bad idea
You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking
And you do
(covering) Not hard to guess
60
-   -  60 Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches
Where were you
We left you a message
We waited, but we were starving Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car
They freeze, agog
He's composed now, making an effort to be charming
And they are charmed
Sorry  kept Bella from dinner
We ran into each other and got talking
43
- we - understand
We were just
leaving, so The two girls start to go
Bella is forced to go with them
Okay, well
Thank you
She starts to follow the girls
Edward is torn, then abruptly (abruptly) Maybe  should make sure Bella gets something to eat
(off Bella's surprised look) If you'd like
Then  could drive you back myself
That's so
thoughtful
Really thoughtful
(debates, then decides) could eat
As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and noiseless scream of excitement
-   -  61 Bella and Edward sit on the deck
dramatic waterfall shimmers behind them
waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward
She exits
You're not eating
'm on a special diet
Like South Beach
Not exactly
She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite
44
So how bout some answers
Yes, no
To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851
didn't ask for the square root of pi
You knew that
How did you know where  was
didn't
She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside - (stops her, sincerely) Don't go
He seems torn by some internal dilemma
Then finally
Were you following me
feel very protective of you
So that's a yes
Yes,  followed you
tried to keep my distance
until you needed help
(putting everything together) You said before
That you heard what those guys were thinking
Can you
read minds
(shrugs) 'm thinking of getting a nine- hundred number
(trying to grasp) Alright, so you read minds
What am thinking
Wait -- okay now, go
45
have no idea
can read every mind in there, except yours
(points at people inside) Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend (points at Bella) Nothing
It's quite frustrating
Why, what's wrong with me
tell you  read minds and you think there's something wrong with you
He smiles, charmed by her
But his smile fades, that torn look returns
He holds onto the rail, looking out
What is it
don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore
She's surprised
And thrilled
Edward, you don't have to
He's drawn in by her encouraging gaze
but he closes his eyes a beat, and turns back to the water
(almost to himself) This is wrong
Edward You're cold
We should go
He walks away before she can ask any more questions
62
-  62 Edward's Volvo speeds along the two lane highway
63
'  -  63 Bella glances at Edward, might ask him more questions but he seems to be wrestling with his own thoughts
Finally
46
think 'm warm enough now
She reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their hands
And hold a moment too long
An electric current connecting them
Your hand, it's still freezing cold
He pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it
then her attention shifts outside to
As they drive past the   , a sheriff's car pulls away
Charlie's cruiser is parked out front
(concerned) Dad's here late
Something must have happened
/
-   () -  64 The Volvo pulls up
Bella and Edward climb out
Edward then sees a second car next to the cruiser
That's my father's car
What's he -- ' : In a pool of light, a distressed Charlie and Dr
Cullen study photographs and evidence
As they wrap up their discussion, Dr
Cullen puts a sympathetic hand on Charlie's shoulder, then exits the police station looking grim
Carlisle
What happened
Waylon Forge was found in the woods out near his place
just examined the body
Edward darkens
Bella is horrified
He died
How
Animal attack
The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason
Edward and Dr
Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it
47
Most likely
So it's getting closer to town
Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River
75 miles south
But that's (with a kind, reassuring smile) Bella, you should go inside
Waylon was your father's friend
She goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring quietly, gravely
Clearly, there's more to this
65
-  65 Bella enters to find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, photos, maps --trying to make sense of Waylon's death
Deputies come and go in the background
Bella approaches Charlie
He looks up
Dad, 'm sorry about Waylon
Known him going on thirty years
He's obviously torn up
Bella isn't quite sure what to do
And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
beat
Then Charlie squeezes her hand
It's the first physical affection we've seen between them
And it threatens to evoke even more emotion in Charlie
So he tamps it down, and rises, then projects a confident manner
We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella
But in the meantime
As an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds out a cannister of
want you to have this
That's probably not a good 48
It'll give me some peace of mind
She sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her purse
As Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to A66
-  - '  A66 Two Attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance
On it, Waylon's dead, white, bloody bare  peek out from under sheet, resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle
Off Bella, chilled
: ' '
,  , beautiful and white
' '  -   -  66 -- as she turns on the
She hears a
outside the window
She rises, digs into her purse for the Charlie gave her, and goes to the window
She looks out - all she sees is the wind blowing hard
But she's rattled
She closes the curtains, then reaches for the  she bought earlier
She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within reach
,
As she leafs through we see  of ancient, carved
Comical, menacing, haunting
then she stops on a photo of white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth reads, The Cold One
Bella quickly goes to her computer and Googles Cold One  - several beer ads appear
Frustrated, she closes the pop-ups, revealing a link to: The Cold One: Apotamkin - Several  begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, paintings
Creatures beautiful and horrific
Craven, skeletal demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring innocent maidens
it's all murder, blood, sexuality
in quick succession: 49
-- Speed
Strength
Cold skinned
Immortal
Then finally: Blood drinker
And we           ' , '   ' , - she reels back from the computer in utter disbelief
it's not possible
Off ' , struggling to make sense of it all
: 67 - - '  - --  67 She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn
Her expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief ,   : The bell rings and students exit class, rushing past Bella as she stands still, waiting
'  - -- cross the lawn, heading to class
Edward sees Bella, sees the intensity on her face
He stops
She walks to him, eyes meeting his
her look says, we have to talk
and she continues directly past him, into the dark forest that borders the school
He watches her disappear in the trees, then takes a step to follow
Jasper moves in front of him, Rosalie grabs his arm
Edward, don't go
But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm
He's already there
68 -  68 Bella stands amid the trees, waiting
Then the abruptly drop out
predator is near
Edward appears behind her
She doesn't turn around
beat
50
You're impossibly fast
And strong
Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold
Your eyes change color
And sometimes you speak like
you're from a different time
(turns to face him now) You never eat food, or drink, or come out in the sunlight
And you said no to the beach trip only after you heard where it was
Because of the treaty
This last registers with him
She steps closer to him
How old are you
Seventeen
How long have you been seventeen
long beat as we begin to
He sees he can't hide anymore
Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it
while
She inhales
She knew, but it's still shocking
We know what the Cold Ones are
What you are
Say it
Out loud
Say it
All sound suddenly
We hear only her whisper
Vampire They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her reality utterly rocked
Are you afraid
No
51
(angry) Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat
You won't hurt me
You're different
You think you know me
He glares at her
She holds her ground
Suddenly, he takes her by the hand
Starts walking
Where are we going
Up the mountain
Out of the cloud bank
You need to see what really am
What  look like in the harsh light of the sun
No
The sunlight will kill you
Myth
You need to see the truth
He pulls her but she stumbles
Slow down
Suddenly, he's right next to her
Are you afraid
No
Then come with me
Someplace where no one can protect you
Where could do what 've wanted to do from the first moment  met you
Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them
'm not afraid
You should be
52
He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms
Hold on
Then he flings her onto his back
and starts running
69
-  -  69 As in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark trunks  past as he picks up speed, faster and faster
Bella clings to his back as it seems he'll collide with the trees, but he avoids them with supernatural grace
It's frightening, nauseating, intoxicating
Are you afraid
No
But she clings tighter
Terrified
They climb in altitude
Higher and higher, above the fog layer
Finally, up ahead '  fast approaches, a clearing is beyond
The sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees
they're about to emerge from the shadowy darkness
but suddenly- Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree
All is silent
She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium
Then she realizes she's alone
Edward
Where are you
She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into 70
() -  70 perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery sunlight
a stream nearby
Bella looks around and finally sees , his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some trees
He watches her cautiously
She takes a step toward him, but he holds up a hand
She waits
Finally, he takes deep breath, and steps out of the shade This is why we don't show ourselves in sunlight
As the sun hits him
'  literally sparkles as if embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds
He is magnificent, shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal
He moves toward her
53
This is what  am
He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but
You're
beautiful
He realizes that she's in awe
She reaches to touch him, but he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again
(appalled) Beautiful
'm a killer, Bella
This is the skin of a killer
His arm juts into    , sparkling again
don't believe that
Because you believe the lie
The camouflage
'm the world's most dangerous predator
Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell
As if need any of that
He's suddenly  her --then   of her --then by tree,  so fast, we only see where he lands As if you could outrun me
As if you could fight me off
He abruptly rips off a   , then  it against tree trunk with explosive force
Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable
'm designed to kill
don't care
've killed people
It doesn't matter
54
wanted to kill you
've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life
'm dangerous to you
trust you
Don't
trust you, Edward
'm here
She takes his hand
He reels at the warmth of her touch
She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her  is nearing his lips
then suddenly he's gone
Edward
She looks over to  he's on the other side of the meadow, catching his breath
You
took me by surprise
(collecting himself) don't know how to
do this
He moves back toward her
Slowly
Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind
We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home
We only hunt animals
We've learned to control our thirst
(shaking his head) But you - your scent, it's like drug to me
my own personal brand of heroin
(realizing) Oh
thought you hated me when we met
did
For making me want you so badly
'm still not sure  can control myself
He reaches her again
know you can
55
He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her face for clues
wish  could understand this thing you see in me
You look at me with those eyes
(frustrated) can't read your mind
Tell me what you're thinking
'm afraid
Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass
(devastated) Good
She sinks down in front of him
Not of that
'm afraid
you'll disappear
That 'll lose you
(amazed, elated) You don't know how long 've looked for you
They share a smile
Then he reaches toward her neck, pausing
Be very still
She does so
Exercising great control, he places his hand on her throat
it's so exposed, so vulnerable
The rush between them is overwhelming
But Bella doesn't move
He brushes his hand up her cheek
Then lowers it to her heart
Clouds float past the sun
They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in
And so the lion fell for the lamb
Stupid lamb
Sick masochistic lion
56
on the two of them, laying together, as close as they dare
his hand to her heart
: 71
'  -  71 '
Still in bed
Thinking
(
About three things  was absolutely positive
One, Edward was vampire
She rises, goes to the mirror
Looks at herself, worry knitting her brow
(
Two, there was a part of him that thirsted for my blood
And three
As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing her to  into her desk
She looks back out

She beams at the sight of him

was falling, unconditionally and irrevocably, in love with him
72  72 73
-  ( ) 73 Edward helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous fallen pine tree in the moss-covered forest
How long have you been like this
Since nineteen-eighteen
That's when Carlisle found me
She takes that in, it's a lot
But it stokes her curiosity
Where'd he find you
In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza
My parents had already died
57
to  , 1918 - (
What was it like
(
The word excruciating comes to mind
But what Carlisle did was much harder
not many of us have the restraint to do that
(
Didn't he just
bite
Not just
Our bite contains venom
And once we taste blood, a sort of
frenzy begins
It's almost impossible to stop
(
But Carlisle did
First with me, then with his wife, Esme
He found her in a hospital, as well
The others followed
to Does someone have to be dying to become like you
Their   as we go to 74
'  -  ( ) 74 They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, covered in bright green moss
No, that's just Carlisle
He would never do
this, to someone who had another choice
So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people
Not the only reason
He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion
58
don't want to be a monster
She nods
Understands
He smiles
We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way
For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu
It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying
Then abruptly, he whips past Bella
She turns to see him standing on a large rock in the river
Show off
It's not that impressive, really
Anyone in my family can do this
Can they all read minds, too
No, that's unique to me
But Alice can see the future
(fishing) Really
Bet she saw me coming mile away
She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening
Her visions are very subjective
The future can change
He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and continuing their walk
75
'  -  ( ) 75 Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck
boom box
He perches on top of the roof
Come to my house tomorrow
Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off the cab and sprays in her face
He jumps down from the roof
Your house
With your family
59
He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large  out of the truck's body
She's too flustered to register it
But
what if they don't like me
(laughing heartily) You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you
'm glad  amuse you
But then his laughter dies, as he hears something
What is it
complication
as a   comes into view, and pulls up
'll pick you up tomorrow
He heads to his car, eying the passengers in '  - Jacob, with his father, Billy, who's expression is intense
Anxious
as Edward locks eyes with Billy
Jacob looks questioningly at his father
Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange
She forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors
Jacob sets up Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as Come to visit your truck
Looks good
You got that dent out
Actually, we came to visit your flat screen
First Mariners game of the season
Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again
60
(mortified) Great, Dad
Thanks
Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the pulls up
Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs
Pale Ale
(holds up a brown paper ) Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry
Charlie smiles, pleased
He clicks on the game as they all head inside Any luck with the Waylon case
(darkening) Found a footprint out at the crime scene today
bare, human footprint
Billy seems disturbed but not surprised
Bella is horrified
person did that
crazy person, walking around barefoot this time of year
Spread the word out at the rez, will ya
Keep the kids out of the woods
Will do
(directed at Bella) Don't want no one else getting hurt
Bella looks away from Billy, unnerved
76  76 77  77 78   -  78 Bella floats near Edward, only their hands touching, but their bodies are nearing, so close, so sensual
61
Suddenly,
Something has him, pulling him down
: 79 '  -   -  79 -- as her eyes pop open
and relief sweeps over her as she realizes it was just a dream
But it haunts her
80 -  -  80 of the forest as we sweep over its lush green expanse, to  Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast
The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long serpentine dirt road
until, finally, it reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits 81 -  81 timeless graceful house
The Volvo pulls up and Bella climbs out, surprised
It's
wonderful
You expected turrets, dungeons and moats
No
not moats
He takes her hand
She girds herself
They head inside
82 -   -  82 Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house
Walls of glass look out on the river
Everything's open and white
Historical objects are tastefully placed throughout
Verdi's La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici coming from another room
Bella is enraptured
It's so light and open
Thanks to tinted windows
It's the one place we never have to hide
We then notice  coming from the kitchen
Edward shakes his head
told them not to do this
62
83
-  -  83 Verdi's opera  Bella and Edward who enter to find the kitchen in full swing
Dr
Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and prepare elaborate platters of Italian pastas and antipasti
Esme rolls out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an instant
Rosalie stirs a pot, disinterested
Esme sees Bella and stops, emanating maternal warmth
Her heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the silent-movie era
Bella
We're making Italiano for you
This is Esme, my mother for all intents and purposes
Bon giorno
Molto bene
You've given us an excuse to use the kitchen for the first time
Hit pause
across brand new Williams-Sonoma cookware boxes to the corner --they're watching an    on a
Emmett hits the  remote control
hope you're hungry
Oh, absolutely She already ate
Bella shoots him a look, but something
Rosalie has thrown down a bowl and now strides out Perfect
63
84
() -  84 -- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain
The other's follow - just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know
Of course
That was very considerate of you
(re: Rosalie) Ignore her
do
Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all of us
would never, ever tell anyone
(reassuring) She knows that
The problem is, you two have gone public now, so
Emmett
No, she should know
(to Bella) The entire family will be implicated if this ends badly
Badly
This hangs in the air, uncomfortably
Edward can't look at her
(realizing) Oh
Badly
Like, where  become meal
Emmett chokes back laughter
Edward grins
Wraps his arm around Bella
Even Esme has to chuckle
Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen
Emmett shrugs, goes after her
64
(
Hi, Bella
Alice leaps over the rail, holding a bouquet of wildflowers
Jasper follows her
She bounces forward to kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers
'm Alice
You do smell good
Alice
It's alright, Bella and  are going to be great friends
(extending her hand) And you're Jasper, right
Pleasure to meet you
But he shies away from her hand
(gently encouraging) You won't hurt her, Jasper
He isn't so sure
Edward takes Bella's hand instead
'll give you a tour of the house
(with meaning) 'll see you soon
Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides her up the stairs
As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden China, Asian scrolls
They reach - to  a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels
Bella looks closer
Graduation caps
private joke
We matriculate a lot
What a nightmare, repeating high school
65
True, but the younger we start out in new place, the longer we can stay there
She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on
85
'  -  85 and this is my room
Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with the river beyond
The rest is floor to ceiling 's, vinyl, track tapes, etc
, with a sophisticated -pod/stereo set up
So you're obsessed with music
But
(looking around) No bed
No sleep
Ever
No nightmares, no drool, no snoring
She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of 's, studying the titles
Do you have any favorites
Depends
Alternative
Jazz
Sixties, seventies
Ooh, she knows her music
Alright, nineties
Eighteen-nineties
Classical
'd have to say
Debussy
He looks at her, surprised, smiles
My favorite, too
Off their connection, he pulls out a  and puts it on
solo piano version of    begins to play
66
He moves to her, taking her hand, then he starts to turn her in a pirouette, dancing with her - but she breaks off and backs away
No dancing
Ever
No tripping, no falling, no derision
(mischievously) can always make you
You don't scare me
You really shouldn't have said that
He grins, a low   in the back of his throat
She laughs and backs out the door, onto 86
'  -  () 86 -- Bella backs up to the rail
Edward appears in the doorway, shifting into a half-crouch, about to pounce
Don't you dare - Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they then she finds herself - in his arms
When she realizes where she is, she laughs, delighted
It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too
: 87
-   -  87 Esme and Dr
Cullen look out the window
Edward's filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, smiles
She's brought him to life
He's been alone too long
but how can it end well
Alice has been wrong before
67
Not often
Esme turns to Dr
Cullen, gentle but absolutely firm
Carlisle
Bella is what he wants
It will work out
Somehow
Dr
Cullen smiles at her with love, then takes her hand as they look back out the window
-  88 Edward looks Bella in the eye
Trust me
In theory
Then close your eyes
She does, warily
He grips her more firmly, then  them to another tree like a flying squirrel
Then, again, to the  of another tree
He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella
Open
She does
to the most astonishing bird's eye  of the valley, river, and the mountains beyond
whirls around them allowing us a 360 degree view of their surroundings
Off Bella's intoxicated face
: A89
-  A89 Jessica pops a volleyball in the air, doing practice serves
Angela takes a picture of her, then points her camera around, looking for another shot
Eric studies some fliers advertising the prom
Monte Carlo
That's our prom theme
Gambling, tuxedos and - (ala Sean Connery) Bond
James -- ow
-- as Jessica head-butts the ball which hits him in the face
68
Oh
My
God
Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen
Jessica and Eric -- arriving together
All eyes on campus are turning to them, filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy
Everyone's staring
Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked
Off his rakish, but reassuring smile
89 89 Moving fast, tracking
holding the leash - --It's a hunting party, several dogs, half a dozen armed men
Guys, we got something The Deputies hurry to Charlie
They gather around The dogs start pulling them in a certain direction
As the posse takes off at a sprint -  , We watch Charlie and the posse move away
to find -   , Laurent stands next to him
Victoria jogs up
They took the bait
By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg
Victoria lasciviously grabs James' shirt
Pulls him to her
love when men chase me
69
He grins, then starts taking off her clothes
They pull each other toward the woods with carnal lust
It barely registers with Laurent, who continues to watch the posse with concern
90
/
-   90 Bella hurries toward the entrance, trying to keep the joy on her face in check
with minimal success
Outside the door, she passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball
Yo, Arizona
So
You and Cullen
She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile, as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in
Sorry 'm late
Biology project
Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate of seafood in front of Bella
Ordered you the seafood combo
Order one for yourself next time
You should cut back on the steak
'm healthy as a horse
(concerned) Say Chief, boys want to know, you find anything down by Queets River today
Charlie's aware of the  at the counter listening, too
He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm
The suspect's moving east
Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here
They're putting extra guys on
Hope they catch him fast
She moves off, with a measure of relief
Charlie and Bella pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc
, with an easy rhythm now
Your friends are flagging you
70
She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, straws in their noses, making faces at her
She smiles
It's okay you wanna join them
'm just gonna turn in early anyway
Yeah, me, too
It's a Friday night
Go out
The Newton boy's got a big smile for you
Nice family, the Newtons
He's just a friend
None of the boys in town interest you
We're not really going to talk about boys, are we
Just
you should be around people
leave you alone too much
(with genuine affection) 've never minded being alone
Guess 'm a lot like my dad that way
Charlie smiles
These two have come a long way
Cora returns Berry cobbler, two forks
She sets it between them
Off them, both reaching for forks
91
'  -  91 Bella, dressed for bed, looks out the window as she talks on the phone with Rene
Bella's euphoria still lingers in her eyes
So spring training's going well
: 92
-  92 Rene talks on her cell
Phil is in the background, post-batting practice, chowing down with a couple of teammates
71
Phil's working hard
We're looking around for a house to rent, in case it becomes permanent
You'd like Jacksonville, baby
Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me
(stops, knows there's more) Could
a guy have something to do with that
(small smile) Maybe
Tell me everything
Jock
Indie
Bet he's smart
Is he smart
(trying to avoid lies) Well
he is kind of a history buff
-- this as she turns to find , smiling
She nearly drops the phone
, uh
have to go
No way, we gotta talk boys
Are you being safe
Edward shoots her a look, he heard that
She's mortified
'll call you later, Mom
who hangs up
How did you get in here
The window
As always
You've been here before
What else is there to do at night
72
She pushes him
He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her onto the bed, wrestling as You're a peeping Tom
Perv
Shh
The Chief will hear you
But the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms them, their laughter quieting
He studies her face
just
like watching over you
He raises his fingers to her lips, sending a thrill up her spine
There's something 'd like to try
She nods, bedazzled by him
He takes her face in his hands, hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her
What neither of them is prepared for is her response
Her breath comes in a wild
Her fingers knot in his hair, clutching him to her
Lips part as she breathes his scent
Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her face back
She opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild, his jaw clenched
(mortified) Oh
'm
oh
He relaxes slightly, looking at her blushing face
'm stronger than  thought
Wish  could say the same
'm so embarrassed
Don't be
But we have to be careful
(serious) can never lose control with you
Ever
She nods, then carefully lies on his chest
He wraps his arms around her
Off the two of them
93
'  -   -   93 Bella enters to find Charlie cleaning a rifle
He starts to say hello but she just blurts out - 73
have a date with Edward Cullen
He suddenly looks like he's having an aneurysm
He's too old for you
We're both juniors
thought you liked the Cullens
And  thought you weren't interested in any of the boys in town
Edward doesn't live in town
And it's in the early stage and - whatever, he's outside right now
Now
He's out there
He wants to meet you
Officially
Good
He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness
Be nice, okay
He's
important
Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod
then she opens the door to  Edward in a parka and gloves
Chief Swan
wanted to formally introduce myself
'm Edward
Edward extends his hand
Charlie takes it, but grunts hello, resisting him
won't keep Bella out late tonight
We're just going to go play baseball with my family
Bella's going to play baseball
Bella's equally surprised, but hides it
74
Yes, sir, that's the plan
Well
More power to you,  guess
(looks him in the eyes) She'll be safe with me, sir,  promise
As Edward exits
Charlie holds Bella back
(sotto) You got that pepper spray
Dad
94
'  -   94 Edward and Bella climb into a massive  parked in the drive
(amused) Your father thinks you should go to an all-girl's school
No fair, reading Charlie's mind
As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat And since when do vampires like baseball
It's the American pastime
Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming
It's the only time we can play
You'll see why
95
-  95 Storm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in the Jeep
She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks
Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella
Good thing you're here
We need umpire
(big crooked grin) She thinks we cheat
75
know you cheat
Call em as you see em, Bella
to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound
It's time
-- Just as a deep  of thunder shakes the forest
- And it's extraordinary
Bella stays by Esme who plays catcher
Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed
Edward and Emmett take positions in the outfield
--   the ball with the aluminum bat
It like thunder -- and is followed directly by real
(to Esme) Now  get why you need the thunder
The ball  like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing through the trees
Edward disappears after it
That has to be a home run
Edward's very fast
Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out of the forest with the ball and  it to home plate
Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in
Yer out
Esme nods
Amazed, Bella watches as
hits a line drive
Edward and Emmett race for the catch,  15 feet and  with such might that it sounds like enormous boulders falling
They miss the ball -- Dr
Cullen is safe
the next pitch -- deep into the forest
But before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly
Stop
didn't see them
They all stop
Edward is immediately at Bella's side
The family instantly gathers at home plate
They're traveling so quickly 76
You said they left the county - They did, but then they heard us
(looking at Edward) And changed their minds
(to Bella) Put your hair down Like that'll help
could smell her from across the field
Edward ignores Rosalie as he arranges Bella's hair
shouldn't have brought you here
'm so sorry
She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward - There's a faint rustle
then James, Victoria and Laurent emerge
As they near, Bella  their bare feet, then the deep  of their eyes
Laurent holds up the baseball
believe this belongs to you
He tosses the ball (his casual toss is still blindingly fast) to Dr
Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely
Thank you
Could you use three more players
Of course
'm Laurent
This is Victoria
And James
Would you like to bat first
Laurent picks up a bat
The Cullens take the field
Dr
Cullen is catcher, Edward is on first, with Bella behind him, near the Jeep
77
Bella sees that Edward's eyes are locked onto James
Laurent is at bat first
'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us
Our apologies
We didn't realize the territory had been claimed
Yes, we maintain a permanent residence
The three newcomers exchange a look of surprise
Really
Well, we won't be a problem any more
The humans were tracking us, but we led them East- Jasper pitches the ball -- Laurent  it -- but Alice is up a tree is a flash and the ball slams into Alice's hand with a
Laurent is pissed, but James smiles ever so slightly, delighted at the discovery of worthy opponents
James is up next and he -  with
He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella
--    as the wind from the ball ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, which floats to -- who suddenly  to a halt
His head around at her and he lurches into a crouch, his nostrils flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella
You brought a snack
springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth
truly menacing, feral  rips from his throat
James  back
: in a flash, the Cullens rush into position behind Edward -- Laurent and Victoria line up behind James
The girl is with us
78
(trying to defuse situation) We won't harm her
(hungry for battle) Just try it
think it best if you leave
Yes,  can see the game is over
We'll go now
James
But James' eyes don't leave Edward's
Laurent puts a hand on James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the woods with his cohorts, disappearing
Once they're gone, Esme immediately gathers up the bats- Get Bella out of here
We'll follow them
Dr
Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the three vampires
Edward scoops Bella up as we : -    -   96 Edward whips Bella into the Jeep and straps her in - James is a tracker
saw his mind
The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off - -- The tires spin as Edward  the jeep around -- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human
(dark with disgust) just made this his most exciting game ever
Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just wrought up on them all as
jolting, death defying ride,  through creeks, until they reach 79
97
-  97 speeds wildly down the road
The first place he'll go is your house
He'll track your scent there
(horrified) What
Charlie's there
He's in danger because of me
Because of us
(calmly) Then we'll lead the tracker away from him
Somehow
He angrily  around a bend, 98
'  -   -  98 Charlie watches a baseball game on
as the door suddenly open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated- said, leave me alone
Bella, don't do this
Just think about it, please Get out
It's over
She  the door
Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned
Bella
What happened
have to get out of this place
Out of Forks
'm leaving
Now
Bella runs upstairs
Charlie hurries after her 99
'  -  99 Bella slams the door behind her
Edward's already there, pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle faster than humanly possible
Bella leans against the door
80
(a pained whisper) can't hurt him
Edward gives her a look, you have to
There's a
Charlie on the other side
It's agony for both of them
Bells
Did he hurt you
No, Dad
Then what
Did he break up with you
broke up with him
thought you liked him
That's why  have to leave
don't want this
want to go home
(whispering) 'll be in the truck
And he disappears out the window
Bella gathers strength to continue her performance
She opens the door to reveal Charlie
He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into 100
'  -  () -  100 Bella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows
Your mother's not even in Phoenix
She'll come home
'll call her from the road
You can't drive home now
'll take you to the airport in the morning
want to drive
need time to think
'll pull into a motel in few hours
promise
She heads down the stairs
Charlie follows
81
101
'  -  () - 101 Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels
She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her
Bells,  know 'm not around much, but  can change that
We can do more things together
She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say
Like watch more baseball on the flat screen
Or go to the Coffee Shop
Same people, same steak, same berry cobbler every night
That's you, Dad
Not me
This hits Charlie hard
She can barely stand it, heads down the stairs, as he takes a second to recover
Bella
just got you back
Which breaks Bella's heart
and forces her to deliver the final blow
And if  don't get out now, 'm going get stuck here like mom did
Charlie is stunned, wounded
She takes advantage of his shock, pushing past him out the door
102
'  -  102 Bella exits, heads to her truck
Fresh tears spring to her eyes
Trees, branches
and a pair of
James
He watches from a distance as Bella pulls out
The truck moves off
and so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain, staring out the window
103
'  -  103 Bella drives, wiping tears away
Suddenly Edward is outside the car, near Bella's window
82
He'll forgive you
(off Bella's startled look) Slide over
Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the door, sliding in, and takes the wheel
Bella slumps
His face
said the same words my mother used when she left him
It was the only way he'd let you go
Edward  it
Your father's safe now, Bella
The tracker is following us Suddenly,
- a dark figure  onto the bed of the truck
Bella
It's alright
It's just Emmett
Alice is in the car behind us
She catches her breath
It kills him to see her so frightened
She looks out the window as they drive through town
104 '  -
() -  104 The small, insulated town passes by in
we Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, flirting, innocent, hopeful
105
-  105 Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the house
but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits
They immediately take defensive positions but Dr
Cullen appears
He came to warn us
About James
They back down slightly
Laurent address Dr
Cullen
've grown tired of his games
But he's got unparalleled senses
Absolutely lethal
've never seen anything like him in three hundred years
And the woman, Victoria, will back him
Don't underestimate her
83
Dr
Cullen nods thanks
Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic
'm truly sorry for what's been unleashed here
And he moves off, disappearing into the woods
106
-    - The side door   as Edward and the Cullens enter, followed by Bella
The lights flip on to reveal a pristine garage; the Volvo, the red , a black Mercedes sedan, an
Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable  units, changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc
As they load up the vehicles 've had to fight our kind before
We're hard to kill
But not impossible
We'll tear him up (with bloodlust) We'll rip him apart with our hands, then burn the pieces don't relish killing another creature
Even a sadistic one like James
If he doesn't get to one of us first
(horrified) This is insane
You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me
Too late
Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr
Cullen 'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away 84
No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella
He'll follow you
'll go with Bella
Jasper and will drive her south
(facing him) 'll keep her safe, Edward
Edward agonizes
Frustrated
Alice steps forward
(studies her, torn) Can you keep your thoughts to yourself
She nods
An unspoken agreement
Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice
Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent
(dropping the clothes) Why should
What is she to me
Just a danger you've inflicted on us (spinning on her) Rosalie
Bella is with Edward
She's a part of this family now
And we protect our family
She glowers, but picks up the clothes
Dr
Cullen hits the door opener and the massive   roll open
Dr
Cullen squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together
If any of you get hurt because of me We won't, there are five of us, two of them
When it's done, 'll come get you
He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes
You're my life now
85
They drink each other in, possibly for the last time
as the out, 107
,   -  107 The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black with dark tinted windows  through frame 108
-  108 Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat
Bella is in the back, her eyes red from crying
She talks on her cell phone Mom, it's me again
You must have let your phone die
Anyway, 'm not in Forks anymore but 'm okay
'll explain when you call
She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, misty Olympic Peninsula speed past
Off Bella's face - , -- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash by us
Finally, we land in
109  109 110
,   -  110 at a blinding speed as we track Edward, Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead
Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts
Rosalie tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a And then they're gone
111  111 112
-  112 Esme and Dr
Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the river
In the distance, below, they -    -  jogs into view
She then looks in their direction
Once Dr
Cullen and Esme are assured she has their scent, they continue over the hill's crest
113  113 114
,   -  114 86
James blasts past the   -- then stops, backtracks to the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric
He starts off again
but stops, smells the fabric
Something's not right
He runs back in the opposite direction
Uh oh
: 115
-  -   115 ' : her eyes pop open
She's lying atop a bed, fully clothed
She rises, reorienting
116
-   -   116 The blinds are pulled
Alice and Jasper stare blankly at set
Several plates of food crowd a table
Alice looks up as Bella enters, looking at her cell phone
wish he'd call
You should eat
But Bella ignores the food
She sits heavily
They could get hurt
It's not worth it
(insistent) Yes
It is
She's taken aback
It's the first time he's engaged with her
Edward's changed since he found you
And none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you
(he looks forward again) It's worth it
Suddenly, Alice
Jasper goes to her, Bella follows
What do you see
(with deep worry) The tracker
He just changed course
Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her
87
Where will it take him, Alice
'  as we- - disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of
Mirrors
It's a room of mirrors
Alice begins to draw at  , closing her eyes, trying to see it clearly
How do the visions work
Edward said they weren't always certain
She sees the course people are on, while they're on it
If they change their minds, the visions change
Bella looks over Alice's shoulder to see the drawing
So the course James is on now will lead him to
a ballet studio
(looks up at her) You've been here
No
don't know
used to take ballet lessons as a kid
The school had an arch like that
Was your school here in Phoenix
Yeah, around the corner from my house
But  haven't been there in ten years
Do you have any reason to go now
No
Hell, no
hated the place
Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out
Suddenly, Bella  as her cell phone
She picks it up
Sees the caller
and exhales relief
She answers
88
Edward
Are you alright
: 117
/
-  117 Dr
Cullen drives the Jeep, fast, Emmett in the back, Edward in the passenger seat on his cell phone
'm coming to get you
(hates having to say this) We lost the tracker
The woman is still in the area
Rosalie and Esme are protecting your father
(sinking) This is my fault
You warned me, but  didn't think
just
Bella, we're in too deep
We can't change how we feel
No
we can't
(then) When will you get here
In a couple hours
Then you and will go somewhere
Together
The others will keep hunting
(then, determined) Bella,  swear to you, 'll do whatever it takes to make you safe again
Off Bella, her eyes welling
118
-  118 Alice in the lobby, settling the bill
Jasper loads up the car out front
119
-  -  119 Bella gathers her things, then her phone  again
-It reads
Bella answers - Mom, 'm so glad you got my - 89
(
(panicked) Bella
Bella
Where are you
Calm down, Mom
Everything is fine, okay
'll explain every on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone
Mom
Are you there
Then Bella  a voice that sends a chill down her spine (
Nice house you have here
Not the best on the block, but comfortable
: 120
' ,  -  120 , his sinister eyes and vicious smile
was prepared to wait for you
But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad
It all worked out quite well
Bella's eyes are wild with fear
must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well
It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address
(
Bella
Bella
Leave my mother out of this
You're protective of her
That's nice
You can still save her
But you'll need to get away from your friends
Can you do that
don't think so
90
If your mother's life depends on it
Bella is terrified, but there's no choice here
Where should  meet you
James grins as he fingers a  of Bella that's attached to the refrigerator with a magnet
It's the same photo Charlie has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor
The old ballet studio around the corner
And 'll know if you bring anyone along
Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake
(sniffs the air) She smells like you
Delicious
as she hangs up, panicked
She starts flinging open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit
Useless
Then she remembers
Her purse
She dumps out the contents, and  the pepper spray Charlie gave her
She clings to it, her only protection now

-  -  127 Bella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice
She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion
She slips out the opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the door
The  is an elderly woman with a hacking
(taking a breath for courage) 8th and Palo Verde, please
The taxi pulls out
Bella watches the hotel disappear
Off her
91
(
've never given much thought to how  would die
128
-  - '  128 Once again, we see the polished malls, the manicured cactus gardens
All empty for the night
(
But dying in the place of someone love seems like a good way to go
129  129 130  130 131
'    -  131 Bella climbs out of the taxi
It pulls away, leaving her on the curb facing the deserted building
Bella twirls her mother's ring around her finger, then reaches for the pepper spray
(
can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face with death
they also brought me to Edward
She slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket
She wraps her purse strap around her wrist
She takes a breath, approaches the school
Peers in the windows
The blinds are drawn
But from inside, we  a faint sound
(
Bella
Bella
It's time
Bella goes to the front door
It's unlocked
132  132 133
'    -  -  133 Bella cautiously enters this grand, empty room of mirrors
ballet bar wraps around the walls - (
Bella, where are you
Bella whirls, trying to find its source
She follows the sound to a cleaning supply
She throws open the door to -      - Bella, age 7, hides in the very closet the
is in now
Little Bella looks up at us
92
(
Don't you want to dance, baby
Little Bella shakes her head stubbornly
The frame jiggles as Rene hands someone the camera
Rene, ten years younger, appears on screen and kneels next to Bella
Everyone makes fun of me
But you're a wonderful dancer
Mom,  suck
behind Bella
She spins, trying to locate James in the mirrors
That's my favorite part
Stubborn child, weren't you
Bella's face flushes with rage
and relief
She's not here
Sorry
But you really made it too easy
Visible in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed
Then he steps up next to her and points a   at Bella
So to make things more entertaining, 'm going to make a little film of our time together
Borrowed this from your house
Hope you don't mind
(turns it on) And
action
Bella  her purse at him, and runs for the door
Excellent
An escape attempt
Suddenly, he's right behind her
She freezes
It'll break Edward's little heart
He smells her hair
Touches her throat
Edward has nothing to do with this
93
He will
His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you
He's having too much fun to notice --the peppers spray in her hand
She spins around and sprays him
Then she runs, as James  back briefly
But he leaps over her and lands
Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball
She  hard into a mirrored column
James captures it on film
Beautiful
Very visually dynamic
chose my stage well
He advances toward her
Still stubborn, aren't you
Is that what makes you special
Because frankly,  don't see it
He inhales as if he can taste her already Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you
Instead, he kept you this fragile little human
It's cruel, really
James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper spray
He tries to wipe it off
Well done
You've succeeded in annoying me
He  on her shin
her tibia
Bella  in agony
Tell Edward how much it hurts
Abruptly, the camera is in her face Tell him to avenge you
No
Edward, don't
94
James inhales as her blood pools
He leans in, hungry
Bella, half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face '  -   ' Cut
The end
Suddenly --
He rises to find himself face to face with Edward
James Edward, forcing him up against a column
You're alone
because you're faster than the others
But not stronger
James  Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks
'm strong enough to kill you
Edward  James backwards --  through freestanding mirror -- into the doorway
He scoops Bella up and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he and Bella are  downward
James  Edward violently onto the floor --  Bella out of his arms -- as James  Edward up into the top window --  him in the casement and bricks
James crouches beside Bella
He grabs her Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he into Bella's hand
She  in agony
Edward's rage  -- he climbs out of the window casement and -- James, savagely  him through the floorboards
-- as the venom travels through her veins
'  - dark figures twist and fight, in and out of focus
Her eyes suddenly   to see the of James  Edward, delivering death blows when - Suddenly Edward's hand   and  James' ankle
Edward  up to his feet and  James around like baseball bat,  him into mirror after mirror
James is battered, beaten
Bella moans -- and the sound of her pain slices through Edward
In an animalistic fury, Edward   a piece of James' flesh
95
from Bella's horrified face to
--now standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder
Edward turns to see his father -- and , , and , dropping down from the balcony
Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far
He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and at James like a pack of animals
Dr
Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who  again in pain
Edward dashes toward her - '  -    , going in and out of focus
it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip out the floorboards and build a fire
it's like a funeral pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire
-- as Edward reaches her side
Dr
Cullen works fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her leg
But clearly her hand hurts the most
She writhes in pain
'      : Dr
Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh - Her femoral artery's been severed
She's losing too much blood It's on fire
My hand
Venom - (working on Bella) You have to make a choice
Either let the change happen No
'  - appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct
It's going to happen
've seen it It doesn't have to be that way
Alice, find me a tourniquet
rag, a shirt
96
Alice holds her nose and avoids the blood as she rips the sleeve off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr
Cullen
It's burning
What's the other choice
You said (to Alice) Tighter, above the knee Carlisle
You can try to suck the venom out
-- won't be able to stop Find the will to stop
But choose, she only has minutes left
Edward looks down at Bella, thrashing in pain
Finally, Edward takes her hand
She tries to pull it away
It's alright, Bella
'll make it go away
He looks at her - then starts to suck the venom from her hand
They never take their eyes off one another, the connection palpable, intense
'  -wild with pain
But subsiding
'  -the frenzy has begun
He sucks harder
Hungrily
Anguished, he wants to stop but can't
Dr
Cullen's voice sounds miles away
Stop
Her blood is clean, you're killing her
-- but the bloodlust is too strong
He is killing her
Bella looks at him, forgivingly, as she begins to lose consciousness
'  -  -growing blurry
he disappears into the blinding light
It's as if she's underwater, like her dreams
(
Death is peaceful
Easy
97
Bella starts to float away
we're losing her
Suddenly from the darkness, Edward reaches out a hand
brilliant light flares
134 ' Eyes closed
But they slowly open
She squints at the light
Life
is harder
An oxygen tube rests under her nose
She reaches for it, confused
hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus
(
You're awake, baby
You're okay
- Bella lies in a hospital bed
Bandaged, leg in a cast
In bad shape
Rene hovers over her, tears in her eyes
On the dresser, get well cards and a   of her friends from Forks
Edward
Where's - He's asleep
She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps
He never leaves
And your dad's down in the cafeteria
What
happened
Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window
Bella is drawing a blank, confused
Rene jogs her memory Edward came here to convince you to come back to Forks
His father brought him down
You went to their hotel but you tripped on the stairs
moment
then Bella realizes it's a cover story
She nods
Sounds like me
98
Rene's cell phone
She opens it
Reads a text, starts typing in a reply
It's Phil
He's worried about you
Mom, you're
texting
(smiling) told him to stay in Florida
The Suns signed him
That's great mom
Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have your own bathroom
Mom, wait
want to live in Forks
have Dad
(re: the get well cards) and friends
(re: Edward) And he's there
Bella shrugs, conceding the truth
Charlie doesn't like him
Blames him for your leaving
What do you think
(lowering her voice) think that boy is in love with you
Bella smiles
Rene grins
Bella glances at Edward
Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad
want to talk to him
Apologize
'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby
But Ill go get him
99
Rene kisses Bella's forehead
Exits
Bella watches her go
The door shutting behind her
Bella turns back to find Edward standing next to her with deep concern
Her eyes well
He kisses her forehead soothingly
Is James - did you -- We took care of him
And the woman, Victoria, she ran off
She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him
'm alive because of you
(darkens) You're in here because of me
Her wounds cause him pain
He strokes her face
The worst of it
was thinking couldn't stop - But you did
Bella, you should go to Jacksonville
Where  can't hurt you anymore
What
No
want to be with you
don't want (sitting next to her) Sssh
It's alright
'm not going anywhere
'm right here
He wraps an arm around her
As she curls up in his arms

We're back in the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest

'  -    136 At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife
Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant suit
But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare
The front door opens and they look up to see --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress
Edward is enchanted
Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to her
Charlie edges out Edward to help her down
Alice lent me the dress
It was the only thing that would fit over my cast
Is it too
You're perfect
'll take good care of her, Chief
Heard that before
Edward moves to open the car door
Charlie holds Bella back
(sotto) put new pepper spray in your bag
Dad
and
you look beautiful
Father and daughter share a smile

,    -  137 Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn
He helps Bella out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining room
Mr
Molina and other teachers are there
We may notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones
can't believe you're making me do this
He just grins
Edward guides her around a corner to

() -  138 - Monte Carlo style
Gaming tables and roulette wheels
Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, dance and socialize
101
You really are trying to kill me
Prom is an important rite of passage
don't want you to miss anything
She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately
They continue into the prom
Several heads turn
Bella sees , where a gap has formed
In the middle, two couples whirl gracefully
It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and Emmett, looking absolutely stunning
Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury
But Alice waves brightly
Bella returns it with a smile as we hear a crossfade into the next track- '  -- It's Eric at the turntables, making the room bounce
Next to him, Angela wears the headphones, flipping through a stack of vinyl
They nod at Bella -- she shoots them a smile when - gets her attention '  - ' Mike and Jessica stand in front of an Aston Martin cut-out
Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond impersonation
Jessica poses like Pussy Galore
Edward smirks, then turns to Bella Shall we
(laughs, then realizes) You're serious
He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less  her to the   -- then places her feet atop his own
and starts to move
She actually begins to enjoy it
See
You're dancing
At prom
As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength
Becomes thoughtful
Finally, she looks at him
102
Edward
why did you save me
(off his questioning look) If you'd let the venom spread, could've been like you by now
(stops, horrified) You don't know what you're saying
You don't want this
want you
Always
(angry) won't end your life for you
He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word
'm dying anyway
Every minute, get closer, older That's how it's supposed to happen
Not the way Alice saw it
(off his sharp look) heard her
She saw me like you
Her visions change, Bella
Based on what someone decides
And 've decided
He looks at her, angry
Is that what you dream about
Becoming a monster
dream about being with you forever
You really want this
Yes
He lowers his lips to her neck
One bite is all it would take
103
You're ready right now
Yes
His lips hover over her skin, a long beat
then he presses his lips to her throat
Not a bite
kiss
He looks at her
You're going to have a long and happy life with me
Isn't that enough
She looks at him
and finally smiles
For now
They  around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from one another, as we   on them, in each other's arms
(
) No one will surrender tonight
But won't give in
know what  want
on the dance floor
We realize
someone's watching it, looking down from the window of a second floor hotel room in the Inn
The  wafting up in echoes
to
, turning from the window
She's stylishly dressed now, but seething -- a low, sinister  in the back of her throat
