She sits beside him, mopping his forehead with a cool rag
Your fever broke in the night
The medicine helped
How long was  asleep
Two days

There are now   of people waiting for food

Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine and a few others are enjoying real food
Lazar calls out from the other line

The first thing he sees is Asael, whose face is
What happened
Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others
Tuvia strides over to them
(') What is this
New policy
Fighters get better food
Against my orders
You are no longer Commander
Sorry
Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment
He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they literally cower in fear
He raises his voice to those watching
As long as  am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands

Every morning we get up and we work
In the snow and the cold and the dark
Tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka, we double the number of food missions

He is tired of being in charge, tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate

Not to become like animals

The glow of her skin
He looks at her
And nods in surrender
(') Thank you, Tuvia
She kisses him
chaste kiss of gratitude
She pulls back and they look into each other's eyes

Malbin is there
Oh
Hello, Lilka

Yes
We've caught one

He wears the same uniform as those who marched the villagers into the forest for execution
He's a scout
They're coming for us
Group members have begun to gather around him
They begin to hurl insults -- schtik drek, paskudnyak -- as the hapless man is pushed to his knees
We found this in his pouch
He hands Tuvia a sheaf of documents -- including a map

Shimon translates

Nein
Nein

He breaks the stick across the man's back
We want justice
Justice
Soon it is a chant: "Justice

Only months ago they were decorous, civilized
Now they are hungry, almost feral
Murderous

Tuvia closes his eyes
He has done nothing to stop it
Asael looks at Malbin and Shimon
They are undone by what they have witnessed
Tuvia walks away
Behind them, the group separates -- staring at the lifeless body on the ground
And then they look at each other, their blood lust sated, beginning to reckon with what they have done
What they have become

Tuvia approaches
He and Zus nod to each other but do not speak
It is excruciating
Tuvia and Viktor walk into the woods
Zus waits with other as Asael joins them
Zus wears a Nazi jacket
He doesn't look good
could say the same about you
Where'd you get the jacket
Let's just say the former owner no longer had need of it
Zus winks
The other bodyguards stare impassively
(') Embrace me
Asael looks confused for a moment, then embraces him

Viktor studies the scout's documents

And if  refuse
You are officially a deserter
Do you know the policy on dealing with deserters
Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket
(') The Germans are offering fifty thousand marks for information leading to your capture
(hands it to him) Not a very flattering likeness
Too Jewish
Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a last word
(') Have your men in my camp by tonight
He walks off
Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia

There are some who'd turn you in for less

He gives an order into a field radio

Viktor just looks at him
(') You're deliberately sacrificing them so we can remain safe
No
So we can keep fighting
Everyone must sacrifice in the struggle
Those are my brothers

He is your brother
Comrade Zus
Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but counter-revolutionary
Zus has secretly known he would hear these words
He grips his rifle but holds his tongue
: 142    --      142 Tuvia stares up at it
Have they been spotted
Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children
He looks pale
His cough is worse
He is very ill
but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt
Until Moses said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in God
' He will take care of you' (a wrenching cough) And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries
Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face
Malbin comes to stand beside him

Yes

Malbin doesn't get it at first

Now Malbin understands
He looks at Shimon

It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their death, and apparently it won't be the last
We leave now
Spread the word

Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs
Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion-- Come, tateh-- But my tools-- The  of approaching aircraft
Tuvia searches the sky
Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child
Tamara tucks her newborn under her coat
The  of the approaching aircraft grows
People look up, shielding their eyes
Then from out of the sun, two ominous silhouettes: 144        144 panics the crowd

144 : 144 Some race into the forest; others are frozen
Tuvia grabs people and bodily drags them to cover
20MM  chew up the ground
Several people are hit before they can reach cover
Lilka herds everyone she can into: 145   145 where people crowd in like sardines
Chaya and Riva gather children around them
They hear the  of an incoming shell
Dirt from the roof rains down on them
146      146 Dirt and debris everywhere

Its branches burst into flame
An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is

148      -       148 It explodes into a million pieces
Wood shrapnel everywhere
Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater
Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded
He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus to be replaced by a high-pitched hum
149 '    - 149 Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers -- a surreal effect
150    --       150 Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and gathers his courage --  through danger to his side

Don't try to fight
Just slow them down
Then join us
Asael nods
No need for more words
They embrace fiercely
Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia
Take her
She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment
Come
He forces her to join him and catch up to the others
154   154 is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle
The defenders check their weapons with grim efficiency
They are no longer inept innocents; they have become warriors

Then Levine is hit
Miriam pushes him out of the way and She expertly kills several assault troops who appear out of the woods
The rest of the attackers
159     159 Malbin waits anxiously for Tuvia, clutching a map
(struggling to control his panic) This swamp here

Show me
160     160 Lazar runs from tree to tree, keeping up a steady stream of fire
He is surprisingly brave
Until   flies out of the woods and lands at his feet, killing him instantly

Asael is suddenly in jeopardy
Sara sees the danger
Miriam keeps their  pinned down as the two men race for new positions
Then she is hit
She keeps firing anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is dying
More troops begin firing from their flank
Asael has no choice but to break off
They race into the woods

If he waits for Asael, he risks them all being caught
Suddenly it all falls apart
Tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight
Tuvia--
Tuvia can't speak
He has no more answers
Nothing to say

Who are we doing this for
With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail but his matches are wet
He reaches into his pocket for more
Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to his family's door
As he stares at it, the  of the approaching tank grows louder

167     167 empties at last into a shallow river
On the opposite bank is dry land, and beyond, the deep forest
And safety
The bedraggled group makes their way across

169     169 Asael pulls people up onto dry ground
They lie there, freezing and exhausted
Some cannot control their shivering
What's next
Sinai
Tuvia can't help but laugh
Soon they are all laughing
It ripples throughout the group
Joyous
Contagious
An overwhelming feeling of relief
They are safe
Tuvia lies on the ground
All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body
Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve
Shimon is asking for him
Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed
Malbin is weeping quietly
Who will he argue with
(a whisper) Tuvia
Right here
Shimon is at the end
Something
to say
Shhhh
no
please
(finding the strength) almost lost
my faith
but you
were sent
by God
to save us
Ridiculous
know
But just
in case thank
and  thank you
He closes his eyes
It's too much for Tuvia
Hard as he tries, he cannot stop the tears from filling his eyes

170  --    170 Trees begin to   -- as if pushed by a dinosaur
emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away
The menacing gun turning in their direction
171
171 The first round  among them
Several are killed
Back to the river
He pushes people down
They cling to the banks, cowering
take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench
They   -- old men, young women, even some children
172       172 behind the tank, using it as protection
Aron kills one
But the Germans are well-trained
They direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep their heads below the embankment
It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round , sending up a huge geyser of water
But the next round    , tearing a huge chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade
grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades
He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank
Asael provides covering fire
So do Lilka, Chaya and the women alongside the men
stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest
He pulls Malbin down just as      approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun

172 : 172 Tuvia   behind them, spraying them with his submachine gun
He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect
But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia
Its machine gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take cover
Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the tank
It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is cut down

173        173 Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover
It is only a matter of moments before he is dead
Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the run
Without regard for his own life, Zus charges
The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly
Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun from the open hatch
Jumps onto the tank and inside
An  of
Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke
He sees Tuvia who is staring back at him
174    -      174 Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German assault machine gun
Only weapons and ammunition
Spread the word
Tuvia hands him the machine gun
Anything else
Tuvia looks at him
Is he fucking with him
Just a little
Go on
Lilka is carrying a small child
(') Lilka, please help
We've got to get the injured into the forest
What about the dead
Everybody gather your things
We have to get out of the open
Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it to Zus
Bella approaches
Zus embraces her
Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles
He yells to Shulman
(') Shulman
Weapons only
Tell them

174 : 174 Shulman follows Tuvia's order
(') (throwing the weapon) You've been promoted
Congratulations
Tuvia turns, sees Bella with Zus
They see him
Zus hands Bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches
(') Where is the rest of your unit
Good question
You are going back
No
They look at each other
So much unsaid
No time to say it
We've got to build a new camp
Zus nods
Perhaps you have room for one more

174 : (2) 174 Tuvia reaches out his arms and they embrace fiercely
175     -  175 They walk in silence
Lilka comes to walk beside him, resting her head on his shoulder as they walk
Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its beauty for the first time
Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled
Don't you hear it
What
Nothing
Isn't it beautiful
We  on Tuvia
He has aged ten years in one
() Revision - 7-18-07 110
175 : 175 But for now he allows himself a brief moment of satisfaction
We might even see the ghost of a smile
But it is short- lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern once again clouding his face
Another problem to attend to
And as       he is already hurrying to catch up with the others
As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness of the woods, these words appear on screen: ,  ,

Here is money

So much more
Take it, please
No, no
Indeed, when the  speaks, though the voice is older and somewhat frail, we recognize it as Tuvia's
What else can  give you, do for you
Nothing, it isn't necessary
Tears stream down the elderly man's cheeks
We are alive because of you

His children
So many
Thousands

Please, the traffic
Bless you, Tuvia Bielski
May the Lord bless you and keep you all the days of your life

That wasn't a man
That was an angel
