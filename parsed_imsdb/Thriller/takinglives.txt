Nervously tugs an earlobe

Sir, may  have a ticket to Montreal please
Pardon

Montreal
Yes, sir
Please
Forty-three dollars
Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties and carefully counts out three
The Cashier gives Martin his ticket and change

My mom saw everything and still took his side
You got cracked good
hate that guy
Two hundred pounds of worthless grease
Why'd he hit you
wrecked his sixty-five Mustang and his boat in the same week
His babies
totaled them
would have popped you too
It was worth it
But  didn't deserve the tour in hell
Dan rubs his close-cropped hair
Don't ever go to military school if you can help it
It sucks

Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron
The pickup gets closer, a big one
Heavy with bags of animal feed
Speeding
Martin looking at Dan's back
Martin shoves Dan hard, into the highway
In front of: It plasters Dan
He goes over the hood, the front
Bounces off, spins like a rag doll into a ditch
The pickup has lost control, it rolls
Several times, a heaving mass of steel
The  folds itself around a husky tree
No survivors, that's clear
He can't believe what he has just done
He takes in the carnage, tugs at his ear

Runs toward a row of restaurants

At mass

You see
The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye
There is something formidable about her

: Inspector, 'm saddened by your loss and touched by loyalty
But let's focus on the matter at hand
He walked right past me
We made eye contact
know he recognized me
It was my son
mother knows these things
will sign anything,  will swear before a judge
And thank you,  do have all my faculties and friends who can vouch for my character
Did you talk to this man, he is a man now

Of course he's a man

He had serious emotional problems

He hands her some forms
Madame
The police department cannot resolve your problem
You need to get permits from the coroner and health and safety department
You pay for an exhumation
You have someone qualified examine the remains
If it is the wrong body, the Forensic Examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us
Then we open an investigation
(a beat) No, Quebec City police will investigate
He is buried there, no
The Woman bristles
Stands, takes the forms
No
Inspector
He is not

In the mountains
Near a roaring river log vacation cabin is being erected by digs a trench
The scoop snags something -- a wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly, hanging from the bucket's steel teeth
The jumps off the huge machine, stares at the headless body he has just dragged from its grave
Workers gather and gawk
Someone call the cops

Two eyes open, reflect moonlight
The  drawing closer

It has been excavated by criminologists, the soil sifted, the grass and brush removed
Grace sits up
Grace holds out her  creds, shielding her eyes from the bright light
It's okay, 'm supposed to be here
The  goes off
Laval and Reynaud
Agent Vanderholt, we requested your help
'm Inspector Laval, this is Inspector Reynaud
Hi
Look, 'm not ready to talk to you guys yet

Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two guarding the site

: Grace lays back down
Sighs
Concentrates on the sounds
The
in the trees
Then: (
)
Would you mind trading one liners somewhere else
need to hear the natural sounds
appreciate it
The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot
Laval gestures for them to walk down the road
She steps out of the grave
Sits by it
Writes some notes
Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive
Grace takes it in for a beat
Then:   , the lonely song of a distant
Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar
Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit
Grace sits by the fire pit
More ,  this time
Grace looks down river,  the glowing eyes of a staring from a clump of trees
The animal stares a beat, then runs off
Grace has the chills
Grace walks quietly toward the trees
Grace just a few feet away
She cautiously moves aside a sapling

- Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone
She stoops, pushes aside brush
She finds a hollow under some roots

Don't shoot, 'm on your team
Reynaud holsters his gun
The men relax
Grace takes Inspector Laval aside
Call who you have to call found his head
Laval
- Gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box
The places the skull on an exam table and begins cleaning it
Grace walks around the headless body
The wetsuit has been removed, the body has been autopsied
Headless, skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved
is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar
He's a cop's cop and all-around nice guy
can't tell you how excited we are to have you here
You only have one victim
Usually there's two or three by the time get called in
This case made page one of the Globe
The tabloids say there is a headhunter on the loose

: (') The Mayor wants closure
That's his vacation house they were building
get calls from supervisors  didn't know  had
You clear the Mayor
We cleared the Mayor
He read the article on you in Newsweek and insisted we fly you up
The papers say two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head
What do you think
don't solve crimes anymore, balance budgets
This was not a heat of the moment killing
And the victim was buried complete with head
The grave was five-foot ten
The victim's height
With square corners
Dug with a shovel the killer had the foresight to bring
Thirty-five detectives searched the area Saturday
My investigators think you're a witch
've been called worse
The Medical Examiner finds two small holes in the skull, waves the  over
Jeez
Look at that, looks like he got ice-picked
She simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on the skull
() 12
: No
large canine did that
Probably an old or sick timber wolf that couldn't hunt
It dug up the body and chewed off the head
It felt safe in the trees, away from the riverbank, away from the other wolves
The Medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate
'd say you're right
(into tape recorder) Postmortem scavenger damage to -1
The Medical Examiner examines the skull's teeth
The victim was afraid of dentists
Bad teeth
Inspectors Laval and Reynaud enter
Both give Grace wary nods
Inspector Laval hands the Medical Examiner a paper bag marked
This was a meter from the skull
At soil level
The Medical Examiner opens the bag
Removes a wig
No, not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp
Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied to two pieces of broomstick
The Photographer  some shots
The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord
Look at this
Grace crosses, grins
Grace studies the cord, noting the intricate knots
Bingo
That's your murder weapon
It might be trash a camper left
() 13
: No
Look at it, braided parachute cord, two pieces of broom stick
You approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might
The more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out
And now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker
That is a theory
That's exactly what it is theory
That evidence supports
When the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won't need me
Inspector
Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages
Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord
Turns to her quietly
Laval and Reynaud are my stars
Very smart, very persistent investigators
On the street; they're magnificent
can see that Director
You're lucky to have them
beat
Go ahead, Director, say what you have to say
You're the expert
If you have any suggestions on how to proceed
Sure
forensic anthropologist can draw the victim's face based on the skull
know someone at Quantico who can do it by tomorrow
() 14
: We have people
Call 'em
Then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago
You have his initials; , inside the wetsuit
The long hair is distinctive, someone may recognize him
It's a semi-long shot
No, that's bread and butter detective work
Thank you
(checks his watch) We should get upstairs
They cross to the exit
Director Gillet barks orders in at his two-star Inspectors

Twenty-four Hour News  a
Six  man the phones

Grace sits next to Gillet
#1 You found the skull
Incredible
had a case once where wild dogs had removed remains
#2 So  can tell my people there isn't a headhunter running around the wilds of Quebec
No headhunters, sir
However, a killer is out there
() 15
: #1 Director Gillet
Do you have the victim identified
No name yet, sir
We have someone from the University recreating his face from the skull
#1 Why, after two years, has nobody reported him missing
He wasn't missed
He had no family, or moved often
He had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman
He spent a lot of time in his kayak
#1 The big question is who killed him
Always is, sir
can give you a rough profile; white male, thirty to thirty-four
Has some college but no degree
Neat in appearance
At least six feet tall
Very intelligent
Charming when necessary
He uses murder as a tool, probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor
He's killed before and will again unless caught
Laval and Reynaud write furiously
Gillet is impressed
As are the Councilmen
#1 We really appreciate the sending you
When can we expect your report
couple days, sir

Inspectors Laval and Reynaud cross, Laval shows her an artist's sketch of the victim

Shame
Good-looking guy
This is more than we had
Thank you
Laval has declared peace
Grace smiles
Reynaud still keeps his distance

Grace enters and finds her luggage waiting
She loves the room
Antiques, art
Grace finds a bottle of wine and a note from Gillet

You're an awesome investigator, Inspector
Run his name on every database you can

Grace hangs up
Makes notes on the sketch
Slips it into a picture frame
- Grace, Reynaud and Laval look through a haystack of computer printouts for needles of information
Grace stretches
Grabs a donut from a box
Offers the box to Laval
Fruit of the Gods
You know you want one
Laval gives in, takes a plain cake
She offers donuts to Reynaud
He rubs his eyes, shoves aside papers, quietly to Laval: (subtitled French) Let's take her down the street will not eat one of those hockey pucks
Let's go down the street
Very good food
We are inviting you
Please
Grace grabs her jacket and an armful of reports
- Locals only
The Inspector's favorite spot, they are like family here
Grace, Laval and Reynaud at a table in back
Covered with reports and plates
Grace stops reading
Tosses aside a printout
Mr
Kohler has been dead two years
No doubt about that
Right
() 18
: Very solid time of death
Two years ago
So before he died he got his paychecks, paid his taxes
Patronized sporting goods stores
And had long spending gaps where he was enjoying the great outdoors
That pattern continues a year after his death
He gets some paychecks
Rents an apartment
Buys a three thousand dollar kayak
Pays his taxes
Dead and buried and still paying his taxes
Then everything stops
Last Visa charge was to Travelocity for a plane ticket to Mexico city
Dead men don't pay their bills
It's identity theft
This isn't someone renting limos and fancy dinners on someone else's credit
Lifestyle and habits don't change
Computer error
Too many independent systems
(beat) We work organized crime sometimes, maybe a hit man wanted to lay low
He assumed the life of a civilian until things cooled off
You really think a gangster is going to break his stride and become a long hair groovy river guide
Inspector, this guy's whole life has been stolen
Someone killed him and became him
Down to profession and taste in clothing
Laval and Reynaud trade looks

Cracks the door
It's Inspector Laval
You are a heavy sleeper

Attacked from behind
Asphyxiated with a nylon cord with handles

Want to get those
The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs
Where is it
There
Under his car
Grace shines her light under a car
garrote is there, made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord
Holy shit
Has Le Directeur been notified

He has a membership card in his wallet
That's his car
Car keys
Grace looks around the garage
Taking it all in
Getting a feel for the scene
She carefully examines the victim's car with her flashlight
The door has been brushed with black print dust

Maybe
So far he checks out as an art dealer from Winnipeg

Glasses, moppish hair

Costa is sincere, and frightened

Walk to my car
'm unlocking it and  hear a scuffle, a fight
Over by this car  see this guy getting choked from behind and  shouted
What did you shout
'Stop

Then the person doing the choking lets go and pointed a gun at me and ran
'm so stupid
could of been shot
called the police gave him  until the paramedics came
You touched him
Of course
was giving him
You removed the Garrote
The thing around his neck
Yes
took it off, it was choking him
Did you see where the attacker went
Away from me
What kind of gun did he have
(frustrated) The kind that puts really big holes in people
Was it black
Was it silver
() 22
: Black
Okay, see
am getting information
He had a large black handgun
Listen to me

You want to draw a picture

How could you see his face in the dark

Costa realizing he is under suspicion
He leans forward, looks Inspector Laval in the eye
did not do this
saw two guys fighting and should of ran the other way but  didn't
(as if to a child) You need to find the person who killed this man
(in French) You need to find the guy who did this
'  - Grace doesn't like the turn
You need to confirm he's a suspect or clear him and kick-start a manhunt based on Costa's
If he is a legit witness, he'll get heated up and start forgetting details
think there's a way to clear him without pissing him off
May
Please

Laval exits the room, shutting the door behind them hands Director Gillet a cup of coffee and a new dress shirt wrapped in plastic

Can you get any of his school transcripts
Sure
It's all on-line
Grace takes an evidence bag containing the garrote from the latest crime scene
She drops it in her computer bag
Grabs a case file
Call the Winnipeg Police and have them fax or e-mail his driver's license photo
Grace crosses, opens the door, enters

Sets her bag on the floor
The case file on the desk

Sorry

Agent Vanderholt

She slides typing paper and a pencil over to Costa
Thank you
He had these real intense eyes

: Costa about to start drawing
Hold on
Before you do that, need some personal information from you
Can you write down the name of the elementary school you attended
And your elementary school teachers, as many as you can remember
Costa looking at Grace a beat
Are you kidding me
Lady,  saw someone get killed tonight and you're asking me about grade school
apologize,  know it's random, but it's the best way you can help me
don't remember any of that
Please, Mr
Costa
You'd be surprised

Costa looking at Grace, realizes it's a mind game
told the other guy, 'll tell you

Grace
saw who did this and  can show you what he looks like and you can go catch him
Costa is unambiguously sincere
Grace's attitude softens a bit
She tucks the garrote back in her bag
Go ahead and draw the face of the man you saw
Costa draws a simple smiley face
He shows her
We'll get an artist to help you
can draw him, thank you

Costa begins drawing in earnest

He'll want to know what we know

Can you remember any of your grade school teachers
He remembered three
Rookie crosses with a photo, hands it to Laval
Here's his provincial driver's license photo

It is definitely Costa beat

Just to make sure his  isn't in the victim's car or anything weird

(in French) Put a number and seal on that case
Reynaud  pictures of the guitar case
Grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can tell her
Bonding with the space
She smells a pillow
Thinking
Ever see a Hermit crab
No
It's a crab that lives in the shells of dead sea snails
Yes, yes
They have one big claw and curl up tight
Laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his jacket
Begins prying off a door molding
Grace sits at the kitchen table
When they outgrow an old shell, they search for a new empty shell, crawl up to it and quickly switch

: (') They live in these beautiful shells because they have these soft ugly bodies
They couldn't survive without the shells
Neither can the guy we're after
Laval exposes several   and - hidden under the molding

exits the 24 Hour Gym, gets in his car
: The Director, Grace, Reynaud and Laval watch the video on the
Director Gillet turns it off
He is not in a good mood and that has Laval and Reynaud on edge
We could have had him this morning
Director, please
We are getting close
The hairs recovered from the apartment match the hairs recovered at the crime scene on Ford's body
We found hours of video like that of the victim
He has been following him, filming him for weeks
He tapped his phone and has recordings of Ford's calls
Even a  with copies of Mr
Ford's -mail folders
With that much detail, you could become anyone
So he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy
More like a kind of camouflage
What's his real name
() 34
: We know what he looks like, we have his fingerprints, we know what he had for breakfast
But his name eludes us still
(angry) Find it, Laval
Find him
Yes, sir
Laval and Reynaud quickly exit
Grace stays
- Director Gillet and Grace walk down the hall
They're working really hard
know
Someone died last night because the asshole we're after isn't in custody
It's happened to me before and 'm sure it will happen again
It's a pretty miserable feeling
haven't felt it in a long time
(a beat) Dinner
Thank you
promised the boys 'd hang out tonight
'm sorry
- Grace, Reynaud and Laval have mussels and beer
Laval watches the , a little melancholy
'm fair and  keep my promises
My informants trust me
have eyes on the trains, on the buses
If they see him, they will tell me
() 35

Why do you trust junkies

Grace speaks French
Reynaud
As does Laval
Very nice
You like to play games
Grace smiles
Mr
Ford worked as a cruise-ship musician
He would walk around and play his guitar on the decks at night
Life is pretty cold sometimes
Man's just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered
He targeted Mr
Ford the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in Aruba
Only the new improved Mr
Ford was going to meet he ship
Think he has a plan
() 36
: doubt it
He's been so meticulous and effective in the past,  bet he's never needed one
We can assume he has all sorts of fake IDs and passports
Disguises
But that's not enough for him, he has to be someone else
He gets off impersonating people
And he knows his current persona is compromised
Laval and Reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at her
What
You're always thinking
Save something for tomorrow
We have three boxes of evidence to go through
Pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss
My papa dropped dead of a heart attack in front of a drill press at work
Not me
Grace understands
Laval  her beer, Reynaud too
'm dropping by Costa's,  still have a couple questions
(off Laval's look) can't turn it off
- warm night, people are out
,
Some argue politics
Grace approaches the gallery, keeping a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside
- '  -  () John Costa shares some Merlot with a statuesque She's laughing, flirting
Costa is making her laugh

- Grace quickly crosses to the entrance
- '  - An   joins them, the woman is his arm candy
Costa shakes his hand
The Older Man and the Elegant Woman exit
- Grace enters
Costa sees her, , genuinely glad to see her
And that throws Grace a beat
She really likes his smile
Mr
Costa
You caught me
Not yet
Grace looks over the art
Toussant Jean Bernard
met him in Haiti last year
Very troubled life
Outlived all his children
And he had ten
He lost his wife to cancer and went blind
Passed away last year
Overpriced folk art
Is it the work of a soul that has suffered
Sure
Are his explorations as an artist groundbreaking
No
Ouch
And  was going to send you two and charge them to your Amex
couldn't afford it
Costa is looking at her, looking through her
What about Daddy's Amex
've sold quite a bit of art to poor little rich girls like you
() 38
: Grace grows tense
Excuse me
Try the wine
'm partial to beer
And  don't have long
came by to thank you for your help
And  apologize if you were detained
You did the right thing
Trying to save him
Why, thank you
Agent Vanderholt
(gives her a card) 'm having a show Friday
You should come by and meet some good people
Who knows
Where'd you learn
Medical school
Before  dropped out
had a moment of clarity: in anatomy class  realized 'd rather draw bodies than cut them up
And when  realized  couldn't make art,  decided to sell it
Some journey
It's taken me all over the world
About Monday again, did you see Mr
Ford fighting back
At first  thought  was interrupting something, you know
No,  don't
thought they were hugging
Then the gun came out when he saw me
() 39
: guess that's it
Thanks
Grace hands him a card
If you remember any details or need anything
(off his look) Anything related to the case, please call me
Okay
Think about Friday
Please, Grace
Grace will; she exits
- Grace has turned the romantic little room into a cave of paperwork
Notes and photos cover the walls
Grace reads a phone bill taped to a lamp
Circles a number that keeps reappearing
-  (6:03
) The place is gearing up for a new day
Grace crosses to where Laval and Reynaud struggle awake with coffee and the morning paper
Grace takes a seat, grabs the sports section
eats a grapefruit
Morning
Can you run this name
She got twenty hang-up calls from Edward's phone
The Young Detective takes a Post-It from Grace and crosses
What happened to that beautiful thumbprint on the orange juice glass, you get an
No hits
He's never been fingerprinted
Shit
Any activity on Edward's accounts
() 40
: Nothing
think he became Edwards a year ago
He was a software engineer
Did everything by the internet, he never met anyone face to face
Grace trades Reynaud for the front page
Why a year ago
Edwards went on a river trip
Kohler was a guide
Grace
Laval tosses her some papers
Those are -mails between Kohler and Edwards discussing the trip one year ago
You connected Edwards and Kohler
Somebody was working all night
couldn't sleep
Our suspect kills Kohler on the river, lives his life a year, kills Edwards and assumes his for a year
Then he stalks Ford, kills him but is interrupted by Costa
Think he's pissed at Costa
Of course
The Young Detective returns with a report, hands it to Grace
Agent Vanderholt, a report came back on the name
-  - Laval drives fast through a neat, modest neighborhood
Grace marveling at the police report
() 41
: She must have sounded like a total fruitcake
This is it
Grace watching Laval
He looks pretty rough this morning
Let me go and be non-threatening
- on the front door
The  from the ferry answers the door
Her name is
She opens the door, smiles warmly at Grace
Hi, please come in
Thank you for coming
-   - Classy decor
Grace sips Earl Grey
Admires the impressive antiques
'm glad they finally sent someone, those hang-up calls have me terrified
They started right after  saw him
(a beat) looked him directly in the eye
There was a moment of mutual recognition
Do you think it's Martin calling and hanging up
It couldn't sound crazier, but who else
Were you ever asked to identify his body
() 42
: The body
Yes, they showed me some remains that had been hit by a pickup truck
The upper body was crushed
There was no face
got physically ill
Mrs
Asher studies Grace

You have some very nice things, Mrs
Asher
Thank you
Some of them have been in my family for several generations
Please call me Rebecca
Grace looking at pictures on the wall of a good-looking, athletic kid
They stop at age fourteen
Is that Martin
No
That's Reese
Martin's older brother
He drowned in a terrible accident
Grace notes a photo of a smiling young  receiving a long distance swimming trophy
'm so sorry, Rebecca
How did he drown
The San Michel River
Martin fell out of their raft and Reese jumped in to save him
() () 43
: (') There was a lot of snowmelt that year
Martin reached the bank
Reese didn't
It was their fourteenth birthday
Their fourteenth birthday
They were twins
Identical twins
You said Reese was older
By three minutes
They were very different boys
To lose one son so young, then to lose the other two years later; to think you've lost him
That must have been devastating
Mrs
Asher lights a cigarette
Crosses to the window, so poised, so tragic
Grace studies her with a critical eye
Reese was very charismatic and outgoing
Martin was introverted
He never thrived like Reese
He was a very disturbed young man
Reese was Martin's world
Martin never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him
He changed
Martin began to intimidate me
He could be very menacing
He began imitating Reese at school and that lead to fights with other students
At sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away few days later the Thunder Bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire
The police want you to sign this so they can exhume the body in Martin's grave and verify identity

Asher takes the paper
'll sign it

Mrs
Asher crosses to the kitchen and answers

Grace, Laval and Reynaud peer inside and
Reynaud looks ill
Hmm
Could be worse after getting run over by a pickup and twenty years in the ground
-  (10  ) The body has been moved to the exam table
Covered with mold the corpse seems to be upholstered with baby blue velvet
The Medical Examiner checks the scale
Bodies get mixed up all the time
Police found the wallet, called the mother and nothing was cross- checked
This was his head
Medical Examiner pulls a plastic bag from the coffin
Slices it open, revealing skull fragments and teeth

She's a machine

He's your killer

They watch: - '  - checking in
- How'd she finagle a room there
She's a very slick woman
() 48
: She didn't have one picture of Martin
Not one
Even cut him out of the old yearbooks
And she had a basement door like a vault
She's hiding something
In the basement of her house
What is it, ten minutes away from here
Her house
beat
Laval looks at Grace, decides he can trust her
If she's under our protection and something happens to her house, her belongings, the department could be liable
There could be a lawsuit
You're right
We should make sure her front door is locked
Laval makes a -turn
- The front door opens
Revealing Grace, and Laval as he pockets a lockpick gun
'll stay outside
Kill him if he's in there
Yeah, 'll get 'em
Grace enters with a flashlight and a pistol
She cautiously clears each room until she is sure she is alone
Grace crosses to the hallway
The little dog is there
Grace tosses it a hamburger patty
Let's be friends
The dog happily attacks its treat as Grace opens the deadbolts on the door the little dog was guarding

- Grace descends
Shining her light around
Old boxes
Furniture
Forgotten things
Dust
Grace is looking for something and she's not sure what
She spots a door chain
She moves some boxes
Finds a leather razor strop hanging next to a small door
Grace's hand undoes the chain
Lifts the latch and opens the door as rusted
'  - Grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight
The room is tiny
Exposed joists overhead
Grace sits on the cold concrete
sleeping bag rolled in the corner
One wall is just chicken wire
Her flashlight beam stabs at the yawning darkness beneath the house
There is a public school desk chair combo
The name neatly carved into it, then scratched out broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner of the house
Grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag
pair of socks, underwear, -shirt neatly folded inside
She rolls it back up
Finds a large jar, picks it up
Very old feces inside, a makeshift toilet
She sets it down
Grace pulls the door shut
And turns off her flashlight
Pitch black
So quiet

Listening to her , to her
So lonely, so frightening

At the art gallery

Did you call the police

- Wooden painting crates everywhere

Costa is distressed
Grace looking at a message typed onto his computer screen

My address book was on the screen when  went out for coffee came back and this was on the screen
How long were you gone
Ten minutes
Maybe
When returned, that was on the screen

:    @ @   1:30
Reynaud takes a picture of the screen
Laval checking the door's lock
Finds no marks
Gives Costa a look
Is this about the strangling
Is that guy after me
Please relax, Mr
Costa
We don't know if there's a connection yet
Is anything missing
No
Everything's here
(a beat) Shit
He took my organizer and my business checkbook
Grace nods for Laval to step outside with her
52
- Grace and Laval
How do we know Costa didn't stage this
For attention or something
He's happy to see you
But the alarm was jumpered
Do you think Costa knows how to jumper an alarm
We should take the computer
Costa who has followed them out, overheard
Don't take the computer
That's my brain
Costa turns to Grace
'm not making this up
Believe me
Grace shrugs, sees an  facing the alley
Should  believe you
Grace crosses to the
Peers into its security camera
Or should  believe this
Believe what you want

Locks the door

Costa stands there looking at Asher's image on the video monitor
Is that the man you saw choking Mr
Ford
Fear flashes across Costa's face
must of walked right past him
Mr
Costa, is that the man you saw kill Mr
Ford in the parking lot
Yes
That's him
That is the man saw murder Todd Ford in the parking lot outside my gym
No doubt
Now will you go catch him, please
Thank you
just needed you to say it
Who is this guy
He's like a Ninja
Sneaking into my office
How dangerous is he
Does he want to kill me
John, no harm will come to you
Listen to me
No harm will come to you
promise
Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to get through these two for starters

Costa turns to them
How many people have you killed
Reynaud shrugs
You will be safe, my friend
We want you to be there tonight
beat, Costa smiles
Realizes she's serious
No
'm not meeting him
Absolutely not
You ever go fishing
The bait always dies
He won't get within fifty feet of you
The second we see him, the cuffs go on
(adamant) Grace, no
- Costa gives Grace a look as Reynaud tapes a microphone to the   he is wearing
What if he shoots me in the head
will take the bullet for you like the Secret Service
Okay, friend
Reynaud is serious
Grace helps Costa with his shirt
You're good
You could move a lot of art if you wanted to
Their eyes meet for a beat
And inspire some too, 'm sure
Right then something very rare happens; Grace blushes

The dance floor  with a
Costa sits at the bar
all around him, jostling to buy drinks
Two busy  sling booze
Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve- wracking
He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger
Staring at the clock

He's nervous, sweat beads his forehead
big , an undercover cop, pours Costa a Scotch
Don't worry
You're doing fine
Could you look any more like a cop

Could  have some water

Grace and Laval watch Costa via the  built into the dash
Costa fits Asher's choice of victims
Travels the World looking for art
Single
No kids or anything
(looking around) Asher's here somewhere
Watching
With all the patience in the world
() 56
: wish  had his patience
He should be a cop
His mother should be punished
Like the owner of pit bulls that attack kids
You got kids
Three
Don't keep them in a cage
-  (2:03 ) Costa looks miserable
Overheating, anxiously nursing his water
He looks around
Then
note sits on the bar top
Right in front of him
Costa looks around
Only sees strange faces
Costa carefully unfolds the note
It reads:   " " - Costa walks down a narrow hallway
Paint peeling Red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling
Approaching the men's room, Costa looks over his shoulder
No one is watching
'  - Costa cautiously pushes open the door
Stepping inside
Dingy tiles
Several stalls
The room seems empty
Costa swallows, bends down
Checks under the stalls
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Then
Something
At the far stall
pair of men's shoes
Black
Polished
Facing the stall door
Waiting
Costa freezes
Backs away as
The stall door slowly swings open foot, a trouser cuff
leg stepping out

Go outside
Costa eyes him

We're calling it off

He rips off the wire, he struggles out of the body armor
Grace and Laval watching
have a life
can't play superhero for you
don't handle stress very well
have an art show to open tomorrow and  don't know what 'm putting on the walls yet
know you have a life
So did the people who have lost theirs
Someone else might die if you do not help us
Every time someone dies it affects forty, fifty lives
Costa looks at her, arms on his hips
Grace, 've been cooperating even drew you a picture
You can't put your responsibility on me
You have a badge, not me
If somebody else dies, and you know you could have done more to stop it, you're going to feel like shit for a very long time, Mr
Costa

That resonates with Costa

It's okay to be scared
Scared
'm off-the-charts terrified

Don't stop living your life
You'll be protected by armed officers twenty-four seven
Until he's caught

Costa is torn, Grace empathizes with him
have a lot of work to do

You'll be okay
Costa looking at Grace
He decides to trust her
'  - Director Gillet leans against a wall, smoking a pipe
Grace, Laval, Reynaud sit on the tired couches
So who was in Asher's grave
Dan Soulsby
He went missing from the Alberta Military Institute two days before the accident
() 59
: 'm sure Soulsby's death was a homicide, Asher saw the opportunity and took it
He became Soulsby and bummed around Seattle for a couple years
Why is Asher after Costa
Why isn't he in Mexico getting a new face
Costa saw him
Costa caught him in the act, caught him being Martin Asher
Seen first by his mother, then by Costa
For the first time he's failed at taking a life, and since we found the apartment, he can't be Edwards
To be seen, to be recognized, is a horrifying thing to Asher
He has no identity and wants it that way
Where is the real Mr
Edwards
Likely dead and buried south of the border somewhere
(beat) South of the American border somewhere
Visa records put Asher, using Kohler's  and Edwards at a Mexican surf resort
Edwards' last charge was sixteen hundred dollars at a 'no questions asked' facelift clinic in Guadalajara
Director Gillet taps out his pipe
Looks at a new, more detailed portrait of Asher
Have you contacted the clinic
Yes
They are also 'no questions answered
' Mr
Kohler suddenly paid off his credit card bills, thanks to money from Edwards
() 60
: Keep's the collection agencies off the trail
How do we flush Mr
Asher
He's focused on Costa
Who fits the profile of Asher's victims
He went on Costa's computer and - mailed copies of Costa's files to an -mail account in Denmark
Constant threat of discovery, Asher will become more disorganized
Laval and Reynaud agree
Okay
My office will arrange a press conference
will tell a room full of correspondents we have a suspect who is dead and murder victims who are alive
And 'll sound like a madman
It does sound crazy
That's what the press likes, sir
-   - Director Gillet stands tall before a podium
Blinded by lights
bouquet of microphones in his face
Beside him is a haunting poster-sized portrait of Martin Asher
Mr
Asher, we know who you really are
We will find you and we will arrest you
You can hide no longer
- Posters advertise
put up barricades and porto-potties
- Two  uncrate and hang paintings
61
Lost in thought
He studies a series of vivid paintings leaning against the wall
He crosses
Changes the order
Steps back
Something isn't right
Mr
Costa, some men in that car have been watching this place all morning
The Carpenters looking out the window
They're protecting the art
Go ahead and hang those
Be very careful
Yessir
Costa hears a
Spins around
Grace and Reynaud have entered
Costa is apprehensive
What now
Grace gives him a reassuring smile
Security is going to be very solid tonight
She waves him out of earshot of the Carpenters
Their faces are close
Grace gets butterflies
Is he going to show up tonight
What do  do, offer him a drink
He won't show
But we want to be here in case he does
Four plainclothes officers will form a perimeter watching the four corners
perimeter, excellent
Yes
And four plainclothes officers will be in here
Mingling
Mingling
don't need four bruisers crashing through my clientele
() 62
: The officers will be very discreet
We won't interfere with your thing
With my thing
Will you be mingling
Sure
If you feel safer
Much safer
- Summerfest, a street festival, is just warming up
It could be Mardi Gras, plastic cups and glowsticks
-  (9:39 ) cutting edge club feel
spins a captivating mellow mix
The gallery is filled   with chit-chat
Inspector Laval and Reynaud study the patrons
(subtitled French) This painting costs more than my house
Reynaud shakes his head
She's stunning and shy about it
She examines a painting
gentle hand touches her back
She turns
It's Costa
He hands her a highball
Thanks
You look a little anxious
(re: her dress) This isn't me
() 63
: It's all you
Grace gives Costa a look
She sips her drink, nods at the painting
'm trying to get into the show, but  mean
What is this
It looks like somebody napalmed the Garden of Eden
Mangos
Ripe mangos hanging on a branch
Now she sees it
Oh
Okay
Why the borders
Almost every painting has one
Was he in prison or something
Costa , impressed by Grace
Most people don't notice
This is from his prison series
He could see a mango grove through his cell window
He made some of the pigments himself
From flowers
From his own blood
What was his crime
He attacked his neighbor with a machete
There was a woman involved
Always is
Grace sips her drink, letting herself relax
She enjoys Costa's company
He had a lot of lovers, didn't he
Dozens
He was a consumer of life's pleasures
() 64
: Now he's dead and you get rich
His children formed a corporation, take ten percent
'm not a buccaneer, Grace
Grace looks at Costa and smiles
What
don't think 've ever met anyone quite like you
You're very sensitive for
An  agent
The   spots Costa and crosses
She lays a hand on Costa's shoulder
He turns and they kiss cheeks
John, it's amazing tonight want to cry, 'm so touched
Grace watches her hand linger on Costa's arm
And is amazed that she feels jealous
She catches Costa's eye
Mr
Costa,  would like to discuss an arrangement for the series
The Elegant Woman
Just a sec, John
She crosses to the Older Man in b

Costa is miffed
What are you doing
She's not writing the checks

: John, it's incredible what you've put together
(aside to Costa) The thing we were talking about the other day, well 'd like to proceed
Hell, 'm sick of making two percent in the market
Dick, they're yours
The Older Man smiles, shakes Costa's hand
The Elegant Woman looking at Grace, arms crossed, enjoys her victory
Grace plays along, stalks off, hiding a grin
- few minutes later Costa finds Grace at the turntables looking through the 's records
Don't you miss wax
You helped me close the biggest sale of the night
What's my cut
What do you want
Grace smiles coyly
don't know
Costa looks at Grace for a long beat
Not sure what her game is, or if he wants to play
Let me know when you do
Excuse me
Costa walks away
Grace ; she didn't want that
-  - Costa takes a leak
He's in a good mood
() 66
: The window above the stalls is open
The noise of the on the sidewalks outside
Costa finishes, washes his hands
Pauses
Smoothes his hair
Costa looks in the mirror and
stares at him from the mirror
No doubt who it is
Asher is wound tight, not at all happy
Put your hands on the wall
Asher jams a gun in Costa's back
Costa is very scared
Feel that
Please be cool with that
don't wanna get hurt
should blow your spine out
My face is everywhere
have to hide in the shadows like a fucking animal because of you
Yessir
apologize for everything you think  may have done
We're moved past sorry
You ruined everything
John, soon to be dead, Costa
Asher's eyes flash
Asher slams Costa's face into the mirror
Costa's nose bleeds
Stop it

Costa hits the deck
Asher spins, aims at Reynaud and

Reynaud drops and rolls out of the line of fire
- Asher bursts from the bathroom, running right over Reynaud, who draws his pistol
Grace pulls a pistol, Laval too

Out of my way
Asher  a ,  it
He shoulders his way through the safety glass
Grace and Laval follow

Asher dives into their midst
Grace plunges in after him
Inspector Laval follows
-  - Costa is stunned, Reynaud checks him for bullet holes
'm okay
From Reynaud's radio: (
) (filtered, subtitled French) Jean, he ran into the damn crowd
Reynaud bolts out of there
- Asher and his pursuers leave a wake of disturbed that Reynaud follows
Asher running
Careening, rolling, bouncing off
He has the tireless power of a soccer player
68
Running
Equally tireless
Locked onto Asher like a missile
Grace is slowly gaining on Asher
Laval behind her
Running
Screaming in his radio
(subtitled French) We're heading East
Form a line at Seychelles

- Police  busy with
clear a path for two
as they coast in, bumpers, blocking the intersection

Gun in his pocket
Elbowing his way through the crowd
Asher
He sees the gauntlet of  and   blocking the intersection ahead
Asher shoves his hand in his pocket

The Uniforms hit the deck
The  ,  and
It's not gunfire

Rivers of sparks
Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought she was dead for a second
Grace looking around for Asher
Laval reaches her
Shit
You see him

More fireworks
Laval gestures for some Uniforms to spread out

Below and beyond is a long rooftop
Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights
huge outdoor dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the St
Lawrence River
-- jump from the far end of the roof
- Laval will go no further
Grace gets a running start, jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls
On her feet again, Grace sprints along the roof
and  overhead
Grace reaches the edge of the roof
Reynaud has caught up with her

The  dominates all sound

He stalks a dancing  who wears a huge bundle of glowing necklaces
Asher snatches necklaces
Disappears into a wall of -- She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher
Grace the back of Asher's head
Grace and Reynaud tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a bonding moment

She reaches out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt
Asher turns
'
Grace shoves him aside and moves on
She  a disturbance up ahead
Grace shoulders her way through the crowd
Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance
They cleave through  to reveal
Two drunk   slug it out
Grace looks around; no Asher
Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the Jocks, hurls him to the ground
Six  swarm in and arrest the two Jocks
Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration
He looks at Grace, they know they've been beaten
-   - to reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an ocean of bodies in motion
Some dude with his shirt off grinds on three
() 71
: It's Asher
His face is an evil green from his mane of pilfered gel glow necklaces
Red plastic cup in hand, Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity
' Dangerous and cold
They track Grace as she moves through the crowd
Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with her
Grace searching the crowd
Scanning faces
Grace passes within feet of Asher
Asher smirks
Now another hottie wants a kiss
Asher complies
- It's late
Costa has a beer, his nose bandaged
finish up questioning
Grace enters, crosses to Costa
She's tense, wound tight
(
) Need a ride home
Costa looks at her
Despite everything, his face shows he is glad to see Grace
-  - Grace drives
Costa in the passenger seat
The night started out great
Everything gelled
Everyone was happy
You helped land a big fish and the feeding frenzy started
Six figure pieces were flying off the wall
(shivers) He said he was going to blow out my spine
was thinking surgery
Six months in bed
Exercise pools
Never walking again
Grace looks at him
Costa is worried
() 72
: He was in my bathroom and none of you could stop him
need to leave town
That might be a good idea
Until then 'll check under your bed for monsters
Costa looks at her
Grace gives him a warm, open stare
would appreciate that very much
(a beat) Can  profile you
read your book
Please, don't
Thirty-something, single white female
Best schools best grades
Discovers adrenaline policing the inner city
(cuts in) John, stop it
Please
Let's shift the conversation from me and my business onto something inbounds
Okay
Are you going to my funeral when Martin Asher cuts my throat
They both know she's been lowballing the threat
We can tell Grace is truly concerned for Costa's welfare
You let him get away
Grace takes that hard
No excuses
'm sorry
meant you in the general sense
(a beat) Can you catch him
() 73
: We got his name
We catch everyone sooner or later
Sooner, please
'  -  (3:33
) Spacious, lofty
Costa and Grace enter
Careful
Costa scoots aside a pile of clothing
The newspapers
Cool art, sketches, images all over the walls
Reminiscent of Grace's hotel room
And a very cool view of downtown
Grace taking everything in
Art books, sketch pads
Piled high on the desk
She looks at the ceiling notes and sketches taped up
Grace laughs to herself
'm sorry
It's a sty
Must be a profiling mother lode
'm done profiling you
got you figured out
failed healer, a failed artist
Grace looking at a drawing on the wall
Costa winces, he didn't want her to notice it
Is that how you see yourself
No
That's you
did it last night
This is how you see me
No
It's how  think you see yourself
() 74
: And how do you see me
Costa licks his lips
That would be out of bounds
Grace looking at him
Costa looking at her
staring match
Costa and Grace try not to laugh
They end up giggling
What was that
don't know
John, games are fun
But head games are dangerous
Then keep your head out of it
beat
Grace shrugs, back to business
The Justice minister is going to relocate you to another city until Mr
Asher is in custody
don't know what your deal is
One second you're so there, then all  get is the badge
apologize if you've been getting the wrong signal
Yeah
Relocate where
Another province
They want you on a flight tomorrow morning
This monster comes into my life and  have to leave
enters
() 75
: My people are in place
Thank you, Sergeant
The Sergeant exits
This is surreal
What do  pack
What you need
Movers can get the rest
need tomorrow morning to finish up my business here
'll let them know
This is goodbye
Neither of them feels very good about it
thought you were going to check under my bed
Grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed, stretching for Costa
Driving him nuts
No monsters
Thank you
Grace holds out her hand
They shake
probably won't see you again until the trial
If there is a trial
Goodbye, then
Costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall
bold move
Now they are eye to eye
Grace kisses Costa for a long beat
Grace breaks the kiss
Holds a finger to her lips; shhh
She turns and exits
The door shuts behind her
Costa is going to miss Grace
76
'  - The next morning
Laval pulls up in  #1, next to the patrol car that has been guarding Costa's apartment
With a wave the  behind the wheel drives off
Laval exits his car
Crosses to Costa's door
Reynaud and Grace have just pulled to the curb a half block away

You spent a lot of time with Costa

He's a good guy
Grace smiles

Asher in the passenger seat
You just shot a cop
Let's go
Go
Costa hits the gas and pulls out
'  - Reynaud slides to a stop
Leaps from the still-moving car and checks his friend Laval
Who is no more
Grace wants to get Asher
You staying or going
'm not leaving
Grace slides behind the wheel
And takes off in the muscular cop car
#1 -  - Costa driving
Scared to death
Asher has the gun in his lap aimed at Costa's face
Asher looks exhausted
Hounded
Asher notes the police radio
() 78
: Jesus, he was a cop
He's dead because of you, because you made the choice
The choice to fuck with me
That, John, was a very bad choice
intersection ahead
Which way
Left, right
Left
Costa makes the turn
It leads to a
You're dead, John Costa
You fucked with the wrong man, shitsmear
Costa is shaking, looks in the rearview
Asher rips the rearview off the windshield
Faster, asshole
'm flooring it
Shut up
Faster
Costa pulls onto the highway, buckles his safety belt
Asher scoffs at the gesture, then does likewise
Give me your wallet
Give it over
Right now
Costa does
Asher looks through it, pockets it
Costa tries to focus on driving
Are you going to kill me
You're goddamn right  am
've been dreaming about it, John
#2 -  - Grace
Sails onto the highway
79
- - Costa's unmarked races northward, out of the city
Grace catching up
#1 -  - Costa gets stuck behind a slow-moving truck
Pass the truck, John
Before blow your head off
God help me
Costa swings out to pass the truck
head-on imminent
The Buick swerves onto the shoulder
Just missing them

The oncoming Buick swerves back onto the asphalt
Overcompensates, now heading right for Grace
Grace , swerves
The cars hit
Grace gets a face full of airbag

Stops in a ditch beat
The Buick's hulk blocking the road
Grace exits the unmarked
Dazed but unhurt
She crosses to the Buick
Three    are in the car
Is everyone okay
They seem alright
#1 Yeah
() 80
: #2 think so
#3 Omigod,  have to call my mom

Then another Grace runs to one of the police cars
They're okay

Grace jumps in the passenger seat
The  looking at her
Let's go

It's always been business
This time is personal
Please be cool
'mon, we don't even know each other
() 81
: Shut up
Art Man
You are stupid or crazy or both
Will you drive faster
'll shoot you in the thigh
Will that get your attention
Costa speeds up
Don't, man
got money
You want money, 'll give you money
got paintings
What do you want
Talk to me, Martin
am not Martin
There is no Martin
Of course
No Martin
What do you want
What's my life worth to you
Nothing
And everything
This is deeper than money
Shut up
Talk is done
Talk is over
Understand that
You are over
Just shut the fuck up
Asher lights a cigarette
sharp turn ahead
Costa speeding up
Okay, please, Martin
Martin
Be cool
Asher aims his pistol at Costa's head
(really pissed) Who the fuck is Martin
Costa sets his brow in determination; he is driving straight at a large tree
Asher
Costa jams his thumb into the release button of Asher's seatbelt
Asher angrily pulls the trigger of his pistol
() 82
: The unmarked car hits the tree
Airbags deploy
Costa's body is slammed by crash forces but stays put
Asher goes over his airbag
Asher's head goes through the windshield
-  - The Cop  it into the mountains
fork in the road
Which way do  turn
Which way's the river
Go to the river
The Cop makes a right
- Oil smoke and steam pour from the unmarked #1
Costa is alive, cut bad
He looks at Asher
Rot in hell, Martin Asher
#1 - '  - Asher's head is stuck through the windshield, his throat cut bad by glass
He's alive
Asher panic-sucks deep breaths
- Costa undoes his safety belt
Grabs the door handle
The door pops open
Costa pulls himself from the wreck
Flames spread under the car
/
#2 -  - They race along a mountain road with a view of the St
Lawrence River below
They can see far up the road, no sign of the unmarked #1
Grace looks behind them, reacts
83
- '  - rises from behind a ridge
#2 -  - (subtitled French) Turn around
- Costa lays by the road
Motionless, he may be hurt bad
#1 is now Martin Asher's funeral pyre
Flames engulf everything
Even the glass is melting
Costa stirs, crawls on his hands and knees, into the road away from the wreck
--
in the unmarked  from the heat
police car arrives
to a stop alongside Costa
Grace leaps from the passenger side
She grabs Costa, helps him into the back
--
More Let's go
-  - The Cop backs up fast
Another tire
Now the tree has caught fire
Grace examines Costa, running her hands over Costa's battered body
Nothing broken
think my hand is broken
() 84
: Grace looks at it
There is no doubt
Don't move, okay
Presses his split scalp
This hurt
God yes
Stop that
You're going to the hospital
You'll be fine
Is he dead
Very dead
Costa relaxes significantly
He realizes Grace is holding him in his arms
So does Grace
It feels good
heading to the crash passes them
- Crime scene tape
form a perimeter
The fire is out
Fire Truck pumps water for a three-man cooling the hot metal
plume of steam rises up the scorched tree trunk
The car is nothing more than blackened sheet metal
Asher has been reduced to a charred torso
- Reynaud sits by himself, his head between his knees
Mourning Laval, dead on a nearby gurney
Director Gillet crosses to him
Lays a comforting hand on Reynaud's shoulder
Reynaud sees who it is, stands crisply, wipes his tears, embarrassed
am sorry, sir
() 85
: Please, Jean
called your wife
'm having someone take you home to her
There is nothing left to do here
Reynaud doesn't want to leave his dead comrade
'm ordering you home
Reynaud acquiesces
Uniform escorts him out of there
Director Gillet crosses to Grace, who was watching him
She sips coffee, an icepack on her ankle
You're really good with people
Gillet shrugs
How's Mr
Costa
He got off light
With a broken wrist and fifty stitches
Lucky man
My luck has run out
Until today have never had to bury a friend
Grace squeezes his arm
'm sorry, Director
Thankfully it's over
We have our man
Asher's  matched the hairs recovered on Ford's body and in the apartment
-   - Costa's scalp is being stitched shut
Costa's wrist is in a splint
She watches the  sew flesh for a beat
Grace enters
Grace smiles warmly at Costa
() 86
: Hey
Hey
(winces) Ouch, Doc
That's not rawhide
'll inject more anesthetic
Grace leans against the wall, smiles
You okay
'm okay
Thank you for rescuing me
Anytime
Do you know where he was taking you
To my grave
He was going to kill me
It's over
(a beat) Let me take you out tonight
Let's have some fun
owe you that
What's fun for you
You want to go to the shooting range or the morgue
Grace is hurt by that
'm sorry
It's going to   take a couple days to depose you   and get a full statement
thought you might enjoy a break   before you have to
know a place
You drive
87
- Ultra mellow
Grace and Costa chill on throw-pillows and tapestries
Persian trip-hop and hookahs
Grace and Costa have melted into a corner where they sip tea
Nobody has been more comfortable
Costa pours beer from a pitcher
'm happy to be alive but it's like this door has been opened don't think  was naive
But everything is different now
You'll fold this experience into your life and be stronger for it
How do you deal with it
All the misery and pain and violence
can stop monsters, John
And because  can,  have to
So is it a calling or a curse
Neither
It's just my job
When  was in med school  saw a guy on a Harley get -boned by a Daihatsu
He was screaming in pain and needed help and  knew what to do,  had all my certs, but  saw all this blood and froze
failed the big test
Bye-bye, med school
Hello, graphic design
Roy Wilson
The man on the Harley
Costa
Sighs
So you knew about that
No wonder you knew what to say to keep me cooperating
() 88
: You're a sharp one, John Costa
You threw me in a tiger cage like a piece of meat
That's right
You were the cheese in the trap
We stopped a monster
That's what matters
Grace is utterly unapologetic
It makes Costa like her even more
- Grace is in manic cleaning mode
She pulls papers off the walls
Shoves a pile of clothing in the closet
Sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket
She opens the door for Costa
He enters
The room is still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy
'm sorry
'm a pig
don't trust anyone who's too organized
Grace puts some   the
Want a beer
Please
She grabs a couple cold ones from the mini-fridge
Which is it, are you a runner or chaser
What's that mean
People like you -- People like me
() 89
: Yeah, people like you
Hardcore
Gung-ho people like you
And you know what  mean
People like you are either runners or chasers
Grace looks at Costa
You are a trip, John Costa
He's not letting her off the hook
She plays along
Okay
guess 'm running and chasing
Costa
'm sorry
didn't know
Growing up  quit speaking after that
didn't say a word for three years
When you're not in the conversation, you get forgotten real quick
So 'd watch people
Study them
The mouth can say anything, but the body doesn't lie
The tilt of the head, the way the hands move
Grace draws closer
Costa watching her mouth
How'd you get your voice back
The day my Uncle died
The truth exploded out of me like a vision
My Uncle and Father had been arguing, there was a gunshot and my father was dead
You are very intense, you know that
remember my Uncle telling me not to say anything
And  didn't
() () 90
: (') made myself forget why
The day he died my voice and my memory came back
screamed for an hour
Very primal
haven't shut up since
Why did your Uncle do it
Land
Great-grandpa owned half of Pennsylvania
My Uncle wanted control and sold it all
All that's left is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture
(sadly) My father's murderer got away with it because  couldn't open my mouth
That's a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eight-year-old girl
Grace blinks, looks at Costa
That's exactly what she needed to hear
Something good game out of it
The dead can't speak
Now 'm their voice
Costa cups her face and kisses her
Grace breaks away, a little hesitant
Something is bothering her
Martin Asher is dead, right
Costa
Can we please forget about him
That's the point
He's dead, so there won't be a trial where you or  would have to admit under oath that we did anything inappropriate
() 91
: We haven't done anything
That's about to change
Grace stands, pulls him off the couch
Begins undressing him
She finds horrible dog-bite scars
Jesus
In college we tried to make my friend's German Shepherd take a bong hit
How mean
Serves you right
Costa pulls Grace to her feet
Grace retreating
Step by step across the room
Costa
Pursuing
Slowly
Determined
The heat
The immediacy building
Costa grabs her
Pushing her
Up against the wall
The phone  to the floor
Grace's eyes widen
Two mouths
Inches apart
Costa's hand reaches up her skirt
Exploring
Grace swallows
His hand reaching into her panties
Grace's eyes looking away
As she grabs his arm
Pulling
Pushing
Wanting
Her mouth
Avoiding his
Their breath mingling
Until
Costa's lips crush down on hers
The kiss devouring
Knocking pictures off the walls
Grace's hands pulling him closer
Costa picks her up
Throws her on the bed
He tears at her blouse
Her white lace bra
Grace's back arching
Her legs wrapping around him
As her eyes flutter open
Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps
Costa stops
Turns
To see what she's looking at
Surprised to see pictures of Asher's victims, the crime scenes
Staring down at them
Costa turns to Grace, whispers
Let them watch
Grace looking deep into Costa's eyes
Nods her head
Costa flips her onto her stomach
92
-  (5:41
) Grace and Costa spoon
Grace stirs
Kisses the back of Costa's head
He's utterly still
- Grace enters, groggy
Turns on the sink
Flips on the light
Grace reacts, stumbles back
She's covered with blood
Grace panics, feels herself for wounds
- Grace shakes Costa
Tears well in her eyes
John
John
Costa stirs
Mmmmm
Morning
He sees the blood
Doesn't really react
My stitches must have ripped
Grace hands him a towel
Presses it against his shoulder
thought you were scared of blood
You better take a shower
-  (4:30
) Mrs
Asher looking at Martin Asher's remains
The charred torso, blackened thighbones
Mrs
Asher reaches for Asher's red swollen face
Please don't touch the remains
() 93
: She gives him a withering look
Nineteen years ago  stood in this same room and your predecessor showed me a washtub full of blood and guts and told me it was my son
will touch anything want, Doctor
'm not going through this a third time
He hands her a pair of rubber gloves
Mrs
Asher them on, she reaches for an eyelid, peels it back
Stares into the clouded eye
Mrs
Asher , quickly withdraws her hand
It's not him
That's not my blood
You people are incredible
The Medical Examiner , thinks she's a kook
'll swab your cheek and test your against the body
Will that do it
Good idea, Doctor
He's smarter than all of you, do you know that
- The Doctor staples Costa's scalp
Is that going to hold
'm not coming back
Grace enters, in a serious mood
What's wrong
That was my boss
'm going back to Quantico tomorrow
Suddenly that seems like the end of the world
Costa looks at her
() 94
: Washington,  has some of the best art in the world
Georgetown would be a great place to open a gallery
Grace realizes what he's saying
Smiles
Staple his mouth too, Doc
Grace's
She exits to take the call

Not her son
You're sure
(
) Lab ran the test twice
That's weird
Was he adopted, switched at birth
(
) Listen for a minute
There was a match
John Costa is Mrs
Asher's biological son
Grace laughs
It's a joke
So John Costa is really Martin Asher
(
) Dear God,  wish  was joking
Grace turns and
() 95
: Costa has been standing there
Listening
He tries to read Grace's expression, worry etching his face
Grace is looking at Costa, her mind racing a million miles an hour
Grace's world crumbles as she puts it together
Are you Martin
Costa gasps
The very thought is painful
Grace, 'm John
Okay
'm John
Costa hoping against hope everything is okay
But it's not okay
Grace has a calamitous expression
Holy shit
Costa takes a step toward her
The street cop motions for Costa to stay back
Costa
- '  - Grace's purse sits on a chair in the exam room
Her pistol visible
-  - Costa takes the gun from her purse, pockets it, along with her  credentials and car keys
Costa backs away from Grace
Costa's physicality transforms from hip art dealer to something much more menacing
The monster Martin Asher
Grace looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared
(:   Costa will now be called
) She screwed it up, didn't she
Who
() 96
: should have cut her throat when saw her on the ferry
That's the least she deserves
Please don't do anything, Grace
It would hurt me so much if  had to hurt you
Good idea
Don't hurt me
Costa shakes his head, his brow set with a grim determination
He turns, enters a stairwell and exits the building
Grace's heart is breaking
Shit
She kicks the wall and gives chase, runs into the stairwell
- Asher gets into Grace's unmarked
And drives away
Grace exits the building, watches him go
Grace has no way to follow
Then
She sees a  talking to a cute  by his patrol car
Police emergency
We need to pursue him
He's a murder suspect
The Cop cocks his head, looks at Grace like she's a nutcase
Grace dials her cell phone
Director Gillet, there's an emergency, can you please tell this officer to cooperate with me
Grace hands the cell phone to the Cop
- patrol car stops in front
Grace leaps out and runs into the building
An Unmarked pulls up
Reynaud jumps out and enters the building
97
-  - Grace running
Reading room numbers
Reynaud appears in the hall
Grace finds the right room
Reynaud joins her, gun drawn
The door is ajar
Grace pushes it open

Mrs
Asher is gone

Asher answers a  at her door
Mrs
Asher Hello, Mother
Asher forces his way inside
Mrs
Asher

- Grace over the shock and harder than steel
Reynaud drives fast
Grace on her cell
No answer
She turns her phone off

Asher sits on her couch
Asher stands
The teeny Doberman walks into the room, sniffs Asher
What happened to Rex
He was a real dog, right, Mom
Rolls up his sleeve, revealing the dog bite scars
() 98
: Don't show me that, Martin
had Rex put down after you ran away
Martin, sit
Asher looks at her defiantly
Mrs
Asher stands, gets in his face
How dare you defy me
You will sit down on that couch and you will do it now
Martin
Asher sits
Mrs
Asher lays a hand on his, leans forward, her eyes intense and earnest
Martin, you have severe emotional problems
know you're in a lot of pain
There's hope and help, Martin
Look at me, Martin love you very much
know now that what you did to me was not love
-   - Asher sitting on the couch
Then stands
'll stand if  want to stand can do anything  want to do
And 've done some great things, Mother
'm not a scared little boy you can push around anymore
Mrs
Asher's head neatly adorns a silver platter
-  - Grace holds on as Reynaud slaloms around a corner in Asher's neighborhood
hope the son of a bitch doesn't shoot me with the gun you gave him
What else did you give Asher
() 99
: An accusing look
Shut up and focus
That kind of shit helps no one right now
- Reynaud's car  to a stop
Police cars take position around the block, forming a perimeter around the house
Grace and Reynaud exit the car
Grace has a shotgun
Four , also with shotguns, join them
The ad hoc entry team runs up the steps, onto the porch
Get right,  got left
Reynaud  the door
Grace is first in
- Grace, Reynaud and the four Uniforms enter
Weapons sweep for targets and clear sectors
Grace moving down the hallway
Slowly, breathing hard
-   - Grace enters, approaching the couch
is there
Grace sidesteps quickly, raises the shotgun
Don't move
It's Mrs
Asher
Sans head, sitting on the couch
Grace turns away,
She sees Mrs
Asher's head
Omigod
Reynaud enters
Sees Mrs
Asher's head
He's gone
Reynaud looks at Grace
Grace feels hollow, miserable
100
- Grace's hotel room is now a crime scene process the scene
The sheets are bagged as evidence
watching this
Reynaud crosses to her
her
My best friend died protecting a serial killer so you could get laid
Very nice
Grace
The cat is out of the bag
That's none of your business
No
It's my case
Back off, Reynaud
Asher fooled you too
At least  didn't fuck him
Grace walks off
Reynaud intercepts her
Touch me again and  will kick your ass
am taking you to the Director
' '  - Gillet sits at her desk across from Grace
His eyes are harder than normal
They're on their way from the airport
Grace nods, chews a nail
Your old life is over
There is no going back
() 101
: know
You're still young
Whatever happens, be strong
(beat) Where is he, Grace
How do we find him
Director, 'm the last person you should be discussing the case with at this point
Grace
You know his mind, and his heart
Where is he
beat
Not here
This city no longer has the psychic gravity to hold him here
Try Mexico, getting a facelift
We 'd the remains in the morgue
The real
He hands her a picture of the man whom we thought was Asher
(reads) Richard Hart
-
'  - Hart rolls painting canvases into a tight cylinder
Inserts it into a fancy lamp
hypodermic stands by to reward his work
(
) He was an addict
And a thief
An art thief
He hits galleries in Europe and North America
Traveled back and forth smuggling and selling stolen canvasses
102
'  -  () Grace puts it together
Let me guess, Costa was selling stolen art for Hart and never gave him the money
Now Hart is just another one of Asher's victims
Director Gillet
Costa owed him eight thousand
Those are -mails off Hart's computer
(reading) Go to hell
won't pay you a dime
'm not scared of you
-
- Richard Hart checks his -mail and nearly has a heart attack
(
) Come and get me
will never pay you, dumbass
(thinks a beat) Asher taunted Hart into a confrontation
Jesus
It was right there in my face
was interpreting behavior from two different suspects
() He had us all fooled, Grace
All of us
If Asher can do that, what else can he do
Anything he wants
Gillet stands, crosses, opens his door
Two enter
Grim, silver-haired
Grace stands
Ah, the undertakers have arrived for my career
() 103
: Grace hugs Gillet
And the  Men escort her out of Gillet's office
- Grace is on the spot
Her  by her side
Facing a panel of seven
Microphones, water pitchers
Have your rights been explained to you and has an indication to that effect been made in your employee record
Yessir
- Grace is exhausted, but holding up well
The questions don't stop
Agent Vanderholt
Why would Asher kill Ford, if nobody knew he was Costa
If he wasn't going to use Ford's identity
He needed a murder he could link not only Richard Hart to but also to his past victims
-
'  - Upscale Euro-hip
Hart  down the phone
Shoves a gun in his belt and exits
(
) Hart's behavior was consistent with a disorganized drug addict following the rules of the criminal road by attempting to kill a debtor who won't pay
He had no idea he was being manipulated by a serial killer
104
'  - Asher enters through the front door
Hart isn't home
'  - Asher steals floss from the garbage can
Takes Hart's toothbrush
Some dirty laundry
(
) Asher wasn't becoming disorganized and decomposing into madness, he was evolving
- Asher, his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood, pulls Todd Ford from the trunk
(
) The Ford murder was staged and missed it
Asher drove Ford's car there with Ford unconscious in the car
Ether maybe,
Something that disappears
Asher works out, heads to the parking lot
Pulls Ford out of the trunk
And strangles him
He left a couple of Hart's hairs on the body
Asher leans over Todd Ford, strangling the unconscious man with the garotte
Asher places a couple of Hart's hairs on the body
- Asher drawing the sketch of who we now know was Hart
Is that a sly grin Asher has
(
) He draws a nice portrait of Mr
Hart and he's now inside the heart of Montreal 's investigation
'  - In the bathroom, Asher, wearing surgical gloves, places Hart's comb in the medicine cabinet
Puts Hart's trash in the wastebasket
() 105
: (
) Evidence at the Ford crime scene led to an apartment with more of Hart's
And evidence linking Hart to Asher's crimes
Hart never set food in that apartment
Asher staged everything
- Grace chasing Hart
(
) Mr
Hart, not Asher, murdered the Montreal Inspector, correct
(
) Yes
Hart thought Costa was systematically destroying his life
Hart's violent explosion was inevitable
(
) How could Asher plan on Hart snapping like that
(
) He couldn't
My guess is Asher intended to kill Hart and make it look like suicide
The authorities would find the body and close the Martin Asher file
-    () Things are wrapping up
This ethics panel has no choice but to recommend terminating you for misconduct
Do you wish to make a statement
Grace shakes her head: no
Please speak up for the record
Grace leans into her mike
No
have nothing to say
106
- Grace does the walk of shame in front of her former She carries a cardboard box full of personal stuff from her office
Two   escort her
- Grace heaves the box into the back of her Audi police car stands by
, her ex-boss intercepts her before she gets in
Grace
This is a bitter loss to the unit
You'll manage
Want some good news
closed their investigation and the Minister isn't indicting you
This could have been a real train wreck for you, Grace
It wasn't
Grace gets in her car
No one has any clue where Asher is
That son of a bitch might fixate on you
Please watch your back, Grace
'll dig a hole and hide in it
Don't fade away, Grace
You're still my friend, okay
Grace pulls out
Heads for the road that will take her out of Quantico
- Grace has the top down
The  snatching papers from her box
Grace doesn't care
107
- Grace watches  in the dark
Drinking a beer
Her
Grace looks at it
Sees    on the caller
She answers
Hello
(
) 'm sorry
'm sorry you lost your job
beat
Grace grabs the big
45 by her thigh
(
) Hello
'm here
(
) miss you
Why don't you come and see me miss you, too
'm at the Gainesville Virginia
The Motel 6 off Highway 29
Stop by
There is a strange tension in her voice
She hangs up
Turns off the
She gets off the bed, crosses to a corner
She sits, settles in for a long vigil
- The rising sun reveals Grace has not moved
She is now realizing Asher isn't going to show
Grace drops the
45 and begins to cry
- Grace exits the clinic reading a test result
She freezes in her tracks, returns inside
- Grace shopping
She has a quarter ton bag of dog food
Gallons of spaghetti sauce
Stocking up
108
- Wintertime
It's an ice storm
Freezing rain accumulates on existing snow and ice
Grace loading her supplies into her truck
It's miserable out and getting worse
Grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding helpless across the ice
It stops just short of hitting a parked car
- Ten minutes later Grace checks her
Box
Finds some baby catalogs
local   enters
Wow, you know the question
Six months
: Grace is very pregnant
That's it
Twins
Good luck, sweetheart
Get yourself home, it's miserable out
Grace smiles, exits
- Old and falling apart
Overgrown with branches
The wind picking up
Grace's truck slowly navigating the ice
The only vehicle around
'  -  - The accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly
Grace drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in low gear
She drives around a fallen tree branch
() 109
: (
) The State Police have said to stay off the road unless it's an absolute emergency
Several of their cruisers have already been damaged
There is ice everywhere
On the way in tonight  saw the snowplow slipping and sliding
Everybody, stay where you are
This is only the beginning
Grace turns  the
Turns on the defroster
Her
Grace
tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her truck
The truck slides across the ice
Grace fights to regain control, to keep it out of the ditch
Grace stops
Gets out
Pulls the branch off the hood
- The last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings
Grace pulls open a large garage door
Assaulted by rain and sleet
She slips on the ice
Regains her feet, finishes opening the door
She gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage
- Restored
Filled with family heirlooms
Another family that has decayed from glory
Grace enters
Dripping wet
She turns  the
Then hangs up her heavy jacket
Bone tired
Grace crosses to the kitchen
-  - Grace takes a Glock from her pocket and sets it on the counter
She pours water into a kettle
() 110
: Puts the kettle on the stove
Turns on the stove
Grace notices water on the kitchen floor
Wait
Wet footprints
Grace
Reaches for the Glock
hand lands on top of her hand
It's
Hi, Grace
He snaps a handcuff around Grace's wrist
Asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down into a chair
She throws a punch
Asher blocks it
Asher yanks on her cuffed arm
Grace slaps him
Asher pulls her into a chair
Grace is now cuffed to the chair
She struggles futilely against the cuffs
Asher catches his breath
Knock it off
You're not going anywhere
Grace stop struggling
Asher looking at her huge belly
'm not going to hurt you
You're so full of shit your eyes turned brown
Asher is happy to see her
They're contacts
You're glowing
Grace looking at him
Still astonished to see him
Her arms behind her back, her belly is so vulnerable
How the fuck did you find me
You told me everything  had to know
() 111
: Get it over with
Just get it over with
Ever since  met you, you're all can think about
had a way of life
And  can't go back to because of you
want you in my life, Grace
Please listen to me, Grace
have a proposal
Asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's licenses
You become her
become him
We are married, see
Asher slides a woman's wedding ring across the table
Already inscribed
We have the babies
We raise them
However you want
just want to be with you
Grace looking at Asher, not sure whether to laugh out loud or start crying
He seems edgy; he needs her decision quick
What happens if  don't want to assume this woman's identity and raise my babies with a serial killer
Grace, don't be morbid
If anyone can deal with this, you can know you felt what  felt
It's real
Answer my question
'll shoot you in the head and burn this place down
Grace reacts
She can respect that
Grace looking at Asher
He's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her
() 112
: You'll do what you have to do can respect that
How do you know it's still real
Maybe it's gone
What we felt
Grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes
Asher leans over to kiss her
Slow, delicate
Asher kneels beside her, the kisses become hungry, desperate
Grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable
God,  missed you so much
Asher leans in to kiss her
Grace head-butts him
Smashes his nose
She drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest
Asher, already on his knees, falls back
Grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair
She shoulders over the kitchen table
There is a holster mounted underneath the table
Grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it
Grace
There is no gun in the holster
Asher looking at her, matter of fact: searched everything
Asher stands, reaches for the Glock on the counter
Grace can't let him get it
She lunges at Asher, collides into his knees, hurting him
Damn you
Asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block
Plunges it into Grace's belly
Grace , looking at the knife embedded in her stomach
beat as Grace and Asher stare at the knife
Grace uses the pause to kick away from Asher
She gets on her feet and runs from the kitchen
113
- Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands cuffed behind her
Running for her life
She runs for the nearby woods
Her shoes through a layer of fresh ice over old snow
Fighting for balance
--
Asher   on her from the house
the ice around her
Grace runs into the woods
Branches sheathed in ice
Smacking her face
Asher exits the house,  -- ---
the ice around Grace
She dives to the ground
She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs from behind to in front
She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she wears
Grace is not pregnant
She pulls the knife out
Grace runs deeper into the woods
Asher running in the woods behind her
The gun in his hand at the ready
Asher is hunting
He intends to kill her
Keep fucking running, Grace, you're only going to die tired
Running
Batting away ice-covered branches
Drenched with sleet
Hypothermic conditions
- Grace emerges from the woods
Running along the icy road
She slips and falls
Cuts her hand on the ice
Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the knife getting slippery
Gaining on her
Grace slips again, scrabbling on the ice, trying to keep moving
slow motion nightmare
Here comes Asher
No mercy
He aims the gun at her face
() 114
: Grace raises her hands to protect her face
Asher
The  intended for Grace's forehead hits the knife --  into the trees
beat
Grace looking at the now-creased knife
Asher's gun is out of rounds
The slide is locked back on an empty chamber
Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife
Slices each shin deeply
Shit
Asher kicks the knife from her hand
Then kicks her in the face
He tries to kick her again but she grabs his leg
Asher slips, hits the ice hard
Grace is on top of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck
Wraps her legs around his body
Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth
His eyes bulge, his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his victims
Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted brain dies
Grace doesn't let go
long death embrace
Finally, when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's body
She checks his pulse
He's dead
Grace stands
The rain falling on her
Ice and moonlight
Grace spits blood, looks around
Looks at Asher's corpse
Better you than me, asshole
Walks back toward the house
Alone
Strong
Whole
