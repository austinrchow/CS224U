Alien Resurrection We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars
Finally she comes into view: the
massive research vessel that sits majestically just beyond Pluto's orbit
We   the side of the ship, and along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two guards standing rigid in front of it
Full armour, powerful shockrifles, expressions empty and cold
Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens
As we move  them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human
Still  around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass encased in a clear, aspic-like gel
Tubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine
As we still , the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can see what might even be a face
Eyes, shut tight
Sleeping
Dreaming
:
birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen
Sharp contrast to what we have seen before
There is a woman wandering through the field
Beside her a girl, seven or eight, in dingey sundress
Both have black, tousled hair
' My mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there are
The girl stops, looks around her
The wheat comes all the up to her chest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see
She looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty yards away
The girl's expression becomes perplexed
She slaps a bug on the back of her neck
Pulls it off and is , wriggling fleshily in  her hand
Her expression becomes even more distraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout
The sound of insects-fills the air
Another bug lands on her, another
She looks down in  growing horror and sees: Blood
At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, a sea of blood now, dark, thick
The girl tries again to scream, raises her arms
She is completely covered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she finally does  they flood into her mouth
: Instruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure
Scientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic
We can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the size of a man, and in a new case
The camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a second one
Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat
: Tiny
dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning into another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving until we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of dark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us
:   Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream it keeps shifting
She opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless
She reaches for her chest and begins scratching
Hard
Tearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides
: And the cause of this dream becomes apparant: : ' being cut open with a lasersaw
We see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it
And her skin is unnaturally blue
But as we  from her chest to her face her identity is unmistakable
Around her are several men in operating masks
Cutting her , a young and enthusiastic scientist
One man, seemingly in charge, stands a bit off, watching
This, by tag on his coat, is
Careful
ready with the amnio
Gediman finishes cutting
Another man steps in with a clamp
Sets it
Pulls apart the chest
There she is
He says it like he's found a lost kitten
He reaches in an pulls out a sleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst
Others work at severing umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest
Here we go
He holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator filled with  amniotic fluid
The alien , its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of his grasp
Watch it
Everybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from him, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio
Someone shuts the top rapidly
Everybody looks at each other for a moment
Well
The host
surgeon looks at Ripley's readings
Doing fine
Gediman looks at Wren, hopefully
Wren nods
Sew her back up
Gediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the alien
Well, that went as well as could be expected-- Ripley's hand  ,  the surgeon's forearm
He yells in pain as her fingers dig into him, the others scramble knocking things over and we
: ' Sudden stillness
Ripley crouches in the middle of a small, dark chamber
She's wide eyed, staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia
Hair tangled and wild
But at least she's not so  blue as before
The only light on her comes from directly above, from a thick pane of glass in the center of the ceiling
: guard stands on the floor above, looking into the cell through the square of glass in  the floor, directly above Ripley
(We see other panes of glass lining the floor, indicating more cells below
) : She is still for a long while
Then she lifts her hands, looking at them
Touches her face, her skin
She fingers her tunic, pulls down the neck
There is a scar running along her chest
She fingers it thoughtfully
- She looks at her forearm
Tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the number 8
She looks up, her face unreadable
': Ripley is sitting on a table as Gediman draws blood from her
He deposits it in a test beaker, studies her eyes
Wren enters, looking at a chart
How's our number Eight today
: Appears to be in good health
(noticing his tone) How good
Extraordinary
As in, completely off our projected charts
(shows him some photos) Look at the scar tissue
See the recession
This is from -- Yesterday
This is good
This is very good
'd like to run some tests: strength, coordination
We're not looking at a normal cloning arc
: Approved
Wren goes up to Ripley, studies her face with satisfaction
Well, it looks like you're going to make us all very proud
She grabs his throat with dazzling speed, applying deadly pressure as she  brings his face to hers
Her eyes are burn but lost
Why
Oh my God
He is as wide eyed as , and he isn't having his windpipe crushed
After a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the alarm
Klaxons, red light fire up
guard rushes in, levels his weapon at Ripley
After a moment of staring him down, she opens her hand
Wren falls to his knees gasping
The guard  his rifle at her -- a powerful electrical charge lashes out and sends her flying back into the corner
No
No
'm all right
The guards keep their weapons -- 'burners', these shockrifles are called -- leveled  at Ripley
She has recovered from the shock quickly, sits crumpled in the corner, looking at nothing in particular
(wearily) Why
: Wren and Gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests Ripley
With them is General , the man in charge this boat
Ramrod straight and about  as gruff as you would expect, he stares at Ripley suspiciously
: The scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them: house, dog, boat
Ripley gives answers we can't hear through the glass, looking pissed off and bored
It's unprecedented
Totally
She's operating at a completely adult capacity
And her memories
There are gaps
And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance
She's freaked
Wren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance
"It" has some connective difficulties
kind of low level emotional autism
Certain reactions
Perez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall
: - The two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second observation room
: But the thing is, we can't terminate her
It
You haven't told me what you think has caused this
Cloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought to adult term
'm right
There's been cases
Not like this
Well, we don't have nearly enough data
but in some cases there is a collective memory passed down generationally
At a genetic level
Like instinct, only  more complex structurally
In some cases
You're talking about the alien
Yes
You promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing
It's not like the other ones
Perez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second observation room door opens
He steps in, the other two right behind him
: Darker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards by the door
Apart from-that, identical
Perez turns to the others
But there is some genetic mix
Yes
Will there be further mutation
Mutation isn't exactly
don't think so
That's one of the things we need to study
All right
You can keep it
But secure, under obsorvation, and for God's sake keep it away from here
don't want any more surprises
And as he speaks the      -- it's big, the ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and  at the back of his head
The reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, stops it
As it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the alien's face
Its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off
Perez turns to look at it with the others
It took a hell of a lot to get us here
No shit
Wren shoots him another look
How soon before this one's ovulating
Days
Is that normal
No way of knowing for sure, but 'd say it's accelerated
(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies
They're coming
Soon
: Ripley sits across from Gediman
He is eating at a good pace - Ripley, however, has stopped
She is staring at her fork, her brows furrowed
Turns it over in her hand, in her mind
"Fork
" The memory comes, and she shakes her head wearily
(softly) Fuck
(pretending to correct her) "Fork
" Ever so slightly, she smiles
The smile fades, and after a moment: How did you
How did we get you
Blood samples from Fiori 16
On ice
Do you remember that place
Does it grow
Does it
Yeah
Rapidly
It's a queen
How did you know that
It'll breed
You'll die
Everyone in the
fucking
(searches for the word, then spits it out)
Company
Will die
Company
(
) Weyland Yutani
He has entered behind her, comes up to the table
Our Ripley's former employers
Terran Growth conglom, had some defense contracts  under the military
Before your time, Gediman -- they went under decades ago, bought out by Walmart
Fortunes of war
(to Ripley) You'll find things have changed a good deal since your time
1 doubt that
We're not flying blind here, you know
This is United Systems military, not some greedy corporation
The potential benefits of this race go way beyond urban pacification
New alloys, new vaccines
there's nothing like this in any world we've seen
You should be very proud
She laughs, bitterly
Oh,  am
And the animal itself is wonderous
They'll be invaluable once we've harnessed them
It's a cancer
You can't teach it tricks
This stops Wren, and he retreats silently
Ripley repeats word to herself, thinking
"Them"
: As Wren is leaving the mess, he is accosted by an ensign
Doctor, General Perez is asking for you
We've been hailed
: We see the Auriga far in the distance Suddenly     , heading for it
small vessel, it is every bit dirty and jerry-rigged as the Auriga is pristine
To accentuate the difference, the sudden roar of its engines is accompanied by ,
: The music is coming from nearby
Piloting the ship toward the Auriga is , a roughskinned woman in her forties, along with , a slight and quiet fellow
Behind them stands , the leader of the group
Has the kind of authority that doesn't need to flaunt itself
Maybe fifty, by the silver in his hair
He speaks into the vidcom (good naturedly) My authorization code is 'fuck you', son
Now open the goddamn bay or General Perez  is gonna do a Wichita stomp on your virgin ass
He switches off
Wichita stomp
guarantee that boy's
Never seen the inside of a woman
(to Hillard) Bring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel
Darlin', it's done
Don't cut thrust till six hundred meters
Give em a little fright
He puts his hand on her shoulder, runs it up along her cheek as he exits
They're more than friends
He moves through a hallway, sticks his head in a cubicle
Christie
St Just
Rise and shine
We're docking
He proceeds into: - It's the largest space in this boat, two stories high
Taking up most of the space are two , big rusty hovering threshers roughly the size of winnebagos
As Elgyn enters, we   to reveal - working atop one of them
She's young, tough -- at home with this  motley bunch despite her youth and prettiness
Call
The music is louder here -- it's blasting from a box in the corner
Elgyn switches it off
Call
What
We're docking
Are the cargo trucks secured
checked 'em an hour ago
don't want em so much as rattled
Any leakage,  take it out of your hide
Trust me, boss
(laughs) Not my style
He leans down, looks under the thresher
Lying on a gurneylike steel dolly, working under the machine, is , chie mechanic
Late forties, in pretty good shape considering he's got no legs
How's it looking
It's never gonna be pretty
but she'll fly
The other one's a total fucking write-off
You'll make it good
Don't be so sure
(calls out) Call
Adjust the generator plugs
(straightening up) They just gotta run, Vriess
They don't gotta run far
He exits
: is up and mostly dressed
He is black, very large, and has distinctly military bearing
He speaks with quiet, don't-fuck-with-me authority
What's our status
We're coming in
Time to enjoy a little of the general's hospitality
Oh great
Army food
("San-Jhoost") is slim, Asian -- and the epitome of cool
Moves quickly and silently, a sly grin playing about lips
He is strapping a contraption to his forearm
It resembles a deringer holder, but a very complex one
: We could use a rest, till the heat's off and Vriess can get those harvesters on their feet
This'll keep us for a couple of days, assuming the natives are friendly
We expecting any trouble
From Perez
doubt it
Still, let's be ever vigilant
: :  working intently, the extremely nasty blades of the thresher inches above his head
'm patched in
Check the sequence timer
(no answer) Call
: hand reaches in toward the  switch
: Call
The thresher    -- a hundred blades and claws spinning at Vriess's head
Vriess wheels out from under the machine in a second flat
Goddamnit
The second he's out he hits a lever and the back of the dolly flies up, transforming it-into a wheelchair
Johner
You son of a whore
jumps down from the machine, laughing
He's thickset, mean and ugly, with ugly scars crisscrossing his ugly bald head
Thought 'd give you a little haircut there
You fuck
Call, who has been over on the other side of the thresher, ably climbs up on it  and switches it off
You should see your face
Vriess, you must have soiled yourself
One of these days 'm gonna kill you
My hand to God
Well, you already gave him your feet
(jumping down) You're a limp fucking scrotum, you know that
Either of you want a piece of me, 'm less than busy
Any time
Vriess
Forget it
He's been sucking down too much homebrew
Don't push me, little Annalee
You hang with us a while, you'll learn 'm not the man with whom to fuck
He exits, full of annoying bravado
That inbred cocksucker
He feels his forehead, comes up with a bit of blood
Realizes how close it was
Call looks up at the thresher
1 hate machines
Well, now we know it works
: As it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship
The bay on the bottom of the Auriga - the doors are actually  the ship, which rises into the airlock
The outer doors close under the ship
Pressurized air shoot into the airlock for a few seconds, and then the inner door opens
the ship rising into the bay
The ship moves slowly along the huge dock to land gently at far end
The top of  the ship is nearly level with a grated platform that runs the length of the bay
Three soldiers in full armour stand rigid on the platform
The hatch atop the ship slowly  opens
One by one the crew files out
Seeing them en masse, we get a clearer view of  what separates them from this Environment
They're not wearing uniforms
They're an  eclectic, fiercely indivualist group, their look varied -- spots of bright color showing  through militarian space gear
Johner's bright tuorquise bowling shirt
Elgy's and St Just's floorlength leather dusters
Even Vriess's chair stands out as he wheels down the platform
What they have in common is the toughness, the wary eyes, leathery skin
The cool readiness to kill
These guys are smugglers
long while ago, you'd have called them pirates All eight of them emerge, one by one, looking around them
They file past the silent, uniformed soldiers
The last one suddenly puts a hand on Johner's jacket, stops him
There is a bulge under it
green sensor light on the back of the soldier's glove turns  red when he touches the bulge
No projectile weaponry is allowed on board the vessel, sir
Johner opens his jacket, shows what he's packing: a large thermos
Moonshine
My own
Much more dangerous
Sorry, sir
(to Perez) What, do you think we're going to hijack the vessel
All eight of us
No,  think one of your asshole crew is going to get drunk and put a bullet through  the hull
we are in space, Elgyn
He enters from the antechamber, motions for the crew to follow him
Vriess comes abreast of the soldier
Wanna check the chair
The soldier makes no response, simply falls in behind Call, the last of them
: The long neck that connects the bay to the body of the ship
The group proceeds down it, the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur
This place is really clean
(to a guard) Hey
You got any whores on this vessel
(the guard remains stonefaced) Any loose women with bad eyesight
think you'll find our accomodations somewhat spartan
Although the cook sets a good-table
: That ain't what 'm hungry for
(to Call) What's the matter
She is looking around her, somewhat tensely
don't like army
Yeah, join the fucking club
: : stack of bills dropped down on a desk, then another
They're green, and identifiably money
But they're square, about the size of cocktail napkins
The face on them is  unfamiliar
Thousand dollar bills
: good sized suite, decorated in a sparse, military fashion
Perez is behind his desk, the money sitting between him and Elgyn
This wasn't easy to come by
Neither was our cargo
You're not pleading poverty, are you
We're well funded
mean the bills
There's not many that still deal in coin
Just the ones that don't like their every transaction recorded
The fringe element
guess that would include you, though, wouldn't it
Drink
Constantly
'm guessing whatever you've got going here wasn't exactly approved by congress
Perez pours two whiskeys
(changing the subject) So where do you go from here
Out by the Handle
We've got a couple of harvesters, we can unload 'em on one of the collectives if Vriess and Call get 'em working
Call
Where'd you find her
She is severely fuckable, isn't she
- And the very devil with a socket wrench
think Vriess somewhat pines
He takes a stack of bill, smells it
He likes the smell
- She is curious about this little transaction
You can hardly blame her, Awfully cloak and  dagger
Perez hands a drink to
This is an army operation
Most army research labs don't have to operate outside regulated space
And they don't call for the kind of cargo we brought
Do you want something, Elgyn
Just bed and board, couple of days worth
If we're not imposing
Not at all
Keep out of the restricted areas, don't start any fights, and mi casa is yours too
Elgyn drinks to that
trust, of course, that you can mind your own business
(smiles) 'm famous for it
They drink
:
- The 'cargo' is rolled down the corridor, armed guards flank it
It is wheeled into: Where Wren and a few others are waiting
Gediman looks a little nervous, not sure this is a good idea
The cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the electric lock
It springs open and the guard slides off a side panel
They are stacked one on the other, five of them in all, cryotubes
People sleeping inside
One by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second unit is wheeled in
By the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in the dark chamber
The scientists meanwhile retire to
with a long glass window looking at the chamber
The last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock behind them
Wren starts pushing buttons
The glass tops of the cryotubes slide open
We see temperature and lifesign gauges begin to change
There is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes lowers, lowers,  and rotates slowly
Stuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs
The ceiling rotates just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers
For a moment nothing happens
One of the sleepers eyes flutter slightly
Opens
All ten eggs open simultaneously
: huge room, used for assemblies and events
It has a chain basketball net set up at one end, crude court lines taped to the floor
Ripley stands beneath the net with a ball, dribbling absently
At the other end are set up tables and folding chairs
The crew of the Betty, sans Elgyn, are filing in to eat here
Johner spies Ripley, smiles
Ooh
Johner comes up to Ripley
Her expression makes it clear how much she enjoys having him in her face
How about a little one on one
She keeps dribbling, says nothing
What do you say
Get away from me
Why should
Because pain hurts
He falters a moment at her quiet threat, then: Are you gonna hurt me then
1 think  might enjoy that
He smiles his ugly smile
She smiles back
She hits, him solidly in the chest -- and he flies back ten feet, landing badly on a group of chairs
His mates fly into action, Christie grabs a standing ashtray
Hillard jumps Ripley from behind
She throws her off with e -- chucks the basketball at her hard enough to pop the air out of it
Christie swings at her and  her right in the face
She arcs back
and right back up, at Christie's throat before he has a chance to react, squeezing, batting away the ashtray just a trickle of blood coming down her nose -- Johner cames at her again and she leaps on him, throws him to the ground, snarling, '
Ripley
Ripley looks up and four guards are pointing burners at her
Wren and Gediman behind them
Call, standing to one side with Vriess, reacts visibly to the name
Everybody is slowly backing off
St Just stands with his hands behind his back, as if concealing something
Call watches in rapt silence
Don't let's have a scene
Ripley lets go of Johner, stands
He
smells imagine he does
(barely breathing) What the fuck are you
She looks down on him - in both senses of the phrase
- Look around at everyone staring at her
She wipes the bit of blood from under her nose, flicks it away
Exits
(to Gediman, amused) Social skills, less than a hundred' percent
: ' The few drops she flicked away sizzle on the floor -- not eating through, but melting  a small patch
:
- large metal box is being wheeled next to an observation pen
Soldiers surround it, weapons at the ready
Not one of them at ease
Wren and Gediman watch intently
What's the status on the Queen
We still haven't detected the origin of the reproductive anomalies
But the egg laying  stage appears to be over
Did we do something wrong
don't know
think we covered everything
But these redundancies
soldier lifts a panel in the pen and then doors to the cage come open automatically
Everyone waits
fullgrown alien suddenly bolts into the pen
The soldier shut it as quickly as humanly possible
Father, check security status, observation pen six
Father, the voice of the ship, replies after a moment in a dulcet, comforting tone
Pen six secure, security systems functional at 100%
Good
Now the others
:
- We see   of people at night: Rane, in, a chamber on the Auriga
Hillard and Elgyn, in a slightly more lush one
Perez, in his quarters
, rolling about the Aurigals engine room, looking it over
Christie, St Just, Call and Johner, all playing poker in the mess hall
:
- sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near emptiness of the room
Gediman alone is in here, writing observations down in a notebook as he watches the pen
Inside are three aliens
Two of them seem to be hibernating, curled up in the corner,  but the third faces the glass, tilting its head and hissing at it
Gediman sits right up close to it, his face just inches away from the beast's
It draws back its lips, opens its mouth
The metallic tongue issues slowly forth, dripping with slime
(softly, fascinated) Is that a distended externus lingua
or are you just happy to see me
The creature hisses
retracts the tongue
Gediman scribbles few notes
Something moves in the dark behind him
Before he can notice, a hand closes on his shoulder
It's Ripley
She steps forward, eyes locked on the cage
Gediman seems only mildly surprised
How did you get in here
Beautiful, aren't they
Yes
Yes they are
've been monitoring their interaction
He points at a audiograph by the wall, blips and waves interrupting the vibrating line, indicating sound
He notices that her hand is still on her shoulder
They communicate
Through ultrasonic soundwaves
Sort of like bats
know
She looks at him
can hear them
(smiling) Amazing
She runs her hand through the back of his hair, gently urging him up off his chair
Ripley
Shhhhh
She pulls him close, kisses him
Lightly at first, then deeply - holding his head with both hands
He responds with surprising warmth, the kiss drawing out, pulling slowly apart
She looks at him, smiles
An alien tongue  out of her mouth, burying itself in his face
:
' As she suddenly awakes, eyes wide, breathing hard
She has been sleeping, we see, in the same position she was before: squatting in the middle of the room
She looks about her, recovering from the nightmare
Her breathing slows
With a somewhat fatalistic look, she settles back to sleep
:    - Christie, Call, St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker game, stacks of bills, peanuts and liquor scattered the table
They are in a tense hand, the pot impressively high
'm in
All right
Raise you two hundred
Oh, fuck you
That's it
'm out
'm fucked
She throws down her cards, takes a swig of Johner's patented moonshine
It tastes horrible
That takes me down, too
Johner
Uh, Uh, fuck it
fold
(to St Just) What do-you got
St Just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck
You'll always wonder
You asshole
Johner, your deal
Deal me out
It's not my night
She tries to stand up, takes a spill over her chair
The others laugh
Jesus, Johner, what do you put in that shit, battery acid
Just for coloring
(producing a small vial) got something that'll take the edge off that
Thanks, 'll walk it off
She stumbles out of the room
Johner shuffles the deck
Bitches should not play with the boys, they will get cleaned out
(dealing) Eight card throwback, fuck your sister and the sevens are wild
: As soon as she is out of sight, Call straightens up, completely sober
She looks around her and takes off toward the restricted areas
She comes to the door and making sure no one is around, star punching in code on the keypad
:
- As Call pads silently down it, looking for one cell
:
'  - The cell door opens silently
Call hesitates a moment, then slips in, shutting the door behind her
Ripley is sleeping, still in the squatting position in the middle of the room
Call approaches
She stares down at Ripley a moment
shadow passes as a guard walks above them, Call tenses till he is gone
Look's back down at Ripley -- still sleeping
Call extends her hand, flexes her wrist
The meanest lookin stilletto you've ever seen extends from out her sleeve
it, gotta be a foot long, and sharp enough to shave with
She lifts back her arm, the better to punch it through Ripley's heart
Ripley shifts slightly
Call stops
: ' Her shirt is open enough to show a good portion of the scar
Call hesitates, staring, realization flooding her face
Well
Call starts, moving back a pace
You gonna kill me or what
There's no point, is there
flick of her wrist and the stilletto whips back up her sleeve
Ripley sits up
It's already out of you
Christ
Is it here
Is it on board
(smiling) You mean my baby don't understand
If they've got it, why are they keeping you alive
Curious
'm the latest thing
Those sick fucks
She raises her arm, the stilletto gliding out again
can make it stop
The pain
this nightmare
That's all  can offer you
Ripley holds her palm up, presses it against the point of the blade
What makes you think  would let you do that
Ripley pushes her hand out - the blade goes
She keeps pushing her hand out slowly, a good five inches of the blade sticking out the back of her hand  before she stops
Call stares at her
What are you
Ripley, Ellen, Lieutenant first class, number 36706
Ellen Ripley died two hundred years ago
Ripley pulls her hand back suddenly, grimacing at the pain
What do you know about it
've read Morse -- 've read all the banned histories
She gave her life to protect us from the beast
You're not her
If 'm not her
What am
You're a thing
construct
They grew you in a fucking lab
But only God can make a tree
And now they've brought the beast out of you
(smiling) Not all the way out
What
It's in my head
Behind my eyes
can hear it moving
The beast
The smile is gone, some real vulnerability showing through
Call softens, trying a different tack
Help me
If there's anything human in you at all, help me stop them before  this thing gets loose
It's already loose
Call's expression changes
Those words terrify her, but she's not sure if Ripley means what she thinks
Ripley raises her hand at Call's head -- Call flinches but Ripley stops a few inches away
Then touches her forehead gently, almost sensually
Once the thought
the hope for it
grows here
it has found its way
It will come, because
man will bring it
Bring it forth
You want that
've come to terms with the fact of it
It's inevitable
Not so long as there's breath-in me
Ripley   and  '
Call swings wit the blade but Ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect
Ripley squeezes the girls neck
Ripley looks at the girl with a world of sadness
can
make it
stop
Call's eyes are pleading, terrified
Ripley finally lets go and she drops to the ground gasping for air Go
They're coming for you
As soon as she can move, Call scrambles up and heads out
:
- Call comes out and before she can move a   hits her the head
She goes down but  not out as two guards grab her
Wren is with them and three more
think you're gonna find that this was ill advised
(to the men) Where are her friends
Mess hall, most of them
Sound the alarm
want them rounded up
Now
:
- : Being kicked over
Elgyn, Hillard and Rane are pushed into the room, sleepy and confused
Christie, St Just, and Johner are all being herded in by soldiers
Call is thrown into the group as well
What the fuck is going on here
Looks like a doublecross, boss
Where's the other one
With the chair
(to a soldier) Get your fucking hands off me
Do you mind telling me what the fuck you're up to
Shut up
(to a guard) Get the general
Wake him up
Look, if there's a problem tell me what it is
We can work this out, there is no  need to get emotional
St Just is silent, standing in the same position he was when Ripley attacked Johner
Hands behind his back
:   ' As Elgyn speaks, two guns
slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands
They got nothing to do with this, Wren
(to Call) To do with what
don't give a fuck
It's way too late for that
You're all looking at a firing squad
You hear me
do
St Just
With lighting precision, St Just raises his hands and blows of the guards away
He takes out a third to his left without even looking that way
One guard gets off a shot with his burner, frying Rane before Hillard's elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat
Christie tackles the next as Johner presses a latch on the bottom of his thermos --  the top half flies off, revealing handle of a gun inside
He grabs it and another  guard runs
Johner doesn't have time to pull the gun-out of the the so he  right through it, sending the guard flying
:
- Alarms, flashing red lights
Gediman looking in a video monitor
What the fuck
You three
Go
Sector two
All but one of the guards rush out to investigate
Gediman works the surveilliance screen, trying to see what's happening :
- When the smoke clears, There are two guards still standing
They point their weapons inneffectually
St Just a has gun to wren's head and a gun on the guards, who are also covered by Johner
Nice and easy, boys
Call starts to take off
'm gonna finish this
Elgyn grabs her by the hair, roughly pulls her back
You're going nowhere, Annalee
:
- : The three aliens have picked up the energy
are stalking back and forth like tigers in the dim light of their pen
: We see Gediman and the guard, their backs to us
The aliens-stop pacing
One of them,  to the right, looks at the one on the left
Something passes between them
They look back at the humans
At each other
They   the middle alien,
It lets out piercing, insectile  as they tear it limb from limb
Gediman spins in terror, the guard bringing up his weapon
Gediman hits the lights inside the pen and as they blink to shocking brightness we see: The remains of the third alien on the ground as a giant pool its blood Oh, God He bolts for the failsafe but it's too late as the blood eats all the way through  - the two aliens  through the hole
just as Gediman hits the button -- freezing gas  fills the chamber but there's nothing to freeze
No no no
He hits another sequence and the door slides open
He rushes in, kneels by the hole and looks down
: Their blood has already eaten through two levels
Christ
They could be anywhere
He looks up at the guard -- and an alien   at him through the hole
It was hanging on the ceiling below and it pulls him through before he can breathe a decent scream
The guard just stares, shaking
: The mexican standoff is getting even more heated
Who gives a shit
We have to get out of here
If Call's got something going here  want to know what it is
You brought her here
Two more guards rush in
Johner shoves' his gun in Wren's mouth
Drop them
'm not fucking with you
(indicating the dead soldiers) Boss, we got bodies here
It doesn't matter what Call's up to, we're all fucked now
have to stop him
If  don't we'll all die
(pulls his mouth away) Elgyn, tell me what you know
If she's alone in this
In what
Johner puts his gun to Call's temple now
Does anyone want me to make this simple
Far away, a
Everyone stops
Wren turns slowly in the direction it came from
No
: technican  screaming just as an alien  on him from behind
The    , frenzied as the scene, to pick up a guard in the next hall firing wildly at the ceiling as an alien dissappears up an airvent
There are three bodies lying dead before us
: We see that the aliens have been freed
Smoke, dead bodies, the plexiglass partition to one 1 cage is cracked and open
:
'  - Ripley sits in the dark, the noise of Chaos just beginning filter in
And she just can't help herself
She is
:
' He is mostly dressed, still shaking off sleep
He stands at the command console, bringing up visual
Everything on the screens is smoke and noise
Ensign
Damage Report
Ensign
Nothing
On one of the screens, an alien is briefly visible
Perez stiffens at the sight of it
He punches up a different sector
The labs, and here is a badly wounded lieutenant
Status
Containment is impossible, sir
think they swept the barracks
(to himself) military strike
Christ Jesus
After a beat, he starts punching in the emergency override codes
:
- It's worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their sleep, and everyone awake is screaming
One soldier runs for the weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and  him into it, falling in a tumble of guns
Over the chaos, the emergency lighting comes on, floor light like an airplane's indicating the nearest exit
Father's voice is excruciatingly calm: Emergency
Initiate evacuation procedures immediately
All hands
This is not a drill
One soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong with two of his friends
They're out of commission, but the alien is hurt only momentarily
It bounds forward, takes out his face
Emergency
Initiate evacuation procedures
- The noise is too far above to be heard down here, but Fathers droning voice and the emergency lighting are on
Vriess wheels slowly into the hall, concerned
He spins slowly, checking out his surroundings
: There is nothing
Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards the exit
Vriess follows their lead, wheeling out
:
- Nothing here either
But Vriess's fur is up -- he moves slowly, carefully
And was that a noise
He looks around, up at the ceiling
drop of alien blood is eating through right above him
It drips down -- and he rolls out of the way just in time, back up as the blood plops to the floor, eating casually through
:
- Men are rushing into one of the lifeboats
They sit facing each other in the tiny vessel  and strap themselves in
Pere is here, hurrying the soldiers in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after
Bay three
Go
The late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch
He hits the eject button and steps back
:
- As the lifeboat  out of the side of the giant craft
:
- Men crowd into this one too -- it's nearly full and an alien suddenly into it
starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are screaming
Perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner, hitting the alien, the men, the controls -- a shower of sparks as the alien-turns, about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade
The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button
:
- The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later
:
- The noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all around the group
Father's voice still urges evacuaticion (to Call) What have you done
Nothing
Not a goddanm thing
You thought you could control it
All right
We make for the Betty
Can he walk
He is pointing at Rane, who nods, standing
Betty's all the way across the ship
Who knows what's in between
(indicating Wren) He does
One of the soldiers steps forward
DiStephano
(to Wren) Sir, we have to go
(to Elgyn) Let him go
No quarrel
You can have him when we're off
Not before
They start out, dragging Wren along
Guns still on Call and the soldiers
What about Vriess
Fuck Vriess
- Vries enters, looking around
He is getting seriously wigged
The lights on the floor still pulse
Urging him forward
He obeys
Something stirs in the rafters
Coiled about the pipes
Vriess stops, still a good thirty feet from the beast
Strains to see
It starts , climbing at him upside down on the pipes
Vriess starts wheeling himself back away but , agonizingly slowly compared to the beast
He turns the corner, spins around
The hall is fifty feet long
At the far end a few soldiers running through
Seal off that sector
soldier runs to obey, working the door controls
No
The soldier sees him, but the fear on the boy's face telegraphs his- decision
Vreiess starts pumping toward the door
He's strong, picking up speed, but the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him
Vriess can't even look back as the thing gains on him
The door begins to come down, the soldier finishing the sequence and running off
Vriess rolls, face set -- the alien a few feet behind, reaching for him An  far away    -- the hall tilted momentarily, Vriess gets a  boost as he rockets downhill, the beast still on him, the door closing, too low for him to clear
He gets there and  a lever, his chair  out to a dolly  position, his head just the closing door as the alien  into it, Vriess spinning out and flying off the chair it tilts, landing in a heap next to him
Lying still on the ground, he listens as the beast slams against the door a few more times, then fades off
Fuck everything
He reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a shotgun
:
5 - Perez is trying to maintain order
He is failing
Grabs a corporal
Muster a squad to search for survivors
Fuck no
Fuck no
Fuck you
Perez slams him to the ground with his fist
An    at him from the ceiling
The soldiers scatter, Perez just leaping out of the way -- Shoot it
Fry it
couple of men fire their burners, to little effect
One soldier runs up to the action
His head is bloodied, his expression vengefully grim
The soldier whips out a pistol, private
issue, he takes a bead on the thing -- And the soldier  -- pumps three bullets into the beast sends it flying back toward the window
Perez is riveted by the sight of: : big ones, hitting the window
Everything seems to move slowly now - the alien,  struggling as the soldier pumps two more bullets into it, the other soldiers, Perez -- the monster falls and the Get out
Everyone
Now
Soldiers are beginning to get it
The window , begins to as the blood is almost through it
Even the soldier who shot the alien has stopped, his face frozen in horror at what he's about to accomplish
Perez shoves him, herds the rest out, looking back -- Clear the sector
at the window, the blood is almost through -- Men are pouring out of the hall -- some move down a side hall and the door shut  behind them, but most are making for the main exit anyway
Warning
Potential hullbreach
Clear sector
The blood eats a hole in the window -- the nearest soldier is sucked back against the  window -- he  as he is sucked through a hole no bigger than his fist
Still men are falling over each other, Perez herding them out
huge  sound, and Perez shuts his eyes
The window explodes outward, the air blowing everything int space
Debris, vehicles, men, all tangled and dead as they blown out into the black
: shut instantly one cutting right through a soldier halfway out
: Gates slam down here as well
: Foam  into them, hardening instantly, sealing the breached sector
Breach contained
Sector five nonfunctional
:
- As the crew moves quickly through
They come to a shut door, red lights along it indicating it's locked
(to DiStephano) Open it
can't
Johner puts his gun to the soldier's head
He can't
The sector's closed
The hull's been breached
Okay, which way
We'll have to go through the holding cells
Here
All right
They turn left, entering - that leads to the holding cells
The room is big, a railing at one end looking over another chamber two flights down
shut door separates the chamber from the cells
Can you get that one open
It comes from the rafters, dropping down on Elgyn in a heartbeat
He barely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back of his skull
Hillard has time
She  as her lover's brains come out his mouth
The beast leaps at the group, scattering them like bowling pins as it claws into one of the guards
Everybody else is scrambling for cover
St Just tries to escape by running past the beast - its tail lashes out, tangling his feet and tripping him up, his head smashing against a pipe
Another guard hits it with the burner -- it shrieks and lands on him
Johner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it
Call has backed to the far wall -- she desperately works the controls to open the door
It starts to rise
Christie
Hillard
Come on
The door rises fully
Ripley stands behind it
Call starts back, not sure what the woman will do
Ripley surveys the scene
The Alien, burrowing its head into the belly of the guard, stops
Looks up
Everyone watches as the two creatures sense each other
ThE alien hisses
rears back
Ripley looks away, contemplative We see a gamut of emotions cross her face, but her posture passive, sacrificial
She does not move
Everyone watches, too afraid to breathe
The alien  at her, leaping across the room in two bounds
It's on her -- and she ,  , and
It lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond, jumps at her, knocks her back into the room, on her, its claws digging into her skin, piston tongue at her face, inches away
She locks an arm around its slick, long head and pulls back we hear its tendons strain, snap
(to a guard) Shoot it
Shoot them both
She grabs his gun and  them both
Two less-than-human fill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart
The beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for Ripley again
Ripley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with inhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head
She dives at it as it comes out from under
Call shoots as Ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as Ripley's momentum sends them over a railing and they    -- the Alien lands with a spine snapping crunch, Ripley only slightly better
few crew members rush to look over the railing
Christie starts down the spiral staircase to that level
Where are you going
The creature rolls back onto Ripley, grabbing her with its dying strength
Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off
its jaws open, dripping shaking
The tongue   and Ripley
scream wells up in her throat
totally animal killshriek that she , victorious, as she   '
She stands, bellows another warrior cry
The crew has gathered near
They watch her, awed, wary
Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to Call
Ripley looks a tad pissed
Call tenses, maybe wishing she hadn't shot Ripley as well
Ripley takes Call's hand, puts the tongue in it
walks on
Call looks at the dripping souvenier
The pincers at the end still twitching
What the  is going on here
What was that thing
Are there more of that thing
(to Call) Make a hell of a necklace
: on the upper level, kneeling by Elgyn's body
No tears, but terribly quiet
What do we do
Same thing we were doing
We get the fuck
What if there's more
Let's stay here and let the army guys deal
Someone will come
mean, where are the fucking army guys
St Just is very calmly looking up at the rafters, guns drawn Doctor
You know what that thing is
do
And there's others
How many
The doctor looks around, almost guiltily
Thirty
Thirty
We are fucked in our pink bottoms if there's thirty of those things
There'll be more
Everyone looks around at her
She is squatting in the corner facing away from them
They'll breed
In a few hours there'll be twice that number
(she stands, approaches them) So who do  have to fuck to get off this boat
You bought your ticket when you killed that thing
welcome aboard
Are you fucking crazy
She doesn't care if we
(fiercely) You got no authority here, Call
- Now secure it
It's the first time Christie has raised his voice, and it has the desired effect
After a silent moment, Call starts again softly
Christie, she's not human
Wren cloned her because she was carrying an alien in her
She could turn -- Nobody cares about your opinion, you bitch, you fucking mole -- She'll turn on us
Just like that
don't give a syphallitic fuck whether you people can get along or not
If we've got a wish to live then we work together, and that includes bug-lady
You can't trust her
don't trust anyone
:
/ - The group is still in the adjoining chamber, but looking here into the cellblock where Ripley had been
DiStephano and St Just come first, guns ready, looking about them
They are followed by Christie and Wren
There's a console in the guards, station
We can punch up a diagnostic of the ship and plan a route
To your ship
That likes me fine
He signals for the others to follow, everyone moving cautiously
: Gently lays her coat over Elgyn's face
Johner looks down a moment
Via con Dios, man
Hillard stands
Call puts ahand on her shoulder but Hillard moves away, a distrustful look on her face
Ripley, bringing up the rear, watches the whole group with a sort of fascinated detatchment
Call looks back at her
Ripley smiles, coldly
: The group makes their way slowly, quietly
They approach a bank of elevators, but Wren points down an adjoining doorway
They are about to go there when the elevator door lights up, indicating arrival
The group backs up, spreads out
Those who can find cover take it
guns drawn
The elevator doors open
It is too dark inside to see: Suddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator and a figure appears in the light
Everyone jolts, about to fire
before they realize it is Who sits in his chair, a shotgun in each hand, eyes wide
twitchier than they
Oh, fuck
vriess
(mock casual) Hey, whatchyou guys doing
Hey, Annalee
Thought you were toast for certain
You've seen that fucking thing
(suspiciously) Where were you
was down by -- what do you mean
was in maintenance, checking out your oxidation systems
Doc's got a bug up his ass 'cause Call's a mole and he thinks we're a conspiracy
(looking at Call) She's a what
mole
fucking spy
Vriess looks hit harder by that information than anyone
We got'a mission here, people
Let's keep moving
They do
:
,  - : hologram of the ship appears above the screen
It looks a solid as the ship itself, except that parts of it occasional break themselves down to show interiors
The group looks it over
Parts of the ship are simply not there, the sections around those holes red
Wren points them out
We've had hull breach by the lifeboats, here on level five, and down -- Jesus, right by the engine room
We're very lucky
(sarcastically) Lucky we
What about the Betty
Our ship
The dock seems to be intact
Then we head for it
Can we track those fucking things
No
We could get to the Betty and they could be all over it
Are you toting a better fucking idea
All of the activity seems'to have been in the aft-sector, by the barracks
There's no reason to suppose they'd move They won't
Everybody looks at her
They're breeding
They've got new bodies to work on
They'll stay close
If they send anybody out, it'll be here
Where the
meat is
'The meat'
Jesus
They're breeding
How long does that take
Hours
Or less
The process has accelerated, something to do with the cloned cells
Faster we get from here to there, the better
With all the devils of hell in between
Well, if we want to make decent time  say we ditch the cripple
(to Vriess) No offense
(giving him the finger) None taken
Nobody's left behind, Johner
Not even you
Her voice is quiet, mourning still thick in it
Nobody backtalks her
So what's our route
'm trying to figure it
we can cut through the labs, but we're blocked on both sides here, 'm not sure Sir
There is the lift
Show me
DiStephano works the console and the hologram splits, the route he's indicating revealed
The lifts
They run straight from the top of the ship down to engineering
No stops, but  if we can get in the shaft, there's a maintenece access tunnel here (points to the center of the shaft) that runs above level one deck
Take us right to the dock
Sounds reasonable
don't have the code for the access tunnel door
can override
(indicating the route) Then we head through the labs, then down to the kitchen
To the bottom of the shaft
Up, through the tunnel, and onto the ship
Home free
: Is unloading additional ammo from inside his chair
He toss one of his shotguns to Hillard
They never check the chair
He pulls out a grenade launcher
It's so compact it's almost cute, cradled one handed like an uzi
Call
She looks around and he tosses it to her
The gesture is not acconmpanied by any show of warmth
Try not to shoot your foot off
You people should know -- We
won't shoot at the windows, Doc
No
The aliens, they bleed molecular acid
That's right,  saw that
So did
We can't shoot them
Fuck that, 'm shooting them
This is a big vessel, and for the most part we should be okay
But if we get anywhere near the outer hull and start strafing them
He indicates the hologram, the sections of the ship missing
Everyone gets it
If we're clear then let's get on it
We'll go by twos -- We're moving
What
The ship is moving
1 can feel it
don't feel shit -- what, do you mean they're piloting this fucking thing
This ship has stealthrun, even if we were moving there's no way she could feel it
She's right
Call is working the computer now
The ship's been going since the attack
It's uh, it's standard,  think
That's right
If the ship takes on any serious damage it autopilots back to homebase
(to Wren, pissed) You were planning to let us know this
forgot
What is homebase
Earth
Oh, God
Oh, you bastard
Earth
'm not going to that fucking slum
If those things get to Earth, It'll be
(not very concerned)
The end
That's not our problem
We've got to blow the ship
We don't have to do anything till we get off it
How long till we get there
Three hours
Almost
Then that's what we got
Let's move
Don't you understand what this means
understand my hide
And  like it on me
Let's go
(to Ripley) What are you called, Ripley
You mind taking point
She moves to the head of the line, and they start
:
- As they progress
Everyone with a gun has it at the ready
Ripley is a few yards in front
She stops, sniffs
Listens
Clear
Johner moves up next to her
You've come up against these things before
Yes
So what did you do
died
He lags behind a bit, thrown
That wasn't really what  wanted to hear
DiStephano points to a door
This way
And Ripley leads them in
:
- As Ripley enters, we can see that this lab has been trashed
Ripley surveys the wreckage calmly, keeps moving
As the others file in, their horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one
Among the debris are three bodies, chests exploded outward
Fuck me
Let's keep moving
The door to the next chamber is ajar
Christie and Vriess in, then St Just, then Ripley
Something  at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar into her side, throwing her off balance
St Just and Christie spin, weapons up, and almost shoot the figure cowering in the corner
Everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him, eyes wild with terror
Get away from me
Drop the rod, man
Do it
Get away
But the energy is out of him
The rod falls with a hollow clatter
He looks weakly from face to face
What's going on
St Just looks at his name, stitched in his coveralls
Purvis
What's going on is that we're getting the fuck off this ghost ship
What ship
Where am
1 was in cryo on the way to Xarem, work crew for the nickel refinery
wake up,  don't understand
saw something
horrible
Look, you come with us
It's dangerous here
Ripley
Cocks her head
Leave him
Fuck you
We're not leaving anyone on this boat
He's carrying
He's what
He's got one
inside him
can smell it
Inside me
What
Shit,  don't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass
It's a bad risk
We can't just leave him
thought you came here to stop them from spreading
(to Wren, torn) Isn't there a process, can't you stop it
We've got no time for that
couldn't do it here
The lab's torn apart
(quietly) could do him
Painless, back of the head
Might be the best way
There's gotta be another way
If we freeze him -- ' --
They all look at him, a bit sheepishly
parasite
foreign element that
Ripley steps in front of the doctor
There's a monster in your stomach
They (indicating the smugglers) hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him (indicatingWren) and he put an alien in you
In a few hours it will punch  its way through your chest and you'll die
Any questions
Purvis is wide-eyed, stunned
After a moment he stammers Who are you
'm the monster's mother
She starts heading out of the chamber
Call turns to the others
He comes with us
We can freeze him on the Betty and get the doctor to remove it later
All right
Since when are you in fucking charge
Since you were born without balls
Ease off, people
(to Purvis, herding him along) Come with us
You might even live
Get twitchy on me and you will be shot
They move out
-:
- still in the same general area, still looking around every corner
It's been too quiet too long, and the group senses that & They move into - It's in bad shape, so we might not recognize it as the chamber the queen was in
She's gone
Who
The Queen
Good
He is loooking into the room
the queen was kept in
residue of slime is all that's left here
Beyond the queen's chamber is another observation room
Wren indicates that they have to go through
Suddenly a burner blast  at them, just missing them as they duck
They hear more blasts, not aimed at them, and screams
(
) Pull back
Pull back
(
) It's on me
Ripley looks up and can just see two aliens making short work of a group of soldiers
Call instantly moves to attack, and Ripley grabs her, holds tight
We've got to help them
Can't
You bitch, let go of me
She does, and Call rises
The noise is gone
What she can see of the soldiers-is parts
She is shaking at the vision when an alien  in front on the soldiers
Call ducks back down, terrified
Christie hisses at her
You want to get yourself killed, then you run solo
How many
At least two
Think they heard us
Yep
Fine by me
Yeah, let 'em come
Wren
Any other way around
Wren shakes his head
We can't just walk in there
(thinking) No
No, but they can
Say again
The cages all have failsafes
Liquid nitrogen
Get 'em to come to us and  can freeze em
Excellent
Get-ready
Wren goes over to the failsafe button
The others look out at the aliens
Okay
(calls out) Hey
Hey, guys
Here, kitty
The aliens react, start for the cage
Four 'of them
They reach the edge of it and stop
Look around, at each other
But go nowhere
They're not coming
Hey
Fresh meat here
They know it's a trap
Oh, bullshit
What do we do
Shoot the fucking things
There's too many, and we don't have the angle
Bait
What
Give em a reason to go in there
Throw somebody in
Fuck you
we want to live
Give em her
She indicates Call, who looks around, nervous at the lack of protest about this idea
Ripley points at Rane
Or the skinny one, it doesn't matter
We can't resist the smell of meat
We
Fuck, 'm with her
Give 'em Annalee
Now hold on You people are insane
Now you're not exactly in the club either, soldier
People start pointing guns at each other
Fuck you all, 'm not dying for you
Stop this
Ripley grabs her
Looks at the others
Come on
Do you want to live or not
(to Call) It won't hurt long
(terrified) Noo
(to Wren) Wren hits the button just as three aliens are bounding across the cage -- they're almost to the posse, people screaming, scrambling, when the freezing gas hits, turning the beasts to statues
The forth one sees this and flees, but St Just stands and put four bullets in it from forty yards
It slumps over
Everyone is silent, stunned
Breathing hard
(realizes) Fear
Ripley nods
That's how they knew it was a trap
They couldn't smell the fear
(looking at Call) So  gave them some
(gleefully) Son of a bitch
He pops up and  at the frozen aliens - - they  into fragments
: Gildihg through space, passing Jupiter's moons with dazzling speed
: Ripley and Call are on point
Ripley looks down the hall
Call is staring at her, and Ripley can feel the girls eyes on her back
(without looking around) Did you think  was going to
feed you to them
think you still might
Ripley smiles
She may be right
want to live
And you don't care about anything else
No
(bitterly) guess you're more human than  thought
Why did you come here
To kill you, remember
(after a beat) Because somebody has to
well it's not me
did my time
Now  just want to
She stops dead, staring at a door
is written on it
Stencilled beneath that is `numbers 1-7`
Ripley stares
Tries the door, which opens
That's not the way
Ripley, we got no time for sightseeing
Ripley is looking down at her arm, at the 8 tattooed on it
She looks at Call
Looks back at wren
Ripley
don't
She enters
:
- She stands a moment, staring, before proceeding through it
Call stands in the doorway, others crowding behind her
Every face registers the horror of what they are seeing, but none more so than Ripley's Numbers one through seven
The first failed efforts to clone Ripley
They are lined up like museum exhibits -- or side show freaks
Here is the fetal Ripley, the fetal alien visible through its translucent chest
In a jar
Here is a prematurely old, diseased Ripley, withered blue skin cling to Collapsed bones
Here is an attempt to separate the alien and grow it without the host - - boneless, bubbling tissue, weak and useless mouth rigored in midmew
Each one more horrifying than the last, and the last the worst of all
Ripley approaches, and stares at number seven
complete mixture of alien and human
tortured, disgusting hybrid, half Ripley, half nightmare
Hooked up wires and machines, it lies on the tilted-table, its head nearly level with Ripley's as she finally approaches it
When it opens its eyes, they are hers
it tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her
Recognises her
Ripley cannot even speak
She begins to shake slightly looking at number seven
Kill
us
Ripley's eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling a mouth
Ripley staggers back a step, shaking now
This is too much to bear
Ripley
Ripley turns, slowly, still in a fever dream
Call cocks the grenade launcher with a loud
Her eyes meet Ripley's
Call tosses it to Ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it Ripley , a grenade chugging to the end of room and  in fire and noise, she  another, tissue and steel exploding into flame, she turns to number seven, hand shakes momentarily
And she , the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame
Freezing gas jets fill the room, extinguishing potential spread, but the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber
She backs out, the crew waiting for her outside
The launcher falls loudly to the ground
Ripley turns to Wren, her face rigid with pain
Wren backs up a step, looking around him for protection that the others have no thought of providing
Ripley
Don't do it
Ripley stops
weariness suffusing her expression
Don't do what
The tension pases
Wren breathes a little sigh of relief
Call  him across the jaw, his head whipping around as collapses to the ground
Call starts down the hall, not even looking at him
Don't do that
Feeling his jaw, Wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this
It's kind of winning
Christie helps him up
Had it coming, Doc
Johner looks in at the burning lab
What's the big deal
Fucking waste of ammo
Let's move before anything comes to check out the noise
Chicks, man
We go down from here
(to Vriess) We got to lose the chair
Vriess
know
Kawlang maneuver, all right
Vriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair
Just like old times
:
- hatch opens
Ripley drops down, surveys the scene
Quiet dark, empty
Ripley comes up, Call behind her
Ripley sniffs, listens
Closes her eyes
After a beat she starts further in and Call motions for others to follow
Slowly, they make their way down the corridor
Ripley, Cal ,Hillard , guns drawn
Bringing up the rear is Christie, toting a shotgun
He turn slowly, alert, and we see that Vriess is strapped to his back facing the other way, also with a shotgun
(to Ripley) That lab
1 can't imagine how that must feel
No
You can't
Ripley looks down
The floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark water
Ripley steps into it, moves up a few paces
The others gingerly follow
Vriess is facing the back
He looks up
The cooling tanks
They must have blown during the trouble
: We see the round underbelly of two huge tanks
There are gaping, twisted holes in them
The nasties couldn't have done it, could they
What for
Down here
He is at the front with Ripley and-Call, where the water is waste deep
He looks down at a stairwell, just the top of the railing visible above the murky water
There's no other way
We're at the bottom of the ship
Some of the worst damage is down here
Most of the sections are sealed off
You're sure
There's the noncom's entrance back there, but it's flooded too, and it's a longer run
He's right
We're gonna have to do it this way
It's just through the kitchen, then up, maybe seventy feet
don't like it
What's to like
(to vriess) You ready to get wet, partner
Oh yeah
You sure about the distance
Yes
No locked doors
It's an open hall
Just keep left when you hit the bottom of the staircase
This sucks
: He flips caps over the barrel of the gun, slides a panel over the digital readout
The burner is ready to go, watertight
(to St Just) You should secure'your weapons
St Just holds up his two guns
These are disposables
They can take it
Disposables
heard about those
How many rounds
Twenty
Split points, give you a good hole even at the smaller caliber
Cool
They're big with hitters
'Cause you throw em away after the job
Nobody likes throwing  away a weapon they're attached to
You know
He smiles at Di Stephano, who looks a little uneasy about the turn the conversation has taken
He joins the others who are getting ready to dive
Do  have to tell everyone to take a deep breath
couple of the guys smile
Christie, do me a favor
When we hit the surface on the other side
no backstroke
Okay
(laughing) You'll be forever blowing bubbles
On three
He counts down, the two suck in enormous breaths -- and dive right behind Call and Ripley
One by one the entire crew slips down into the black water
:
\ - It's all underwater
Visiblity is poor
The crew move swiftly and gracefully down the stairs and into the kitchen
In here it's a tad labyrinthian, and the size of the room it darker
Wren heads straight for the other end
They swim
Safety is a good fifty feet away
They are tense, concentrated
Swimming past dark spaces
Anything could be hiding here
Johner looks about him, very nervous
Dark spaces
He looks behind
Three aliens are right behind him
Panic blows half the air out of his mouth as he swings around and at them, tags one as the other two swim off into shadows with horrible ease
Ripley, all the way to the stairs, sees
She hurries the others past her
They swim frantically for safety, Hillard Wren, Christie and Vriess
Rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness, pull him into it
Hillard  in that direction, Johner bringing up the rear still firing at the third one, wounding it but not scoring killshot
Call is swimming up ther staircase, the growing light above indicating the surface
She is almost to it when she is
net of translucent alien goo, it is spread just six inche below the surface
Call struggles the goo sticking to her she's running out of air -- as Wren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear through it, but they are getting weaker
Ripley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her, aliens close behind
She looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface -- but an  alien  her foot, holding her down
Now  is running out of air  at it, it  lets go
The others are fighting, Call pops her stilletto and cuts through, but it's tough, she  still can't get her head up -- --Di Stephano, off to the side, is drowning
Takes in a huge mouthful of water and begins thrashing
Ripley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut, pulls it apart with a mighty heave, she glides up through -- : ' Just  the surface, she takes in a huge  of air, Ripley goes back under, pulling at the thing as others break the surface
Wren comes up and a hugger  right at him ,but Call nails it in four shots
Christie and Vriess break surface and both begin , back to back, in a circular sweep
They decimate a number of eggs : Ripley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off, its fingers singeing the sides of her face, leaving marks like warpaint
Worse, its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat, thrashing horribly
In utmost disgust, Ripley  it
and the three aliens are - Most of the crew has gotten up out of the water
Christie holding a facehugger inches from his face, others screaming, taking a bead on it
Get it
Kill it
The blood'll burn you
Throw it
He does, and Johner nails it in midflight
Hillard and Johner pull Di Stephano out of the water, but he is not breathing
: Ripley is grabbed by an alien -- and St Just comes up behind her and shoots it
They swim up and away from the spreading, lethal bloodpool
: They come up out of the water, and an alien rises right behind them
Everyone who can, shoots it
It falls back into the water
trap
They set a goddamn ambush
Give me that
He pulls the burner off Di Stephano's body, even as Call is giving him mouth to mouth
Johner flips the gun open and  at the water, the whole thing and sizzling with the electrical charge
we hear an alien wail bubble from below the surface
(grinning feverishly) Okay
Everybody out of the pool
Let's get the fuck
Di Stephano sputters back to life
Ripley picks him up with one hand, (to Wren) Which way
Up here
He takes off, the others following
Up through the lift shaft
He stops at a pair of sliding doors, starts working the panel
Ripley come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt
Company
He's refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens
She herds them into the shaft
:
- It goes down about four stories, and up seemingly forever
Enough room for or three elevators, one of which is two stories below
He starts climbing
It's not that hard -- there are ladders in each shaft section
Call comes up behind him
Ripley and others pair off on other ladders
They climb fast, they're three stories up before the aliens begin on the metal door, it buckles under their might
Move
Not far
Still  -- one alien gets its head in, looks up, hisses, pulls it out
: Wren comes to a cralwspace ledge
He climbs on
Set back a few feet from the shaft is a small maintenance access door
works the keypad beside it as Call climbs up behind him
The aliens  through the door, one of them  across the shaft to grab a pipe on the other side
Instantly four of them are swarming up the walls, moving much faster  on pipes and ridges than the humans on ladders
On one of the aliens a facehugger crawls, constantly moving about on the adult alien's head like a frightened spider
Hurry
It's jammed
Shit
Gun
She hands him her gun and without hesitation he She flies back and   , lands  on an elevator six stories below
Eyes wide and empty
He fires up at Wren, but Wren has punched in the code and slipped through the opening door
Ripley  through the air and grabs the ledge, hauling herself up just in time to see  the door shut
The lock lights turn red
She  against the door, but to no avail
The aliens are getting closer
St Just, the closest to the bottom, suddenly lets go of  the ladder
His knees hooked over a rung, he drops, hangs up side down, his guns  filling his hands
He blows several holes in the nearest alien
Ripley is furious, maybe surprised just how so
Suddenly an alien , it's not three feet away from her and she ,  herself at it and they both go into-space, they hit the wall on the other side, they fall
a pole, it practically tears her arm out of her socket but she holds on, the alien isn't so lucky, it plummets unable to find puchase
We see it fall past  the unmoving body of Call
: As the facehugger  onto it
Pauses
Pushes off a bit, two digits probing Call's nostrils
Sensing no breath, the thing scurries away to find a better host
Another alien is fast approching Christie and Vriess
Vriess frantically tries to reload
It's on us
Christie turns, aims -- Vriess grabs the ladder as Christie , but the alien is too close, it grabs Christie, spurting blood all over him
He , lets go of the ladder Vriess takes the weight of both as Christie fires again, the alien flying off  and down the shaft
We gotta go
The last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers
We're locked in
Fuck
How far to the next door
All the way
Then we climb
They start, moving as fast as they can
(to Christie) You just hang on, man
'll get us there
He starts climbing up, impressively fast considering the burden hanging from his back
(to Ripley) Are they going for reinforcements
Fucked if  know
They climb
And climb, the minutes stretching out, still no door
Ripley easily ahead of the rest
Finally: think  see the door
(exhausted) Great
Vriess is having increasing trouble
Hillard notices him lagging behind, and why
Vriess
Jesus
Vriess is moving very quickly, considering
But the effort is becoming too much
We're coming
Johner scrambles down next to Vriess
he checks the pulse in Christie's neck
Vriess, man
he's dead
Refusing to hear it, Vriess struggles to climb further
We'll get him to medlab
just a little while
Johner looks over at Hillard
Without saying a word, she pull out a good-sized hunting  knife, flicks it open
She slices through the cord holding them together, and Christie's body falls free
Vriess shuts his eyes, feeling it
: There is silence as Christie's body drops down the black abyss Until, from up the shaft next to where he fell, we see two Fuck
Company
Hillard looks up the shaft
How much further
, Too fucking far
Let's G0
They start to climb, but the aliens are making much better time
loud  sounds from the bottom of the shaft
few of them look down
: The aliens are still coming, but suddenly the lift passes them heading up at high speed
They can work the elevators
Is there anything fucking else we should know about them
He's addressing this at Ripley, but she's as puzzled as the rest of them
The lift comes up to them, stops suddenly as emergency brake is flipped
They wait, guns ready
Out of the hatch pops Call, not especially dead
Get on
moment of stunned silence, then they all jump on top of the lift
Call drops back down inside
An alien comes up level with the lift, prepares to jump
St Just shoots the shit out of it
Where are the others
:
- Call flips the brake off, and the lift shoots up
She is holding her jacket closed around  her chest wound, but it doesn't seem to bother her particularly much
: Everybody holds on as the lift flies up the shaft
: Call waits for the signal to stop and an alien   the bottom of the lift
Call yells as it gets its head and an arm through, clawing for her
: We see the other half of the alien clinging to the lift
: Ripley sees the door approaching stop
: Call hits the emergency button and the lift stops halfway in front of the door - - giving both Ripley and Call access
Bu the alien is still grabbing for her -- Ripley pries open the doors again, the crew pouring out into the hall
Ripley follows, jumps down and opens the lift doors The alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs Call's ankle, but Ripley wrenches her free
They roll out but the alien is still fighting, Pulling itself inside the lift
Ripley grabs Hillardl's shotgun
Levels it at the cables holding the lift
The lift , the alien still halfway in
It shoots down the shaft -- picking up the second alien on its way down, neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as-- The lift  into the bottom of the shaft, crushing both the Aliens to jelly
: Johner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft
Eat that, fuckneck
They all breathe hard, exhausted, before they can muster for the next stretch
Call stands with her back to them
Baby, am  glad to see you
thought dickbag took you out for sure
Are you, hurt
'm fine
You got body armour on
Yeah
Come on
Ripley isn't buying
You were Gunshot
saw
'm fine
Ripley spins her around
Call stares at Ripley, sullenly a small trickle of milky white fluid comes from her nostril
Ripley looks down
: ' Wren has indeed made a messy hole here, but where blood and bone should be there is a tangle of synthorganic wiring
To state the obvious: robot
Call's a goddam sythetic
Son of a bitch
Little Annalee's just full of surprises
(quietly) should have known
Couldn't smell this one out
No,  mean
all that crap about being human - there's no one so zealous as a Born Again
(to Call) You're an LM7, aren't you
Is that it
Leave me alone
Her voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by the wounds
The voice is a shade slow, and echoes strangely
Call
(bitterly) Yes
LM7
Shit
That explains a lot
(to Ripley) The latest and best
They were supposed to revitalize the synthetic industy
Instead they buried it
Ripley looks at the girl
They were-too good
Oh yeah
Overrode their own behavioral inhibitors
Didn't feel like being told what to do
The government ordered a recall
Fucking massacre
1 always heard there were a few that got out alive, but man
never thought 'd see one
Johner starts laughing
Oh, Christ
Doing fucking nickel and dime border runs, selling second hand junk to the farm belt
and we're carrying the most expensive piece of contraband in the system
That's rich
(getting anxious) It's great, she's a toaster oven
Can we leave now
Vriess tries to touch Call's wound
Let me see
Call pulls away
Yeah, get your socket wrench, Vriess
Maybe she just needs an oil change
Let's go
They start off again, Johner and St Just bringing up the rear Can't believe  almost fucked the thing
Yeah, like you've never fucked a robot
: Letting DiStephano lead
DiStephano
Where are we
Upper decks
Storage
the chapell's up here, not much else
Can we get to the ship
Well, we're a ways out,of the way, but  think we can get through to the garden
From there, it's down a few levels, it's do-able
What if the fucking doctor gets there first
It's a good point
Shit
They have reached an access door
Debris blocks the way
Another way
Uh, yeah
Through the wall
We'll have to get one of these panels off
It'll take a while
(to Vriess) You got tools
Yeah, but no torch
Fucking blow the door
Assface, We're on the top of this thing
(pointing to the ceiling) That's hull
What about Wren
if he gets in the computer he can really fuck us around
We have to get in too
There's no access console on this level
We'd have to-backtrack
Fuck that
And  don't have the security access that Wren does anyway
Ripley turns to Call
Call
No
can't
Bullshit
She's a damn well talking machine
There's another way
Just tell her to access it on remote
Shit, that's right
Any of the new model droids can access the mainframe
Just by blinking
can't
No time to get coy, Annalee
can't
burned my modem drive
We all did
You can still patch in manually
You know that
Call looks over at the group, staring at her
She knows she doesn't have a choice
There's ports in the chapel
Come on
(to the others) You get started on that wall
:
- @ Ripley and Call enter the small room
Ripley sits in one of the pews, pulls out a bible
it somewhat resembles a Newton Under the leather flap is a screen reading
: Ripley pulls out the cord from the bible's port, holds it up Don't make me do this
Don't make me make you
don't want to go in there
Get over it
It's like
your insides are liquid
It's not real
You can blow the ship
Before it reaches Earth
Kill them all
Just give us time to get out first
That convinces Call
She pulls up her sleeve, and begins
pushes a part of her forearm, just below the crook of her elbow
It has a spring release catch, and a small panel rises up with two computer ports on it
She takes the cable from Ripley and plugs it in
It looks almost like she's mainlining heroin
She cocks her head
Dammit
Anything
Hold on
She reaches in her chest, reconnects some tubes
She twitches then shuts her eyes
It's beginning
She begins speaking very rapidly, eyes still shut
Breach in sector seven sector three sector nine unstable -- engines operating at eighty six percent -forty six minutes until earthdock
Her voice has a slight mechanical quality as she rattles this off
Her eyes open
We burned too much energy --  can't make critical mass
can't blow it
Then crash it
:
- As the crew works at getting the wall panel off,
: Ground level recalibrated
new destination 760, 403
Done
Forty one minutes until impact
Try to clear us a path to the ship

Please wait

handprint
(like herself) It's Wren
He's almost at the Betty
And how do	you feel about that
:
- Wren is holding his hand to the scanner, just as Call described
The red light turns green and we hear the locks the door crack open
Emergency override validated
The door begins to rise
Looking around him, Wren waits to through
The door grinds to a halt, still too low to climb under
The lights go out, only the faintest glow coming from various instrument panels
wren's expression drains
Father, reboot systems on 45V, authorization 'starling'
Nothing happens
Wren looks about him, beginning to sweat
Did the aliens do this
Father, locate power drain, report
Father
- (on the system) Father's dead, asshole
Wren spins in shock at the sound of Call's voice
it,s everywhere around him
She has downloaded her vocal matrix place of Father's
(She's not just speaking over a , she is the
) The door  back-down, locks clack into place
The doors behind him open up, emergency lighting pulsing along toward him
\ Intruder on level one
all aliens please proceed to level one
Wren is freaking
He turns back down the corridor, looking about him wildly
:
- Call pulls the cord out of her port
You got a mean strak
It's done
That should hold the fuck
This as her voice track slips even more
She works the wires in her cheest, trying to fix it
Let me see Don't touch me
Ripley backs off
You must think this is pretty funny
Yes
But 'm finding a lot of things funny lately
And 'm not sure they are
Why do you go on living
How can you stand it
How can you stand
yourself
Ripley shrugs
Not so hard
Not much choice
At least there's part of you that's human
'm just
fuck
Look at me
She looks at the hole in her chest, the white and sticky fibers
'm disgusting
Her voice is at its slowest here, low and eerie
It's a mechanical problem, but it sounds just like despair
Do you dream
we have neural processors that run through
(stops)  Yes
When  sleep,  dream about it
Them
Every night
All around me
in me
used to be afraid to dream, but 'm not anymore
Why
Because no matter how bad the dreams get
when  wake up it's always worse
Purvis enters
guess we're almost there
Right
He exits again
Call finishes fiddling with her internal wiring
We hear her voice slip back to normal as she says: Let's get going
: As they come one by one through the wall
Not far now
God, 'm so tired
Yeah, well, we'll sleep when we're dead
Ripley follows him through
Don't count on it
The rest of them come through and walk into: The Garden runs nearly half a mile straight across, and then down on a terraced slope
Everywhere are different kinds of plants: trees, vegetable plants, exotic and experimental hybrids
Access paths crisscross the beds
It's huge, the single biggest space on the ship
Yet the low ceiling, laticed with grow-lamps now dim in nightcycle, and prodigeous undergrowth make it labyrinthian, almost claustrophobic
From where the crew is, they can barely see where it slopes down
What's this fucking deal
This supplies most of the food for the unit
(holding a lucious ripe pear) You guys got something against spam
And there's some lab work here too
Hybridization
At the other end
Runs down to the by the waste tanks
We can get to the dock from there
You, okay
Ripley is holding her head
She shuts her eyes
What is it
Ripley shakes it off
Nothing
'm okay
She looks out at the jungle, they have to cross
We should get moving
Hey
Check it out
He has come upon a small loading truck, a sort of platform jeep
Vriess checks it out, takes a huge bite of his pear
Beats walking
He hauls himself up-into it
Everybody piles onto the back flatbed just a foot or so off the ground and just big enough to hold everyone but Vriess, Call and Ripley, who pushes into the driver's seat
Quickly and quietly, people
Ripley stares unconprehendingly at the controls for a momen till Call flips on the ignition
Thank,you
The jeep pulls out
It's electric, so it emits just a low hum as she takes it at a good clip toward the other side
The access paths are just a bit wider than the jeep itself, plants rising tall all around them
Ripley concentrates on driving
The pass through as section of wheat , then of corn
As they come to another section, The crew's expressions change to one of pleased disbelief
You gotta be fucking me
St Just
Is this real
So this is what heaven looks like
We see they have driven into a healthy section of  plants growing ten feet high
The car screeches to a halt
Ripley's at a crossroads of sorts
Which way
(looking at the plants) always wondered where the military got its funding
An alien  out of the brush and lands on Hillard everyone -- Ripley  her foot on the pedal The jeep  , as more emerge from the brush
Get it off MeeeaaaaAAGGHRE
It bores into her head before St Just can blow it away
It's head exploding in fragments of bone and sizzling blood as it falls away from the jeep, Hillard's body still clutched in arms
Another leaps out at them, but the jeep is going a good clip and it misses
The crew peppering it with bullets
They look,about them, guns ready
: Something runs parallel to them in the plants
: Two more run on top of the grow-lamps, pacing them as well
One   -- Ripley  out of the way, driving in the plants
They are varied, exotic -- and there are aliens behind half of them
The crew  away all around them Ripley drives a drunkard's path through the brush, avoiding trees that dot the scape
An alien  onto the hood, another grabs the side -- Vries takes out the first, blowing it off, but the second grabs Johner, he goes flying over the side,
dropping his gun
St Just is too preoccupied with his own problems on the othe to see that Johner is being dragged, the alien still clutching onto him
Shots bang out, ripping into the alien, which lets go
Johner looks up to see Purvis  holding Johner's gun
Johner drags himself back on
One jumps down onto St Just, tears a good chunk out of his midsection before he dusts it
Another alien jumps on the hood just as the jeep  over first ledge of the terraced  slope, comes-down hard enough knock it off,  over the next -- the crew can barely hang on as the jeep crashes down slope after slope
Ripley swerves back onto the road, the jeep sliding over onto the steps beside it, rocking violently as they shoot down the remainder of slope, the aliens close on their heels
Still blasting away at the beasts, the crew is able to put little distance between them as they come to the end of the garden
Here it divides into three sections, all open halls with access for the jeep
Which way
(looking over) Left
Left
She swerves left, the jeep-bouncing into the hall Where windows running along either side look out onto black space
Ripley drives as far as she can, till a staircase -- going -- fills her vision, too steep for the jeep
She  on brakes
the jeep spinning out and coming to a halt
The crew piles out, Di Stephano grabbing Vriess
At the other end of the hall, the aliens can be seen approaching
The crew  at them, the aliens, blood splattering the narrow hall
: Eating into the walls
the floor
/Ship Warning
potential hullbreach
Clear sector
(indicating the steps) Down here
They start down -- all but St Just
He gets out of the jeep with difficulty
Looks down at his wound
Johner looks around to see him still standing atop the steps St Just
Come on, man
St Just looks down at the wound
Back at Johner
He walks calmly away, towards the aliens
St Just
You go
He looks at the appraching aliens
'm bored
\ Warning
Evacuate sector
moment, then the crew takes off
St Just takes a handful of pills, pops them into his mouth
Only the slightest  grin suffuses his face ,as he waits for the aliens
They close on him, and he raises his guns
\ warning
: - The crew runs full out
We have to get out of the sector
Where
There
He points at a door that's down two flights and across the hall
: The aliens close, and St Just , blasting away with bot guns
Aliens writhe on the floor before him, still they cover the bodies of their brothers, still he fires, Call\ship monotones of warning in sharp contrast to the chaos -- St Just fires until both guns are empty
In one smooth motion he drops them both and jerks his wrists and - disposable guns fly into his palms and he blasts away : Eating through the hull
: desperately racing for the door
: Firing with quiet glee
: The first of them are through the door
: St The aliens are getting closer, but still he mows them down Both his guns click, spent
Damn
\ Warning -- and
, the hall  , everything explodes into space, the wind rushes out as , the whole garden sector rips open, sucked out, as : is the last to get out, but the pressure change   she flies backwards, the section door coming down just in time as she  into it, the door closing fully as she falls, lack of pressure sucks at the door itself, it creaks and be inward slightly, but it holds
The others have exited into the next hall
They've been tossed about, but not as badly
Call stops, runs back to Ripley, helps her up
Ripley is dazed; the door hit the back of her head solidly
Can you walk think
'm not fucking carrying you Ripley doesn't even hear her; something else drowns Call out
Ripley puts her hands over her ears
Mistake
mistake
Ripley
can hear them, in the hive
it's close
We're on the hive
Jesus
Come on
can hear them
the queen
What
She's in pain
They   through the floor panels, six of them, surrounding the two women
Call can barely spin before Ripley  her and  her fifteen feet down the corridor, out of harm's way
The aliens close on Ripley
She struggles but she's still weak
One slams her onto the ground call recovers, looks back at Ripley As the aliens drag her unconscious body back down under the floor
:
- Dark, cramped, and already covered with a hardening layer of resin
Skittering, insectile motion at one end heralds the aliens, as two of them crawl rapidly along
The third craw upside down, the semiconscious Ripley draped over its chest  If she were awake, and out
vf her mind, she could be kissin the beast
Her eyes flutter open, but she is obviously still groggy
: ' Alien head, dark tunnel passing beneath
Scuttling through a small maze, the aliens come out into: 5 - vast, dark chamber, entirely encrusted with alien goo
air vent opens about three quarters of the way up the chamber
The aliens pour out and imediately scuttle , carrying Ripley to the top of the chamber
They circle her and begin secreting resin, spinning a web around her
The resin comes out of ther backs in spits and globs
It isn't pleasant, and Ripley struggles feebly as they begin to cocoon her
: The crew piles through it on their way to the loading dock
Call brings up the rear, still looking back regretfully
She hesitates, and Purvis takes hold of her arm
We got to be moving, miss
Best gift you can give her right now is a quick death
It's not right
've been saying that all day, we need your help
moment more, and she heads out with him
: ,  5 - The aliens have finished webbing Ripley, and climb away
When it is done she finds herself basically hung from the ceiling, her legs encased and glued with glistening strands to the roof
She hangs therefore at an angle, looking down on the chamber
And so it is with her, as she swims to full consciousness, we get our first real look at where we are
There are no less than ten people strung up exactly as Ripley is, encircling the chamber, and all looking some forty feet down at: The Queen
Lying on her back at the bottom of the-chamber, belly swollen and distended
She is herself partially cocooned, strapped down to the at the edge of a black pool of blood and ichor
Her head moves slowly back and forth, in delierium of pain
There are a four or five aliens tending her, spinning goo around her, vomiting blood onto her belly
They might be serving her, or imprisoning her
Both, in fact
There is one thing missing from this tableau
(softly) No eggs
() Multiple reproductive systems
Ripley turn's slowly, to see the person next to her
It's Gediman, looking wane and haggard
He may be speaking to her but he stares straight ahead, his eyes glowing with near insanity
Complete asexual reproductive cycle, self-impregnating, we found six different sets of ovaries in her
Egg laying is the first cycle, immature
Redundancies, redundancies she'll bring forth legion
They didn't impregnate you
Now he looks at her, regret and glee at what has happened battling for his expression
No
they've just been draining me
She looks down, to see : ' As blood from various wounds seeps slowly past his toes, dripping into the pool
keening  comes out of the queen, as her limbs begin thrashing
The aliens around her back off slightly
The bulge in her belly starts moving
Ripley starts struggling with her bonds, terror and determination in her
eyes
'm getting	out of here
Goddamnit, 'm getting the	fuck out of here
He looks at her, the last glimmerof his sanity sinking beyond the horizon
Don't you want to see what happens next
: :   - The crew rushes in, heads for the Betty
How long till we can get airborn
'll need Call to patch in to the ship again, open the hatch
Right
We hit atmo in a few minutes, only gonna make it harder
They all run on board and head for the cockpit
DiStephano deposits Vriess in a wheelchair
Johner, take Purvis to the freezer
All right
Nap time, buddy
and Purvis goes flying, blood spurting out of his shoulder, Johner draws but Wren emerges from the shadows too fast
Wren grabs Call and very carefully holds his gun to her back right below her shoulderblades
Fuck with me and  put a bullet where her brain is
Johner stands, uncertain
DiStephano
Take their weapons
Begging your pardon, sir, but eat my fuck
DiStephano aims at Wren
Wren backs up a step
Drop it
Drop it or we all die together
Heaped in the, corner, Purvis suddenly jerks forward
His eyes go wide
:
5 Ripley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds
It's just beginning to work
But the noise in here is getting worse, the aliens franitcally agitated as the Queens belly begins moving more violently
, and does as well, from effort or sympathy, it is hard to tell, as Blood shoots everywhere, burning into the walls
And all the screaming stops
The movement stops
Even Ripley stops
Silence
Something emerges from the wound
An alien, to be sure, but nothing we've seen so far, its forelegs arch out of its back like spiders legs, its back legs set on enormous haunches, thick and powerful
Its head is long, eyeless, like the others, but along its white expanse red veins, coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to the back
It has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its tongue does
Its much bigger the the others, nearly the size of the queen herself
And it's bone white
Beautiful
beautiful butterfly
He is crying with revelatory joy
Ripley is not
Grimacing the sight and smell of the new beast, she begins pulling again at her bonds
One of the soldiers, at the 'other end of the room from Ripley wakes up
Dangling uselessly at his side is a rifle -- the real deal, not a burner
No, God
He  in uncomprehending horror
The newborn stops, tilting its head: It  up to the ceiling in a second, quick and effortless as a monstrous flea
Leaps again and lands on the screaming soldier, gripping his sides with its four forelegs as he screams lustily
pincers  out and pin either side of his head
His eyes go wide as: Its tongue  into his throat
Stays there, and we watch it drain the blood from his body
We can see it, see its stomach swell, red tinged, as his body goes blue and slack
His rifle drops into the black pool
Gediman stares, transfixed, and it
:
- Johner's gun drops to the floor
Everyone backs off
The fucking robot is going to plug back into the Auriga and land it according to standard operational procedure
No she's not
You're fucking nuts
You still want to bring those things back to earth
Have you been paying any attention today
can handle the animals
Fucking shoot me
Shut up
And Purvis  from the corner, screaming, jumps on wren - Wren gets off a couple of shots -- nails DiStephano in the face
The soldier drops like a sack
The other shots hit the ship, Call dives for cover as Purvis  his fist across Wren's face, Wren fires again and Jo is on the ground, rolling, grabbing his gun -- Purvis is a man possessed
He grabs Wren's gunhand and  it against an instrument panel, bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun
Purvis jerks
Blood blooms in his chest
Everybody stops, mesmerized
wren drops to his knees, going for the gun, and Purvis grabs him from behind, pulls him so that the back of Wren's head is against his chest
Purvis jerks again
It takes Wren a moment to understand what's happening
They both scream
Then alien  out of Purvis's chest,
Everyone else is still frozen
Then the little critter bursts out of Wrens face, flying straight at Vriess
:
5 - Ripley  one of her arms free as the newborn feeds beside her
Gediman is already a shell
Having drained the scientist, it leaps blindingly fast onto the ceiling
Looks around
Targets Ripley
It has no eyes, but she can feel them on her anyway
She rips at her bonds with a terrible effort -- the newborn  at her and she with a scream,   the thirty feet to the pool as the alien flies over her, missing, landing on the far wall instead
Ripley disappears beneath the surface of the water
The newborn turns its head, trying to locate its lost prey
other aliens scutter closer to the pool
Ripley stands up out of the pool, covered in blood, Killshriek rising from her throat as she , taking out a host of aliens in a single sweep, just tagging the newborn as it leaps out of the way
Aliens jump at her, trying to kill and trying to protect the newborns, but she blows them out of the air
It feels pretty good
few shots go wild, and punch big holes in the side of the tank
Light streams in through them
Ripley sees -- and continues firing in that direction
She makes a big enough hole that she can run and  through to - rolling and coming up in an instant
She looks around her
exit this way, but there is a vent above her
The newborn's head lunges at her, the small hole making it impossible for the creature to get all the way through
But it wriggles, pushing
Ripley jumps up, grabbing a pipe, and  open the vent grate, throwing herself up the vertical shaft with astonishing ease
:
- --- Vriess is scrambling away, knocking over things to avoid the baby alien
Johner  at the creature as it speeds-towards Vriess
Don't shoot it
Betty's hull is too thin
Look out
it knocks over cannisters as it speeds across the table and behind some instruments Where'd it go
Don't shoot it
Fuck that
It  out of the darkness and heads straight for Call, she stumbles back, trips -- it comes at her, leaps right at her face, she pulls her hand back -- and-flicks her wrist The stilletto pops out as the creatu flies at it, the blade slides right into its mouth, ramming eight inches through its innards before it pokes out the other end
Blood spurts on Call, on the floor
The creature wriggles and finally falls free as the stilletto melts inside it
Vriess
Get behind the fucking wheel
:
- Ripley is climbing up the cramped vent with the speed and agility of an alien
Unfortunately, so are the aliens, twenty feet below her
Two drones in front, with the newborn sqeezing close behind
Ripley grabs a pole and her hand begins to steam, it's so hot
She cries out, lets go
then looks down
Grabs the pole again and, ignoring the searing agony, pulls, pulls
out of the wall, burning steam  out below her, slowing down the aliens
She continues climbing, then kicks through a grate
: The Auriga races toward: But not as we've seen it
The planet is still blue, but almost two thirds of it is obscured by a giant orbitting latticework of metal, a part shell that rotates sligtly faster than the  planet itself
The Auriga heads for a section of exposed earth
Not long now
:
- Ripley drops to the ground and heads for the dock
/ Airlock doors closing
Stand clear
No
She doesn't bother to try the door, she  herself through the window, landing in a hail of glass
She is on the platform that
runs the length of the dock
Betty
is barely visible past the far end, - sinking into the airlock as the massive airlock doors
slide slowly shut
against the metal door behind her tells her the aliens are here
She picks herself up and  -- and she can run fast
Speeds across the platform, faster, faster, the Betty sinks of sight as the airlock doors move closer together, fifteen feet apart, ten
Ripley reaches the edge of the platform and , just hurls herself off of the platform, sails through the air, thirty, forty feet, and down, the airlock doors thirty feet below almost closed She  right through just before they close, falls another fifteen feet and lands --
-- on top of-the Auriga, hard, rolls, lies there in extremes of pain
: - The crew look up at the sound
Something's on us
Forget it
we'll shake it off on descent
Airlock secure
Outer doors opening
: - Ripley tries to pick herself up, is momentarily too wiped
breathes heavily, gets to her knees
:  - we see Ripley crawling toward the hatch, and the huge outer airlock door opening beneath the ship
Blue sky and wind the screen below
: Struggling to get to the hatch
God'
And above her, through a window into the docking bay, we see the newborn appear
:
- Almost there
We got about forty seconds till we kiss the ground
Go full thrust on the downdraft
We'llget clear
It's gonna be fucking close
\ Warning
Procedural interruption
Ship not leveling for vertical drop
Braking system nonfunctional
Collision imminent
No shit
Almost there
: - The airlock doors are almost
completely open
Ripley has reached the hatch, but cannot get it open
She pounds on it frustration -- and the newborn  through the window, onto the ship
: - Vriess punches it : \ and the Betty   out of the airlock -- Ripley and the newborn just barely hold on, Ripley's body thrown straight up as she grips the hatch door for dear life
The newborn has a better grip -- it has more things to grip with but it too struggles with the sudden drop
: Speeding toward the earth
The Betty  out the airlock and nearly smashes into the bottom of the ship as it passes, like trash thrown out of a speeding car
The Akiriga passes, huge above them Look out
am
The ship swerves as Call expertly avoids the Auriga -- and see Ripley and the newborn on top, still fighting for purchase The Betty gets clear, leveling out -- The Auriga still heads straight for earth, as the terrain below becomes clear - - deserted, snow covered mountains : Hanging on : Fighting to control the Betty : Deserted halls, passageways bodies, and,aliens milling here and there \ Collision in six seconds
five
four
(softly) Here we go
: , a deafening exposion eating the massive ship in seconds, utter cacophony
: Flying away, the thundering firestorm behind it
: An instrument panel suddenly  beside her warning lights flash, the ship shaking as if under massive turbulence Johner
Fire
Vector control's fucked
we gotta put down
Find me a path
Johner sprays foam on the fire
There is a loud  heard far overhead
What the fuck is that
: is slamming her fist on the hatch doors, hanging on with her other arm
The ship continues to tremble and buck -- she's nearly thrown off
Godamnit
She looks around at the alien
It's almost on her
Working its way painfully toward her, gripping with its legs and tendrils
Hissing
It slams a tentacle down at Ripley, but she rolls, just holding on : Above the cockpit, looking at a fuzzy external monitor
It's Ripley
Ripley's on the fucking hatch
In the cockpit, Call nearly goes white
Let her in
Fuck no
There's something else out there with her
One of them
Johner looks at the image, realizes how masive the newborn is
Awed fear creeps into his voice: No
it's something else
Frustrated, Call jumps out of her seat
Vriess fights to control the ship as she  climbs up toward the hatch
Goddamnit, Call
Johner grabs her, practically throws her at the monitor
Look at that fucking thing
We can't open up
They both tumble as the ship jerks : Is bucked before she grabs the newborn's tentacle, holds on to it -- The newborn  it against he ship, trying to shake her again - - she grabs an external grate and starts climbing painfully away
: Pushes Johner aside as she makes for the hatch release sequence
:
Desperately pulling up as wooded, snowy mountains zoom dangerously close below
: Turns as the   nearby, the door sliding slowly beast is torn between Ripley and this new distraction -- Ripley sees it too, starts climbing for it frantically, one on the newborn
The beast makes for the doorway -- and     pointing a at the thing
She  it once,  the beast roaring and starting back, hurt but not nearly enough
Call fires again but the ships rocking sends the shot wild
she flies back for all of a second The beast rears to attack but Ripley is at the hatch -- Call drags her in and closes the hatch, the beast just  in it as it closes
Ripley is hanging on Call, exhausted
Another  on the hatch, and they can see the door starting to give
Call
Call and Ripley head into the cockpit
Johner continues looking at the vidscreen at the beast
We can't to do a vertical setdown
Braking systems are shot
Find me a patch of land
'll put her down
Call jumps back into the pilot's seat by Vriess
He pulls up hard on the wheel, but the ship is still dangerously close to the ground
That thing isn't going anywhere
Johner, strap in
We're coming down hard
:     -  Approaches the rough, wooded terrain, just above the trees
Hits a relatively clear patch, touches down -- bounces back up and then down again : Fighting the wheel -- she can't pull it up hard enough
: The ship blasts through trees
The newborn moves to the back of the ship to avoid debris
That things gone back behind the thrusters
Call and Ripley look at each other
Hit it
Call throws on the thrusters, the ship  forward   : Engulfed in flame, losing its grip -- Going too fast -- Call can't control it Kill thrust
Now
Call does
: Skids, skids, throwing up enormous debris
It hits another wooded area is thrown bodily into the windshield -- mows down a half acre of trees before finally grinding to a halt
As soon as they've recovered, Call throws off her seatbelt
Is everbody all right-
Where're you going
Call opens the hatch
To make sure that thing is really dead Its giant face  down at her, piston tongue shooting out
It has charred black skin -- in some places that skin has fallen off and wet pink flesh shows through
Call drops to the floor, the tongue just missing her
Johner scrambles for his gun as Ripley drags her out of the way
quickly as it came, the head lurches back out
think it's gone
No, it's waiting for us to come out
Can we fly
We can't fucking crawl
It's gone
Call looks at her
Are you sure
Good
Great
No
Call grabs a grenade launcher
've got to stop it
Call That thing is thirty minutes old
In a few hours it'll grow up
If it reaches a place with people
She heads for the door but Ripley is on her way
They exchange a look
You'll never catch it
Call tosses her the grenade launcher
:
- The ship sits silent in the woods, the trees around heavy with snow
Ripley comes out the top
She looks around her, sees the tracks in the snow
Huge, loping
She jumps
down off the ship
And runs
Through the blur of trees, she moves with the grace and speed of an animal, leaping from boulders, racing through the powdered brush this is Ripley at peak speed, and it is something to see
She starts going up, the way getting steeper and rockier, til she reaches a cliff face, and looks out on: Sprawling, huge, a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes it's just before  the horizon
The newborn  in front of Ripley,  her before she has a chance to aim her weapon
Its tentacle cuts deeply into her, sends her flying
The beast is on her in a second, its enormous jaws missing her head by an inch as she rolls, grabs the grenade launcher, The beast is thrown, but just grazed, back on her as she tries to get off another shot, it  a foot down    she , the launcher rolls free, the beast coming in for the kill and over the ridge   , Call at the controls
aiming right  for the newborn
It rears up to see it just as the girl  it into the creatures head, it knocks it on its ass, the harvester shaking but not quite spinning out, as Call comes around for another shot
Ripley scrambles to safety as the Newborn prepares for the oncoming harvester, it whips its tentacles at it but Call swerves at the last second -- The monster spins with it, screaming, sees Ripley and slashes at her
-- She falls, grabs brush it snaps -- she starts slinding down rockface and she takes her hand,  her fingers into the smooth rock face like a pick axe -- it rips her nails bloody but she digs out purchase
: into the newborn from behind, the girl nearly thrown out of the harvester, the newborn spins and grabs it, Call throws it into reverse but the newborn is too strong, holds on, bringing its head up to face Call herself
: ' Bloody and torn, it  into the rockface, as she climbs back to the top : the harvester into a tree, Call nearly knocked loose again
The monster is jolted as well, lets go, Call pilots the machine back through the trees, the alien watching it, growling -- Call flies deftly through the trees, away, away, then spins out, heads back for the beast at  , the wind roars as she closes The newborn spins and she  into it, it goes flying, screaming in pain,  the harvester bouncing off it, flipping over,  against the trees and landing tilted upside down, Call unconscious between it and the ground
The newborn shudders, rises, makes for the harvester -- it clearly pissed
Ripley pulls herself over the ridge, sees the situation, rushes toward them
Call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine
Terrified, but determined, she reaches for a lever No
Over here
Calling out to distract it, she runs, waving her arms
Ripley
Let it come
Let it come
Tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever
The beast is torn, and for a  moment doesn't move
Ripley looks over to where Call is, and understanding blooms on her face
She looks around and spots: : Halfway between her and the newborn
For a moment neither of them moves
Then Ripley , the newborn comes at her with equal speed, like they're playing chicken, Ripley at the ground, rolls, comes up holdin the grenade launcher, and she
The newborn is hit up close and dead center this time, and it rears back, screaming - - Ripley  and , driving it back toward the upended harvester
The alien rears up to its full height, and Ripley pulls
the trigger
There is a hollow click
Furious, Ripley stares a moment at the beast
wells up in her throat and she herself at it, leaping impossibly high, smashing into it and sending both  of them tumbling onto the Harvester
Call pulls the lever
In an instant the machine roars to life, a thousand blades grinding to top speed, pulverizing the beast, consuming it, sucking it down as layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes
And it , a noise unheard before, as it thrashes frantically
Ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close -- but the beast grabs her, holds her
The blades ever closer as she struggles with it
: Still trapped below, she sees the aliens blood seeping through the machine all around her
She squirms, trying to get away, but she's stuck
stream of blood lands on her shoulder, eating it away
Another on her leg, and panic blooms, bright in her
Galvanized by the cry, Ripley  herself out of the beast's dying grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and spark, blood eating through the controls
Call writhes, blood everywhere now
She is lost in primal terror
Ripley wriggles her way under, and, regardless of the streams of blood splattering her, wrenchs Call free
She drags her' out
section of the harvester explodes, raining fire and debris or the dying alien
Call lies on the ground, Ripley behind her, arms wrapped tight around her
Covered in blood and grime, the two watch the alien go up in flames, breathing hard,  holding each other as if their lives depended on it still
- :  ' Burning, hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it
Collapsing gently on itself
: - The four of them sit by the huge camp-fire, watching the flames
Vriess tosses 'Christie a bottle of whiskey
The bitch takes her time in burning
Well, it looks like she's finally giving it up
Troopers should be finding our ship any time now
1 don't much love the idea of being around when they do
Ripley gets up, looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city
Christie offers the bottle to Call
She takes it and drinks
(to Call) guess you won't want to be answering any official Questions either
guess not
She is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together
Well, we're on Earth, for Chrissake
Plenty of places to get lost here
So 've heard
After a moment, she gets up as well, goes over to Ripley
She hands her the bottle
Ripley looks at it
It's a drink
You drink it
(smiling)  remember
She drinks
So, what do you think
Think
What should we do now
don't know
She looks out in the distance
'm a stranger here myself The two of them stand side by side staring out at the unfamiliar horizon, as the newborn dwindles in the dancing flame
