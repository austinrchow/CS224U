behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes authority much more so than the Mayor does
The Arroyo Seco freeway is just the beginning
We're planning freeways from Downtown to Santa Monica, from the South Bay to the San Fernando Valley
Twenty minutes to work or play is the longest you'll have to travel
More applause
One  asks a little too loudly
How many bodies you think Mickey Cohen'll be able to hide in all that cement
The Mayor wears a plastic smile, ignores it
- pops snapshots, but the real action is on the floor where   does a wicked "Lindy Hop" with  different  at once
fireplug of a man, he hardly seems a public menace
Nearby is his bodyguard
Over it all: (
) Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey  to his fans
He's the big moocher, local
color to the nth degree
You know Mickey
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution
He kills a dozen people a year
But who you may not know is bodyguard Johnny Stompanato
His hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on Cohen and comes onto a   at the same time
(
) Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the real attraction is below the belt
Second only to Steve Cochran, he's sometimes known as 'Oscar' because of his Academy Award-size appendage
Mickey works a sweat on the dance floor

As he laughs at himself

The Mayor has moved off to the side with the power brokers
Patchett is a presence

Beautiful weather
Affordable housing

And the best police department in the world to keep it all running smoothly

But with a second rate Al Capone out there,

Something has to be done
As Pierce Patchett nods sagely
- Wrestler   primps and poses before flatten- ing an opponent with a drop kick
- An enthusiastic crowd adjusts their 3- glasses
( ) - In monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the door, his pet  Mickey Jr
at his feet
The police are waiting
' flashbulbs pop
Mr
Cohen, you're under arrest
Bullshit
What's the charge
Non-payment of federal income tax
Bullshit '  - gets his hand prints in the sidewalk
- hurry to finish the harvest
We who wait impatiently with bull- dozers under a "Spirit of the Future"
As the last picker leaves the field, the bulldozers move in, leveling the bean rows to make way for a housing tract

Accompanied by his , bodyguard Stompanato and mob lieutenants   and , Cohen ignores ' shouts
How's your bullshit now, Mickey
As Cohen gets into a waiting car, the media turn their attention to District Attorney
singularly ambitious man, Loew loves the spotlight
Today is an auspicious one for the city of Los Angeles
Mickey Cohen has just been sentenced to ten years in federal prison for failure to pay income tax

(   ) - December 24th
Wendell "" , 30, stares at the enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over Bullocks' entrance
An  cop, Bud's rep as the toughest man on the force has been well earned
In the back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is Bud's partner --
Older, but also a tough hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow
The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard Johnny Stompanato slides in
Guinea handsome, Johnny wears his curls in a tight pompadour
With his boss behind bars, he's out of work
Bud just stares at him
Officer White
heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters
And you fuck people up for a living
That don't make me you
Capisce , shitbird
Stompanato smiles
Nervous
Through the window, Bud watches a Salvation Army Santa palm coins from a kettle
Bud ain't in the mood for small talk, Stompanato
Look, Mickey 's doing time and half the other guys who'd hire me are dead or left town
need money
If your snitch-fund's green, 'll get you some fucking- collars
Impatient, Bud tugs at a finger,  a
There's this guy
He's blond and fat, about forty
Likes the ponies
Been pimping his wife to cover his losses
Knocks her around to keep her in line
Bud's eyes narrow at this last bit of info
Stompanato holds up a slip of paper
figure the address is worth twenty
Bud digs into his wallet, pulls out twenty bucks, exchanges it with Stompanato
Stompanato smiles smugly, grabs a bottle of Scotch from the back
Yuletide cheer, fellas
Without warning, Bud grabs Stompanato's tie and yanks, slamming his forehead into the dash
Happy New Year, greaseball
1486  - stucco job in a row of vet prefabs
neon Santa sleigh has landed on the roof
Through the front window, we see a fat guy browbeating a woman
Puff-faced, 35- ish, she backs away as he rages at her
The Packard pulls up out front
Stensland could care less
Leave it for later, Bud
We got to pick up the rest of the booze and get back to the precinct
Bud  the , picks up the radio
Central, this is 4A-31
Send a prowler to 1486 Evergreen
White male in custody
Code 623 point one
Domestic assault and battery
won't be here, but they'll see him
1486  -  - steps to the house
Inside, we hear , Bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and yanks
The sleigh crashes to the ground with around it
beat
The fat guy runs out to investigate, trips over Rudolph
Bud pounces
Fat guy takes a swing, misses
Grabbing fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement
Once, twice
Teeth skitter down the walk
Touch her again and 'll know about it
Understand
Huh
Another face full of gravel
Fat guy's  watches with apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's hands behind his back, empties his pockets
cash roll and car keys
Bud looks over at her
You got someplace you can go
She nods
Bud hands her the keys and the cash
Go get yourself fixed up
(nods, determined) Merry Christmas, huh
Bud watches as she gets into a pre-war Ford in the drive
She backs over a blinking reindeer as she goes
You and women, partner
What's next
Kids and dogs
(  ) - The "Badge of Honor" set
Christmas party in full swing
Eating, drinking, and dancing
Star Brett Chase, seen earlier on television, is holding court
Sgt
"Trashcan"  , late 30s with slick, good looks, dances with a young
Grinding their way through a ballad, they're obviously hitting it off
Brett Chase told me you're the cop who busted Bob Mitchum
(grinds closer) These 'Badge of Honor' guys like to pretend, but being the real thing must be a thrill
Let's go someplace quiet
'll give you the low-down on Mitchum
You got your handcuffs with you
Two sets
'll get my coat
They're interrupted by Sid Hudgeons
Big  Jack Vincennes
May  have this dance
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine
know who he is
The Actress storms off
Jack looks to Sid
We did a piece last year
'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood
'  Her name got mentioned
Is she
Beats me
Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds
He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills
It's right around the corner
You lost me, Sid
Who
Contract players at Metro
You pinch 'em
do you up feature in the next issue
Plus the usual fifty cash
Tell me, am  fucking Santa Claus
need an extra fifty
Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station
Jack
It's Christmas
No
It's felony possession of marijuana
2245  - a  of Grauman's Chinese
Jack and two uniformed patrolmen wait on the darkened street
An arc light has been set up
Hudgeons creeps back over from the house
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree
Stand there with your camera
'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns
like it
like it
2245  - The arc light floods the living room about the same time that Jack kicks the door in
The room is caught flush: Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids necking in their BVDs
and
Police
2245  - Jack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck
Jack stops with Grauman's  behind him and Hudgeons off several shots with his
Cut
Wrap it
Windows light up
Rubberneckers appear
Jack hands the kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in tow
2245  - Jack scoops the pot, flips through an address book card falls out
"Fleur-de-Lis
Whatever you desire
" Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being loaded into a black and white
They're both crying now
(stantorian tone) It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them
The free- wheeling, big-time Big , celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere
You like it, Jackie- Boy
Yeah, it's subtle
Sid hands him a President Grant 50
Remember: you heard it first here, off the record, on the
and very Hush-Hush -   - Suspects, mostly drunk and disorderly, are ushered through
Sgt
, 30, bespectacled, is at the desk with a
Exley is an up-and-comer
Burning with ambition
The faster he rises through the ranks, the more resentment he leaves in his wake
What's on the call sheet
guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz
Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself
Decorated
With tinsel and plastic icicles and
on his penis, sir
get the idea
You got a description
Of his penis, sir
-   - Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the walls as the  takes an order from
case each of gin, Scotch, and rum
Everything top shelf
None of that watered-down stuff you push on Errol Flynn
(laughs) Sounds like a helluva party
Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it up
There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn
She seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie stars
Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the counter
Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a moment
You want it delivered
Before five tomorrow
The Owner spots Bud
big smile turns to a frown
'll be right with you, Lynn
The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at each other
Bud says the only thing he can think of
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas yourself, Officer That obvious, huh
(smiles sweetly) It's practically stamped on your forehead
As the Owner bangs a case of liquor on the counter
- Bud exits with his booze, heads for the car
Something catches his eye
woman in the rear passenger seat of a new Cadillac
Both her eyes are black
Bud starts over
The case on his hip, he motions for her to roll down the window
The driver's side door opens and bodyguard  ""  menaces his way out
Get lost why don't you
Meeks stops short as Bud shoves his badge in Meeks' face
Setting the case on the car's hood, Bud spins Meeks around, pats him down
He finds a
38 in a shoulder holster
got a license for that
Bud removes Meeks' wallet, checks the
Cut me some slack
used to be a cop
Turner Meeks
Never heard of you
(exiting store) We just call him Buzz
Bud raps on Susan's window with his badge
It comes down
You okay
Beside her, a man leans over
Pierce Patchett, seen before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being chauffeured
Like , he smokes his cigarette in a holder
She's fine
(menacing) 'm not asking you
Patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice
As he stares impatiently at Bud, Bud looks back to Susan
Somebody hit you
It's not what you think
Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's door
What is it then
You got the wrong idea, Mister
'm fine
Susan laughs
Patchett eases back into the shadows
(getting in the car) But it's nice to know you care
Bud considers Meeks' gun license, then hands him back the 38 and wallet
Lifting his booze, Bud watches Meeks get back in the car
Stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away
What's going on
For an odd moment, Stensland and Meeks lock eyes
You know him
Seen him around
He used to be a cop
: Fifty, handsome in his police captain's uniform
Singing "Silver Bells" in a beautiful low tenor
Tough, respected, Dudley goes to bed as a cop every night of his life
He's a department power to be reckoned with
-   - An Herald Express and photographer listen along with the gathered patrolmen as Dudley finishes to applause
Dudley joins the press
Captain Smith,  -- Drop the formalities; it's Christmas Eve
Call me Dudley
Dudley,  came up with a title for the story
'm calling it "Silent Night with the
" Excellent
How's this
(dramatic pause) The sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element
Our vigilance will not be diminished
As the Reporter scribbles down the quote
That's Smith with an
They laugh
Dudley points the way out
This way, gentlemen
Dudley's the last one out the door
As he goes, he turns back to give the men a wink
He's no sooner out the door when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in
-   - Ed Exley gets another report from the Young Officer
Two police officers were assaulted in a bar
Brown and Helenowski
He hands the report to Exley
It's now that Dudley comes through on his press junket
This is Sergeant Ed Exley
Son of the legendary Preston Exley
He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job
As the photographer snaps Exley's picture
was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when was a rookie
It makes a man feel old
That's a fact
(a beat) Feel free to get a feel for the place
As the Reporter and photographer wander off, Dudley turns to Exley a bit more serious
word with you, lad
'  - Dudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley
To the memory of your father
They drink
Exley looks to a photo on the wall
Himself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his father Preston, both in police uniform
The day he got the Medal of Valor
simpler time
Remembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast
To the solving of crimes that require absolute justice
Exley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him
That was his favorite toast
(a beat) saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam
You placed first out of twenty-three
The youngest applicant by eight years
You'll make lieutenant inside a year
Patrol division
was thinking Detective Bureau
We can see Dudley doesn't approve
You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective
Or the stomach
You're a political animal, Edmund
The criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter
You're wrong
Am
Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment
Dudley, we've been over this
Answer yes or no
No
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis
Yes or no, Edmund
No
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty
No
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance -- No
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective
Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices
Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau
know you mean well, Dudley, but don't need to do it the way you did
Or my father
At least get rid of the glasses
can't think of one Bureau man who wears them
-   - large impromptu bar has been set-up
The party is in full swing, the floor packed with nightwatch blues Stensland pours eggnog and Old Crow into the water cooler as Bud elbows his way in with another case
Hey, partner
Grab a cup
got to write my report first
#1 Hear about Helenowski and Brown
They got into a helluva scrap with six taco benders at some bar
Helenowski lost six pints of blood
Brown's in a coma
#2 We ought to teach Paco and his friends a lesson
More cops vocie their agreement
Bottles are passed
Only Bud doesn't seem as caught-up as the rest
-   - Jack Vincennes at his desk
Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, Jack dials the number
corkboard on the wall is posted with press clippings
"Dope Crusader Wounded in Shootout
"  "Actor Mitchum Seized in Marijuana Shack Raid
"  That one includes a shot of Jack ushering Mitchum into jail

Hi

The line goes dead
Jack redials

Look, a friend of mine gave me this number
just -- The line goes dead again
Jack dials a new number

This is Sgt

Requesting a name and address on a phone number
Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine

No such number is assigned

(
) No, Sergeant
checked twice
(realizes, hangs up) bootleg
- Exley surveys the carousing rowdies
Raising his voice
All right, men
You've had your fun
Time to break it up
The party continues undiminished
From across the room, Stensland eyes Exley with disdain
Fucking Exley
Guy's got a pole so far up his ass, every time he farts the flag waves
' The command not really his, Exley reads a report, ignores the party, though his window looks into the thick of it
Suddenly a ripple goes through the room
The men begin to push out through a rear door
Exley stands, stops a What's going on
They got the spics who japped Helenowski and Brown
Helenowski lost an eye and Brown's got brain damage
have the report right here
They're home with bruises and muscle pulls -- Oh shit
Exley starts out after them
- Stensland in the lead
Pulling out a blackjack, he enters Cell #4, begins wailing on one of the Mexicans -- Dinardo
For ours, Pancho
And you're getting off easy
Cheered on by drunks in the tank and his fellow officers, Stensland goes wild
He's joined by Lentz, Crumley and Tristano
Shaking his head, Jack Vincennes moves away
- Bud types his report with one finger
Jack looks in
White, you better get a lease on Stens before he kills someone
- Followed by Jack, Bud forces his way through the crowd
The men who see it's him quickly clear a path
Swigging from a pint of gin, Stensland works skinny Head saps
The kid drops to his knees drooling blood
Bud grabs Stensland, hauls him off of Garcia who looks up
Fuck you, pendejo Yeah yeah
And fuck your mother too
Bud sees red
Letting go of Stensland, Bud White picks up Garcia by the neck
There are cheers, "Attaboys" and "Holy Fucks" as Bud bangs Garcia's head on the ceiling
(arriving) Stop, Officer
That's an order
Cops block Exley's way
As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks him in the balls
dangling shot
Bud keels into the bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack
Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer, then puts Garcia down with a left-right
Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket
You're going in my report
All of you
Exley has just started taking names when Bud grabs him by the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into
As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store room
Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door tight
Exley is locked in
As Bud moves off, we hear (
) Let me out
That's an order
The Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed
Stensland swings like a madman
That's when a flashbulb goes off
Freezing everyone in black and white
: '  - The  sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform
Dudley Smith sits to his left,
Ellis Loew to his right
Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press conference, Loew is the only civilian
Bud White stands across from them
There to be judged
Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs
But you should know this is bigger than a police board
Indictments may be handed down
Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image
Will you testify
Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief
No, sir
won't
The Chief sighs, looks to Loew
District Attorney Loew
Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo
The headline:  "
" Bloody Christmas
The press love to label
You and Officer Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct
Stensland was already drunk
Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself
won't do it
(staring at mirror) won't testify against my partner or anyone else
This man is a disgrace
Your badge and gun, Officer
Bud sets them on The Chief's desk
This is the new
, White
You're suspended from duty and dismissed
Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as he makes his way out
Dudley Smith hides a smile
Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on the other side of the glass
' Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters
Ed, your observations have been astute
What's your assessment of this situation
The public demands justice, sir
This was a full-fledged riot of policemen
Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured
Force them to retire
But someone has to swing
Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White
Secure them jail time
Feed them to the sharks, sir
Protect yourself; protect the department
Dudley gives Exley a look
He's angry with him
Stensland's a disgrace
Straight fitness reports from every
he ever served under
But White is a valuable officer
White's a mindless thug
No, Edmund
He's a man who can answer yes to those questions ask you from time to time
The Chief interrupts with his own concern
want to know who we give the public in contrast
The department needs role models
Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire
'll testify, sir
'm not afraid to do what's right
And 'll promote you
You'll be a lieutenant immediately
Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head
Detective lieutenant
The Chief and Dudley exchange a look
Neither approves
Ed, you're 30
Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33
know that, sir
also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective
(interrupting) Before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness
That'll be hard to come by
The men hate a turncoat
Jack Vincennes
He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir
He lives for it
That's the way to get him
All right, Ed
(into desk intercom) Call Sergeant Vincennes
As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department
Yes, Dudley
am
So be it
Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the
' Round two
Centred on Jack
Exley is gone
Sergeant, we'll get right to it
Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia
But my office has a stellar witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only after being hit
What do  have to do
Testify against the three officers who have already earned their pensions
Our key witness will testify roundly, but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men
'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist
brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Ad Vice
(a beat) When you transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show
The show, sir
Badge of Honor, Vincennes
We need to tone down your profile for a bit
The Chief just got Jack where he lives
John,  doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath
Don't start now
Okay
'll do it
Smiles all around
Loew smiles at the two-way
move not lost on Jack who wonders who might be on the other side
Dismissed, Vincennes
Jack leaves
The Chief steps to the mirror, looks through
So be it
Detective Lieutenant
Exley clenches his fist in victory
The Chief continues
Ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son
Wear the smart- looking suit and ace them
And, Ed
Lose the glasses
114 (   ) - Glasses off, Exley waits, looks up as Jack enters
You're the key witness
That's right
should've known
What's the Chief throwing you
Throwing me Yeah, Exley
What's the payoff
You're the payoff expert
'm just doing my duty
You're playing an angle, college boy
You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching
If they're making you a detective, watch out
Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs
What about you
'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week
Next to you 'm clean
And smart
At that, a  steps in from the hallway
Edmund
Exley to chambers
As Exley's about to go
Just remember, Bud White'll fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life
They already suspended him
Just pray he cops a deal and stays on the Department because that is one civilian you do not want on your case
- An old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano
Bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a with too much make-up on too many miles
That an old fashioned you're drinking
(as she nods) My name's Bud
Nobody was born with the name Bud
They stick you with a name like Wendell, you look for an alias
What do you do, Bud
'm sorta between jobs
Look, what do you say we, uh
hand on Bud's shoulder
He turns to see Dudley Smith
Lad, may  have a word with you
This business, Captain
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables
Dudley starts off
Bud turns back to Redhead, but she's already talking to a sailor
Dudley sits at a table
newspaper is opened, a little mound underneath
Bud joins Dudley
Does that paper say we've been indicted
Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off
He made his play amd he got what he wanted
They're making him a detective
Captain, what do you want
Call me Dudley
Dudley, what do you want
Lad,  admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner
admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job
And  am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters
Do you hate them, Wendell
(looks away) Yeah,  hate them
And for good reason judging from what  know of your background
Bud looks back over
Dudley's getting too personal
What's going to happen to Stensland
He'll give himself cirrhosis over this
He's one year from his pension It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him
Why the loyalty, Wendell
He helped me out once
That's all
Your partner's through
Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders
He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing
Him and me both
Fucking Exley Don't underestimate his skills
As a politician he exceeds even myself
But the department needs smart men like Exley and
direct men like yourself What do you want Wendell,  want you to come to work for me
Doing what
Mowing your fucking lawn
Smith yanks the newspaper revealing Bud's badge &
38 Special
Bud can't believe his eyes
They're yours
Take them
knew you had juice, but
There's no goddamn bill on me
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony
How
Dudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand
need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on
duty few men are fit for, but you were born for
You'll be working out of Homicide
(excited) Homicide
detective
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell
It's a muscle job and shooting job
You'll do what say and not ask questions
Do you follow my drift
(disappointed) In Technicolor
Will you work for me
Of course
But how
How what, Wendell
How'd you get them to retract
Dudley lays brass knuckles on the table
They're chipped, caked with blood

But  think can answer for them

That's why  do the show
Chase looks over and winks at Jack who waits in the wings
To protect and serve
It's not just a motto
As the kids applaud, Chase joins Jack who gives him a quick drag of a cigarette
nervous  joins them
Chase points out a fetching girl in the second row
That one
In the sweater

Chase and Jack watch the  ask "Sweater" a question while pointing to Chase

He opens it to reveal a holding tank with a burly, jumpsuited hear you like to hit women
My wife
She's dropping charges so it's none of your business
Bud enters, closes the door behind him

It's Bud's business now

He pulls down books to reveal a shoe box
He sets it on his desk, pulls back the cover to reveal several bags of white powder
Heroin

Perkins opens a drawer, fishes a revolver
Turning off the light, he heads to the window
His finger parts the curtains
At that instant, he staggers, falls as  rips into him
The heroin just sits there on the desk
McNEIL  - Grim-faced guards scan the yard from machine-gunned towers
McNEIL  -   - Mickey Cohen sits across from visitor Johnny Stompanato
Cohen is going off the handle
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night
They shot him in his library

Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny
Nobody
At least not yet
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me

Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who
Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper
As "  " , so does the
-   - Addressing the squad, a no-nonsense   picks up a stack of magazines
Picture-book smut, gentlemen
There's been a bunch of it found at collateral crime scenes lately
Mostly narcotics and prostitution collars
As the Vice Capt
hands it out for the men to examine, new member Jack Vincennes arrives late
Look who's back from suspension
We're honored, Sergeant Jack
The men laugh
Jack sits, flips a magazine
Men and women
Men and men
Girls and girls
Girls and horses
Gee
The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be
Yeah, Cap
Back in Narcotics
Oh
Anyplace else
Working whores with squad two
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one
Vice Capt
retrieves the magazines, hands them to Jack
They're yours
Make a major case, Sergeant
It's the only way you're getting out of here
Exaggerated "oohs" and "aahs" from the men
Dismissed, gentlemen
As they go, Jack sees the books are stamped:  "Fleur-de-Lis Whatever you desire
"  Jack takes the matching business card from his wallet, the one he found on Christmas Eve
Roll, Vincennes
No sidetracks
This is Ad Vice, not Narco
-   - Jack Vincennes is at his desk
Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number
- - Sid Hudgeons sits behind his desk, answers the phone
Hush-Hush Off the record and on the
(
) Sid, it's Vincennes
Jackie, are you back on Narco need copy
Jack at his desk: No
But 've got something going with Ad Vice
Something good
Don't know
'm chasing picture books
Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies
It's well done stuff
thought you might have heard something
Hudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a magazine like the one Jack has
Not a word
What about Fleur-de-Lis
Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire
' No
No, 've heard bupkis
Jack, 'll talk to you later
Call me when you get something  can use
Smut's from hunger
For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled The   off
Jack hesitates a moment before cradling the receiver
Something's not right here
-   - As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones: (
) Park Rangers report three Negro youths discharging shotguns into the air in Griffith Park
Suspects are driving a late model purple Mercury Coupe
As the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and gets out of his car
-   - Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of his desk into a box
Well-wishing cops pat him on the back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks like he's going to cry
It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face with them
This is hatred
Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley
It's a mauling
Four vicious body shots
potentially lethal head shot sails wide as Exley falls to the ground
As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him
(gasping) You're just a thug, White
That's all you'll ever be
Dudley steps into the fray
He helps Exley to his feet
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up
His blood's always up
Four cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back
Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration
Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time
-   - Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his box of stuff into the trunk
Bud is moody, pensive
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud
You nailed him good
Yeah, sure
got a couple of hours before  have to be at the Victory
Want to grab a beer
Rain check me, partner
got something big going on tonight
What
That new mystery girl you've been seeing
No
'll tell you sometime
Not now
Don't want to jinx it
But it could take the edge off that jail time  got coming
What are you talking about
It's confidential, Bud
Like that magazines Vincennes scams for
Hush-Hush (smiles) 'll see you tomorrow
And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it
Stensland gets in the car, drives off
Bud is left alone
-   - Exley sits alone in a sea of desks
The Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't make it out
He takes his glasses from the inside of his jacket
2:00
Finally, something to do
He walks to the wall calendar, tears off Feb
28 to reveal Mar

As Exley sits, the call   booms to life
Squad call
Nite Owl Coffee Shop One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee
Multiple homicides
Multiple homicides

- Patrol cars
Blues setting up a crime scene blockade
Exley pulls up,  his

Men
Women
stopped for coffee -- Exley pushes him aside, heads for the door
It's wide open
- Exley takes mental snapshots
Ten stools front a counter
The side wall mural-papered:  winking owls perched on street signs
On the right a string of tables
Three in disarray
Food spilled, dishes broken
high-heel pump by an upended chair
Heel drag marks across the linoleum floor heading back toward the kitchen
Exley follows
Past an open, empty cash register
Outside --
Crisscrossed drag marks connect, lead to a walk-in
Blood-soaked bodies on the floor
Five, maybe six in a tangle
Dozens of shotgun shells float in the pools of blood
As Exley struggles to maintain his composure
(
) Holy shit fuck
Exley looks at a green-faced  in the locker doorway
-s-sir, there's a captain outside wants to see you
Don't get sick
Not in here
Exley shoves the Rookie, puking, out the door
- Patrolmen hold back a swarm of reporters and rubber- neckers
Motorcycles run interference for meat wagons cut off by the crown
As Ed emerges, reporters surge, shout questions
Exley hurries past, finds Dudley in command and barking orders
Sir,  took the call
It's my case
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it
Yes,  do, sir
It's mine
'll make you my second in command
Exley spots a photographer moving in
He looks properly serious as the flash bulb pops
- Forensics Chief   walks Exley and Dudley through
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells
Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps
All of them reloading twice
Hold on
We need to canvass
See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight
Why
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths
Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe
(to his adjutant) Get on it
approaches Pinker
We got an
on one of the victims, sir
think it's Dick Stensland
Exley and Dudley react, look at each other
- Set in a no-man's-land of bulldozed homes
sign proudly announces the impending arrival of the freeway
The motel is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence
Abandoned but for a pair of  cars and a light burning in room 6
An unmarked pulls up and Exley and Dudley step out
They start forward, but a  inside 6 stops Exley short
With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime free
The Chief wants it to stay that way, Edmund
The means are not for the weak-hearted

table and chair bolted to the floor
tough -  is cuffed to the hot seat
On the table are a
45 and a fat roll of $100 bills
Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a couple of short, stiff body shots
Flatnose is not used to being on the receiving end
All the same, we get the idea Bud's a bit reluctant
Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him
Come, Wendell, you can do better than that
Bud turns, sees Exley and Dudley
beat
As Bud looms over Flatnose, the gangster babbles
Snitch-frenzied
know things
hear things
Like with the Mick inside, things are on this weird slowdown
() (') These shooter teams, bang bang bang, they're 86-ing Mickey Cohen's men
We know all that, lad
Tell us, who do these shooters work for
don't know
No one knows
Maybe they're mavericks
You want a prostie roust
Huh
Some narco action
(breaking down) What do you want
We want you to go home
(to Breuning) Uncuff him, Michael
Dudley turns to Exley
Mr
Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco
He arrived this afternoon at Union Station
Looking for business opportunities in our fair city
An organized crime associate in need of re- education in the ways of polite society
Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists
Wary
As Breuning steps back, Flatnose snatches the
45 off the table
Motherfuckers
Exley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand there
Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley
It's part of the play, Edmund sincerity test
Flatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the No bullets
(to Breuning) Sit him back down
,
They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat
Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet
Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business
'll finish up here
'  - They drive in silence
No love lost here
Finally
Where are we going
It's a surprise
You like surprises, don't you, White
- Exley pulls up
Bud looks to him
Really curious now
-  - Exley and Bud walk
An orderly wheels a covered corpse toward them from the other end of the hall
Bud's spooked
The orderly wheels the body in to the examination room
As Bud and Exley pass, the  pulls back the sheet, is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite see
Call me crazy, but for a second thought it was Rita Hayworth
Exley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a coroner's assistant waits
We need you to
the body
There's no next of kin and you knew him best
So tell me
The assistant pulls open drawer 12
naked man
tag on his toe and half his face blown off
Is that Dick Stensland
Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner
Yeah, that's Stens
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence
Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out why Stensland is dead
He squeezes out the words
What happened
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people
Then, from the hall
(
) Not my baby
Not my little girl
-   - , 50, enters with the coroner to  the body of her daughter, Susan
There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders, but a sheet hides the real damage
It's the girl Bud saw outside Hollywood Liquor
Without the black eyes, she does look like Rita hayworth
As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs
Lefferts looks confused
Is this your daughter, Mrs
Lefferts
--  don't know
We know this is difficult
Just take your time and look again
Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased
It seems like my Susan, but
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs
Lefferts
At Christmas
We had fought didn't like her boyfriend
-- she has a birthmark on her hip
The Coroner lifts the sheet
Mrs
Lefferts gasps
It's her
My baby
Dear God
As Mrs
Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up
-   - The room buzzes, jammed to the rafters with every detective standing ready
The Chief waits as Dudley Smith takes the mike, holds up an Times headline
'Nite Owl Massacre
'  Hyperbole aside, this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution
The public will demand it and this department will provide it
Six victims
One of them, one of our own -- Dick Stensland
(as the cops react) As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular
In the wrong place at the wrong time
Bud White listens, not too sure
Stensland said he had something big going on
Robbery looks like the motive
We have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen
We do have one hot lead, so listen well
Three Negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at Griffith Park
park ranger
ed them as driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury Coupe, purple in color
An hour ago, a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple Merc Coupe parked across from the Nite Owl around 3:00
The room goes loud, a big rumbling
Dudley holds up a list
The
worked all night to get us a registration list on '48 to '50 purple Mercs
There are 142 registered to Negroes in
County
Fifty two-man teams will shake three names apiece
Hot suspects you'll bring here
Interrogation rooms have been set up
They'll be run by Lieutenant Edmund Exley
Hollywood Squad
Catcalls
Boos
The Chief steps to the mike
Enough on that
Gentlemen, just go out and get them
Use all necessary force
The people of Los Angeles demand it
The men exchange knowing looks
The real message:  kill them clean
Exley doesn't approve
As the men hurry out
He might as well have put a bounty on them
- Detectives pairing up and moving out
Scanning his three name list, Bud joins his  for the day
Can you take them
got got something  gotta do
Christ,  don't know
What if one of these names
What  gotta do is for Stensland
My partner
The guy looks at him a beat, nods
As Bud heads off
watches everyone go
Wishes he could be part of the action
He spots Jack talking to his  partner for for the day
Redneck chews tobacco, has a Texas drawl
Where to, Trash
If we go by the list, we have about zero chance of making the collar
But  know a guy who knows what's going on south of Jefferson
'm betting he could put us at 50/50
don't know
As Redneck thinks, Exley steps up
He's overheard
'll take those odds
(to Redneck) Take off
We got it from here
Jack stares
Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a cup
Between the two of you guys, you should bring along a photographer
- Last time we saw the Owner was Christmas Eve
He looks up from a customer as Bud strides in, badge out front
need an address on a customer of yours
Her name was Lynn
That's all  have to go on
Yeah
And  think you already know who  mean, so cough it up
Lynn Bracken
There's a billing address and a delivery address
Give me both
Billing first
1184  ,  (') - big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile
Also last seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a koi pond
They land in a tight grouping
As he tees up: (
) You must slay 'em at the country club
Bud's halfway up the walk
Patchett sees the cuffs hooked to his belt
Patchett is cool as can be
Are you Pierce Patchett
am
Are you soliciting for police charities
The last time, you people called at my office
'm a homicide detective
Where were you last night
was here, hosting a party
Who was killed and why do you think can help
Richard Stensland
don't know him
Mr
Officer White
How about Susan Lefferts
You know her
(sighs, concedes) You know  do or you wouldn't be here
How did you find me
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve
This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go
Of course
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl
'm investigating
Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options
Patchett's burly  starts over from the house
Everything alright, Mr
Patchett
(waves him off) Fine, Philip
Thank you
Where's the other guy
Buzz
He no longer works for me
(a beat) Find Susan's killer, Mr
White
'll give you a handsome reward
Whatever you desire If only Jack had been around to hear that
Thanks, but no thanks
Against your code
don't have one
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it
How come
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder
No
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them
That's right
Then listen closely, because 'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, 'll deny it
run call girls
Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts
treat my girls very well have grown daughters, myself, and don't like the thought of women being hurt
sense you share this feeling
(ignores comment) Why were Lefferts' eyes black
think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket
She is -- was -- a big doubles fan
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially
Wait
Our deal still holds
Bud nods, his patience running thin
needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio
What little studio
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake
use girls who look like movie stars
Sometimes employ a plastic surgeon
That's why her mother couldn't her
Jesus fucking Christ
No, Mr
White
Pierce Morehouse Patchett
Now,  sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all 'll give you
If you persist, 'll meet you with my attorney
Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address
doubt she knows anything, but -- got her address
Of course
this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr
White
Bud turns, heads down the walk
Patchett hits his golf ball
It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest
Ice

We hear a
1736  ( ') - The film is This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake
It's projected on a wall in front of which stands Lynn Bracken and an  , in his underwear
Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye
She looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake
The film flashes over them as they kiss
The
Lynn ignores it as long as she can before breaking away to go answer it
Hello
(Alan Ladd) Is it the cops
She waves him off
As he practices pointing his finger like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the phone
9781   - South Central plywood and tar-paper dive pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the porch
Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and Exley till they're almost on top of him
Leonard Bidwell
The Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath
Looking them over, he finally nods
How's the left these days
What's it to you
saw you fight Kid Gavilan like your style
What do you want, Mr
Policeman
You got a brother up in Folsom know because  put him there
Till 19-fucking-70
How'd you like to make it 1960 know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte
Exley nods, this is true
The Boxer's still listening
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns
One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket
You wanna buy your brother ten years
You don't have to say anything
Just look at this list and point
Here
Jack holds the  list out to the Boxer, who waves it off
He's bad, so 'll just tell you
Sugar Ray Coates
Drives a '49 coupe, a beautiful ride
Don't know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs
He is righteous trash
Jack and Exley scan the list
Jack's finger stabs down on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414
" That's five minutes from here
1736  ( ') - Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled Older Gentleman out the door
don't understand, doll, we just got started
'm sorry, but 'll make it up to you
promise
Gosh, kitten,  don't know
As he begins to mash up against her
(
) Hit the road, gramps
Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs
The Older Gentleman strikes a pose
He still thinks he's Alan Ladd
Alright
This time 'll go, but next time -- (flips badge) , shitbird
Get the fuck out of here or 'll call your wife to come get you
Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth
've been expecting you
Pierce called
Told me what happened to Sue
1736  ( ') - nice breezy feel
The perfect place to shack up
It's Officer White, isn't it
Bud nods, eyeballs the place
Can  get you a drink
Yeah, plain scotch
Bud watches her move to the bar
God, she's beautiful
was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends
You know what  mean
Are you sorry she's dead
Of course  am
What kind of question is that
She steps back with a scotch for both of them
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland
No  haven't
Do you know why Pierce is humoring you
You use words like that, you might make me mad
Yes
But do you know
Yeah  know
Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side
He doesn't want any attention
That's right
Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl
don't know
never heard of the Nite Owl till today
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend
Like  said we were friendly, not friends
How'd she meet Patchett
Pierce meets people
Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood
This is how they turned out
Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little
Tell me about Patchett
He's waiting for you to mention mention
You want some advice, Miss Bracken
It's Lynn
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or 'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears
Lynn smiles again
She likes Bud
beat
remember you from Christmas Eve
You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White
Maybe 'm just fucking curious
You say 'fuck' a lot
You fuck for money
There's blood on your shirt
Is that an integral part of your job
Yeah
Do you enjoy it
When they deserve it
Did they deserve it today
'm not sure
But you did it anyway
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today
(laughs again) Actually, it was two
You're different, Officer White
You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me  look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute
You look better than Veronica Lake
Now, Pierce Patchett He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us
He makes us quit the life at thirty
He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us
Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake
No
'm really a brunette, but the rest is me
And that's all the news that's fit to print
Lynn starts toward the door
Bud watches her a moment, then follows
She takes his glass at the door
It was nice meeting you, Officer
Out the door, Bud turns back
Blurts: Look
want to see you again
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment
(suddenly unsure) don't know
(another smile) If it's a date  think you'd better tell me your first name because  -- (feeling foolish) Forget  asked
It was a mistake
Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away
He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off
last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car
- An -shaped walk-up
Jack coasts the car to the curb
He leaps out with Exley
Exley holds up at the sight of a late model sedan
He leans down to look in the window at the two-way on the dash
Shit Someone beat us here
from the carport ahead
We see a chrome bumper, the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe
door slams
Drawing a
45, Jack starts over with Exley,
38 in hand
Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel, Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury
Jack and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns
Hey
Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber
He very nearly fires before he sees who it is
What the fuck are you guys doing here
Think of us as back-up
What do you got
As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window
Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box of double-ought buck and cash
Jack spots them
Three shotguns on the passenger side floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills
So long, Vice
Badge of Honor, here  come
Fuck you, Vincennes
It's our collar
Breuning actually has to restrain his partner
Quiet
'm ranking officer here
We go as a team
End of story
-   - Breuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley bringing up the rear
Squinting, Exley reaches to his pocket for something
Not there
Damnit
What
Glasses
(chuckling) Just don't shoot me
The door to 414
Two men on either side
Breuning rears back
Jack rears back
They kick at the same instant
The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black men,   and  , waking from a couple of flop mattresses
414 Fontaine jumps up
Entering, Carlisle aims, but Exley grabs his arm
The  rips the ceiling
Jack aims
Freeze
Fontaine freezes
Jones doesn't dare get up
Ace him, Jack
Shut up, Carlisle
Jack and Exley burst into a
Another black,  , passed out on mattress, sur- rounded by empty beer cans
Jack sticks his
38 in his back, starts to cuff him
As the cuff ratchets down
- Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report, memorizing names and dates
Jack and other brass are also here along with a stenographer
So's Bud
One of these guys killed Stensland
Through tinted glass, the three suspects in three different rooms
Casitas Youth Camp
Coates twenty-two, a boxer
Manager saw them burning clothes
Satisfied, Exley sets the report down
Ed,  want confessions
'll break them, sir
As Exley steps into the #1 room, Jack joins Dudley
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap
think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of
#1  - Exley closes the door
Ray Coates is cuffed to a chair, dressed in baggy County denims
One eye swollen shut, lip split, a smashed nose with one nostril split
Exley unlocks his cuffs
drops cigarettes and amtches on the table
As Coates rubs his wrists
They call you Sugar Ray because of Ray Robinson
(no answer) They say Robinson can throw a four punch combination in one second
Do you believe that
Coates just stares at him
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray
Say what and so what
Did one of the officers work you over a little
No bite
Coates just stares back
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight
'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse
So you're twenty-two, right
Man, why do you keep asking me that
Just getting my facts straight
Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce
You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago
Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man
Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy -- never truck with no sissies
That fucking Larry
almost believed him
Believed what
Nothing, Ray
(laughs) That Larry, he's a pisser
You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry
His business is his business
Unseen by Coates, Exley reaches under the table, takes hold of one of three toggle switches
Sugar, Larry told me you went sissy up at Casitas
You couldn't do the time so you found yourself a big white boy to look after you
He said they call you 'Sugar' because you gave it out so sweet
Exley flips the toggle
#3 The speaker over Larry Fontaine's head crackles to life
(
) Larry gave it at Casitas

Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you
You ain't woofin'  did
Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog
Exley flips the switches off

Dogs got no reason to live
Oh
you feel that way about people, too
Man, what're you saying
Ray, we got the shotguns
don't own no shotguns
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator
(trembling) Say what
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes
You were seen burning them
Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good
got nothin' more to say till see a judge
Were you on hop
You were passed out when you got arrested
Were you hopped up, Ray
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me
Where do they get their stuff
Come on
Give me one to feed the
Just a little one
Coates nods
Exley flips up the toggles as he leans in
Roland Navarette
Lives on Bunker Hill
He runs a hole-up for parole absconders and sells red devils
Exley flips down the switches, stands
'm going to take a break
Exley opens the door, looks back in afterthought
You know, Ray, 'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't even asked me what this is all about
You got a big guilty sign around your neck
Exley exits
Exley enters
Masterful, Edmund
Your father would've been proud

Exley looks through the glass into #2
Larry Fontaine is weeping
piss puddle on the floor by his chair
Fontaine next, but give Jones the newspaper
want him primed
#2 Fontaine tries to control his sniffles as Exley enters
Larry, Ray Coates ratted you off
He said the Nite Owl was your idea
You want to tell me about it
No answer
think it was Ray's idea
Talk and  think  can save your life
No answer
Larry, this is a gas chamber job
If you don't talk, you'll be dead in six months
No answer
Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay
It can be you or it can be Ray
No answer
Larry, he called you queer
He said at Casitas you took it up the ass
He said -- '
The voice is strong, full of conviction
Exley glances at the mirror
Then
Why'd you burn the clothes
(sobbing) just wanted to lose my cherry
didn't mean to hurt her
Exley can't hide his surprise at this
Hurt who
Was she a hooker
Hurt who
But Fontaine is gone
Head lolling, eyes squeezing out tears
Exley steps out of the interrogation room
Dudley braces him
Don't get sidetracked
Stay with the Nite Owl
She may still be alive, whoever she is
Bud's all ears
#3 Reading, Jones has his feet on the table
Exley bursts in
This newspaper shit ain't shit
Where's the girl
Did you kill her
No answer, but Jones looks nervous
You wanted Larry to lose his cherry, but things got out of hand
Is that right
Everyone's attention is riveted, particularly Bud's
They watch, listen over the speaker
(over speaker) Kick loose, Jones
know you made her bleed, but that doesn't mean you killed her
No answer, but Jones is squirming
(over speaker) If that girl's alive, you've still got a chance on this one
(over speaker) think she's alive
(over speaker) You think Jack turns to Dudley
He's good
'll give him that
They don't notice as the chair back begins to splinter in Bud's hands
#3 Exley sits across from him, tries to wrap it up
Where is she now
(no answer) Did you leave her someplace
(no answer) Did you sell her out
Give her to some of your buddies
Tell me where the girl is
The door blasts open
Bud slams Jones up against the wall
As Exley stands, he bangs his knee on the table
Pulling a

One in six

Officer White, put down that weapon and -- Bud shoves the barrel into Jones' mouth, pulls the trigger twice

Exley arrives, steamed

You expect anyone to believe that
Get the fuck away from me
Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face
Other cops begin to take notice
The ambulance pulls out
How's it going to look on your report
It'll look like justice
That's what that fat fuck got
Justice You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard
Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart
Dudley on Exley
Four cops genuinely having trouble on Bud
And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the cops on the street

Exley drops a handful of earth on the casket, has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands

The loss of Sgt

He stares emphatically at the   who stands before him holding a manila folder
You tell Mr

The Lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs
From Lynn Bracken's apartment
The first is the Older Gentleman naked except for his socks and garters

It may surprise some, but a mature man, enlightened by the facts, can change him mind

Lynn answers in an evening gown
He gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her
Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan a look down the street
Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened silhouette behind the wheel
Smiling a bit sadly to herself, Lynn disappears inside
This is no stake-out
Bud watches after her with yearning

Johnny Stompanato enjoys the frenzien floor show

Uniforms everywhere along with Exley and Loew
Bus sits in the back
Edmund
Exley has amassed a brilliant record in his seven years with the
Recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty
It is my honor to present him with our highest honor, the Medal of Valor
Exley steps up
The Chief hangs a gold medallion around his neck
Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands
Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley
The policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm
Dudley lifts the medal from his chest
Your father would've been proud
Exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley
There are loose ends out there, Dudley
-- There always are
But there are also three men and three guns
Matched forensically
few loose ends don't matter
Something's wrong
feel it inside
Doesn't that sound crazy
Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as more bulbs flash
Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind
little self-doubt
It's natural
Just keep it inside
Between you and you
Exley considers his medal
It is an appealing thing
In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat
No one's watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows pretend smoke off the barrel
As the song ends

Loew's re- election cmpaign
Hot dogs and sauerkraut
Fishbowls stuffed with cash
Jack is here, returns a smile half- heartedly
Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter as Brett "Joe Reno" Chase speaks
This election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles
Ellis Loew represents that future
So dig deep and let's get a moral man re-elected
Applause
Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes
Chase then winks knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile
Jack scans the room
An odd moment as Jack catches his own reflection in a mirror across the way
He puts a hand to his face
Is that him
(
) Big  Jack Vincennes
Jack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching
You're back, boychick
Sid, how are they hanging
Down around my ankles
Hudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out
You remember Matt Reynolds
Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack arrested on Christmas Eve
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust
He just got off the honor farm
What's he doing here, Sid
You tight with the
, trash
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke
How'd you like a little payback
Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund
Did you know Loew was a swish
And Reynolds
He's queer too
Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues
On screen and off
'm getting him to fuck the
for a hundred bucks
(winks) That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career
Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that
Matt
Over here
As Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out
That's
Loew right there
Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew
Hudgeons realizes: You need a drink, kid
Jack, look after him a minute
Kid, this is Jack
No secrets between me and him
Hudgeons heads off
Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack
Have we met before
Yeah
Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him
Reynolds' nerves won't let him stay quiet
Was it a party
Something like that
(misreading) Oh,  know
Fleur-de-Lis party, right
Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth
Fleaur-de-Lis
'Whatever you desire
' Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars
Pierce Patchett has it all
Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information
Yeah
Me and Patchett go way back
Pierce isn't like regular people
dig him, but he scares me too
Really
How
(shakes his head) You know, when  came out to
, this isn't exactly where  saw myself ending up
Yeah
Me neither
Reynolds looks like he's going to cry
Hudgeons returns with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with sauerkraut
He hands the drink to Matt
Dutch courage, kid
Drink up
Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at Loew
don't know if  should do this
Hey, it's not like you don't know how
And Jack here has connections on 'Badge of Honor
' Pull this off and there'll be a part for you
smell a comeback
Don't you, Jack
Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug
Loew's free
Congratulate him
Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off
Hudgeons hands Jack a folded slip of paper
If Reynolds works his charms, which he will, this is the address where they'll be
Meet me at midnight
guarantee all sorts of illegal activity
Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill
Jack doesn't take it
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers
Where'd you hear that
Around
Jackie, all  know is what you know
The man is very rich
And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer
But that's it
Patchett's what  like to call 'Twilight
'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo
Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head
What can't do it
Talk to him, Jack
Tell him about the opening on the show
'm pretty sure  can get you a part on the show
But tonight
Pretend it's an acting job, kid
Showbiz
And no one'll know about this
It'll be our secret
Showbiz
Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off
Jack and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew who's captivated
Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog, gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp

cauliflower-eared Cleveland mob enforcer on the hotseat
Breuning works him with a rubber hose as Dudley asks unanswered questions
Bud watches, revulsion growing
Where did you intend to start
Prostitution
Gambling
(no answer) Go back to Cleveland, lad
This is the City of Angels and you haven't got any wings
More screams as the hose thwops down
Bud looks away, then shuffles blindly out of the room
-  - Bud runs water in the sink to drown out the
It doesn't work
Finally, he leans down and sticks his head under the stream of water
That doesn't work either
- Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car
The tires spit gravel as he tears away
Dudley appears in the doorway, watching curiously
As cauliflower continues to '  - 1736  (') - Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment,  Colored lights play on the windows
Shadows pass
Finally the front door opens
There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman goodnight
Bud watches the man into a waiting limo
As it pulls away
1736  ( ') -   - Now Lynn just looks tired
As she puts away Scotch bottles and picks up empty glasses, there's a  on the door
Lynn sighs, become sultry Veronica Lake before our eyes
- (opening door) Did you forget some -- Bud stands there, filling up the door frame
wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White
It's Bud
Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet
Embarrassed
She smiles
You should see yourself
You look like you're ten years old
Bud looks back up
Lynn's smile fades as she studies his face
She's not going to ask questions
Lynn looks at him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde hair covering one eye
If you'd called first,  wouldn't look this ridiculous
' (1736 ) -  - Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back
Bud goes slow, gently, takes time with his kisses:  like she was a lonely woman he wanted to love to death
Lynn plays off his timing:  her kisses back, her touches
Finally, Bud forces himself to stop
He pulls back so he can see her
You're wondering if Patchett told me to be receptive
Bud doesn't answer, but yes
It doesn't matter
like you, Bud
really do
She kisses him
Softly, drawing it out
Not a job
She wants to make love to him
And as Bud stops thinking
5261   () - Jack sits in his car waiting
He checks his watch
1:30
Well past midnight
Come on, Sid
Where are you
Jack decides
him as he gets out and crosses the street
The apartment is dark, the front door a few inches ajar
Suspicious, Jack listens
Dead quiet
He enters
5261   - No one here it seems
Till Jack nearly trips over a body
Matt Reynolds
Soaked in blood
Throat slit
Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back up at him
Jack stumbles out the door
We hear his shut, the  of  down the street

Sid, cut the crap

Jack grabs him, jerks him into the door frame
Shut up
(confused) What's wrong, Trash
What happened with the kid and Loew
You didn't get my message
It got called off
The kid chickened out at the last minute
He's dead
was just there
Somebody slit his throat
Jesus
Jack, that's a story
'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade
' Let me get my camera
Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him
Loew didn't go with him
You're sure
put Reynolds in the cab myself
The night cost me a hundred scoots and  got bupkis
Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night
Jackie
Big
Let me get my camera
Where are you going
- The  walks down the bar to where Jack arrives
What'll it be, Jack
(pulls out wallet) bottle of Scotch
As the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds is the President Grant fifty
The things he's done for fifty bucks
As he looks up with despair at his reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a bottle and shot glass
He plucks the fifty from Jack's hand
Jack grabs the bottle and starts out
Hey
Your change

SHe traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling
Who was that guy who was here earlier
Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small white scar
It doesn't matter
All they get is Veronica Lake
You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken
(re: scar) Where'd this come from
When  was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother
guess got in the way
So you saved her
Yeah
But not for long
Bud looks away
Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about it
Do you like being a cop, Bud
used to
What  do now is strong-arm
Sitting duck stuff
No,  don't like it
If  could work Homicide like a real detective
Lynn listens sympathetically
Bud's opening up
There's something wrong with the Nite Owl
That prick Exley shot the wrong guys
But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there
Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest
In here  know it
But  can't prove it
'm not a detective
'm not smart enough
'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless
Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of himself
Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her
You found Patchett
You found me
You're smart enough
Be a detective if that's what you want
That simple, huh
Lynn nods
That simple

Clean
More or less

asked my men, Lieutenant
No one remembers any colored guys firing shotguns
Then who phoned in the report
Not us

Bud White, what brings you down to the basement
got a few Nite Owl questions
don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed
'm tying up loose ends
Padding my report
You know how it goes
What do you want to know
Anything off
Anything that didn't make sense
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous
can't think of anything
Pinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall
Bud pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table
We see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor
Whose shoe
Susan Lefferts
(pointing) If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way
What are these smears in the blood
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away
But she's moving away from the door
(thinks; points) Who was sitting at this table
Dick Stensland
(a beat) Had to be dumb panic
If she knew him she would've been sitting with him
Right
Bud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place
Pinker remembers something
You know, there is one thing
Pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands Bud
Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls
Cotton balls
found them just inside the meat locker door
Ear plugs Exactly
At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic
What do you mean
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in
Yeah, so
Bud just stares at the picture of Susan Lefferts

Ma'am, 'm sure she was
Mrs
Lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter
Susie,  told you  didn't approve of that boyfriend
He was too old for you
You let him come into this house and be fresh to me went out one day and old Mrs
Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus
What was that boyfriend's name
We were never properly introduced
Susan and  were fighting that day
She called him by a nickname
Muns or Lunts or something
Stens
Was it Stens
Maybe
don't know
Look at a picture for me
Bud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana
Out of uniform
She recognizes him
That's him
That's him
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus
Was it outside, inside
Mrs
Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door
Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it
don't know
You'll have to leave now, Officer
Bud starts for the closed door
What's through here
No
Please leave
Bud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into
Innocuous except for the smell
It hits Bud right off
Don't mind the smell
think a rat died behind the wall
My Susie was a good girl
Easy
Tell me about the ruckus
came home that night and there was blood on the floor
Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself
They were acting nervous
And that Stens kept going under the house

Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door

There's a long burlap sack ahead
It smells bad
Bud rips burlap

Bud sweeps a forearm at them
As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked human skull staring back, a
38 hole in the forehead
Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further
He pats the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet
Bud checks the
"Turner Meeks

Buzz Meeks
Holy shit

Mrs
Lefferts is there

Anything bothering you about the case

That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss
Officer White

No signs of foul play

You talk only to me on this one
'  - Sitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962
He flips one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp
Jack remembers something Matt Reynolds told him
He dials the phone
Yeah
Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting
need the home address on a Pierce Patchett
(
) Please hold, Sergeant
As Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him
need to speak to you
Give me a minute, will ya
Exley clicks off the phone
Damnit
What want you to follow Bud White
Even 'm not that crazy
It's not a request
need to know what White knows
Follow him or 'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor
'  Permanently
Yesterday that might've meant something
Pull me off
You'd be doing me a big favor
Yesterday yes, today no
What happened last night
Transfer me, suspend me
Just leave me alone
You make a mistake
Yeah
My whole life
Jack stands, heads out
Exley follows; he needs help
Listen,  think  made a mistake, too
ain't a priest, Lieutenant can't hear your confession
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings
What
It's a simple question
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Lieutenant Exley watches as Jack continues down a hall
Then: Rollo Tomasi
Jack stops, looks back at him
Is there more to that, or do have to guess
Rollo was a purse snatcher
My father ran into him off duty
He shot my father six times and got away clean
No one even knew who he was
made the name up to give him some personality
So what's the point
Rollo's the reason  became a cop
wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it
It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo
But somewhere along the way  forgot all that
How about you, Jack
Why'd you become a cop
Jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead
don't remember
Both men are quiet a moment
'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but sure as hell can't see one
've given up angles for awhile
just want to solve this thing
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant
want to do it right
So does Jack
Okay, college boy, 'll help you
But  want half the collar
third
don't think we can make a case without Bud White
- Packard pulls up out front
Bud gets out, heads inside
Another car pulls up across the street
Watching Bud
Jack gets out, starts across the street
-  - At the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins him
Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles anyway
Wendell White, how's tricks, paesano ain't your paesano , you wop cocksucker
Nervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer
What do you want, officer You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks
He works for a guy named Patchett
Johnny taps his ring harder
The bottle almost tips
Should
His file listed you as a known associate
Now spill
Oh, yeah
That was a long time ago
Before your day
The last few years he's been muscle for hire
But  heard he's disappeared
More
More's gonna cost you
Bud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch
How 'bout  give you your balls back
(in considerable pain) Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin
Bullshit
Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin
Deuce Perkins
Mickey 's narcotics lieutenant
The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing
Bud loosens his grip
Stompanato gasps for air
Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato
Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out
Stompanato's recovering
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo
And he don't smell too good
What happened to the heroin, Johnny
don't know
swear it
Bud starts to raise a hand
Stompanato cringes, but Bud just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes
-   - Jack's on the phone to Exley
He's in the Brown Derby with Johnny Stompanato
(sees Bud exit) Check that
gotta go
1736  ( ') - Jack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door
It opens and Bud steps in
Jack doesn't see who opens it
- 1736  ( ') - There's movement in the underbrush
Jack appears, followed by Exley
Jack pulls a gun as they near a window
What's that for
Bud White
He sees us and we're dead
They press up to the glass for a partial view
Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet
Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look
This isn't the Bud White they're used to
pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin
The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman
It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake
Only the hair's not over her eye
They stand, kiss again
Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles
Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom
long beat before
Jesus
Maybe White's not so dumb after all
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White
What the hell's going on
Movie star hookers
Whatever you desire
It's Fleur-fr-Lis again
What's Fleur-de-Lis
High line whores
With plastic surgery to look like movie stars
And who knows what else
It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett
You want to talk to him
Yeah
But first  want to brace Stompanato
-  - Exley and Jack enter
Check the bar
got the restaurant
Exley scans
There's Stompanato with a girl who looks amazingly like "
" Engrossed, Stomapanato doesn't look up till Exley's nearly on top of him
Hey, you want an autograph, write to --
Since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs
What As Stompanato stands, Exley flashes his badge
Sit down
"" Who in the hell do you think you are
Take a walk, honey, before  haul your ass downtown
"" Who in the hell do you think are You are making a large mistake
As Jack arrives, Lana tosses a drink in Exley's face
"" Get away from our table
(grabs her wrist) Shut up
Being cut to look like Lana Turner doesn't mean you are Lana Turner
Jack pulls him aside
She is Lana Turner
What
She is Lana Turner
'  - Rolling
The sky glows ahead
How was  supposed to know
moment before Jack begins to laugh
Exley joins him
1184   ( ') - Exley's Plymouth is parked on the street
1184   (') -  - In a silk robe, the unflappable Pierce Patchett smiles at Exley
Jack stands alongside
believe the Nite Owl's your area of expertise, Mr
Exley
saw you on television getting your medal
(turns to Jack) And you're that other celebrity Hollywood policeman, aren't you
beat
Exley and Jack don't look like they appreciate being joked with
Patchett finally sighs
'll tell you what  told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death
(a look to Jack) Bud White's been here
For the last time
may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores
vulgar term, but yes
What's her name
Lynn Bracken
Why's she seeing Bud White
Why do men and women usually see each other
Anything else you want to add before  talk to her
No
Not good enough
(unfazed) Then try talking to my lawyer
Good evening, gentlemen
1184   - Exley and Jack head for the car
Guy's as cool as they come
call  in over Exley's
Exley picks up
This is Exley
(
) Ray Pinker wants to talk to you, Lieutenant
Says he has your
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him
What are you going to do
'm going to Lynn Bracken's
'll meet you at the Dining Car
Great
You get the girl,  get the coroner
(1184  ) - Watching Exley and Vincennes from the window, Patchett picks up the phone, dials
(
) (over phone) Hush-Hush Off the record and on the
1736  (') -   - on the door
Lynn answers to reveal Exley
Miss Bracken, 'm Lieutenant Exley
know who you are
You're the policeman Bud told me about
Really
What did White say
He said you were smart
He also said you were competing with your dead father
How did he put it
Trying to measure up to a ghost
Exley lets it pass
As he enters
Let's concentrate on my smarts
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he
He taught you how to dress and talk and think and  am very impressed with the results
But need some answers and if  don't get them, 'm going to take you and Patchett down
He can take care of himself and 'm not afraid of you
And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant
Pierce also taught me how to fuck
Can  get you a drink
Exley can't help but smile
Lynn smiles back
Scotch
Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks
'm curious about you
Why
She hands him his drink
Because Bud hates you more than he loves me
Exley stews
Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass
It galls you that  know so much about you
You don't have information to compete
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken
The way you've underestimated Bud White
Exley's had it
menacing step forward
Lynn's smile becomes a laugh
Lost to himself, Exley leans in and kisses her
Lynn pulls back, then kisses back
In a beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes
As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror
- Two-way glass
Sid Hudgeons is in here pictures
As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic lovemaking
- Ray Pinker rubs his tired eyes
God bless dental records
Stiff used to be a cop
Turner Meeks
Buzz Meeks
You knew him
Of him
He was around when first joined the force
bad egg
Pinker could care less
As Jack's wheels turn
-   - Jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939 and 1940
Reading one headed "Meeks," Jack lets out a low whistle
He's found something
- Jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously
Come on, Exley
Where are you
1736  (') -   - Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor
They're quiet
Then, through a smile: How was
Oh, the best  ever had
Absolutely the best
(laughs) You sound like you mean it
The silver screen's loss is your gain
How about White
You want to know what Bud's like in bed
She actually embarrasses him with that one
want to know why you see him
Is it a Patchett payoff
see Bud because  want to see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him
'll take your word for it
see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money
see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is
There's more if you want to hear it
Exley shakes his head
He's heard enough
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier
don't hate White
really don't
It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for
You don't like that you don't know how to play him
He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do
That makes him dangerous
You cut to the heart of things, don't you
What about Lynn Bracken
She going to be a hooker all her life
came out here with a dream
That's gone, but  settled for reality
Some reality
No
This is the means to the reality
But 'm not going to tell you what it is
Why not
Because you'll use it against me
Won't you
Exley doesn't answer, but the answer is yes
Lynn smiles
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are
(smiles) You're the first person to ever call me tough
Like recognizes like
'm pretty tough, myself
You, me and White, huh
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside
As Exley kisses her
Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust
9608  () - Jack knocks at a darkened house
The porch lights come on
The door opens to reveal Dudley Smith in his bathrobe
John Vincennes
It's three
, lad
Two minutes, Dudley
It's important
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara
9608  -  - Jack sits at the table while Dudley makes coffee
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley
disgrace as a policeman
Straight  fitness reports from every
he ever served under
What about him
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland
They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam
Guy ran hookers
He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail
Charges got dropped
Insufficient evidence
You were supervising officer on the case and  was wondering if you remember anything about it
What's this all about, lad
Part of it has to do with a murder
've been working with Ed Exley on it
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide
And since when do you work with Edmund
It's a private investigation fucked something up and  want to make amends
(smiles, then
) Don't start trying to do the right thing, John
You haven't had enough practice
Dudley walks over, hands Jack his coffee
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John
No
Not even with Exley
Jack shakes his head
Dudley raises a
He it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart
Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the linoleum
Jack opens his mouth to speak
His lips form the words, but no sound comes out
Dudley crouches down beside him
Have you a valediction, lad
Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear
As he dies
Rollo Tomasi
Dudley frowns in ignorance at the name
-   - Nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their own
Dudley is at the podium along with Exley
Dozens of detectives take notes, including Bud White
Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning
Killed by a single
38 round to the heart
One of our own, gentlemen
We cannot tolerate it
Justice must be swift and merciless
That's all
As the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley
Edmund, a word with you
We received a tip this morning
Did Vincennes ever mention the name Rollo Tomasi
Exley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from the grave
Screaming the name Dudley
No
Where'd the tip come from
Anonymous
Probably nothing
As Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go
Scared
-  '  - Bud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell
You're not your old, cruel self anymore
need proof that the extracurricular work  had planned for you remains within your grasp
What work
've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation
That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely
Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell
() (') Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it
Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated
But don't stop there
Extrapolate
Imagine the police in control
It's big, lad
You lost me, Dudley
don't know what you're talking about
You have your extracurricular secrets,  have mine
We'll hold a clarification session soon
For now,  need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel
We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes
Can  count on you
Sure, boss
Sure you can
- Pinker looks up as Exley enters
want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night
Anything and everything
Start with the
on the corpse
put-upon Pinker sighs
An ex-cop
Buzz Meeks
pulled his police academy photo
Pinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of Meeks
he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl
Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother
It's not a good week for ex-cops
got Vincennes in the next room
It's not a good week for cops in general
- has turned the courtyard into a mud bath
As usual, a light burns in room six
Bud White parks alongside the other cars already here
He makes a dash for the door
-   - Sid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat
Dudley sits across from him
Dudley's henchman Breuning looms
Bud enters
This is Mr
Hudgeons, Wendell
'm happy to cooperate
You don't need to tie me down
It's for your own safety
Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes
Trashcan Jack
The Big
can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios
Breuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head
Take it easy
didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean
But you were business associates
What does that have to do -- Breuning cuffs him again
Okay so we worked together
It was an information exchange got him first class collars and he got me good stories
We were friends for Chrissakes
Alright
We'll drop that line for now
Next topic
Please comment on Pierce Patchett
Bud looks over at mention of the name
You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced
Dudley sighs, looks to Bud
Wendell
want full and docile cooperation on all topics
Hudgeons flinches as Bud steps up, twice Breuning's size
Okay
Okay
Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks
From aviation, freeway construction
But the man has hobbies, too
He bankrolls movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers
And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer
All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o
And
And what
Bud digs a fist into Hudgeons' gut
As Hudgeons gasps to get his breath back
Reciprocity, Mr
Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships
He runs call girls
Primo tail
Fixed up like movie stars
Bud looms, rests his hands on the back of Hudgeons' chair
He doesn't like where this is going
And
In my car
Blackmail shit
The trunk under the carpet
Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa -- Wooden slats pop as Bud tears the bolted chair right out of the floor
Hudgeons and the chair land sideways
Wendell
Bud can't hear him
He uprights the chair one-handed
As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and Dudley
This is no act
They can barely hold Bud back
Get him away from me
Bud breaks free, heads outside
- '  - Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with a ferocious yank
He tears at the carpeting
manila envelope
Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley and Lynn spill out
Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his Packard and tearing out of there
-  6 - Dudley and Breuning watch from the door
wouldn't trade places with Edmund Exley right now for all the tea in China
Breuning laughs
So does Hudgeons
Dudley,  thought you were gonna let the dumb bastard kill me
(to Breuning) And you
Learn to pull those punches a little better
Dudley and Breuning stare at him
bit grimly
You can uncuff me now, fellas
But no one moves to do so
Fellas
(nervous) We had a deal
You, me and Patchett,  We're a team
(scared) Come on, we're friends
We're -- As Hudgeons protests, Dudley slaps a hand over his mouth
Hush-hush
As Breuning and Carlisle move in
-  - wormish  searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939 and 1940
The same ones Jack looked through
Exley steps over from another row
Anything
Nothing
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43
Someone must've pulled the records
Exley ponders the implications
Taking out the photo of Meeks, he gets an idea
Where are the police academy files
don't have time
have -- Just show me where they are
1736  ( ') - Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down
on the wet street as Bud's  pulls up
She watches as he gets out and starts for the house
Lynn stands, holds her arms out
Bud stops short on the steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him
Did you talk to Exley
Come in out of the rain
In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast
Lightning flashes
Bud shakes hs head
want to know about Exley
He's the opposite of you
He's more like me
Cold, calculating
How'd you get to know so much about him
More lightning
Lynn looks God-awful sad
Come in out of the rain, Bud
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley
We talked
So tell me about it
(looking away) In the morning
No
Now
(a beat) You fucked him
Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods
thought  was helping you thought -- Bud backhands her, hard
Lynn faces straight into the next one as Bud hits her again
third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son
Bud stops short as the self-realization slams home
Lynn waits stoically
She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back into the rain
-  - Drawers are open
Files are everywhere
Exley's reached the end of the line
As he looks through one last file, he finds a stack of official photos
Then he stops short
There's a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor
Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick Stensland
The instructor is Dudley Smith
Exley looks up at the sound of  and Bud is there
Fury
He slams Exley, knocks him flat
Bud's here to kill him
He hauls Exley up, pummels him, then throws him over the table
Then up into a wall
Plaster cracks
Bud's on some gonzo animal plane
Bud strangles him
Exley gags
It'll be over in moments
Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's
38
Yanking it from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead
Bud reels
But, blind with rage, he moves back in only to have the barrel of the
38 placed right between his eyes
Why
Lynn
She told you
Bud shakes his head
He's coiled, ready to make a move
Who told you
Did Dudley have anything to do with you finding out
Bud hesitates, the answer obvious
Listen to me
Dudley killed Jack
It has something to do with Buzz Meeks
Exley points out the academy photo on the floor
Look
Dudley and Meeks go way back
Stensland, too
Bud sees, but does he really
As Bud reaches for the photo, Exley relaxes slightly
Bud slaps the gun away, drops Exley to the ground
He grabs, begins slamming his head into the floor
Think, goddamn you
Think
Exley's almost out
But maybe Bud heard him
The attack slows, stops as Bud does think
Exley stays conscious
knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other
Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve
The night  met Lynn
Lefferts' mother
ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them
Stensland and Meeks
What were they up to
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot
Stensland and Buzz Meeks Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants
When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus
Then something goes wrong
Meeks gets killed
Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house
(a beat) The night he died, Stens was all mysterious
Said he had something big going down
The Nite Owl
Stensland was going there to sell the heroin
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all
It wasn't the Negroes
The Griffith Park report was a phony
And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl
Dudley
The first guys to the car when Jack and  got there were Bruening and Carlisle
Dudley's guys
They didn't find the shotguns
They planted them
It all keeps coming back to Dudley
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl
They just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in
Pierce Patchett figures in, too
That's the angle Jack was working
Dudley must work for Patchett
Let's just kill them
What
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way
've been trying to be smart detective
But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice
Stay smart, Bud
We build a case
We play by the rules
There are no rules
Why the fuck are you doing this
The Nite Owl made you
You want to tear all that down
With a wrecking ball
You want to help me swing it
Bud smiles
For a second he likes Exley
Let's go see Pierce Patchett
Run a good-cop-bad-cop
Which one are you and which one am 1184   ( ') - Exley and Bud make their way up the walk
Bud pulls his 38 from its shoulder holster, shoves it in his waistband
You expecting problems
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle
Exley  the
Looking back, Bud sees a pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the grass
single ball floats in the koi pond
Bud's eyes narrow at the sight
Not like Patchett at all
Come on
And Bud shoulders the heavy door right off its hinges
1184   -  - Bud draws his
38 as he strides in
Exley tries to keep up
(a screaming whisper) What
Double doors on the left open into a library
Bud stops short, slowly lowers his gun
Exley steps up beside him
Hanging from a ceiling light, Patchett's body slowly twists around, a toppled chair beneath him
don't think his ex-cop did him much good
Bud goes to the body while Exley heads for a side table on which rests a typed sheet of paper
Bud checks Patchett's right hand, the knuckles are split, two of the fingers badly distended
It's a suicide note
Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running
He had help getting up there
Two of his fingers are broken
We had one thing figured wrong don't think Dudley workd for Patchett
At least not anymore
Patchett's dead
He sent you after me
'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends
(it hits him) Lynn Bud dashes to the , dials
It
No one answers
got a guy who owes me in the Sheriff's department
West Hollywood station
He can be at her house in two minutes
Bud shoves the phone into his hand
Call him
1736  ( ') - county sheriff's unmarked parked out front behind the wheel
Exley's Plymouth pulls up behind
The Deputy gets out
him as he steps Exley, who's rolling down his window
Is she inside
We took her to Hollywood Station for safekeeping
Someone worked her over pretty good
She wouldn't say who
Exley looks at Bud
Bud looks down in shame
Hold her as Joan Smith
No one sees her unless  okay it
You got it, Exley
And now we're even
As the Deputy moves off
Ellis Loew
What about him
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this
'   - looks up as Bud and Exley beeline Loew's door
You can't go in there
Loew looks up as they burst in
Do you want me to call the police, Mr
Loew
Ask for Captain Dudley Smith
We'll have a party
Hot dogs and sauerkraut
beat as Loew considers his options
It's okay
These are police
(as she leaves) What do you want
want
bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day;  want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone;  want authorization to check his bank records and  want it all in an hour
On what evidence
None
Call it a hunch
(incredulous) Absolutely not
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and won't smear his name without -- Without what, his smearing yours first
What's he got on you, Loew
Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down
Do you have any proof
The proof had his throat slit
(a beat) So far you're not denying it
'm not going to dignify youwith answers
If you'll excuse me, 've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for
Loew enters his bathroom
Bud looks to Exley who nods: Go
Loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs
Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley
Unless you're here to wipe my ass, think we're through
Bud just glares at him
Loew shakes his head
Don't try this good cop/bad cop with me
practically invented it
And so what if some homo actor is dead
Boys, girls, ten of them step off the bus to every day
The   as Bud slams Loew's face into it
Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his head in the toilet
He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath
Then backhands:  one, two, three
Dudley Smith
Spill
Call him off, Exley
don't know how
More backhands
Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck, Bud marches him past Exley and back into the
Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through it
Loew catches hold of the window framing
Bud hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him through
Bud holds his leg
Loew screams as coins, comb and wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street below
Bud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time
Bud
If  let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow
They just won't come on the bus, that's all
We hear Loew's    loose
Okay
You're right
Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds
What's Dudley's scheme
More
Loew's life may depend on the answer
Dudley's rotten to the core
He's taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets, his own hand-picked cops'll be the new franchise holders
Because of those pictures  won't be able to prosecute
Oh Jesus pull me up
Exley helps pull Loew back inside
Bud dumps him on the floor
Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley
Dudley's got everyone under his thumb
Not just me, but the Chief of Police, the lieutenant governor, everybody
Exley pulls his
38, shoves it into the side of Loew's neck
Not everybody You tip-off Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time
Loew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess
- Exley and Bud exit
Bud's wheels are turning
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers
What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room
Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn
Bud just stares at him a beat
You want to talk to her
Bud looks away, shakes his head "no
"  Finally
You do it
'll check the files
'  -   - Lynn looks up as Exley enters
her face is puffy, swollen
(dry) If  knew you were coming 'd have baked a cake
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn
Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith
blank look from her
police captain
think he's behind all of this
(shakes her head) work for Patchett
had a feeling that there was someone else, but  never knew who
Okay
Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did
(a beat) know how he feels
beat as Exley wonders how he should interpret this
don't know if it's pathetic or romantic, but when this is all over 'd like to see you again
Lynn looks away, can't help an ironic smile even as she starts to cry
As Exley gives her his handkerchief
-   - Bud waits at the cage window as a  returns with some information
got your guns, Bud
Signed in April 3rd, 1950
Remember the First Western bank robbery
They were used in that
want to see them
No can do
can't find them
As Bud thinks, a - approaches
- Uh -- Sergeant White
What - Dispatch just got a call for you
Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet him at the Victory Motel
- Bud's Packard crests the rise looking down on the Victory
Exley's Plymouth is in the courtyard
-  6 - Exley in the hotseat
Sitting there thinking
At a , he goes to the door
Exley opens the door as Bud approaches, toting a shotgun
The sun is down
The sky is just a dull glow
You wanted to meet here
Me
You called it
got a message that
As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear  on the ;  are
Being in a concavity, they don't see them yet
Then the
But still Bud and Exley can't see anything
They hear the  of , but they don't hear them shut
There are ,
More
Shit
Come on
Exley starts for his car, but Bud holds him back
Too late
beat
Resigned, Exley nods
They retreat back to Room 6, disappear inside
beat
There's  in the shadows to the left
To the right
-  6 - There's a big back window
Bud covers most of it with a ratty old mattress
He pumps the shotgun
He pulls a
45 automatic from his waistband
Here
He throws the auto to Exley, pulls out a
38
Bud's armed for bear
You figured this was a set-up
And you showed up anyway
lot of bad stuff happened here
It's as good a place as any for it to end
Bud switches off the light
They wait in silence
Then: You know, all  ever wanted was to measure up to my father
(softly) spent years trying not to live down to mine
() (') (thinking) We should block off the bathroom
They could come through -- outside the front door
Bud levels the
The  is
We see the figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt
In the darkness beyond,   from all around
Exley and Bud We hear the    under a
Bud charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men climbing through
Sitting ducks:  torn apart by -  close in
beat, then
We got him
Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering
third man looks through the window
Bud nails him
Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window
- Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room
Two sets of feet shuffling along
Bud the
Shrieks as the men go down
Bud extends the
38 to fire point blank headshots
Then
Bud flattens himself as a wicked 6
- Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down
The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in
Four men with rifles
One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard
They spot Exley lying there
Hushed whispers as they approach:  "Dead meat
"  "Be careful
"  Kicks in the side
The men look at each other, sneer
Exley jerks a foot
The foot man stumbles as Exley spins around
the
45 and his own
38
All four men go down
Exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload
Bud scrambles back through the window
Exley looks over and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun
It's dead quiet
'm thinking we might walk away from this
At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door
He's got Exley dead to rights
As he squeezes the trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the ground
The  passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder blade
It spins him around
to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley Bud's jaw, but still he comes
Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat
He even gets hold before a   tears his chest
Bud falls hard
Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud
frozen moment
'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund
Tell that to Jack Vincennes
To Stensland
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin
Through his whore girl friend
sent him to make the buy
The rest is history
Why
vacuum, Edmund
That's what we have in Los Angeles
Sending Mickey Cohen up created it
My containment work maintained it
Certain photographs guarantee it
Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides
And now you'll provide them
Absolutely
Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes
The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds
Anesthetize them
As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care
It's still a crime free city
for respectable people
Dudley aims the
38, cocks back the hammer
We hear This isn't politics, Edmund
There won't be winners and losers when it's over
Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket
Just the living and the dead
It's always been that way in the Bureau
You should've realized that before you became a detective
It's over
Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger
But Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left calf
It took all Bud had left
As he collapses
Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun
Dudley , misses
wild   takes out half the wall
Dudley stumbles out the door
- Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down
Exley steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun
The two of them are bleached white by headlights
Dudley raises his badge over his head
We're policemen
(winks) Let me do the talking
They'll make you Chief of Detectives
Exley steps ahead to block his way
No Why not, lad
Absolute justice
Something like that
Really Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis
Exley doesn't answer
Dudley smiles
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty
Exley glares
Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward the gathering policemen
Are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance they'll -- The   flame
Dudley goes down, shot in the back
Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his head
: "  "
- Riding in a convertible, waving to the crowds is the Grand Marshal -- the new Vice President, a young Richard Nixon
- midnight assembly
The Chief,
Loew and several high ranking brass
Their attention riveted the one-way glass into
#1 - Bloody, exhausted, Exley sits across from two #1 You have a lot of explaining to do, Lieutenant
Yes
do
As Exley begins
Where we're informed that tonight's episode of "Badge of Honor" is:  "Dedicated to the memory of technical advisor Sergeant Jack Vincennes

Eager motorists roll down the blacktop
'   - Ronald Reagan applauds as Jane Wyman plunges her hands into fresh sidewalk cement
- The brass exchange concerned looks and raied eyebrows as they watch Exley  the glass, his  heard the
- The Flatnose Frisco loan shark and Cauliflowered Cleveland enforcer seen earlier at the Victory Motel return to

- Hush-Hush is delivered
The headline:  "Actor Reynolds in his Final Role:  Conductor of the Night Train to Slice City
" #1 - Exley stares across at the Internal Affairs Detectives
That's it
That's the whole story
As Exley looks to the gray-tinted wall mirror
Loew leans over, whispers to the Chief
The press would have a field day with this
(a beat) When in doubt, feed them a hero
In this case, we'll need more than one
: : Fabled
Cop Dies Defending City from Organized Crime
-   - Exley in his dress blue uniform
The Chief smiles, pins gold stars to his shoulders
Captain Edmund Exley
Chief of Detectives
Los Angeles Police Department
Applause
Flashbulbs
Lynn watches from the back as Exley runs a handshake gauntlet
Finally, he spots her
She's returned to her natural brunette
Looks even better
Exley steps over
(ironic smile) tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades
- Exley walks Lynn out
Where will you go
Bisbee, Arizona
The air's good for pensioners and  know where everything is
When
Right now, before  back down
Where is he
Lynn gestures ahead
They walk to her car
She opens the back door
Bud's in the back
Braces on his legs, head sutured
Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and out
But his hands still look strong
Bud forces a smile through the wires, tries to say something, but can't
Thanks for the push
Exley takes his hand
Bud squeezes till both men wince
You just did what you did
No rank, no glory
Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand
From me to you
It'll mean something if it's yours
Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears
We should go now
As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door
noises drift from upstairs
Exley looks to Lynn
Do you think  ever could've been in the running
Some men get the world
Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona
beat
Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona
She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the
it
Exley looks back at Bud
Bud presses his hands to the glass
Exley touches his side, palms half the man's size
Hands against hands
The car moves
turn into traffic, a good-bye  on the
Exley's all alone
As he watches them go
