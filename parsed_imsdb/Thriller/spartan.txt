a screenplay by David Mamet copyright (c) 2002 by David Mamet : We see the drawn face of a young woman
Camera tracks with her as she runs through the thick woods
She is exerting herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside
She looks behind her quickly, and continues
, we see a young man, and then another, running through the woods, out of breath
They are dressed in filthy 's, and show several days growth of beard
The leader stops for a moment, and looks around
The two men separate
, the  young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over a ravine
She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to catch her  breath
She looks around, and looks back, her back to a steep  wall, a steep drop before her
, the first young man, having come up to the spot vacated by the young woman
In the  we see his colleague
He looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in the ravine
He starts to descend, and then looks up
, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep rockface
The young man regains the ledge and looks up
Camera takes him around a bend in the ledge
Standing here we discover
He is somewhat older than the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy 's
He is making a note in a small notebook, which he closes
Now, the two men look across the ravine at the young woman, seen disappearing over a ridge
(quietly) you better catch her
The man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface behind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots of trees
Several feet up, he falls on his back
He tries to work himself to his knees and winces in pain
He looks to Scott for help
your Dad's napping on the sofa, your Mom's watching Let's Make  Deal, and God is Dead
What do you expect me to do
(very weakly) 'm tired, Sir
Sir, there's no way
2
There's always a way
Don't You tell me there's no way
pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet
Scott looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives her a "hold" gesture
She stops, at his command
Scott nods, as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs
The man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet
How 'bout that
That's called 'Adrenaline'
You said you Wanted In
He moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, not heavily, but convincingly, several times
This is where you get in
The mugger don't care
The shooter don't care
get up
Or  will beat you to death on this fucken hill
Now: you better Catch her
He motions with his head
In the  we see the young woman nod, and begin running again
We see her, for a moment, breast a hill, and disappear again
, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now, of self-pity, as if he just realized something
(responding to his look
As if to say "That's right
") There's nothing but the mission
The young man begins to climb the rockface
on Scott for a moment
large, hand-painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of the rough building
It reads: These are the precincts of pain
goddess lives here
Her name is Victory
In front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier
She is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck
Camera takes her to Scott, who is holding a cup of coffee, and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier
3
She stands, waiting, as she finishes his note
Well done
( ) signal honor to work with you, sir
Thank you, Sergeant
He starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly, to indicate she has something more to say
He turns back to her
Sir: Day or Night
Black or White
You reach out for me
"Black, Jaqueline
24191489
" 'll remember, Sergeant
She nods, and walks off
Scott walks toward a mess tent
He is joined by George Blane, a very military-looking figure of an older man
He wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatched jacket and trousers, without insignia
Scott is greeted by him, as they walk toward the mess tent
Scott shows the notebook to Blane, and Blane refers from the notebook to what we see are a group of eighty young men, in the mess tent, two of them the men we saw on the hill
Blane takes the notebook and walks off, as Scott enters the mess tent
, Scott enters the tent
Several of the young men react to him
He nods to them
Among them, we see the young man Scott berated on the hill, who rises and comes over to Scott
, on Scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him a tinfoil tray with some food on it
Scott takes out a stiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the blade emerges
He begins to use it to cut up his meat
The young man from the hill, Anton, stands sheepishly near Scott, till Scott turns, acknowledging him
Anton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a credit card, old, creased cardboard: It reads, "Rogers Rangers, Rules for Engagement
1782"
There is a line drawing of a man with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it, boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style
Written on the card, in old faded ink, "
Anton,
3149584, United States Special Forces
" The young man (Anton) shows the card to Scott
4
(of the card) What's this then
It was my father's, sir
He carry it Over There
As they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules - "Dated 1759"
"Rule 4: Tell the truth about what you see and what you do - there is an army depending on us for correct information
You can lie all you please when you tell other folks about the Rangers, but don't never lie to a Ranger or an Officer"
Yes, sir
He come back
Yes, sir
He did
(nods
Pause) Well, so
Scott pauses again
As he looks at the young man, who is obviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense of occasion
You carry that card, son
It might save your life
(Anton nods) You could use it to light a fire, or something
Blane's Aide calls the men to order
' The Candidate Cadre will fall in on the White Line
The men start to come to their feet, and leave the mess tent
just wanted to say, sir
That, to meet you
5
(rising, as he gives the Ranger card back to Anton) You never met me
You've been up for a week
You're seeing Snakes
The exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line
They are happy, and joking with one another
In the  we see those who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a bus which has just pulled up
on a young man, who looks out of the window
Twenty or so similarly exhausted men, with dufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus
, on the young man, Anton, as he exits the tent, who stands next to Scott, outside the tent
Scott stands next to an old, but pristine Mustang Cobra
He withdraws a small dufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see Anton standing next to him
(looking after the departing, failed men) can't imagine how they live with it
on Scott
As he thinks a very brief moment, as if reluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to Anton
Make sure you can't imagine it, cause, if you can, it's just one step to doing it
Anton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failed men
(pause) they'll be back where they came from by Morning, and all this is just a Bad Dream
My name is
6
Do  need to know
(pause) If  want Camaraderie, 'll join the Masons
(pause
Then, summing it all up:) There's just the mission
Beat
Anton steps away
' (as he glances down at his clipboard) Congratulations on completion of this evolution
know you would probably like some sleep, but do not think you'd mind sparing ten minutes for Induction
The camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very proud young men
on Blane and Scott, off to the side
Beyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates, filling up
Thank you, Bobby
Not at all, Sir
You going home
weather permitting, Sir
' (in the distance
As camera tracks with Blane and Scott) as  call your names: (he consults his clipboard) Grossler, Anton
These two men steps forward
, on Anton, nodding to himself at the proudest moment of his life
,  Scott, looking at him
7
Camera takes Blane and Scott into a cinderblock building which houses a shooting range
We see various housefronts, and storefronts, and targets
long table along one wall holds a coffee urn
Blane draws two cups of coffee
Through the open door we see Anton and Grossler, smiling, entering the building
Anton comes into the room, and smiles at Scott
We see Scott look away, sadly
He shares a look with Blane, drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away
Blane gestures to Scott, meaning, "Shall we begin
" Scott hesitates for a moment, and then nods
, on Scott, in the , as Blane steps forward to address the two candidates
(over his shoulder, to an Aide) would you bolt the door, please
Scott gestures to the Aide, "One Moment"
(to the candidates) are you tired, Gentlemen
(the two young men smile) This is the completion of the evolution: (beat) Only one of you may join the unit
The first man through that door will be inducted
He gestures at a far door in the room
, on Scott, as he looks at the candidates, as they get the picture
Beat
(to himself, quietly) yeah
you wanted to know the 'secret knowledge'
Scott  as he looks, interrogating the   two men, weighing them, as  they look at each other
Beat
Grossler starts to advance  on Anton, in a fighting crouch
Scott gestures to the Aide  that that was what he wanted to   see
8
The Aide lets Scott out of the back door
Scott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and jeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow duffle-bag
He opens the trunk
He takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we now see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes and saws
He closes the trunk
We see the young woman from the first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with a colleague
She nods at him, and he responds
As he starts to get into the car
squad of exhausted men is marching past
As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the direction of Scott
(to that man) What the hell are you looking at
There ain't nobody there
young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which we find several earthmovers, idle
He is standing by a high chainlink fence topped with barbed wire
Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in his direction on a rough road
The young worker opens the lock on the chainlink fence and swings it open
We see a sign "McGarrity Construction Company" on the gate
The young man walks back toward a construction trailer
We see a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered desk
The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles, and grenades
Another phone, its red light blinking, is found in the cabinet
The young worker picks up this phone quickly
(into phone) Frontgate
We see his face grow serious, as he begins to write on a pad
Scott, driving, comes around a bend
9
The construction trailer up ahead
We see the young worker come out of the trailer, and stand in the road giving a "Stop" signal to the car
We see Scott bring the Mustang to a stop, and get, inquisitively, out of the car
We see the young worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper
Scott takes the paper and begins to read
He looks up, to ask a question of the young worker
We see the worker begin to respond, his body language saying "That's all  know
" As he starts to speak his words are drowned out by the sound of a helicopter
Scott looks up
helicopter, flying low
man in civilian clothes points out Scott, on the ground, to the Pilot
Through the canopy we see Scott and the construction canopy down below
The helicopter goes into a tight turn
Scott
Above him, the helicopter goes into its turn, and begins to descend in a field some fifty yards away
, the sheet of paper Scott holds
Is reads: "All hands
" Over the throbbing of the helicopter, we see Scott giving directions about the car, to the young worker
Camera takes Scott to the trunk, which he opens, and from which he retrieves his gym bag
He hands the keys to the young worker, and takes off, running, to the helicopter
, on Scott, as he is pulled up aboard, and the helicopter takes off
, over the worker, watching the helicopter disappear
Scott, asleep
As the helicopter banks low over the Charles River and Harvard College
Crewman shakes him awake
, : the helicopter descends into the field of a football stadium
black suburban is waiting
Seen through the windshield of a car
, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the boathouse
We see scaffolding being erected outside the main entrance
10
Scott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban, and proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large, paint-spattered drape
sign on a stanchion reads "Temporarily Closed For Repairs"
,
The group pushes through the drape, beyond which we see several men in suits, holding assault rifles
An older government type, , followed by an , walks up to meet the group, the Aide motions to the armed guards that Scott is to be admitted, that he is "okay"
Miller gestures to Scott that it will just be a moment
The Aide hands Scott a sheaf of papers, and leads him through the boathouse
We see the long skiffs up on their rests, the Charles River beyond
on Scott
As Scott looks through the papers
Around him we see communications equipment being hurriedly assembled
The top sheet shows a color photo of a phenomenally lovely redheaded girl in her teens
As Scott talks, he leafs through the sheets to reveal several photos of her and a man, obviously her father, holding her hand
One is a print of a glossy magazine article
(of the photo, nodding to himself, as he reads) "
Betty Coed, has hair of red for Harvard
" (of the top photo) It's not current
Why not
on them as they arrive at a small equipment room
Through the door we see a young government type, Gaines, his suitcoat off, his shoulder holster empty, being interrogated by several colleagues
It seems she got a makeover today
We're working on it
He hands a small log book to Scott, and points to an entry
Scott looks down the entries, and glances up, now and then, at the man being interrogated
11
(reads) 4PM
Cut n'Curl
Gave her a crewcut, dyed it platinum blonde
(glancing up at the man in the chair) Met with her boyfriend at ten
Then
The Aide shrugs, meaning, "That's it
" he's on Post until he turned her over to the Nightwatch
He says he was
Who else you got
Miller gestures to an associate, who comes forward, passing photos to Scott, as Miller goes to look through the glass at the young man being interrogated
we got the boyfriend, Michael Blake
where is he
We are shown a photo of an Ivy League preppy chap around 18
He is on a sailboat
Was not in his dorm last night, we're shaking the trees
And
(Scott is passed another photo) Professor Gerald Sloane, notably chummy with his female students, of which she was one
Weekend home, Martha's Vineyard
for sure
12
Been there since Friday
We see a photo, obviously from a school catalogue, of a youngish bearded man, in front of a blackboard
We see Miller in the  finish his meeting and turn to the group
'm light
'm light, people need another team on the Professor,  need an overwatch on the boyfriend
The Aide hands him a sheet of paper, obviously a roster
Scott, looking at the board
He puts down his head for a moment, and blinks his eyes, trying to clear his head
You just come from the Cadre
Yes sir
How long since you've slept
Not significant
You take a team, and Bulldog
Are you up for it
(absently, as he looks over the materials he has been given) Sir, "this Marine pisses av gas and farts blackpowder, Sir
" Thank you for coming, Bobby
Are you kidding, sir
An Associate comes over and hands him a piece of paper
Miller shakes his head
don't have the bodies
Call em in
call em in
13
on Scott
As he watches the interrogation of Gaines in the next room
The young man begins to pick up his coffee cup, and we see that it shakes
on Scott, as he gestures to Miller to look through the glass, at the young man being interrogated, who is now seen to be wiping his brow, and shaking his head
The young man tries to take a sip of coffee, and spills it, inadvertently, down his shirtfront
Scott exchanges a glance with Miller, and walks into the equipment room, to the interrogation
The man being interrogated, the government type, Gaines, is in his early thirties
He is sweating and obviously frightened
An Aide comes and stands by Scott
(whispering) His post was Harvard Yard
Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell House, across from her dorm
Nightwatch relieved him there, Midnight
, on Miller in the interrogation room
Miller nods to Scott, meaning "You know what to do
" on Gaines, as Scott enters, the interrogators step back for Miller, who is obviously their superior
He motions them to continue
Camera holds Scott throughout the following interchange, with the suspect and questioners seen reflected in the glass of the door
Once more: She, uh
She had lunch with her father
Lunch with her father - you seconded to that detail
No, sir
just had her
"
you just had her
" Uh
uh
had her all day
Tucked her in
At Ten
And she
14
yeah, "she had a tiff with her boyfriend
" Yes
Michael Blake - (he holds up a photo of a preppy fellow) What was it about
think it was about her
her
(he makes gestures of haircutting) Her haircut
(Gaines nods) So it wasn't a serious
No, no
(pause) No
(pause) And then , (he covers his mouth as he speaks) held the post until relieved
(he gestures at his notebook, as if to support him) Miller motions at Scott
Well, then, we've got a little problem
(shaking his head in denial) was there
15
(reading) 23
12 Hours, 19 May
Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell House, reveals no Secret Service Presence, neither this post nor adjacent
(he looks through his notes) a second tour, 23
30, reveals, similarly
was there, Sir
(to Gaines) Who's lying
(pause) You or him
(pause
Gaines slightly averts his head
) on Miller, who gives an infinitesimal sign to Scott who steps forward and slaps Gaines across the face
You son of a bitch, 've got fifteen years in, and three kids, and you're gonna sit there, and lie away my Pension
He makes a move toward Gaines
don't you tell me you were there
was On Post
(as he moves towards Gaines seriously) you lying swine
Don't you tell me you were On Post
Miller gestures to a couple of the types who take Scott out of the room and sit him forcefully, in a chair
cautioning him to stay still
16
Miller now stands by him
on Scott who uses the pause to review the documents he holds, the photos of the girl, of the Boyfriend, of the Professor
He picks up another glossy magazine showing the redheaded girl - the caption reads "America is Seeing Red"
Shall  tell you what's gonna happen to you, when we find you out
(he gets up and walks, wearily, toward the windows, and turns) Uh
Were you fucking her
(pause) We're gonna find out
No,
um
Where Is She
Scott turns, to Miller, who is seen, beyond the door, in conference with several government types
Scott leaves the room, and is seen, on the outskirts of the conference
We've got until her Monday Morning Class, and then it's Meet the Press; and "Where is she
" (he shakes his head) Who's got the Professor
Where is he
Martha's Vineyard
Who's got him
Jones and Shannon
17
Throughout this section camera holds Scott
As he looks through the file, the various photos, and notations, and takes notes in as small pocket notebook, in which we also see the small cardboard card of "Rogers Rangers Rules of Engagement"
(to the group) Wake him up, shake him up
He don't want to talk
(he holds out his hand, and an Aide puts some papers into it) Here's what we have him doing with his Female Students, show 'em to his wife
The Photo
(one of the agents brings in two photographs) Here is the last known photo
of the girl
on Scott, at the back of the group, taking notes
We see him holding several newsclippings
One of them shows the girl, and the headline reads "America is Seeing Red
" We see the photo blown up, of the ravishingly beautiful young girl with long red hair
It features a small, red enamel crescent earring
The second photo shows the same girl, in the same pose, but now her hair is short and platinum blonde and spiky
The agent opens two boxes and begins distributing the photos to the group
The lab ran it up, based on the testimony of the beauty shop
We have not told Boston or Cambridge , nor have we
An agent comes up and hands him a sheet of paper
The Professor
(to the associate) You had him in his home
Sir, we were in Error, we
Where is he
18
Best guess puts him on his boat
Last seen out of West Tisbury, Martha's Vine
Find him
Put the guard on him
Get me an overflight

(he points to an associate) Shake the Trees
'm light, here
'm 25 men light
Get 'em in
Who's got the Coastguard
What's the name of his boat
Professor Gerald Sloane
An Aide comes in, hurriedly
It's the boyfriend
He's moving
Miller points at Scott, who rises
've got him
(coming over to Scott) 've got two days to run in
Before the Press wakes up
(as he responds to the inherent request in Miller's voice) Whatever it takes, sir
Miller nods his appreciation
Scott exits, and we  on Miller giving orders to his group
Two students, walking through the yard
They acknowledge a uniformed security guard, who walks, with his back to us
slight, Asian young woman, her arms full of books, walks toward the camera, hurrying
She indicates something, back over her shoulder, and the guard, who is in front of the camera, walking away, veers off in that direction
19
,
young man ( ) is, furtively, working on jimmying open one of a set of mailboxes
He senses something, and turns
The Security Guard (Scott) standing just beyond a glass door, looking in at him
Scott enters, coming to camera
Could  see your hands, son
The Boy, Blake, moves his hands away from his body, to show a screwdriver
Scott motions him away from the mailbox, which we see is in the process of being demolished
Scott reads the name on the mailbox
Newton
(pause) You lose your mailbox key, Mr
Newton
(pause) Um
You a student here
Yes
Could  see some identification, please
Mr
Newton
(Scott takes out a walkie and begins to talk into it) Ten-Twelve patrol, requesting
No, please
please
(pause) Please, Oh, God
He starts to advance on Scott, who draws a nightstick, and keeps him at bay
Calm down, Son
It's gonna be what it's gonna be
20
One minute, could  please talk to you for one minute
Look look look:  broke up with My Girlfriend
The young Asian girl, now walking with a male friend, pass in front of the vestibule
Beyond them we see Blake and Scott, as Blake motions to the mailbox, and moves to the mailbox and takes out a letter
On Scott, as he watches Blake take a letter out of the jimmied mailbox
(of the letter) Laura
(he rereads the nameplate on the mailbox) Laura Newton
(pause) Laura Newton
Is that 'the' Laura Newton
We broke up
Alright
Laura Newton
They know who  am
Who
The Secret Service
The Secret Service
That's right, that's right
They know who  am
You
They've "cleared" me
(gesturing to the jimmied mailbox) They didn't clear you for this
You, you hear me out, and, if you want to, Then
(pause) Okay
Okay
(pause) 21
have to call it in
Please
please
Five minutes
That's all  want
Please
Please
She would

(his face brightens at the new idea) Maybe she's in her room
You tried the bell, you called her
(as it dawns on him) Maybe she's ill
,
Blake and Scott, as they walk up to a door
Scott knocks on the door
Mzz Newton
(pause) Mz Newton
this is Campus Security
He begins to fumble with keys at his belt
Several agents, obviously involved in investigating the room, wearing plastic gloves, stop
One, silently, unlocks the door
We   see Scott enter the room, "miming" using a key, and turn on   the light and look inside
We take him to her desk, where he   finds several photos of her and her father - and a note on   he desk, reading "Dear Dad-Thanks for coming-signed %-)"
We see the boy, Blake, out in the corridor, unable to see into the room
Mz Newton
(pause) , in the hall, as Scott and Blake stand there, a young girl comes down the hall and stops, opposite her room
22
Hey, Mike
Sprised to see you there
(smiles) That was some Vicious Performance
She smiles brightly and goes into her room
Scott looks at Blake
Blake and Scott sitting on a bench in the deserted yard
Scott holds the envelope and the letter, on which we see this symbol %-) and begin to read: "This is a sham
Your view of the world is not cockeyed, but corrupt
You cunt
And you deserve everything that is going to happen to you
" was just
trying to retrieve the letter
, on Scott, as he looks at the letter
this is not very nice language
(pause, Blake looks away) How old is this girl
She's
just turned 18
(Scott shakes his head, sadly
pause) was mad
(of the letter:) "everything that's going to happen to her"
What was going to happen to her
(pause) You hurt her
(pause) Did y'hit her, son
Hit her
No
(he gestures to the note) called her
called her a whore
Why
23
The boy bangs his head
Scott, as he rises, brings Blake to his feet
(as if realizing "This is the question") Where is she
(as if the question had not occurred to him previously) She must
she must
she must have gone home
Why
(gesturing around, quietly) Because the Secret Service, isn't
As they walk by a parked van, we cut inside the van
Where we see a Secret Service type
Through the windshield we see Scott gesture "Do Not Intervene
" , on Scott and Blake, as they walk down the near- deserted Mass Ave
(of the sign on the letter,the "Picasso" sign, that is %-}
He turns the sign rightside up to show it is a 'cockeyed smile') What is this sign
It's how she signs her letters
(smiles) Cause she looks at everything cockeyed
Like Picasso - she said they called her "Picasso"
(pause) Who called her that
24
You know, her, her
(remembering) He saw her yesterday
Maybe she's
maybe she's with him
Why'd you fight with her, Son
(pause) She, uh, she got her hair done
She cut it off
She dyed it blonde
said she looked like a slut
and
(pause) Beautiful young girl like that
We've all seen her pictures
What'd you care how she dyed her hair
(pause) What'd you care
Why's that make her a slut
(pause) She
(pause) Uh
She seeing another fella
(as he moves closer, confidingly) just between us
Off-the- record, son
,
We hear the conversation, and see the tape machine moving
(
) was young once, too
(
) Blake and Scott
25
know that nothing hurts worse than that
She seeing another guy
(pause) There's this, um
Teacher shouldn't, ,  shouldn't tell you this: She
She sleeping with a teacher
She says she isn't
said she looked like a slut
She wants to fuck old guys, she should go to The Regency
Go all the Way
The Regency, what's that
(as if everyone knows this place) 'the Club, by the Fenway
it's like a joke at school, it's like a rumor: this or that girl, made a thousand bucks, went with a businessman for One Night
Look: it's a Lover's Quarrel said something  regret
sent her a note which  regret, and assure, you, Officer
If
(pause) If you would
From inside the windshield of the van we see, through their body language, that Scott is "giving the boy a break", the boy is very thankful
Scott is admonishing him and the boy is contrite
Now Scott begins to walk away, and we see him minutely, signal to the van, we see the driver of the van pick up a phone and speak softly into it
, Scott, walking down a sidestreet
The boy in the , we see the young Asian girl, take up a tailing position some half-block back of the boy, as a car glides to the curb
And Scott gets in
, tight on Scott in the car, as he rubs his eyes, beyond exhaustion
The car pulls away
26
He gives several instructions to the young man driving, and then leans back, eyes closed
He opens his eyes again, and we see him mouth, insistently, "The Regency"
The driver nods
As Scott enters
The activity is more widespread than previously
An agent walks him into the fray
No morgue
No hospital
No note
The parents
Agent, nods, shrugs
The mother, (makes a "drinking" gesture) You know where she is
He's holding up
(as an afterthought) He was in town yesterday
To see her
(as he shakes his head - to clear it) He was
we snuck him in, and out
We see Miller, in the , in a hurried conference, nod at Scott
(looking at a chart) "The Colophon - 36-foot sloop"
Where is she
They walk off, an Aide talking to him
the Coast Guard has a watch over this area: (he points to the chart) And they have scheduled the Colophon first
Scott and the Agent stop in front of the interrogation room, where we see the agent, Gaines, a guard over him
Gaines is sitting, looking as if he had been weeping
The guard addresses Scott and the other agent
27
He copped to it
He copped to what
(of Gaines) Off-post - punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend
Scott shakes his head as if to say "How about that
" The agent holds a photo of a very lovely Eurasian woman in a business suit, and shows it to Scott
Hope she was worth it
Uh huh
Scott stands wearily, watching several large men berating the seated Secret Service Agent
An agent appears with a tearsheet showing the ad for "The Regency Club"
We see the ad for exotic young companions, and the address is Boston
Scott gives instructions to the Aide
Scott, having stripped off his shirt, is washing himself at the sink
The "Regency" ad, and a description of the club is pasted with water to the mirror before him
We read, in the mirror: "
243 Charles Street, Boston, Mass
Owners of Record
" Et Cetera
In the mirror we see the Aide bring a fresh shirt and a tie to Scott
Scott turns, as the door swings, and he sees, in the , , just entering the establishment
Swat team is laying out its weapons and assault gear, on a long table
on Anton, who is standing, unassigned, and looking it
We see, on an improvised bulletin board, photos of the Boy, Blake, the Professor, and the Girl, blown up from a newspaper shot, and in various photos
As we watch an Agent walks up with a box full of photos, and tacks one up on the board
It is an altered shot showing the young girl with short, spikey platinum hair
on Scott, dressed in a clean shirt, a tie, as he takes a photo from the box
We see him put it next to the original, blonde photo, and look at both
28
We ran it up from a description of the colorist from the Beauty Parlor
Gimme your coat
The Agent takes off his suitcoat, and gives it to Scott, who puts it on
, on Scott, as he holds the photos, and the Regency description
He walks toward the door, through the mass of agents
He stops by Miller, who is on the phone, looking at a photograph of the Professor, as a tech hooks up a video feed of a house on the water, the Professor's house
photo of a sailboat is tacked up
We read 'The Colophon' on its stern
(to Miller) need five thousand dollars
Miller gestures "Just a Moment", and then waves to an Aide, meaning "Do It"
How long do we have
Sir
(shakes his head) It hits the papers, and we're done
No
note
No
Miller shakes his head, he holds up the "Regency" note
(nodding) 've got it
(to Miller) Can  have some backup
Miller, gesturing around the room, meaning "what you see is what you get"
All the occupants of the room are engaged on some task, save Anton, who sits alone on a bench
Scott looks at Anton, who glances at Scott, trying to keep the appeal out of his glance, "Please take me"
(to Anton) We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here, aren't we
29
Yes
Sir
Scott looks at Anton and shakes his head
He is summoned to the front of the room by a young woman, who is putting cash into an envelope
Scott comes over to her, and we see her filling out a slip of paper
She hands him the cash in the envelope, and the slip of paper
need you to sign it
You sign it
(He scans the room again, shrugs, and motions to Anton) Come on, Wallflower
(Anton rises and walks over to him) Scott turns to Anton
Now: your mouth shut
Your eyes open, and form on me
Here's where we're going
There is the sound of a gunshot
Scott and Anton instinctively take cover against the side of the building, drawing their sidearms
on Scott
As he looks through the half-open door
We see several of the Swat men, taking up positions, one of them kicks open a door, and his partner enters
Pause
We hear the partner call "clear"
, on Scott, as he re-enters the building, and proceeds, pistol out, toward the room
On the floor, we see the dead Secret Service Agent, a pistol in his hand
We see Miller turn to his team
An Agent kneels to the fallen Secret Service Agent, and prods a small hideout pistol from his hand
Scott turns to leave, and sees Anton standing next to him
30
Don't look at him
Don't look at the Downed Man
He's dead
(as he turns his back on the scene) Kick the fool overboard
on Anton and Scott as they leave
In the  we see Miller et al
Miller giving directions
who is the girl he went to see
Get her in
The girl he was fucking
Who's got the Coastguard
on Anton and Scott as they exit the building
'd hate to be the Lucky Duck who frisked him
(beat) He was off-post when they snatched the girl
(as he looks at the fallen agent) Yeah
Well, apparently, he felt bad about it
garish neon sign, beneath which we see a couple exiting, getting into their limo
Scott, in his sportcoat, walks up to the large and threatening bouncer at the velvet rope to the club
We see the bouncer bar his way, and gesture to his watch, meaning "closing up"
Two one-hundred dollar bills are passed to the bouncer
, Anton, in a cab across the street, looking on
Several well-dressed couples are leaving
group of raucous, drunk businessmen types push past them
Scott walks up to the bar
The Bartender is beginning to ring out the cash register
In the  we see a manager eye Scott, and continue to direct the closing operations
31
Closing up
(he points to his watch) Can't sell you booze after 3
(laying money on the bar) No, no
just came buy to pay you that money  owe you
He gestures to the bills on the bar
The Bartender swoops them up, and gestures to the back bar, meaning "What'll you have
" Scott points to a bottle of Bourbon, the Bartender pours for him
(as he drinks) how about them Sox, huh
Yuh
Whaddaya gonna do
"Curse of the Bambino"
that's right
(pause) Nice place you got here
You from out of town
Yeah, you know, actually,  was just looking for my Daughter
(as he smiles) that's what you're looking for
Uhh
ask, because a lot of out-of- town guys, come in, lookin, someone else's daughter
32
No,
Oh, no
(smiling) You sure
Abso, absolutely
He brings out his case, with the photo of the platinum- haired girl
The Bartender comes over and glances at it
on Scott as he looks incisively at the Bartender, who displays no flicker of recognition
girl like that been in tonight
pretty girl
None prettier
on Scott, who looks around the club
We see him eyeing the lovely young scantily clad waitresses, who return his looks with disdain
The Bartender, observing him, comes back to him
Yeah
'm looking for a girl like that
You're sure it was your daughter
'cause, a lot of guys, come in here, guys your age, go home with some
some rather 'younger' girl
The Bartender smiles
(as he leans forward) Well, why would a, one of these 'younger girls'
What would they want to do with me
The Bartender leans close and hesitates
Scott takes out several more bills and passes them to the Bartender
33
He hesitates a second, as if to say   "You wouldn't fuck me, would you
" The Bartender signs,   " am your man", the Bartender takes the bills and leans   close and whispers to Scott, indicating someone over in a   dark corner
In this corner, as the lights are flicked up, we see a youngish man in very expensive casual clothes, an American, dressed like Eurotrash, sitting talking with the man we saw earlier was the Manager
As Scott approaches, we see the Manager, knowingly, drift off
Beat
The young man () rises from the booth, and tugs himself into neatness, and stops, as if bemused by Scott
'Howdy, Pard'
Hello
wonder if you could help me
(as he yawns and looks at his watch, as he pushes past Scott) love you, Baby, but the season's over
Zimmer starts for the front door, and Scott falls into step with him
(gestures at the Bartender) my friend says that you're
you're sort of a 'matchmaker'
Izzat what he says
Camera takes the two out of the front of   the club, where Zimmer tips the bouncer, who his putting   on his coat, preparatory to going away for the night
Zimmer begins walking into a parking lot, where we see   several run-down employee's cars, and his, Zimmer's prime   Mercedes
Scott tags along
(as he walks away, to Zimmer, of Zimmer's car) put her back in your space
was looking for a girl
a young girl
34
Aren't we all
My, my, my, my, my, my question was: why would a young girl want to go out with an older man like me
And, if you could "answer" that
He takes out money from his pocket
Zimmer begins to speak slightingly, dismissively to the 'hick'
Look, Bub
Zimmer starts to open his car door
He turns back to Scott, and we see, Zimmer's , Anton, standing behind Scott, at the doorway to an alleyway
Obviously backing Scott up
, Zimmer reacts infinitesimally, to the sight of Anton
, Scott, sees him, and slams him against the side of the car
Zimmer reaches through the half-open door, and comes out with an automatic pistol in his hand
Scott kicks him in the stomach, Zimmer tries to raise the hand with the gun, and Scott throws him to the ground, the pistol falls on the concrete
on Scott as Anton emerges from the alley
Scott directs him to drag Zimmer into the alleyway, near a dumpster
Anton thrusts his hand into the car and starts to reach for the dropped pistol
Don't touch the piece, don't touch the piece, don't touch the piece, th'out your gloves on
As Anton now pulls off Zimmer's sportcoat, and begins emptying the pockets
Scott interrogates Zimmer
think you broke my arm
(as he shows the photo to Zimmer) You seen this girl before
(of his arm) think it's broken
35
You seen her tonight
Zimmer turns away from the photo
think it's
(to Anton) Pull him up
Anton pulls Zimmer to his feet
Scott puts a lock on Zimmer and breaks his arm
Zimmer screams
Now it's broken
(of the picture) What's her name
(pause
He strikes Zimmer in the face) '
(to Anton) Break his other arm
'
You don't know her name, then who is she
Some, some 'girl'
Some 'girl', some 'pal' of yours
Where is she Now
Anton, tossing Zimmer's coat, comes up with a small medicine vial
He holds it up to Scott
Who takes it, looks at it, sniffs it
Pause
(to Zimmer) Oh no
(pause) Oh no
this isn't Rohypnol
(pause) Is it
(pause) Izziz Rohypnol
Is this "Rho"
(pause) -
(to Anton) Whatzisname
36
(looking at his driver's license) Donny Zimmer
Donny
Donny: where's the girl
(pause) You dose her
(pause) Where is she
Donny
Anton tossing Zimmer's clothes comes up with an envelope
Scott takes it, and leafs through many bills
what is this
Ten, what is it, Fifteen thou
For what
never saw that girl
Oh, alright, then we've got to let you go
, Scott
Where'd you take the girl, Donny
(pause
Silence
To Anton) You touch his piece
No
Good
Scott gestures to Anton to let Zimmer go
Zimmer hesitates, knowing he must not move
Scott holds the photo to Zimmer's face
'
' 37
That's not what girl
(pause) Where'd you take her
(Scott points to Zimmer's pistol
To Anton) Put your glove on
Pick up his pistol
Two knees, the other elbow, (he points to the head) Mozambique
, Anton looking at Scott, to say "Really"
Scott, nodding back, "Really"
You bet your life
Scott starts to walk away
Zimmer begins screaming
Wait
Wait
Wait
,
large Mercedes is parked outside on the quiet street chauffeur reads the paper, he half turns, sleepily, at the sight of a man walking across the street
Scott and Anton pulling up in a Camaro
Scott and Anton, as he turns off the motor
He looks over at Anton, who holds a piece of paper
townhouse across the street
large Mercedes in the courtyard driveway
Beat
Scott and Anton watch, as a door starts to open
okay, then
Anton begins to respond, when Scott gets out of the car, motioning Anton toward the Mercedes
We see a middle-aged Businessman coming out of a side entrance, adjusting his clothes as he walks
As Scott walks nearby - we take him to a garbage pail, where he retrieves a small black bag - that is, as used to transport dog shit
He walks up
, on Anton, getting out of the Camaro
Behind him, around the corner, we see a dark van pull up
Anton motions the van to hold
38
, on Scott
As he walks up toward the Businessman, holding the black bag
He whistles once or twice for his dog, and then turns to see the Businessman
beautiful night
(nods) 'Less you got hayfever
(he gestures at the flowering trees) Scott walks up to him, and pushes him back into the vestibule
on Scott as he flicks open his switchblade, and holds his knife up to the Businessman's throat and whispers
you left something back inside
Beat
The Businessman looks frantically around, beyond him we see Anton taking his Chauffeur out of the car
The Businessman turns to the intercom and pushes a button
We hear a female voice answer, after a beat, "
yes
" on Anton, holding a machine pistol, behind a corner of the wall
left my case inside
There is a beat
And the far door in the vestibule is buzzed open
As it opens several men in Swat gear stream through the vestibule and up the stairs
Scott hands the Businessman over to an Agent, who takes charge of him, and camera holds on Scott, standing, wearily, at the bottom of the stairs
He motions for Anton near him to hand him a cigarette
Anton does so
Scott lights up
From the top of the stairs we hear screams, sounds of breaking, yells, commands being shouted
Beat
An Agent comes to the top of the stairs, looks down, and shakes his head
Beat
Scott turns and finds the handcuffed Businessman in his field of vision
they got some young girls up there
Beat
The Businessman, terrified, is silent
Scott holds out the photo of the girl in the black hair
39
You see this girl
(pause) The Businessman looks at the photo
Scott gestures at Anton, and passes the photo of Laura Newton to Anton
And then looks as if to say "In or Out
" Anton hesitates a moment, and then strikes the Businessman
Did you See This Girl
on the Businessman, on the ground
Terrified
He looks back at Scott, as if unable to focus
Scott gives him a beat, nods, as if to say, "What would you expect", and starts up the stairs
Scott enters the vaguely Japanese modern establishment
Several Swat figures are being stood down
They sit, sharing a thermos of coffee
One of the Swat team nods to Scott, and motions him to the direction he knows Scott wants to go
Camera takes Scott past a room where two female Agents are holding five young women, who are supervised, changing out of "escort" wear, and into jeans and sweatshirts, "streetclothes"
on Scott, as he enters what is obviously the "office" of the Bordello
One of the techs is sitting at a bashed-in computer, he is hooking it up to another laptop
He turns to Scott
she was trying to scrub the thing
Beyond them we see Miller
And a very attractive European- looking woman in her forties
In a room beyond two bodyguard types are handcuffed, watched over by a Swat officer
Scott moves back to watch Miller interrogating the woman, the Madam, who speaks with a middle-European accent
an escort service
There is no impropriety, and there is no
40
(calling back to one of his techs, who consults a computer) who is she
Nadya Tellich, Serb
Green Card, in
Miller waves the rest of the information away
Miller shows her the photo
Have you seen this girl
We see a lot of girls
They apply
For the job, as Hostesses
on Scott, who stands by the Tech, who is trying to reconstruct the broken computer
It prints out a file, on which we see photos of various faces
Each girl holds a placard with a number on it
on Anton, who looks down
The wastebasket
In the  we hear Nadya going on about the benefits of working as a Hostess
He motions to Scott
Scott squats to the ground, and pours out what are revealed to be several polaroids of beautiful young women
He uses his knife to rearrange them without touching them
They are now alighted and we see the numerals twelve, thirteen, fifteen, on placards which they hold up
on Scott, as he walks back into the interrogation room, holding the sheet printed out by the computer
a contact for Personal Services
They pay us so much for each call, and
The girls pay us
We are just a - They show you proof of their age
Of course, of course,
you think
What do you think,
41
(showing her the printout) Where's Number Fourteen
(pause) don't understand you
where's Number Fourteen
(pause) (pause) want my Lawyer
Miller takes the photos of Laura and shows the platinum- haired one to Nadya
is this the Girl
Is this her
Was she in here
, wait,  no
want to talk to my lll
(of the platinum-haired girl) Izzat her
It's her, isn't it
She was here
Is that her
, on Scott, as he steps away
He takes us through the Whorehouse
In the adjacent room we see a bank of video monitors, showing people in various sexual activities
On the screen for a moment comes the face of what looks like a very young girl indeed, camera swerves onto the face of the Businessman we saw outside the Whorehouse, he is disrobing,
( ) come over here, you little bitch
That's right, get your sweet ass over here
on Scott
As he looks to the Businessman, himself, who is seated in a chair, presided over by several agents, forced to watch the video
He turns his head away
(to an Agent) Make him watch it
42
One of the agents turns the Businessman's head brusquely back
listen
listen: 'm a wealthy man
am,  am not- without-friends in, in the Administration
(he takes out a business card and hands it to Scott) whatever it takes to
This here, sir
This is a piece of cardboard
Scott holds the card
He shakes his head sadly
Scott nods to the Interrogator and Scott throws the card into the Businessman's lap
(as the Businessman starts to look away) Don't you look away, you son of a bitch
(he forces him to watch the video) , on Scott, as he looks disgusted
Anton stands on one side, looking to Scott for a cue as to how to react
(stepping in) "--" - What are you, Carmen Miranda
He holds the photo of the platinum-haired Laura Newton
(he draws Scott close, turning from Anton to the "good" cop) Listen to me:  cannot
Be caught here
You write an amount on a sheet of paper

() 43
(') (he takes out his business card and hands it to Scott) No, Baby
Today we got the Barter System
And you best pray to God you got something to trade
(he takes out his wallet) ' (he slaps the Businessman, and Anton pulls him off) , ' (he picks up the man's business card) Come in here, try to buy me off
've got Three Daughters
Anton succeeds in pulling Scott off the Businessman
He drags him around a corner
We see the terrified Businessman in the background, as Anton tries to reason with Scott
maybe we'd
, on Scott, now appearing transformed, and easy
He gestures "shusshh" to Anton, meaning "It is all an act"
In the  we see the Interrogator browbeating the Businessman
(as he looks down at the Businessman's card, and shakes his head
He moves back toward the Businessman, terrifying him) thought when you wanted to pet little girls, you picked on your Daughter
Ain't that what you rich people do
now you step off the Reservation and you want to buy me
() 44
(') (he shows a photo of the platinum-haired Laura to the Businessman) Where Is This Girl
The Businessman is terrified
He looks around the room in panic
on Scott, as camera takes him to where the Female Agent is interrogating the Young Whore
Anton follows
(looking at the photo of Laura Newton) She was sick
she was Not Very Well
She came in here
and
and
who was she
dunno
some young girl dunno
They took her,  told Nadya, she shunnt be here, they took her
Who took her

Was she here
think that's the girl

The two, two men

(she draws the Female Agent closer, frightened) they gave her a shot
on Scott, as he turns back to Nadya
am entitled to my rights, and am entitled to a phonecall to my lll
45
(brusquely) Your lawyer ain't going to help you
want to guess 'why'
(he looks to Miller, who nods, "Go ahead"
he takes the photo of Laura with the red hair, sharply, from Miller and shows it to Nadya) 'understand the picture
ohmigod
on Miller, as he beckons Scott
Anton starts to come and Miller signals him to stay behind
He's with me
Miller nods and the three walk out of the room
on Scott, as he and Miller retreat behind a door
Beat
(as it dawns on him) They don't know who they've got
they just snatched "some Young Girl"
When they find out, they're going to have to
Scott moves back to Nadya
She was here
She was here, where is she
(Scott thrusts the Laura Newton photo at her) She was here - don't know if this is the
She was here
(pause) 46
(very softly, as she looks around, broken, for sympathy) they'll kill me
Who did you call
How did they know, to come get her
it's just a number,
Miller pushes a pad of paper and a pencil across to her
on Scott
As he looks on
Beat
He nods, as if to say "We're getting there"
There is the sound of a phone ringing, and an Agent comes in, and beckons Miller, who waves him away
The Agent indicates, "No, you have to take this call
" Miller steps back from Nadya, not wanting to break the mood, and moves toward the phone
Scott moves to stand by the girl
on Scott as he pushes the paper toward her, again, forcing and willing her to put down the number
(softly
To phone) hello
helicopter is settling onto the playing field
Two men getting out of a Suburban, across the field, run toward the helicopter
, a powerful-looking older man in a suit, , steps down from the helicopter, and an Aide greets him and leads him away from the helicopter
We see the Aide indicate the two men running toward them
Burch turns
Miller and Scott, who join with Burch, as they all move toward the stadium building
,
, on an assembly of the information of the chase
On a table, the photos of the Eurasian businesswoman, of Laura Newton, of the Regency Club
disassembled machine pistol, and a cup of steaming coffee
on Scott, looking at something, off
As he picks up the cup of coffee
Beyond him we see Anton, asleep in his chair
47
Burch, Scott, and Miller are found in the empty, stainless steel lunchroom, with them a clean-cut young man, , obviously Burch's assistant
where's the girl
Sir, we believe she was abducted, from this club
(as Miller speaks he passes pertinent sheets of information to Burch) That she was taken to
that she was taken to a bordello
here in Boston
Yessir, and, that
that
Come on, let's hear it: That she may have been
that she may have been delivered - for sale - that she may have been sent down the pipeline and overseas
(pause) (pause) "
just some girl
" (pause) on Scott
Sitting quietly, as he watches the two other men
Stoddard takes out a cigar case
Looks to Burch, who nods his consent, and Stoddard takes out a black cigar, and lights it
How certain are you she was the girl in the whorehouse
48
(shakes his head, meaning "not positive") we
Was the girl in the whorehouse
(pause) What about your other leads
the Boyfriend, the
Professor

The Professor, where's his boat
The Coast Guard is on the
on Scott and Anton
As Anton comes awake to the sound of the shouting
Scott gestures him to keep quiet
on the two
As Anton wakes up
He picks up a sheet bearing the Picasso symbol, and starts to speak
Scott shakes his head, meaning "be quiet"
we just go where we're sent and do what we're told when we get there
He motions to be quiet - and to pay attention to the drama in the next room
As Burch and Stoddard interrogate Miller
You've got the fucken Service Agent, shot himself
you're you're telling me, your best bet, some cocksuckers nabbed her, took her, took her, they don't know who she is
And they're gonna sell her down the river
Sir
49
The Detail Agent
Was he fucking her
The girl
The Secret Service Agent, was he fucking Laura Newton
He was off-post, with his girlfriend
(pause) (as he holds up the "Picasso" letter from the Boyfriend, to read it
He reads:) The Professor, the Boyfriend, "
you behave like a slut
", this is who you like
(he holds up the advertisement of the Regency Club) Aah
fuck (he holds up the photo of her hair) She dyed her hair
What do they do, her hair grows out, what do they do when they realize who she is
(pause) (under his breath, not realizing he's speaking) They kill her
(reacting, as if to say, "That's the first sensible thing 've heard") You're fucken  Right they kill her
Okay
Good
() 50
(') Now: Let's talk some commonsense: (pause) What can you do for me
(to Miller) who is that
(Miller whispers to Burch
To Scott) Get in here
(Scott comes and stands by Burch) Scott, and then Miller, looks at Burch's clean-cut and very fit assistant, Stoddard
There is a pause, and then Burch motions Stoddard to leave the room, which he does
Pause
(quietly) what can you do for me
What can you do for me -  need it now -  need it before the Press gets it on Monday
Cause they will kill her
The jackals start a feeding frenzy, and she's red
Help me
Miller nods to an Aide, who comes forward, with a white scrap of paper
He hands it to Burch
Sir: This is the number of a public phone in Downtown Boston
(Burch nods) It's a cutout, between the Bordello, and the abductors call is placed when they have a package to deliver
you going to stake out the phone
(nods) We have a watch on the phone
More importantly:
reports calls placed to that phone
Regularly
They can track calls to a payphone
51
In this case they can
How
They were made from a Federal Prison
(he gestures to the Aide, who shows to Burch and the camera a photo of a smiling man in his forties, in an expensive suit
Of photo:) This is Eli Assani
He is a Lebanese National, serving life without, for kidnapping
He was the head man in a white slavery scheme
And where is he
He's in Lewisberg
We have a Plan
(pause) hesitate to
Give it to me
, on an Aide who comes in and passes a piece of paper to Miller, who reads it and looks up
They've got some action on the Payphone
Scott and Anton start to get to their feet
,
In the foreground we see a lonely payphone in the deserted square
It is festooned with ads for escort services
In the deep background we see the lights on in a corner bank building, and the cleaners at work
One of the cleaners polishes the counter in the bank
He wipes his brow and looks outside
sedan at the curb
Beyond it, a man, smoking a cigarette, stands near the payphone
52
The man looks at his watch, looks around, throws away the cigarette, and continues to pace
, in the bank the "Cleaner" whispers into a lapel mike
Scott, in the backseat of a car, apparently asleep
Anton, sitting in the front
Listening to the faint sounds from an earwig
,
Scott, his head tilted back, looking through almost fully closed eyelids
who's walking up on us
, Anton, as he looks around, down at Scott, and then up, at a man in a suit, some thirty yards away, walking towards the car
Anton, as the man draws closer, looks down at Scott, as if to say "How did you know"
(as he loosens his jacket, over his pistol) who is he
Boston
We see Scott, relax for a moment
And then, putting Anton out of his misery
always a reflective surface
(then, to himself, as if reciting a litany) "
in the city, always a reflection
In the Woods
Always a sound
" On Anton, as he digests this
and in the Desert
You don't want to go into the desert
,
The Phonebooth in Copley Square
We hear the phone begin to ring
53
Scott and Anton, in the sedan
Anton listening on the earpiece
Anton brightens
they're moving
Anton starts to put the car in gear, an Agent comes jogging down the street, out of an alley, and motions Anton aside, and gets into the car
shot of the helicopter, flying over the highway
, the sedan speeding down the deserted highway, the city in the background
The helicopter, flying away overhead
'
Driver, Scott, and Anton
Listening to transmissions on the radio
As they drive Anton leans forward, his hands on the seatback of the front seat
Scott picks up one of Anton's hands, and turns it over
(of the hand) what is this
(as he looks down, and then realizes the nature of the question) it's a wedding ring
take it off
(pause
While Anton hesitates, not comprehending) the ring clicks against your riflestock, some sonobitch hears that noise, hundred yards out, and you're gonna get me killed
Anton nods, and begins to work the ring off his finger
Far ahead, the speeding sedan turns off the highway, onto a "feeder" road
Anton and Scott in the backseat
As we see Anton take out a machine pistol from his "Go" bag, and check it
Scott looks at him
chatter comes over the radio, and Scott addresses the two men in the front seat
54
where's he going
The Driver hands a printout to the shotgun man, who reads
One Five Four Nine, Alpha Sierra, Mass Reg
William Barak
Somerville, Mass
That's where he's going
The Agent shakes his head, looks down at the paper
Also, owner of Record, In Essex
Izzey going toward Essex
(Agent nods) what sort of place is it
The Agent looks at the piece of paper
It
it'd be a Beach house
Get me there
(to the Driver) Get on the net
Call 'em off
Everyone off
Just me
(of Anton) Just me and him
sir
Nobody out there
(to Anton) Just
Him
(to the Driver) You indicate that you heard me
(beat
The Driver nods) Put it out
(the Driver begins to speak softly, relaying his instructions on the radio
Scott turns to Anton
Softly) How you doing bright eyes
(Anton nods
Beat, as Scott looks him over) 55
breathe through your nose
Anton looks at Scott inquisitively, not sure he has heard right
It stills the heartrate
(pause) You got my back
Sir, Yes, Sir
(to himself) alright, then
the Sedan, on the deserted highway
We see another car come screaming up behind it, doing one-ten, a red light on the roof, flashing
middle-aged man watches the other car come up, and disappear around a bend, going furiously fast
The margin of the scrubwoods, in the dunes
Scott and Anton, moving quietly through the woods
Scott points to Anton, indicating where he should stop
, Scott's
run-down beach house on a deserted cove
The blue light of a television flickering through the window
, Scott peering through some scrubgrass
We see he holds a small handful of torn-off grass before and over his face, to break up his outline
He turns
To Anton, who stands next to him, holding a sniper rifle
He points out a position to Anton
you want me to Come Through the Door
(as he checks his weapons
He shakes his head
) Don't you go through the door without an Overwatch
He takes the small handful of grass and throws it into the air, watching the way the wind takes it
Scott gestures to Anton to take up a position beside a small run-down boat shed
56
We see Anton do so, then Scott moves across the dunes, to a small skiff
Which lies just across a little cove from the beach house
, on Scott, as he moves down the dune, to the skiff
He opens his switchblade quietly, and severs the line holding the skiff to the dock
He gets into the skiff, and pushes it off, and we see it begin to drift across the little cove toward the beach house
, on Anton, kneeling, beside the old boat shed, as he assumes a prone position, and sights his rifle in on the beach house
,
Through the sniperscope, the house, the television, flickering in an empty living room
Anton, acknowledging the command
He finds a vantage point, and assumes the prone position, covering the house with his rifle
on Scott, surveying the beach house
The dark beach house
on Scott, as he moves across the lawn, and to a back door
He removes his switchblade, opens it, and uses it to jimmy the screen latch
He replaces it, and takes out a set of lock picks, and begins to work on the door
We faintly hear the sound of a television
We hear the sound of the  and faintly, see a blue glow from a room or two down the hall
on Scott, entering the kitchen, where he looks down at the various dirty plates and cups on the table
on Scott, coming through the door
As he moves, flat to the wall
Camera follows him past the doorway, beyond which we see the  on low
Scott looks in, and finds it empty
on Scott, as we follow him into the bedroom
It is empty
on Scott, looking around
, as he comes back into the living room
He stops
We see something beyond him
small boat some twenty yards from the house
Out near the water
57
, on Scott, as he starts to open the rear, sliding glass door which will lead him out to the boat
Behind him, we see the     open the front door of the house, and begin to enter
Scott hears him, and turns
(as he sees Scott) what the fuck
heard the , so  came in
(pause) The Sedan Man is put a bit off, as the comment makes no sense
Scott uses the moment to advance toward the man
what the hell you got the on for, there's nobody here
(the man puts up his hands) don't wanna hurt you
Why would hurt you
just wanna know why the 's on
Where we see the man, and Scott
We see the scene in green, through a sniperscope
, on Anton, looking through the scope
Anton, as he sees something in the scope
, in the house
Scott advancing toward the man
just wannit to know,  just came to ask you that question
The man backs up, past a half-open glass French door
, on Scott, as he advances toward the man
, '
Through the sniperscope
The faint traces of what might be the Picasso symbol
, on Anton, as we see him move the sniperscope and adjust its magnification toward the symbol
In a corner of the scope, we see another man, in a dirty white shirt, emerge, coming up the stairs from what might be the basement of the beach house
We see this man take in the scene in the next room, and secrete himself behind a wall
58
, on Anton, whose vision is blocked - Camera takes him to a position next to the white tool shed
Scott, moving toward the Sedan Man, unaware of the man around the corner
through the sniperscope
We see the man in the white shirt ready himself behind the opening through which Scott will come
We see him raise a pistol
Anton, as he realizes he is behind the curve
As the man in the white shirt steps into the doorway Anton fires at him through the sniperscope
We see this man fall
,
The man in the Sedan, his hands raised, fetches down a small shotgun from the lintel over the door, and levels it toward Scott
Who draws and fires several rounds at him
As the man goes down heavily
Scott comes forward to the dying man, and kicks the shotgun away
Camera takes Scott warily into the next room, where he sees the man in the white shirt sprawled on the floor
Scott moves past him, and down to a door leading to the basement
Scott takes a long look down the basement stairs
We see a faint light, and a shadow moving across the light
on Scott, as he takes a deep breath, and bursts down the stairs, screaming
The Basement
rough, dirt-floored room
Scott standing alone
We see a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling, swinging slightly in the breeze from an open window
'm Coming Up
, Anton, inside the house, in a covering position, watching out
Scott comes up the stairs
(to Anton) Call em in
We see Anton take out a walkie and talk into it, Scott proceeds to the Sedan Man
He kneels by him
where's the girl
You're dying, pal
Even it up 59
Scott pulls the dying, bloody man to him, and starts to shake him
You're dying
You're dying, man
Where is the girl
Beat
The man begins to shudder, violently, and then stops, obviously dead
Beat
Scott throws the dead man down onto the floor
Beat
, on Anton, who turns to look back
He stares at the dead man
well, you wanted to know
(pause
Scott kicks the dead man viciously) Anton looks at Scott
Beat
(to himself) Yeah, everybody wants to know the Secret Knowledge
Scott sits on a chair, by an old rolltop desk
On the desk we see a bunch of junk, old cigarette packets, empty
box half-full of yellowing stationary
Scott prods the stationary with his knife
We read, in an insert: "Hanson Marine
Everything for the boat
Box 38 Essex, Mass
" (and see, on the envelope, an old fashioned, stylized drawing of an old chriscraft-like power boat)
We hear the sound of a helicopter
And Scott turns, looking out of the window
He then turns back, to see Anton, who is standing, looking down at the man he shot
Anton, feeling Scott's gaze, turns to look at him
tell it to the Chaplain
Scott gets up wearily, and walks toward the door out onto the beach
We see a helicopter landing, and several men in 's, jumping out, and proceeding toward the house
Burch and his Aide
As Scott and Anton enter
Followed by Miller
60
Burch motions Miller over, and they confer, looking at Scott and Anton
, on Scott and Anton, as they stand by a television, an Agent is watching, shaking his head
apparently, had her hair restyled, and cut today, our Newsteam interviewed her stylist, and has reconstructed
Ah, shit
He is summoned, into the next room
By Burch et al
Burch and his Aide
As Scott comes in with Anton, followed by Miller
Burch takes Scott aside
(looking at a  in the  silently, showing photos of Laura as a brunette) here's the deal: (pause
He holds up a photo of Eli Assani, the Businessman, both in a suit, and in his prison garb, with a number in front of him
His name, and "Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary") this is the man
(pause, to Scott) you're covered in blood
Sir, it ain't mine
(Burch looks at Anton
Scott, seeing his glance) On my team, sir
How deep is he
(saying, in effect, this sums it up) He's on the team
61
Yeah, well
He may have to be a little more than On the Team
(pause
After considering) 've been speaking to the father
(pause) Burch walks a few steps away
Thinking
Scott looks at Anton, questioning
(pause) What about if we had to go "off the meter"
With the Mission, sir
Burch thinks for a moment
And then draws Scott aside
Burch glances over at the television, spewing information about Laura Newton, and shakes his head with disgust
(to himself) 'm out of time
He turns back to Scott
And gestures him into a small room, and closes the door
man to man
The door's closed, Sir
Need
To Ask You
To do something
(he is hard-pressed to continue) am here to get the girl back
Burch thinks a moment, he rubs his face, and shakes his head, and looks up as if to say "This is all we have, this is the best we have"
Pause
He nods, as they do not move
Burch takes out a photo of a bearded middle-eastern looking man in a business suit, and another, in a mugshot marked "Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary"
62
This man
Placed a phonecall
Yesterday
From the phonebank at Lewisberg
To the Copley Payphone
(pause) Here's the cut-off-point
(he looks meaningfully at Scott
Pause) here it is: This man, Eli Assani, is to be transported, tomorrow, Wednesday, with another convict
Man on Death Row
For their medical procedures
Now: Police Cruiser coming quickly down a two-lane, deserted road
road sign reads "Just Two Miles To 'The Owl', Rest Stop, Restaurant, Gas-Diesel"
Rest Stop
run-down rural gas station, restaurant
Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down the road
As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant, carrying a full paper bag in his hand
The Cruiser, unseen by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts to get out of the driver's seat
When gunfire erupts from the restaurant
People are shooting at the fleeing man man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who returns fire
Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant
The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac, parked near the pumps
The man in the doorway fires again, and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire bursts
The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in the doorway falls
The roughly-dressed man turns to see that the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at him
The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at the Trooper, who falls
The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind
The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop it up and into his jacket
on this man, who we now see is
He stands around, and moves to the fallen Trooper
He strips the keys from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up
Feeling someone gazing at him
In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and , the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot
He is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously
63
We see the back window behind him, shattered by gunfire
on Scott, who gets into the car, takes the keys he took from the Trooper, and begins screaming off down the highway
, showing the car taking a turn vastly too fast, the car careens up on two wheels, rights itself, fishtails, corrects, and disappears in the distance
Scott driving steals a look back at Assani, in the back seat, whimpering
Shut up
The Police Radio chatters: "Two Twelve Sierra, come back
Two Twelve Sierra, come back, we have your request for Code Seven
please come back with your Twenty
" Yeah, two twelve sierra took all the 20 he's gonna take
Oh, man, you left him there
on Scott driving
He looks behind him
,
In the rearview mirror
dust cloud settling over the deserted highway
Various techies, in the kitchen, monitoring the broadcast of the microphone in the Police Car, Anton among them
The Trooper comes in, taking off his bullet-proof vest, and sits to listen, where we find Miller and his Agents
The 'Restaurant Owner', who we now see is Anton, takes off his jacket and his bullet-proof vest and picks a slug, fired by Scott, out of the center of the vest
(
) yeah
You marked him Paid in Full
(
) you got to pull over, you got to stop
'm bleeding
Yeah, he done ate from the tree of knowledge, our Sierra Two Twelve
help me
64
Shut up
,
The car comes to a panic stop, fifty yards beyond a turnoff onto a dirt road
The car is put in gear, backs up, and takes the road
The car comes quickly up a small farm road, we see a run- down barn, and a farmhouse, washing on the line
Scott pulls the car into the barn, next to an old pick-up truck
He gets out of the car, we hear Assani in the backseat calling to him
, Scott, as he turns to Assani, who is pressing a blood-soaked shirt to his neck
Calling "Help me"
Scott opens the back door of the Cruiser, and the Heavyset Man gets out, and offers his manacled hands for release
Scott motions to Assani
drag him out
(the man does so
Scott motions for them to be quiet) got some business to do
He takes his pistol and walks toward the farmhouse
on Assani, and the other Convict, Assani is holding a rag to his bleeding neck
help me
yeah,  heard yah
, on Scott, as he walks past a clothesline heavy with drying clothes, he is seen to go into the house
We hear a woman's scream, and then two shots are fired
As Scott is found at a table in the kitchen next to which are various foodstuffs laid out
Inside the house we see a female techie, at a table by the wall, various communications gear in front of her
Scott begins loading up his pockets with food
The techie hands Scott a slate on which is written, in large block letters, "The helo is standing by, will assault in support when you have found the girl
On your command
" Scott gestures for the slate, and writes on it, and hands it back
Scott nods, and walks out of the house
65
The slate, on which we see Scott has written "Keep Your Distance
" , on Scott, as he walks back through the yard, pulling clothes off the line
The two convicts, as Scott enters, and begins changing out of his clothes, and into the clothes he found on the line
Yeah, Baby
Pass some my way
Sorry, my man
traveling light
He turns to the Heavyset Man, and fires his revolver at him twice
The man falls, dead
Scott turns his revolver at Assani, who begins to scream
Don't shoot me, don't shoot me, have what you want , '
: Why in the world would  believe a lying convict like you
Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe me
see it
you do
can get us out
Help me and  will treat you like a brother
Scott advances on him
My brother used to beat me (he raises the cop's service revolver and cocks the hammer) Nice guess, though
66
Scott pulls the trigger, which falls on an empty chamber
Assani whimpers, as Scott goes into the Cruiser, comes out with a box of shells, clears the empties from the cop's gun, and begins loading it
No, no
Listen to me
listen
make one call
One call - go in the house
Make One Call
An Aviation Company
Tell
tell them
tell them the word  say, and they will say: (Scott hesitates for a moment, and Assani attempts to capitalize on it) Yes
Yes
-
Scott is driving
The dash is littered with empty coffeecups, cigarette packs
He turns
Assani, sitting in the shotgun seat, a map in his lap, looking at him
You a fag my friend
No
(pause) am not
Then why the hell you looking at me
was thinking
how fucking surprised you're going to be
(pause) Because, Baby, you just did that fucken good turn, going to Make You Rich, Fat, and Happy
just get me on that plane
Didn't they tell you
67
All  heard's a voice on the phone
Assani grins, as if to say, "Just Wait"
you like girls
Better question, where you've been so long, do you like girls
Scott grins, and Assani shares the moment with him
We have
You will have
the most beautiful
most beautiful women, eh
Not women, Baby
Girls
You got to trust me, 'm the Doctor here
All young
All blonde
And this all takes place Where
In Dubai
In Yemen
Well, that's a long way from Tiperrary, pal
what do you have here
Yeah, but 'm not cut out, to live in a fucken tent
(Assani laughs) If you think you can imagine luxury
am here to tell you, my friend
(he smiles broadly) 68
Well, may it Just Be So
When we get to Maskala
And, now, what's Maskala
when we get to Dubai, better
What's Maskala
that's where we clean them up
We ship them Rough, we make them Smooth, and everybody's happy
Well, then, you're a philosopher
huh
How 'bout making me happy tonight
If there's a girl, in the pipeline, tonight, you shall have her, what do you say to that
say you're a stone cold whoremaster
Assani joins with him in the joke, nodding his assent
No, no baby
Take it to the    bank
The Arabs, Man
All the oil    - all the money in the world
What can't they have
Booze and    Pussy
How do they get it
You the candy man
Is that it
Assani begins to swoon
He puts his hand to his neck, and it comes away covered in blood, where it was cut by the glass fragment
Ah
Hell
69
Yeah, no
'm bleeding bad here, friend
(he looks over) Yeah, we just, we got to get some
yeah, you need, all we need, some tailoring tools
, Sedan
Holding Anton and several agents, listening to the broadcast from Scott's car
Yeah, in my wishlist, we had a drugstore, get us some morphine, some
'
As it increases speed
'
As he tries to staunch the fellow
Scott steers with one hand
And turns off the highway at an exit, showing two miles to a town
Scott, dressed in the farm clothes that he took off of the line
Scott is buying supplies
On the counter we see bandages, hydrogen peroxide, etc
Behind the counter we see a newscast, showing a picture of Laura Newton, in long blonde hair, and a woman is doing a talking-head about fashion
America's Number One Redhead, "She Sets the Style, She Brings a Smile", she's Betty co-ed, in College, and she's off for what her father's office says is an "extended sailing weekend"
(the screen shows a sailboat) With "person or persons unknown"
yo ho, yo Ho
she "old" enough for that, our "Little Red Riding-Hood", Cathy
Scott ignores the screen
In back, Assani is sitting in the pickup, a woman driving another beat-up pickup pulls into the lot, there is a shotgun in the rack by the rear window
Assani crouches lower, to prevent being seen
As Scott is checking out
policeman enters from the police car
We see it is Anton
70
On Scott, as he moves to the back of the store, to meet Anton
Scott looks inquisitively at him
(whispers) the helo just went down
don't whisper to me, Baby, it draws heat
What helo
the assault helicopter
You've got no backup, at the house
(beat
Scott nods) You'll be in there, alone, the first few minutes
Well, there you go, then
You said "Never go in without an overwatch"
That's all fine, lad, "But this is the fleet"
You know you deliver him in the door, you know they're going to waste you
gimme whatever nine mil you've got
Anton takes out the magazines in the pouches on his belt
And starts to strip off the rounds
just gimme the mags
(Anton does so) gimme your piece
Anton takes the pistol from his belt
Scott checks it, and puts it in the small of his back
Assani, in the pickup, sees through a small window in the store
on Anton and Scott
Scott is walking away from him, and Anton puts a hand on him, and turns him back
71
Anton gestures Scott to wait a moment
Scott waves, it is not necessary
He goes to the counter, and picks up the medical supplies
He starts toward the back door
He calls back, over his shoulder Thank you
on Anton, as we see something occur to him
He turns to the other officer with him, and asks a question, and we see the other officer hand Anton several magazines of ammunition
on Scott, as he is coming out of the back door
on Anton, as he follows him
(calling) Mister
mister: you forgot your change
on Scott, as he turns back
We see Anton bringing the ammunition
on Assani, weak, holding the shotgun, as he supports himself along the wall, he peers around the corner, at Anton and Scott
(sotto) you better take care of yourself, because
, on Assani, who comes around the corner, and fires the shotgun at Anton, who falls
Scott screams "No"
, on Scott, who drops the packages, and turns to Assani, who is jacking another round into the chamber of the shotgun
Scott draws and fires at him several times
on Scott, who kicks away the shotgun, and turns back to Anton, who is crawling on his back, out of the line of fire
'm alright
'm alright
, on Scott, turning to look at Anton
And, then, back at the obviously dead Assani
In a waiting room
Scott, who looks up, as Miller enters
72
Your partner's going to be alright
do not look at the downed man, Sir
Yeah, well
Miller nods, and starts to walk away
Sir
Miller turns back, understanding Scott's request
(sits, acceding to Scott's request) Air Force Assault is airborne, five minutes out
(pause, Scott shakes his head sadly) Standing down's a bitch
stand down when the girl's back, sir
They'll get her out, if she's in there
(pause, as he looks at Scott) You did your part, what the fuck do you want, a Citation
Out of the window we see a   medical helicopter
Its rotors just starting to turn
We   see two white-coated medical types, carrying bags, run toward   the medical copter
An Aide comes in, and gestures to Miller   that the copter is ready to go
sir
Miller turns to leave
Scott stands wearily
Where are you going
On the dustoff
73
Forget it
Sir
Sir
There's no room
'm pleading with you, sir
Let him hear the assault on the Net
want to see the girl
Miller shakes his head - at the door, turns back for one last word to Scott
And then he stops
The television, in the next room, playing a news program
Scott looks inquiringly at Miller, who is transfixed by the television
the television
"Breaking News" story
We see an overturned sailboat, and the talking head narrating: "
the tragic, the stunning
the
Jim,  don't know what to say
" The woman's co-anchor, obviously very shaken, takes up the story, and we see live footage of an overturned sailboat being towed into a harbor, then inserts of "Our Redhead" Laura Newton, and, after a moment, the Professor
(  ) The death, just reported, the death of Laura Newton
The

On two bodies being taken from the water by medical technicians

apparently the boat swamped
she - She was sailing with
With her professor, Professor

, on Miller, and the Troopers in the room
Miller looks away from the screen, to Scott
a Tragedy, such as this
particularly
Particularly, Tracey, coming, right at the start of his Campaign
An insert of Laura's father, his sportcoat slung over his shoulder, comes onto the screen
Will he delay the start of the Campaign
On Scott
As he is found, standing, near the television
Off to the side, behind him, we see Miller, intently, on the phone, listening
his grief
he was very close to his daughter, wasn't he
75
Well, indeed, he saw her, the day
that would be, the day before last
He was in Boston for the Strategy Meeting, and saw her then
(sadly) and that would be the Last time
that
On Scott
As he is looking at the television, he shakes his head minutely, as if in a dialogue with himself
He walks back to the interrogation room
Scott sits heavily
Miller walks in and sits next to him
Her boyfriend called her a slut
She went off to prove it
Her and the Professor
Coked up, boat capsized
Both bodies washed up naked
Coast Guard dressed 'em up
full of Ecstasy
he killed her
(shrugs, meaning "who knows") He was fucking her, they're stoned
the boat capsized
Miller looks down at the artifacts
(almost to himself) so much death
(philosophically, as if summing the whole thing up) rock crushes scissors
We see Miller leave, as Scott turns away, and lights a cigarette
Miller turns back
'm sorry about your man
76
He isn't my man, Sir
He's a trainee
Beat
Miller leaves the room
Scott hangs his head with weariness
Anton, in bandages, in a bunk in the transport plane
Scott, asleep, in a chair near him
on Anton, as he comes awake
what time is it
What do you care
(pause
We see that Anton is having difficulty formulating his thoughts) fucked up
in what way was that
(groggily, as he tries to move, to draw closer to Scott) but  was trying to help
(Scott reacts to Anton's pain
) What
Do you want some more Dope
Whaddaya want, a Dr
Pepper
Scott takes a pill vial from Anton's jacket
Takes out a pill, and administers it to him
but  was trying to help
77
yeah, well, that's when people generally do fuck up
Wait for that to kick in
(Anton starts to lay back, and then, as if he is remembering something, he draws closer to Scott again
) You're gonna take that fight to bed for a while
You don't got to do it all now
Anton gestures Scott to draw close
(sotto) saw the sign
on Scott as he turns away
uh huh
Scott turns away
(drawing him back, as if saying :) saw the sign
at the Cape
In the House
You saw-the-sign
What sign
when  dropped the guy
The girl's Picasso sign
(he draws the sign in the condensation on the plane's window) She was there
At the Cape
The girl was there
The girl wasn't there
She was on a boat
She fell off the boat
She's dead
(pause) You did what you could
You did what you were trained to do
(pause) You did what you could
78
saw the sign
(turning away) then you are Truly Blessed
We see the Dojo, training room
Several exhausted young men in sweat stained fatigues watch a lecturer, with a knife in his hand, demonstrating a manoeuvre with a trainee
Beyond, on the wall, we see the sign
"These are the precincts of pain
Godess lives here
Her name is Victory
" Beyond, through the open doors, we see Scott's Mustang driven up to a nearby building
young man gets out
,
Scott, rested, clean, shaved, drinking a cup of coffee
Sitting across a desk from an Interrogator, who has several notes in front of him
from the house, a house, a holding facility, a compound
called Maskala
The girls are taken from Maskala, to the Royale Hotel, in Dubai
(he closes the notes, as if completing his presentation) As time passes, you may remember other aspects of
well, (the Interrogator stands) You've heard this speech before
He extends his hand to Scott
Scott looks inquisitively at him, then pauses, then stands
Scott exiting, as Blane comes out of his office
They walk through the compound
And to the camera, toward the Mustang
would be most grateful, sir, to be included on the mission
"At Such Time
" (pause) on a mission to Dubai
79
Is it in contemplation, sir
(pause) , on Blane, who looks at him to say "you know better than to ask
" Yes, sir
(pause) If and When, Sir
You need a rest, Bobby
(pause
as he extends his hand) Thank you, Bobby
Scott puts down the small yellow duffle he carries, next to his Mustang
The young man who drove it in stands by, as Blane and Scott shake hands
Scott looks at the training facility
The lecturer, executing unarmed combat moves against a trainee, who holds a knife
The lecturer puts the trainee on his back
Scott starts to walk toward this facility
He stands outside, by an open double-door, next to a water cooler, and draws himself a cup of water, which he drinks
As he watches the lesson
He turns back, as he sees the young man who drove in the Mustang pick up the yellow duffle, to put it into the car
please don't touch that
(Scott picks up the duffle and puts the strap over his shoulder) , Scott's , as he turns
We see the young female sergeant, Jackie Black, in the , walking across the area
Scott nods at her
She nods back
Scott starts to get into his car, and then turns back
'  as the trainee on the mat gets up, and the lecturer gestures at the knife he has dropped on the mat
pick it up
80
The trainee picks up the knife
The lecturer shakes his head
What are you studying here
'm talking to you, son
What are you studying
Sir, this Candidate is studying knife fighting
The lecturer pauses, looking down at the ground
Beat
Hold your ground, son
The Trainee goes into a knife fighting stance
(pointing behind him) you, and your friend
The Trainee lets his attention drift for a second, in the direction the Lecturer has pointed
And the Lecturer screams, steps in, disarms the Trainee, throwing him to the mat
As the Trainee picks himself up the Lecturer turns to the class
There are two ways to fight, you can fight fair, or you can fight to win
The Trainee puts his hand to his head, and discovers he is bleeding
The Lecturer nods his permission, and the Trainee walks to a water cooler, next to which Scott is standing
Scott looks at the shamed Trainee
Don't you study knife fighting, son
You Learn to Kill
And then, f'you meet some other fellow, studied knife fighting, you send him to hell
, on the Lecturer, who calls another Trainee up
Next man: Trainee stands
Now:  want to see some evil intent
81
The Lecturer glances at Scott, and makes a small "have a drink" gesture
The Lecturer nods back "yes"
Scott walks toward his car
" "
The man inside the "construction booth" raises the barrier, and looks at Scott, who drives through
The Lecturer (Grace) and Scott, in a booth drinking
Pause
Hey, fuck it, Huh
've always thought so
Scott gestures for another round to the bartender
Who is serving some rough trucker types, two of whom are at the bar with a couple of very attractive young women
One is a stunning redhead, who looks back at Scott
How'd the puppy like it out there
He piss in the punchbowl
He did okay
heard he caught poison ivy
He did okay
Why
You goin' out
What
You recruiting
Why would  be recruiting
You speak Arabic, huh
That's what the Arabs tell me
82
You, reason  ask: you going in the Sandbox
Ain't you overdue for some Down Time
'm just saying: Scott is distracted
He is watching the talking heads, on the bar  talking about Laura Newton
We see the photos of her in high school, with her father in some African country, et cetera
On Grace, watching Scott
Who shakes his head very sadly
Yeah
You Marines are a weepy bunch of motherfuckers
(Scott nods minutely in acknowledgement
And returns to watching the television) you get a chance to bowl in that tournament
on Scott
Caught in the image of Laura Newton, on the television
(to himself) beautiful girl
on the truckers, near the television, looking at Scott
One comes over to him
you say something, Mister
No,  was looking at the television
(pause) was talking to the television
(he turns to look at the girl) That girl's too good-looking for you anyway
What are you "rich"
What do you, "own" something
() 83
(') (pause) Or are you "funny" or something
(pause
Hold for a beat, on the confused face of the Trucker) Siddown
Lemme buy you a drink
sound of a truck, coming down the highway
, on the doorknob of the hotel room
We see several quarters stacked
As the truck sound comes closer, the quarters start to rumble, and fall off the doorknob
, on the floor, a glass ashtray
The quarters fall into the ashtray
, Scott, in bed, naked, comes awake, as the quarters hit the ashtray
He has a pistol in hand, and awakes with a start, screaming
He surveys the motel room, taking in his new surroundings
Beat
Next to him, the redhead from the bar, also naked, comes awake, frightened, looking at Scott
, on Scott, as he surveys the hotel room
On a dresser, a cheap imitation pewter bowl, an orange and a banana in it, on the table next to it, his switchblade, open, and the remains of a peeled apple
He looks at the knife, and at the girl
You peel the apple
She nods, not sure how to take Scott
(as he starts to come down from the adrenaline rush) well
You should wipe off the blade
() 84
(') (pause
Scott does so, cleaning the blade on a napkin) Or   else
(as if explaining the simplest and most perfect axiom of the universe) Or   else, it "rusts"
(a pause
He smiles at her
Pause) '   scare you
(he closes the blade and sits on the bed, shaking his head to clear it) 'm   sorry if  frightened you
(pause) three-store town, a couple of pick-up trucks parked in front of the country store
large double log truck goes through the town
The girl looks for some topic of conversation, to bridge the awkward moment
it's an odd knife
Yeah
got it from a Russian fellow
Was it a gift
No
As  remember, he seemed rather reluctant to part with it
(pause) It's just a knife
three store town
couple of pickup trucks parked in front of the country store
Scott's Mustang parked next to them
large, filled, double-length log truck speeds through the village
Scott, in his lumber jacket, is assembling various maintenance items on the checkout counter
large paintbrush, several boxes of nails, a gallon of paint
The Proprietor, a good-natured fellow in his fifties, comes up to the counter to check Scott out
85
How you been, John
workin hard
bet you have
How you, Billy
Proprietor pours Scott a cup of coffee from the pot on the back counter
He mixes in sugar and cream
Billy nods in response to Scott's question
one gallon goin to do it
(pointing at him accusingly) you been lookin' at my house
Nope, just trine a sell you some paint
(as he puts the cup down in front of Scott
Joking) but, now you mention it
, On Billy, as he moves to a new customer, a farmer, who comes in, and nods at Scott
John
Mr
Reese, how are you
(Billy goes to take care of the new customer, and turns back to deal with Scott, who is waiting to ask a question) That new saw blade come in
(as if just remembering) No, John
It did not
beg your pardon
know that's your baby
'm gone call them up and get Right On That
86
on Scott, who sees something out the window, and moves toward the front of the store
(as an afterthought) 'spected you back a few days ago
(looking out the window, absently) took the Long Way Home
Scott, who is looking, over his coffee, at something on the street
And we see, his , a very city rent-a-car which is now across the street
We see a man getting out of the car
We see the back of a man, next to the rental car, which is next to the Mustang
He turns, and we see that it is Anton, his arm in a slig, his face creased by pellet scars
, his
Looking at Scott, who has just snuck up behind him
Could  see your Right Hand, please
There's nothing in my right hand
Could  see it, please
Anton holds up his right hand
Scott relaxes, and comes forward
Anton gestures, meaning, "what was that about"
Scott takes Anton's right hand, by the wrist, and turns it over
He explains: You put your wedding ring back on
(not understanding the import of the question) yes
87
Then  have to guess you're not "on assignment"
(pause) You're in the wrong place, baby
(pause) How did you find me
Anton gestures at the "Oilchange" sticker on the Mustang's windshield
from
The Car
We see the sticker reading "Mike's Service Station, Bradford, "
And beyond it, the actual old, tin sign of the garage, reading "Mike's Service Station"
, on Scott and Anton
Well,  guess 'm not as smart as  thought  was
(pause) need to talk to you
beat
Scott shakes his head, as if in a sad comment to himself
He sighs
Anton and Scott walking down the street
saw the sign
"You saw the sign"
You were up for a week, you coulda seen Jack Ruby, you don't know what you saw
your first-time-out
saw the sign
then, you tell me: you saw the sign, how is it, they found the girl, the
why would they do that
Her father
Her father would do that to her
maybe he doesn't know
88
Well
You're living in a fairyland of your Own Devising
You're seeing snakes
(pause) Who's going to Dubai
(pause
Scott hesitates) They've got a white slave ring, in Dubai, with American girls there - are they going in
(pause) Are they sending you in
(pause) Ask them
(pause) You Got
To Leave it for your Betters
Ask them
Why would you want to know
(pause) Listen up, Pal

don't ask why
That's not a , it's a Benefit
Because we Got to Travel Light
You wanna lose sleep over it, get over it, or get out
(hold
pause) You wanted to go Through the Looking Glass
How was it
Was it more fun than Miniature Golf
want a favor
Why would  do you a favor
Two old ladies come down the small main street
Morning, John, who's your friend
Fella wants to buy my car
89
The old ladies walk on
Pause
saved your life
Well what were they paying you for
Bobby,  saw the Sign
My name ain't Bobby
(pause) saw the sign
(he draws the Picasso sign in the dust on the window of the country store) Saw it
At the beach house
(pause) 'm going back
Back
To the beach house
They took it apart with a tweezers
(Anton shakes his head) She was there
The Girl was There
'm going back
(pause) want you to do something
What would that be
The Secret Service Agent
Offed himself
he was off boffing his girl
90
He shot himself with a hide-out pistol
Yeah
Who frisked the sonofabitch
(pause) You ask them
, on Scott, obviously off-balanced by the question
Hold
Stoddard, smoking a black cigar, and several "Bureau" types in the office
Scott is sitting at a conference table, as is Miller
Beat
Number one, the girl's dead
Number two, the hide-out gun the Agent shot with's registered in his 1020 for the past five years
The man who tossed him has been sacked
His name is none of your concern
Now: what the fuck are you doing here
Sir,  am not here to question
Well, then, what the fuck are you doing here
Sir, as he said, he is here to apprise you of a security leak
and
Miller gestures to him to shut up
To call your attention to what may be a problem in discipline with this
91
Granted
Granted
(he stands) Granted
Fine
Thank you
And
Sir
If  may
What is it
When the operation is staged in Dubai
What is this
He
what the fuck are you talking about
am merely saying, when - Forget it
Walk away
Yeah
you're a pit bull
said forget it
How do we contact Anton
Anton
Your partner
He's gone to ground
Scott shrugs, as if to say, "Is that the way you want it
" Yes, sir
92
And, wait, wait, wait, wait, what does this mean
(of Scott) When and if, any operation is staged which may require your talents,  give you my word
(Scott shakes his head, saying " don't believe a word of it") You impertinent motherfucker
What the fuck is with you, you've got on your "thinkingcap" all of a sudden
Stoddard gestures to an aide to call a number
'd like to finish what  started
And 'm telling you to Stand Down
Where's the kid
(pause) Is there no operation in Dubai
Stoddard shakes his head in exasperation
The Aide hands Stoddard the phone
Stoddard answers
Listens for a moment, and then points at Scott

Scott takes a book of matches and starts to light a cigarette

Scott gets out of the car

He motions the driver to pass him a phone and Scott looks at the number on the card and dials
Beyond him we see, just at the limits of the gravesite
Holding himself apart
young man in a raincoat
The young man turns at the sound of a limo driving up
Scott, looking at the limo
Out of the limo, which stops near the grave, we see Burch emerge
There is a susurrus among the crowd, which, visibly, straightens a bit, at the honor of Burch's presence
We see Burch walk to the gravesite, and have a word with the widow
Burch puts his hands on her shoulders and comforts her

We hear rifle fire, and Scott flinches

The Marine Honor Guard, rendering a salute
We see a Marine bear the flag to Burch, who presents it to the widow
He shakes several hands, and then moves off, back to the limousine
He beckons Scott over to him

Burch shakes his head
He hands Scott the program from the funeral, and reluctantly begins

To commit Murder
Because it needed to be done

To penetrate it makes trying to join the Mafia look like a walk in the park
How would you do it, Scott
(pause) We're dying
We're at war
And we have no intelligence
How Would you do it
How would you infiltrate their clan structure
Where is the interface
(pause) It's at the whorehouse
That's where they go to get frisky, and that's where we listen to them
() 95
(') For the few, priceless hints that we get from that fucking sandpile
(pause) Had the girl been there, we would have moved heaven and earth - you know we would, and, we would have got her out
She was not there
She got drugged up and fell off a boat, and drowned
She's dead
(of the funeral) That man, (Burch gestures at the photograph-on-the- easel, of George Gaines, the Secret Service man, which stands by the head of the grave) That man a sworn office of the Secret Service, went to get laid, and she died
And you are risking the lives of men and women in the field, because you won't take orders
How are you better than him
Yes
You had best look sheepish
What the fuck have you got to say
No excuse, sir
You're goddam right
(pause) Now: where's this new kid who got you all bothered
Where's your partner
'll call him off
The fuck you will
You've got nothing to say to him
He's gone to the ground
Where is he
Over the Honor Guard, packing up, we see Scott hand a scrap of paper to Burch, who makes one or two more points, to which Scott nods, submissively
Burch walks off
Camera follows the Honor Guard, down the path, toward Scott, who, passing, nods at them

on Scott
As he watches the widow, at the gravesite, being walked away to a limo by the pastor
He feels someone behind him and turns

man in a raincoat, standing furtively, half-hidden by a tree, some distance off from the funeral, weeping
He holds a program for the funeral
on the man in the raincoat, the funeral beyond him
He is obviously distraught, a rather slight young man in his thirties
He looks at Scott for a moment, and then turns away
On Scott
As he turns back to watching the end of the funeral
As the gravediggers begin their work
He sighs
And moves to a bench and sits
Looking at the gravediggers
Scott, still sitting on the bench
The gravediggers, finishing their work, begin to walk off, joking with one another
Scott stands, and turns, about to start out of the cemetery
He stops for a moment

The man in the raincoat, who is standing where last seen, looking at the burial
Walks toward the mound of earth, pauses for a moment, and then walks off

Scott walks up to the man
Each holds a copy of the program from the funeral
The man looks down at the program, and then up to Scott
(beat) Terrible thing
(the man nods) Did you know him
The man nods
Beat
He turns back to Scott, looking for sympathy
Anguished
Did you know him
(Scott nods
Pause
Portentiously:) Where did you know him from
97
(pause) you know
(pause
Nods) He wasn't in the accounting office
You knew that
Yes
Did
The man begins weeping heavily
Scott puts his arm around him
didn't think, he told anyone what he did
Because
because
(he looks for sympathy) few of us knew
(pause) The man takes out a small photo in a leather case - we see it is a smiling photo of the Secret Service Agent, Gaines
And all he cared    about was doing his duty
that's    all
that's all
He used to    tell me
(the man is    now overcome) 'm so sorry
He was supposed to see me that night
After his "shift"
We
His wife
Scott nods his understanding
Did she know
His wife
Did she know
How could she
How could she
she didn't know him
(pause) Oh, the poor children

The man begins shaking, and Scott embraces him to comfort him

Scott and the man, at the end of the bar

As Scott bends his head next to the man, speaking low
he was going to come to me that night
after
after his shift
his shift - yes

excuse me
after, after he'd finished driving him
him
(as he puts a hand on Scott) said
(as he turns to the man, who is backing his way out of the bar) driving him
Did you say "him"
(he reaches out to the effeminate man) Yeah
It's a man's world, pal - but you're in the wrong bar
He turns Scott around, and pushes Scott deeper into the room, away from the other man, who is now going out of the door
Scott moves toward him and the Burly Man tries to stop him
99
Scott strikes him several times, and starts toward the door, where, as he exits the bar, he sees the effeminate man, on the bus, and pulling away
Scott starts to move toward the bus
There is a hand on his shoulder, and a second man from the bar is whirling Scott to face him
Scott shakes him off and starts after the bus
The second man restrains him
what the fuck did you do to my friend
In the
We see the first man rise from the sidewalk, and move toward Scott
Scott struggles to follow the bus, when the second man assaults him
Scott is now fighting the two men, who manoeuvre him toward an alley
As Scott's back is to the alley we see a Third Man emerge from the shadows, and throw a garrotte around Scott's neck
Scott headbutts this man, who hauls Scott off his feet
Scott belts him again, and stomps on his instep
And turns into him
He elbows this man as the other two men advance toward him, in the alleyway
The garrotte man falls
Scott kicks the garrotte man in the temple
And draws his pistol
Beat
The men in the mouth of the alleyway retreat
On the street
We see them get into a van which has just pulled up
on Scott
Standing
Shivering
As he looks around the alleyway
He moves back to the fallen garrotte man
Scott standing over the man
He sees something and bends down
In the man's backpocket is a program from the funeral

We hear the phone ringing
Scott puts the phone to his ear

No

Scott stops speaking, and looks down at something

We see an unmarked sedan pull up and two men get out of the car
And begin to look around
One sees Scott, and motions to the other one, and they both start in his direction
They stop, for a moment, as if confused
, their
The street corner, empty of Scott
Copley Square

It is festooned, as before, with ads for escort services and phone sex

Scott looks at his watch, and he looks up
The figure of Anton, walking from the far side of the square, toward the phone booth
, on Anton, as he looks around him, and then proceeds toward the phone booth
As Scott watches, a van pulls into the plaza, and heads toward Anton
Anton sees the van, and retreats, toward the streetside, where we see, the van has herded him toward another car
Three men get out of the car, one slugs Anton, and he is whisked into the car, and the car pulls away
, on Scott, on the far side of the square, looking on, aghast
Anton, in the backseat of the car, pointing back, as the car disappears
Scott, looking at Anton's gesture, and following, looking in the direction in which he was pointing
Scott's
The telephone kiosk
Scott walks into his , to the kiosk
He looks down at the pile of trash on the shelf
101
He looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around the interior
He sees that, stuck in one of them is the "Rogers Rangers" card, which Anton showed him earlier
He pulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck
He looks down at it inquisitively
We read in an insert: "Rule #11: Don't ever march home the same way
Take a different route, so you won't be ambushed
" He then sees that there is something else behind the ad
He tears the ad off the kiosk partition, and he is rewarded, as a folded envelope falls out from behind the ad
He picks up the envelope
We see that it is the old yellowed envelope from the beach house
It is printed "Hanson Marine - Everything For The Boat", and we see, on it, the drawing of the old power boat
We see Scott feel the envelope, shake it, tear off the end, and pour something out into his hand
We see his face, and then pan down to see the object in the envelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs of Laura Newton
,
wind is blowing from the sea
Scott turns up the collar of his jacket
We see the house in the  and Scott, walking along the patio, the sea beyond him
We see him stop and kneel, to the piling, from which he took the matchbook
He sifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling
The wind blows up the dust, and Scott stands, it is evident he has got a speck in his eye, and he tries to extract it, blinking, and squinting
He turns his head
,
Beyond the property line
Beyond the hedges and on what is obviously the next lot, an old, ramshackle dwelling, the small white toolshed
, Scott, looking at the toolshed, and gauging its proximity to the Essex House
He begins to walk toward it
Scott
At the small white toolshed
He stoops, and we see he has picked up the shell, ejected by Anton's rifle
He stands, he takes out a small spotter's scope
His shoulder, rubbing against the pollen- covered window in the small white shed, has uncovered a bit of a sign
Scott, looking at the sign in the window
He rubs the pollen off, and we see emerge, on the inside of the window, drawn in the dust, the Picasso sign %-)

Scott, wearing just skivvies, is asleep on the bed, an empty pint bottle of booze on the night stand
We hear the television on low, showing talking heads narrating the funeral of Laura Newton
"Our Redhead, America's Sweetheart", et cetera
We see a photo of her in her signature red crescent earrings
Next to Scott, on the night table, the envelope, holding the same red crescent earring
, the line of light under the door to the hallway is occupied by a pair of feet
hand, dangling off the bed toward the floor
Below it, on the floor, the creased 'Rogers Rangers' card, and several days worth of newspapers
Scott, on the bed
Unshaven
We see his eyes come open
on Scott's hand, as it snakes quietly past the Rangers card, on which we read: "Rule #15: Don't sleep past dawn - Dawn's when the French and Indians attack", and comes up with an automatic pistol
the door, as we see the door handle move slightly
on Scott, as he jerks open the door, his pistol at his side
In the doorway beyond, we see a Bellboy, holding a small paper bag, looking shocked
Scott shoves the Bellboy back away from the door, and glances, both ways, down the hall
What the hell are you doing
(showing the package) brought you
Why're you screwing with the door
Scott drags him into the room
103
Why're you screwing with the door
Scott frisks him roughly
The terrified Bellboy shows a "Do Not Disturb" sign, which he holds
took the
took the sign off

The Bellboy proffers the package) An,

Thanks
(begins to calm down a bit) don't know why you
You're right, 'm wrong
'm wrong
He begins to look through his pockets
As the Bellboy stands, looking at the television
on Scott, the television beyond him
As he goes through the pockets of his jeans
He then goes through the pockets of his jacket, and throws various objects on the bed
Some coins, some scraps of paper
book of matches, some crumpled cigarettes
He hands some bills to the Bellboy
There you go, Pal
Hold on

just wanted to help

Scott picks up a cigarette and the book of matches on the bed
Part of the pile shows a tabloid paper - a photo of   Laura, an insert of her father weeping at the funeral, and   the caption "Goodbye, Baby"
He bends down and picks up   the Rogers Rangers card
And looks at it
He shakes his   head
As we see the Bellboy leave the room

on Scott, as he thinks for a moment, then speaks
It's been
quite a while since my last confession
That
that "transpired"
On the rear face of a hill, in a mortar attack
(pause) And  confessed that  was frightened
(pause) And  have to confess, 'm frightened now
(pause
He smiles weakly) 'Nother "irregular Confession"
He raises a shotglass to his lips, and drinks
He makes a "another one" gesture
Pause
'm about as frightened as 'm comfortable being
(pause) And that's why
involved you
(pause) Which,  suppose, was shameful
, as a waiter comes, with a fresh drink
We see that we are in a very dark, quiet, smoky, panelled bar
The waiter leaves, and reveals, beyond him, Jackie Black, the female Sergeant we met at the training facility scenes
The waiter looks at her, inquiring silently, if she wants anything
She shakes her head
105
Now: you did me the honor to Call me
Now: you tell me how might help
(pause) There in't nobody here, but two people in Green
(pause) Scott, looks around, he takes up a tabloid newspaper, which has been resting on the seat of the booth
We see it is a "funeral" edition, concerning the death of Laura Newton
We see the large, color photo of Laura, her red hair, and, in an insert, her father, at the gravesite, hiding his face
The caption reads "Goodbye, Baby"
Scott leans over, and whispers to Black, his deepest secret
(pointing at the paper) this girl's alive
Then, you'd better go get her
Scott, shaven, neat, and determined, standing at a bus stop
Reading a newspaper
Behind him, a large iron fence
The newspaper shows "The Tragic Death of Laura Newton", and photos of the accident
And a photo of a distraught woman in sunglasses, being held up by two friends
on Scott
As he looks across the street
Surreptitiously

on the bus, as it pulls into the stop
We see various people start onto the bus
At the last moment Scott, at the back of the line, sheers away
,
The bus pulling away from the bus stop, the chainlink fence beyond it, and, beyond that, a vaguely institutional-looking Colonial building
nurses station, Scott moving through the area, just asking directions of an older woman, obviously a semi-invalid
106
The woman is Mrs
Newton
She walks with a companion, she wears sunglasses, and starts out of the sanitorium
As Scott walks up, some yards behind her, following her out onto a roofed porch
The woman moves to the far end of the porch, obviously weeping
Scott enters the porch, and stands for a moment
Beat
(
) terrible thing, grief
Scott turns to her, to see a lovely woman in her late fifties, sitting on a lounge chair, a robe over her legs, indicating the weeping woman
Scott nods, and takes something from his pocket
He starts toward the weeping woman, but the other woman holds him with her voice
you want to comfort them, but you don't know how
(pause) always think it's better to Leave Them Alone
Scott nods his acceptance of her wisdom, and begins to start toward the woman
(of Mrs
Newton, and the woman, talking to her) relative
psychic
(pause) Well
(pause) Can we blame her
(he gestures, meaning, we get comfort where we can find it) That's right
Scott begins to move toward Mrs
Newton
The woman on the lounge chair sits up
107
who are you
(moving off) United States Secret Service
The woman moves her blanket to reveal a pistol which she holds
Guess again, 'cause 'm the Secret Service, and you follow my directions or  will shoot you dead
Spread your hands to your sides, please
(Scott spreads his hands to his sides) Open them
He opens his hands to show the red crescent earring
We see the demeanor of the woman in back of him change, as she sees the earring
She comes up to Scott, and he turns around
She looks up, asking, mutely, what it means
(sotto, unable to stop her invective) the motherfuckers pulled the Detail off of her
He was in town
Her father was in town, they pulled the Secret Service Detail off her, to take him tomcatting
He's been doing it for years
That's what they do
They turn the Secret Service into a bunch of pimps
He took her protection, she got snatched
He'd let her die
female Agent knocks at the door and sticks her head in and Donny gestures "rotate"
leaving the post
Donny gestures that she has heard
The Agent leaves and the door is closed

Her father would let her die
Who knows if he knows
His 'people' would let her die in a heartbeat

(pause
She takes up the earring and she begins to weep
She looks beseechingly at Scott) 'm her mother
She takes out a small, tattered, cheap earring box
We see the empty place for holding two earrings, and a small arcade photo of a five-year-old Laura Newton, and this woman, Donny, fifteen years younger
They are hugging
Scott turns over the photo to read, in a childish scrawl, "Donny, you can keep the box, cause 'll never take them off"
Donny starts to weep
need some money
(Donny looks up at him questioningly) 'm going to get the girl back
What can  do
need money
need a lot of money

Newton) 've been signing her checks for years

Alright

Does a double-take
And begins to raise his cuff mike to his lips to speak
, on Donny, as she sees this, and turns around
, her
The empty room
Scott vanished
very beautiful young woman in a business suit, in an elevator
The doors open and Scott, dressed in a suit, gets in
He turns to face the front
They ride up in silence
The doors open on a mezzanine
There are several men at the end of the mezzanine
Scott starts to get out, and the girl tries to stop him
He shoves her roughly back into the elevator
Several of the men come toward Scott, and a large, portly businessman in his forties () calls them off
Scott comes forward
Didn't they tell you not to come
Well,  guess  wasn't paying attention
(pause) Five years ago they told me you were dead
You want to gossip, or you want to do business
Avi motions Scott to come with him
110
, Avi's hitters
One starts to take out a phone - Avi waves him to stop -  on the hitters
, Avi and Scott, as they sit, near the edge of the mezzanine
Bobby; this is an American girl
If that were so
If that were so, why don't your people go and fetch her
What if 'm speaking for them
Avi nods, meaning "yeah, sure"
they send a hitter to negotiate
(pause) My question is: have you forgot your catechism
And what's the answer
The answer is Go Home
Yeah, that's a good one
you're at the Big Table here
know where  am
Well, then, you better talk to me using the Decimal System
Your intel
Two men
Infil, exfil, hardware, and com
And com to what
cannot give you
111
Well, you could, when you where in the Boy Scouts
Yes, but  am not in the Boy Scouts anymore
You heard the private sector
Yeah
Well
That's where you found me
And here's what it costs
He writes a number on a sheet of paper
(looks at the paper) you're out of your mind
No, you're out of your fucking mind, and you're out of your league, and my advice to you:
before some mercantile soul shops you
(pause
In disgust, he picks up the paper, crosses out what we wrote, and puts in a new number) for this job, that's what it costs
that's what it costs
That's what it costs you
(pause) Go home, Bobby
We see a woman getting into a Range Rover, in the vast gravel drive outside of an estate
man comes out of the house, with a cup of coffee, hurrying out to kiss his wife goodbye
He does so
She drives off
112
He finishes the cup of coffee, puts it down outside his door, closes the door, and looks quickly at his watch, and hurries to his Jaguar, which he puts in gear, and it starts down the drive
We see it is the Businessman from the whorehouse
on another car, coming down the drive, which smashes into the Jaguar
on Scott, who gets hurriedly out of the car
He goes out to the Jag, and drags the stunned man from his car, and toward the house
,
Beautiful Greek and Roman artifacts line the walls, on lighted shelves
Scott drags the stunned and abraided Businessman into the study
Scott throws him into a chair
Remember me
Scott, as he takes out the Businessman's card, and looks at it
well,  guess you do have friends in High Places
mean here you are home, n'all
(he picks up now one, now another piece of exquisite statuary, and smashes it to the ground) And now we're gonna see if you also got all that money that you spoke of
(he takes out a videotape box) This here's a Short Subject, if you know what  mean
Of you in Carnal Congress with an Underage Girl
,  , '
(he holds up another videotape) There's another
you know how cheap it is to make a copy
what do you want
want what you promised me
113
(as if reluctant to impart the information) 've, 've already made a deal with
Yeah, but you haven't made a deal with me
So, today is Your Lucky Day, cause you get to Do, what Most Men only Dream of: You get to make Another Human Being Happy
He brings over a telephone, and gives it to the Businessman
Scott finds himself behind a large desk
He looks down at photos of the smiling Businessman, in various poses, with two young girls, obviously his daughters
(softly) You had your fun, now pay for it, Jim
Get your bank on the phone
We're going to transfer some money
The Businessman pauses, then picks up the phone
(to himself) "how about that"
do you know how much trouble you're in
Yes
And that's the difference between you and me
Scott, getting out of his car, rounds a corner
We see a car coming down this street, rather quickly
Scott retreats into a doorway
,
The car blinks its lights three times
We see the car slow almost to a stop, Scott emerges from his doorway
As the car's rear door is opened, Scott gets in
114
Avi and Scott, at a small table
Maskala is a suburban villa, in Dubai
The Friends of your Friend, (he gestures at a photo of Assani) Operate there, if you will, a "halfway house"
For the young women they have induced, coerced or drugged into spending their short lives
As the whores of Arabian tourists
Of late the girls have been, in the main, from the former Sov-Bloc
Now and again, a North American Girl, if she is exceedingly lovely,
blonde, usually blonde
(he passes the photos of very beautiful young girls across the table, to Scott) Will, unfortunately, find her way to Dubai
They travel drugged, they are - (he searches for the word) - "tidied up", and sold
For some reason, most of them are sold to Yemen
(pause) The girls are generally held, in Dubai, until the end of the month
(he checks his watch and looks significantly at it) When the Merrymakers fly in to examine them
And take their purchases home
and then
(shrugs) That is "and then"
(pause) This is a floor plan of the building where the girls are held, this is the security arrangements, this is the watch plan
() 115
(') (he checks his watch and raises his eyebrows) The girls are taken from the house in Maskala, to the Royale Hotel,  presume you will hit them in transit
Scott opens another envelope which Avi has passed him
As he looks at the documents he pours out
(reads) "Jameson Construction"
They know we're there
hope not
(he shows documents to Scott) The conex container for the exfil, also Jameson Construction
(he gestures at the materials on the table) passport for the Young Girl
(he shrugs) Between fifteen and twenty-five, they all look alike
(as he looks at the passport) Is that your experience
Yes
It is
Nonetheless, we tried to match it to a Current Photo
, on Scott, as he looks, questioningly at Avi
Avi takes a photo from his desk and passes it to Scott
It shows, through a long lens, blurry and grainy, a photo of what is obviously the platinum-haired Laura Newton, sitting on a bed, in a barred room
she was there twelve hours ago
Who took the photo
(shrugs) How would  know
(pause) 116
What does the bonus cost
(shrugs) gesture of Friendship
But
We thought: if you see some of the Yemenins - (he shows Scott candid photos of several middle-aged, bearded middle-eastern looking men) Any of these, in particular
would you say Hello to them
Scott scoops up the documents, and stands
Who else have you done a favor for, Avi
Avi shakes his head, and wags his finger, as if to say, "No, in all sincerity
" Bobby: the world runs on manners
Beat
Scott takes an envelope, and hands it to Avi, who opens it
He opens his mouth to speak
The last third on exfil, in Geneva
Me and the Girl
As agreed
That's not what  was going to say
What were you going to say
(pause) the Last Third in Geneva
(he exits) ,
Scott, on a rooftop, behind a raised elevator housing
Scott takes out a pair of binoculars, and Scott leans around the elevator housing
Across the way, the window, and the ornate scrollwork bars, in which we, earlier, saw the photo takes on Laura Newton
117
on Scott, as he comes back behind cover, and nods to himself, picking up his yellow bag
Scott, walking down the street, beyond him a building with an ornate scrollwork barred gate over its courtyard door
In the courtyard beyond, two Mercedes 600's
As Scott walks past the trelliswork it begins to open delivery truck is ushered through the gate, by an armed guard
Scott stops, to let the truck pass
As he turns his head to the side
Walking from one outbuilding, across the courtyard, beyond the gate, accompanied by a minder, is Laura Newton
She is obviously drugged, disoriented, and is held up by the guard
He gets into a conversation with a woman, dressed as a matron, who comes out of the building they have just vacated
And she stands, for an instant, untended
on Scott, the gate open, as the gate guard ushers through the delivery van, and Laura Newton stands several yards away
, Laura Newton, as she looks in his direction, and her eyes begin to focus, as if trying to make sense of what she is seeing
, her minder, who reacts to a change in her attitude, and looks at her, and, then, follows the direction of her gaze to the gate
The delivery truck coming through the gate, as the gate closes behind it
The street beyond it, empty
As the delivery truck pulls in, and Laura, escorted by her guard, is taken back into the main house
She turns to look back, groggily, wonderingly, at the street, and is pushed into the door
As she does so, we see the delivery truck pull up to the spot she just vacated, and the delivery man gets out and opens a rear door, on which we see scrawled, in the dirt, the "Picasso" symbol
Scott turns the corner, and gets into a car, driven by Jones, which comes to the curb
In the backseat, Scott, another man sitting next to him, , dressed as a construction worker
The man starts to speak
And Scott shushes him, takes out a notebook and a pencil, and begins to make notes
118
,
deserted streetcorner
Various shuttered posh shops
Scott walking across the street
on Scott, as he paces, as he walks
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen
The camera takes him to the middle of the street
right- hand turn, a tight corner
He looks to his left
Beyond him, we see, several streets off, the sign of the "Royale" hotel
Scott beckons, and the man, Smith, comes out of the shadows
He and Scott walk to a small passageway, at the corner
Camera takes them through the passageway, where we see Jones, standing by his car, in an alley
It's good
(to Jones) It's very good
(Jones nods his thanks) The charge takes the car out
(to Smith) We got the flashbangs fore and aft, You hit the driver, follow down the driver's side, the car ain't going nowhere, the muscle gets out,  cap em,  go with the girl
(he points to Jones
He points to the car
Jones nods
To Smith) You exfil on your own, we're on to the airport
, tight on Scott, and Jones
At the airport
When we hit the Conex
When you Seal Us In
you walk away
understand
119
cannot have heat on it
Now: know: that you want to protect the package
But: you have to walk away
And que sera, sera
won't look back
Scott, at a desk, looking over his plans
photo of Laura Newton on his desk
Beyond him Smith and Jones are cleaning and assembling weapons
Scott takes out his switchblade and begins to hone it
Scott looks into the mechanism of the knife
Peers intently, turns it over and raps it on the table
We see a small seed fall out
Smith turns to the sound, and looks inquisitively at Scott
(as he picks the seed up, answering Smith's unspoken question) it's an appleseed
Smith nods as if to say,"If you say so"
Scott reaches over to a box of -Tips, which sits on the table along with other cleansing paraphernalia, and dips one in the solvent bottle, and begins to clean the interior of his switchblade
on Scott, as he cleans the interior of his knife
His face freezes
Scott leans over, and gestures at a tweezers as part of Smith's cleaning kit
Smith nods "okay"
The interior of the knife
small, wafer thin electronic device adhering to the interior
on Scott
As he turns his back on the group
We see, in an insert
He holds the electronic device up for scrutiny, in the tweezers
He walks toward the windows of the warehouse
(as he cleans his firearms, generally, as if speaking of the universe) "Johnny Appleseed", eh
yeah, 'm just a Man of Peace
We hear a car driving up, outside the warehouse
He looks out of the window
120
,
Just seen, the nose of a small , around the corner, three men, getting out of the car
Scott walks into a corridor of the warehouse
He looks down an industrial staircase, and sees the door at the bottom begin to open, stealthily
, camera takes Scott to a small, filthy bathroom
He opens the door
, at the bottom of the stairs, Stoddard, with two henchmen, heavily armed, look up
Scott walking into the bathroom
, a floor of the warehouse
Stoddard, and his accomplices, coming up the stairs to the floor, which holds Scott
There are several closed doors
One of the men consults a small hand-held '' unit, and points at one of the doors
The men take up position around this door
Stoddard nods, and they open fire through the door
,
The men kick down the door, to find the small cubicle-like room empty
One of them looks around, and sees, and removes the small wafer-thin electronic device from the top of the cistern
He shows it to Stoddard, who throws it down in disgust
As he, followed by his men, exit the room
We see the small  parked around the corner from the warehouse, a black clad driver, sitting in the car, watching the warehouse
The door is wrenched open, and we see Scott, the small yellow duffle over his shoulder, drag the driver from the car, and clout him to the ground
Scott gets into the car, which begins to drive off
" " (     )
, Laura Newton, drugged, listless, sitting on the bed in the small room
We hear a large explosion, and Laura gets up, and moves toward the door of her room
She hears another explosion, and shouts coming from outside her door
She is reaching for the handle of the door, when the door opens, and one of her Bodyguards opens the door, and addresses her
stay in your room, and
He turns as another explosion is heard, coming from the interior of the house
As he turns we hear glass breaking, and see Scott entering through the window behind Laura
121
The Bodyguard turns, and Scott raises a silenced    pistol, and shoots the Bodyguard twice
The Bodyguard falls,    Scott moves to him, and drags him inside the room
He raises    his pistol gesturing "shush" to Laura, and moves her toward    the window
who
He uses the rope outside   the   window to improvise a sling, for Laura, and drapes it   over   her head, and under her arms
Scott picks her up, and   holds   her for a moment
She starts to speak
And he answers   her   question
Stay by me
He hesitates for a moment
We hear another explosion, he nods, as if to say "That's what we're waiting for", and passes her out of the window, and begins lowering her to the ground
Laura, on the rope, reaching the ground
Scott, as he turns to the sound of the door opening, two men come through the door, and he shoots them
Scott puts Laura into the  and gets behind the driver's seat
He puts the car in gear, and it begins to drive off
Laura turns to face him
they said they were going to take care of me
'm going to take care of you
You hold on, now
(as Scott drives he reloads his weapons) (lazily) Who are you
you remember, Baby, we went to high school together
(pause) You dropped your earring
122
She shakes her head
Drugged
Trying to make sense of the proceedings
You're Picasso, right
That's who you are
He draws the Picasso sign on the windshield, she looks at it, having trouble focusing
they're going to send me to a Party
No, Baby, you're going Home
(pause) You're just taking the long way home
Moving through the streets
The airport just becoming visible in the background
Laura, asleep, at a small cardtable
Out of the window we see an expanse of desert and scrub
Her head is down
Scott enters the room, he moves a chair in front of the door, moves to Laura, and manhandles her to a small cot, and closes the shutters to the window
told you to stay on the bed
We see her wake and look around, trying to place herself
on Scott, as he takes out a notebook and begins to make notes in it
you're going travelling
what
we're going to take a little trip
She takes out a crumpled pack of cigarettes, and extracts the last one
She takes out a match
put that away
123
need a smoke
'can't smoke it
American tobacco
Smell
Carry
In the desert air
He looks down his list, and nods
He takes a bandana from his pocket and hands it to her
Put that on
Over your head
Whatsamatter, you don't like Blondes
Whole world likes Blondes
That's why you're here
Put the bandana on
(as she tries to light the cigarette) need a smoke
(He takes it away from her, and crumbles it
) gimme the fucken smoke
He shushes her, and moves to the window
,
The window
The first gleam of dawn
And, far off, a Muezzin is heard chanting morning prayers
Laura moves toward him, unbuttoning her blouse
could make you give me the smoke
He slaps her lightly in the face
Keep it together
(he takes a small hypodermic kit) Keep it together, or 'm gonna give you a shot and carry you out
She reacts violently to the sight of the needle
Beat
Then, she sits on the bed and cries self-pityingly
Nobody Cares about me
124
Hold
On Scott
And we take him back to a small shelf near the door
He takes down what we see is an ashtray, overfull with yellow-brown cigarette butts
He takes the ashtray to the small table, takes out his knife, and begins shredding the butts, and gathering the tobacco into a pile
that's right
'm just a whore
They wouldn't even come get me
They sent me
Scott looks at the pile of tobacco
He extracts the "Rogers Rangers" card from his pocket and looks at it
We read, in an insert: "Rule #13: Every night, you'll be told where to Meet, if Surrounded by Superior Force"
, on Scott, as he very precisely peels the card into two thin halves, and rolls one of the halves into a cigarette, using the reclaimed tobacco from the ashtray
He takes the cigarette to Laura
As a peace offering
She takes it
Beat
Did my father send you
(as he lights her cigarette) that's right
(derisively) One man
One riot, one Ranger, you ever hear that
, on Scott, as he hears a car outside the window
He draws a pistol and moves to the window, and looks down
He gestures Laura to be quiet
The window
In the small, deserted street
car pulls up
man gets out, and looks around
Beat
Another man, and a woman, and two small children come out of the low house and get into the car, which drives away
125
Leonides, the King of Sparta, when a neighboring state would beg for Military Aid
Would send One Man
well, there you go
you ever hear that
No
think we went to different schools
He looks at her
Beat
She hands him the cigarette
And he takes a drag, and passes it back
He checks his watch
put the bandana on
(softly) Did you hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into Gold
Yeah -  heard that one
Beat
She turns away, and cries
don't want to go home
didn't ask you
long view of the airport
, a small delivery van we saw earlier
Parked in an industrial area
Laura, dozing in the passengers seat
Scott, sitting in the driver's seat, alert, watching
Seen beyond the corner of an industrial building, beyond a chainlink fence, the airport
Laura wakes with a start, and looks around
126
don't know where we are
You just keep it together
Scott as he looks up to the sound of a plane
Directly over their heads, a small bizjet, on final, about to touch down
, the chainlink fence
Scott and Laura at the fence protecting the airport
Scott moves aside the pre-cut section of fence, and gestures him through
, inside the fence
Laura and Scott moving to the protection of a small hangar
, beyond them, we see the bizjet come to a halt, on the tarmac, and turn
We see blazoned, on its side, "Global News"
, on Scott and Laura, now inside the small hangar
Scott moves to a small locker and extracts a set of coveralls, and a cap, and takes them to Laura
(of the coveralls) You put this on
(groggily) what
You
pause
He turns to the sound of a car
car, on the tarmac
It comes to a stop by a private plane
Beyond this private plane, we see the "Global News" bizjet, being directed to a stop
, on Scott, as he watches the tarmac
Stoddard and several of his men, get out of the car which has stopped by the private plane
man in fatigues emerges from the plane, and hands Stoddard a piece of paper
Stoddard begins giving this man directions
Scott and Laura, who now has on the mechanics coveralls
127
Scott, as he looks out of the hangar door
To his right, the plane with Stoddard and his men, to his left, the "Global News" bizjet, its hatchway staircase, just descending
on Scott, as he looks at his watch
He turns to Laura
little walk-in-the-park
(he points her to the News jet) See there
Where a man in a safari jacket, and a woman emerge from the plane, and glare at the sun
We see this man consult his watch
, on Scott and Laura, as he walks her out of the hangar, and towards the news bizjet
In the
We see Stoddard, and his men, at their plane
Another car pulls up to Stoddard, disgorging a man, who goes to conference with Stoddard
, these two men
(giving his report) all of the passenger terminals, and all access-points to the Cargo and General Aviation
(groggily, as in a dream) No, you know what my mistake was
(as he looks around) what was that
He stops and picks up a pair of "paddles" from their position, leaning against the nose wheel of a plane
They walk on
In the  we see Stoddard and his crew, searching
what was your mistake
(from a distance, as she begins to laugh, as at a great private joke; she stops walking) you think we bring our troubles on ourselves
128
'm certain of it
She starts laughing, getting hysterical
No, no
come on baby
come on, come on girl: just walk to the plane: Just Get On the Plane
She starts to break free and Scott manoeuvres her into a small hangar area
She is struggling mightily
Scott has his hand over her mouth
We see their feet moving through a pool of oil on the concrete floor - we see she loses her footing
We see Scott tighten his grip on her, and is furiously trying to calm her
Shussh, baby
shussh
shussh
it's going to be alright
We see him work a small hypodermic kit from the pocket of his jacket
We see Laura see it, and her eyes grow wide
This's going to make Everything Allright
Laura reacts to the hypodermic, which Scott is bringing toward her
And screams
No
We see Stoddard, and his men, about to get into their Jeep, stop, and turn at the sound
The Hangar Area
Signs all over marked in Arabic and English - "Petrol - No Smoking
" As Scott lunges after Laura, the door, behind her bursts open, and Stoddard and an accomplice enter, placing Laura, in the midst of the hangar, between Stoddard and Scott
Who stands in front of a large tanker labelled "Aviation Gasoline"
129
Leave her Alone
(to his men) Don't shoot him, don't shoot, you'll blow the thing sky high
Laura
Thank God we Found you
You know me
work for Mister Burch
've met you
on Laura, standing between the two men
She is completely confused
She looks from one to another
(drugged and groggy) He said that he came to get me
(she shakes her head in disbelief
Then she starts to walk a step toward Scott, then turns, and proceeds toward Stoddard
) That's right, Laura
Walk away from him
Walk to the Plane
He can't hurt you now
Walk to the plane
He points at his bizjet, outside, on the tarmac
Laura walks, unsteadily, in the direction pointed, and we see a female attendant, in a vaguely military getup, get out of the plane, and begin to walk toward Laura
(screams) No
He starts toward Laura
And Stoddard and his two men interpose themselves between Scott and Laura, who is approaching the plane
Stoddard's two men approach Scott
One draws a knife
on Scott, who hangs his head, wearily
He looks down at his empty hands
on the man with the knife, approaching him
130
on Scott, straightening himself, as if submitting to the inevitable, as the man with the knife draws closer
He makes a thrust, and covers
Scott steps toward him and spits at him, full in the face
The man with the knife recoils for a moment, and Scott disarms him, throws him viciously to the concrete floor, and stomps on him
Scott bends to pick up the knife the man has dropped, and turns to face the other man
As he does so, he slips on what we see is a large pool of oil on the floor
He goes down heavily
And the second man steps into him as he falls, drawing his pistol
' , ' , ' The man uses the pistol to cuff Scott, who is attempting to rise to his knees, behind the ear
Scott falls
Cuff 'im
The man handcuffs Scott behind his back
on Scott shaking his head to clear it, as he now struggles to his knees
, his
Laura Newton, walking toward the bizjet
(to Scott) Yes
well
Let the girl go home
(pause) (to his henchmen) wait till she lifts off, take him outside and shoot him
(as he speaks he moves, slightly, continuously, to get a better view of the girl) why can't the Girl Go Home
() Because she's dead
(pause) You had to know the Secret Knowledge
Didn't you
131
What is the Secret Knowledge
The Secret Knowledge is: There Is No Secret Knowledge
(turns over his shoulder, to look at Laura, walking toward the plane) You went Beyond What Was Permitted
And the Gods Are Angry
On the tarmac
Laura, walking toward the plane, the petroleum storage hangar behind her
We see a vaguely military uniformed woman fall into step beside her and take her arm
Laura looks at her
We see Laura full face, and just the shoulder of the woman escorting her
Beyond them we hear the engine of the bizjet start up
'm so tired
'm going to ask you to do Just the One More Thing
Laura looks at her questioningly
'm going to ask you, now, to walk away from this plane, and come with me
, to show that the stewardess, who descended from the bizjet (the vaguely military clad young woman we saw earlier) is still on station outside of the bizjet, and that the woman who is walking and talking with Laura is Jackie Black, the young female sergeant we met earlier
Laura looks at her uncomprehendingly
Laura begins shaking her head pathetically, and protesting, drawing away from Jackie Black
No
leave me alone
No -  don't know you
,
The Petroleum Hangar
Day
132
(to his men, as he, Stoddard, casts a glance outside, and then back) Alright, take him outside
(the henchman hoists Scott to his feet) , on Laura and Jackie Black
Standing immobile
Laura looks down at something
She then looks up, her face transfixed
, on Jackie Black's hands, she holds the cheap jewelry box we saw earlier, and, in it
The photo of Laura and Donny, and the legend: "Donny you can keep this box, cause  will never take them off
" , on Laura, as she looks at Jackie, who now moves Laura away from the bizjet, and towards the assemblage of newspeople, who are on the tarmac, around the "global news" jet
,
The Global News Jet
female reporter, gossiping, with some of her crew, looks over in the direction of Laura and Jackie, and does a double-take
Oh, my God
, on Stoddard, his man, and Scott
As they leave the hangar
Stoddard looks around
, his
Inside the hangar, the fallen man, that Scott has killed
Stoddard goes back inside, to drag this man away
He looks up
And, as he does so, he sees Laura, walking with Jackie Black, toward the Global News Plane
(yells) Wait
, on Jackie Black and Laura, walking toward the plane, where we see the crew hurriedly setting up a camera
, on Stoddard, as he draws his pistol, and fires toward Laura and Jackie
We see Jackie move to shield Laura, and then, struck by a bullet, she goes down
(to Laura) Keep walking
, on Scott, in the grip of Stoddard's henchman
133
(to Stoddard) do you want me to
In the moment he is distracted
Scott breaks the man's grip, and his arm
He knees the man, and kicks him to the ground
,
The Global Jet
The news crew reacts to the shot
Beyond them we see Jackie, fallen to the tarmac, and Laura, is walking toward the newspeople
Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink
Now Now Now
Inside the jet we see various monitors, and one switches from an innocuous travelogue, to the scene at the airport, and the caption "Live"
We see the shot is taken from inside the plane
We see Laura stumbling toward the bizjet, and see the female reporter run out of the plane, and move her to safety inside the cabin
(to the unseen cameraman) On her
On her, get it on the girl
Get us Out of Here
The camera shifts to the image of Laura Newton, going out live
Behind her we hear the crew shooting commands, and see the door to the Global jet close, as the jet begins to taxi
,
The Petroleum Hangar
We see Stoddard, reloading his pistol
In the  we see Scott step through his handcuffs, that is, bring them in front of his body
He takes a pistol from the henchman, who is writing on the floor
He raises the pistol and shoots the henchman
He turns on Stoddard
The girl ain't dead, baby, you're dead
You see: that's the difference
He walks toward Stoddard,who is fumbling, trying to reload his pistol
:
The girl's home
You brought her home
Now, listen to me, because  am going to tell you
now, you wanted to be "inside"
am going to take you as far inside as you can go: 'at what you want
Is that what you want
134
No,  just wanted to bring the girl back
He shoots Stoddard, who falls
,
The Bizjet, as it taxis
Laura Newton turns her face to the sound of the shot
, her
Jackie Black, on the tarmac, Scott, kneeling to the fallen Stoddard, and then running out of the hangar toward her
, on Scott, running, as we see he has the key he has taken from Stoddard, and is releasing his handcuffs
Jackie Black, bleeding, as Scott kneels to her, and cradles her
Scott looks down
Black is weakening, and obviously expiring
is she safe
That's right, she's safe
(weakly, almost whispering) well, then
on Scott, cradling her
Weeping, as he smoothes her hair
that's right, Baby
