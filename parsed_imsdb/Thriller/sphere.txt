"Sphere", early draft, by Stephen Hauser by Stephen Hauser based on the novel, , by Michael Crichton March 5, 1996 -- Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps
Apartment buildings line the curb, it is very quiet
In one building, six floors up, a bedroom light is on
the silhouette of Norman's looking out the window
(
) What kind of a crash was it
(
) You seen my suitcase
(
) There's nothing on the news about a crash
Did he say what airline
(
) He didn't say much at all
Honey -- (
) In the closet
don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you
(
) Don't be so supportive, honey
(
) Well,  can't imagine five years of unemployment -- (
) Four
Four years -- (
) Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume
(
) Keep watching the news
Are you watching the news
(
) How are you getting to the airport
You need money for the bus
tinted-window black  travels down the street, pulls up in front of the apartment building
decal is on the door
(
) There's a
Navy car outside, Norman
(
) What
(
) Was it a military crash
(
) don't know
(
) They never used to send a Navy car
: , -- Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter  by, speeding above the Pacific Ocean
-- Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back
He studies a pamphlet in his hand: " :   "
The , in the cockpit, turns to him
What kinda work you in, Dr
Johnson
Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag
'm in psychology
Was
Still am really, just been a while
(beat) treat aircrash survivors
Oh, so you're that Dr
Johnson
You've heard of me
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote
What report
Huh
What report
You mean you don't know
Know what
The pilot glances back at him again
Must be another Johnson then
Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight
Who's everyone
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it
Geologists
At a plane crash
Strange, isn't it
In the middle of the ocean no less
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash
Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the water
-- The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about young, female  -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter
She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag
Any other bags, Dr
Johnson
Just that
Careful, it's heavy
She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem
No other equipment
Scientific instruments
No, they didn't say -- This way, sir
Norman follows the officer away from the helipad
She leads Norman down a flight of stairs
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir
Captain who
Barnes
He's very eager to meet you
Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived
Really
As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit, tries to smooth it out
By the way sir, 've read your report
think it's brilliant
What report
You mean they haven't told you yet
Told me what
She staightens up, like she might have said too much
This way, sir
' , 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on the phone
How's he look
Well, we can't all be officers, can we
(laughs) They tell me he's brilliant
' Norman stands in front of the door
The doorplate reads: --
Norman straightens his big-knotted tie
Deep breath
' As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his desk, as Norman steps inside
Dr
Norman Johnson
Welcome aboard
They shake hands
Thank you, Colonel
Captain
Captain
Right, forgive me
Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up
An akward silence
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it
Don't thank me, Dr
Johnson
You weren't my choice
The Pentagon made me take you
(smiling) The Pentagon
didn't know  had friends in Washington
Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door
Come with me
The team's already waiting
What team
Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with  and
What have you been told so far
The usual
Plane crash
Survivers unknown
Routine stuff really
Anything else
Nothing else
unlocks a large, steel door
Captain Barnes
Dr
Johnson
Hello
Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway, wondering how the guard knows his name
You talk to any reporters
Any press
Press
No,  haven't
The steel door shuts loudly behind them
Good
Security's been our biggest worry
Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight
From what
What's with all the security
Well, we don't have all the facts yet
Another  opens up another large steel door
Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors, screens, and grids
Officers talk into radios
Technicians work on computers
We're moving fast considering the storm
Storm
What storm
cyclone's on it's way in thought they would have told you on the phone
They didn't tell me anything
Norman tries to keep pace
We've had divers working around the clock
Take a look at this
a large   -- shows a diver walking on the ocean floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight
How deep is he
thousand feet
thousand
An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water --  don't want to sound pessimistic here, but assume there are no survivors
Survivors
No,  wouldn't think so
Then why am  here
What
What do you need me for
-- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic What crashed wasn't an airplane, Dr
Johnson
It's a bit larger than that
Barnes walks toward a , sitting at a keyboard
(to technician) Bring up the grid, would you
as an     begins to form
What is it
military spacecraft
Like a shuttle or satellite
Something like that
(beat) That doesn't surprise you
Not really, no
Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret
When did it crash
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago
beat
Four hundred
You're kidding, right
-- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft and a small layer of  above it
See this
Coral
Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick
Geologists
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year -- -- Wait a second -- -- dating the crash at least that old
Hold on -- Maybe older -- -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft
There's no such thing
our space program isn't even forty years old
Extraordinary, isn't it
It's impossible
'm afraid it is Dr
Johnson
because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor
Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs
Off the record,  don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me
It doesn't make any sense
We think it might
That's why we brought you here
We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now
What team
The one you recommended
In the report you wrote for the Bush administration
report
Nobody's mentioned that in years
You mean someone actually read it
As they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the   out from under his arm, hands it to Norman
Norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr
Johnson
We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail
But sir,  don't understand
This report -- these recommendations
they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life
-- sonar video of the spacecraft
(
) How big is this spacecraft
(
) Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet
(
) half a mile long
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen
The team members sit around the conference table: , 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here , 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron
, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet
, 32, mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit
How much damage
To the craft
None
Not a scratch
Right
So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch
'm not saying anything, Harry, 'm just stating the facts
(continuing) The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb
The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented
Never invented
, watching the team
In basic English, what does all this mean
Basic English
There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet
-- large, -Ray  moves to the side, revealing Norman's
-- standing next to him
Five years
No phone calls
What am -- a leper
Norman sits up
Beth, look, can  trust you with a little secret
love secrets
That  report everybody's patting me on the back about
've read it twice, Norman
It's brilliant
It's bullshit
The report's a joke
(beat) That's quite a secret
spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone
Seriously
was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- had no idea -- , standing behind glass in the next room, monitoring Beth and Norman
Do yourself a favor, Norman
Are you listening
Don't tell anyone what you just told me
'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind
Because when we get down there -- Wait -- down where
To the spacecraft
To investigate
Underwater
What do you expect
For them to bring it up here
We can't go down there
We're not prepared
That deep
That takes years of training, Beth
We're just scientists
Lab scietists
We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here
In the ocean
(off his look) 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman
That's first grade geography
It never occurred to me
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made
Have you said anything to Barnes about this
The timing has never seemed quite right
Just keep your mouth shut, alright
This could mean everything to our careers, you know that
Don't jeopardize this
(nervous laughter) What -- are you threatening me
-- -- clouds looming on the horizon
, leaning against the railing, looking out at the water
, approaching him
Arthur never looks at Norman, he just stares out at the water
don't know you, but 'll be honest with you
don't like this
don't like any of this
Especially, the water
Seasick
marine biologist
don't belong here
None of us belong here
Look at that
, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves
Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't it
It scares the shit out of me
: , lying on a cot
It is dark
His eyes are open
He stares at the ceiling
: porthole hatch to the   unlatches loudly
- help Norman lower himself through the hatch
Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment
Seated in a circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur
Ahead of them, Captain Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall of plexiglass
Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted
(
) (through the intercom) Our descent will take 13 minutes
Descending at a speed of 80 feet per minute
Across from Norman, Harry is  something quietly into Arthur's ear
(
) Pressure adjustments will cause the sub to lurch at times, but don't be alarmed
It's perfectly normal
Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his ear
(
) The sub's interior atmosphere will experience moisture as we descend, and the temperature will drop rapidly
Just relax and remain seated during the descent
Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat
(
) We have clearing from the base
Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and   the sub make a  sound
The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the water
Arthur
Harry has gotten to Arthur
Arthur is on the verge of panic
Arthur
You alright
Open the hatch door, please
Harry continues to whisper in his ear
Captain, open the hatch door, please the hatch door, Captain
Open it, please
(
) Calm down, Dr
Levine
Let me out, Captain
Open the door
(
) Please, Dr
Levine
Arthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass wall
(through the plexiglass) Sit down, Dr
Levine
You're in a military operation now -- Arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists
Your civil rights have been overridden
Open it, Captain
Dr
Levine, please
Return to your seat
Arthur , violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall
Open the fucking door
The sub  again, coming to a stop
The compartment is totally silent, as they begin ascending to the surface
smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman
The sub lurches again, and   clanking metal
The hatch door opens
And Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and out the hatch door
(
) Anybody else
Silence
The hatch door , loudly
The sub lurches, and begins descending
Pussy
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman
He wasn't feeling well
He's a pussy
Harry is still staring at Norman
How are you feeling, Norman
What
You holding up alright
Fine
'm fine
Don't be defensive
'm not being defensive
You sound defensive
'm fine
(to Harry) What'd you say to him
To who
Arthur
Nothing
Nothing that Norman doesn't already know
What does Norman already know
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down
Thinks it's a mistake
Norman looks over at Beth
She told me what you said, Norman
What is it, Harry
Just one of Norman's many secrets
, saying nothing
the sub descending into darker waters
-8  -- The  descends into the , metal clanks against metal
Around it, the -8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights
-- closing tightly, locking
(
) One moment for pressurizing
-- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the small, claustrophobic pressurizing room
Like sardines
Nobody says anything
long beat
in front of them, opens
, 30s, a big-boned female officer, stands before them
She wears a black plastic , a "talker", around her neck
She hands each member their own "talker"
Norman takes his
-8 Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway
Each of them wears the "talkers" around their necks
They pressurize us with helium
What's wrong with oxygen
It's a corrosive gas
On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile
At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic
Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile
Important safety tip
Thanks Captain
Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes
Captain, the divers have the airlock mounted at the door
The robot is now in position to enter the spacecraft
Robot
What robot
-- showing the robot in front of the curved gray metal of the spacecraft
Edmunds, bring up the robot's camera feed
, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel
Another clicks on -- showing the robot's  of the door
Captain, you know,  really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television
Nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside
--    scans the spacecraft hull, stops on a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door
Can you open that panel
Working on it now, sir
-- a robotic  extends out to the panel
Trying to pry the panel open
'd like it noted in the report that think we should be doing this ourselves
Making a manned entry
The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal
'd also like it noted -- Duly noted, Ted
Edmunds, try using suction
-- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber sucker
It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck
It's not sucking, sir
Thank you,  can see that
Try something else
We don't have anything else to try, Sir
Well, shit -- find something, do something
make something up -- What about a crowbar
Barnes straightens up, looks at Ted
What about a crowbar
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open
Pry the thing open
What are we -- neanderthals
All that banging and pounding don't know
We should think about making a good first impression
For who
The fish
For whoever's in that thing
Or whatever's in that thing
-- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, staring back at them
Norman, what do you think
Norman, quiet in the corner, perks up
Me
Well --  don't really mean, you could
you know, you could make a real solid case
a crowbar
All eyes on Norman
don't know
beat as they all stare at him
'm secure enough with that
door opening
Inside is an elaborate  and with the name: "", stenciled above the faceplate
Are we all --  mean, is it necessary for all of us to go
out there
The other team members take their suits out of their lockers
Nothing to be nervous about
These suits are wired and electrically heated
Each equipped with an alarm that triggers automatically if life- support sustems go below optimum
Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it's something nuclear
It's just like swimming, Norman
You know how to swim, don't you
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman
They all look over at him
(half smiling) Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr
Johnson
(under his breath) Yeah
Drowning
-- ( ) Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a  of ocean water, cut out from the floor, leading to the ocean
It looks like a tiny swimming pool
Ted jumps in next
Beth, Harry, and Norman are left
You're next, Norman
(nervous as hell) No
Go ahead
Really
Ladies first
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless
She hops in
Norman watches, looks up at Harry, next to him
Go ahead
Ladies first
No, why don't -- Harry nudges him forward
'mon
Wait a second,  -- Harry pushes him again
Norman catches himself
Geez, c'mon, alright
Gimme a minute
Let me get my bearings -- Harry pushes him again
'mon, Norman
Look, would you -- And Harry just pushes him in
Norman slips and falls awkwardly
into the ocean depths
: Quiet
Only     --
For a couple beats
Now
'  -- from inside his helmet -- a light  from behind him -- casting his  onto the murky ocean floor
Norman's head turns, and he's  by a light -- it's Harry, the light  from the top of Harry's helmet
Harry's voice, static, through Norman's helmet
(
) The switch is on your waist
-- his  -- fumbling at his waist
--  on
-- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor
-- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy ground
'  -- can barely make out the others in front of him, their helmet lights  the dark water, crossing each other, like searchlights on a foggy night
'  -- eyes cold,
Couple beats
And : (
) Look at that thing
Norman's eyes look up
, ,   of the team -- their little helmet lights tiny and insignificant almost as
-- the
Dwarfing them in size, looming large, majestic, like nothing we've ever seen
The enormous tail fin, in the distance, extends high out of the coral
In the huge    covering the spacecraft,   a tunnel -- cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs
About 60 feet deep
Narrower than they'd like
Norman descends, clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to the coral walls
'  as he watches the water recede, down past his faceplate
Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and  at it with a sledgehammer
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold
Gimme some room here, will you
Back off
Gimme some space
They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted keeps swinging
Looks alot like an airplane door, doesn't it
Ted stops and looks at the door
Alot like
You know,  noticed it before, but  didn't
Shutup, Ted
You didn't notice shit
Keep hammering
You want me to try
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do
Give him the hammer, Ted
Norman takes the hammer
Walks up to the wedge
Gets his bearings
Rears back
then stops
What is it, your back give out
Something has caught Norman's eye
He looks down at the wedge
What is it, Norman
Take a look
Barnes comes toward him
The others follow
Barnes bends down, looks closely down at the wedge in the door
It's chipped
Chipped
The door
How can it be chipped
don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped
thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash
did
Then how can it be chipped
-- she touches the door with her palms, feels around
There's heat coming the door
Back away then
Wait a minute -- said back away
Would you wait a minute
Barnes unstraps a  -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his buckle
Ted, get her away from the door
What are you going to do -- shoot her
The  louder
Get her away
begins to slide open
Beth backs away
, sliding, is revealing   inside
The door stops, it's open, it's quiet
They all stand there, looking at long beat
-- cautiously stepping inside
His helmet light  on the others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide , suspended high in the air
Metallic  and  criss-cross above them
Norman looks over the railing -- his light  through 40 feet of darkness, dimly lighting the  , a dense network of  and Look at this
What is it

Some sort of lead or something
Radiation shield, you think

That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation
Beth's light  down onto the
outlined on the dusty floor
Hold on -- What is it
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up
No
don't think so
Well, think
Because there's footprints here that aren't mine
Well, they're not mine
-- large, like the boots they're wearing
Calm down, alright
They gotta be somebody's here
Let's stay together, please
: -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk, walking
Their tiny streams of  moving about
just how ominous this spacecraft really is
It's empty
Why would someone build a ship like this
You'd have to ask them
They approach a , at the end of the catwalk
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before
How about  just press the button
She presses a button near the door
The door  open
Or just
press the button
Barnes holds out his gun, and enters
The others behind him
Strange, isn't it
You know -- how it would have a button
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted
Still, make a note  recognized that
-- leading them through a small hall
It seems to be opening up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops
Dead in his tracks
What's wrong
(serious) What do you make of this
-- as he steps around Barnes, his light  on: that reads: "Trash
" (softly) What the hell
Very softly, Harry begins to laugh
English
That's right
Norman looks up and  more of the room as his light throughout it: ,  and  -- made of leather, very comfortable looking
They begin to slowly wander about
don't get it
It doesn't make any sense
You don't think it does
think it's rather obvious
Is it some sort of joke
Like one of those hoaxes
spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it
Someone went to a lot of trouble
Try again
But it's impossible
Is it
Beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery
Why would this ship carry instructions in English
Think about it
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable
400 years ago
'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations
Good theory, Ted
Well, what's your theory
'm a woman
don't theorize only deal with facts
All the facts you need are right in front of you
Gimme a minute here
think 've got it
Do you
If it is an alien spacecraft -- Save your breath
It's not an alien spacecraft
Then what is it
(beat) It's an American spacecraft
An American spacecraft
Half a mile long
And buried 400 years
Yeah, good theory, Harry
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain
That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it
We had considered it
Considered what
That it's American
How would you think it's American
The chip in the door
-- glancing up at Harry
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal
Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper
But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere
Not even a scratch
Meaning
Meaning it didn't land in the water
Please
It must have flown here -- It didn't fly here
It arrived here
Arrived
From where
Not where
When
400 years ago
From our future
quiet moment as they take this in
-- Ted and Barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two ants wlth flashlights
Time travel
always thought it was one of those myths
like Santa's reindeer
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back
Maybe we didn't want to come back

Sounds a little like water -- -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him -- sucking him inside

Get this thing off me

And the desk in front of them  , a control panel coming to life
Nice work, Norman
Whatever  can do to help
as it changes, now filled with columns: Harry punches some keys on the control panel

Our future is about to be seen in our present

Unknown Entry Event
Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys
-- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving
a galaxy of stars, planets coming   , into the room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the illusion of depth
The  begins streaking outward,  , moving rapidly, like we're flying through it
The stars and other space matter streaking by
What's that cluster of stars there
In the center
Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3- image
Our answer
To what
Time travel
black hole
The  of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer and closer, brightening
The  twists and turns as the  and  become  as the cluster, the black hole
-- his face, bright,  as he : (
) Ted
Captain
(
) Yes, Harry
(
) We know how this craft got here
Where it's been
(
) So do we
And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels
-- frightened
Picked up something
What is it
(
) don't know
But it's something alien
: our six team members' , in the distance and    a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly swirling green and blue fluids
Like mercury
Mesmerizlng
, the team stands looking at the , 30 feet in dlameter, held by a   gripping it from the top
They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it
This answers one of our questions
Which one
Let me get the list out
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up
They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in
They come across this
This
sphere Find it interesting, curious
They draw it inside to take back home
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past
Our present
But what does it do
This
sphere
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know
See this red here
-- some dark red  on it's surface
(continuing) Looks like a design, some writing, maybe
Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message
Look closely
That isn't writing
Those are grooves
-- engraved into the surface
No
They don't represent a message
They aren't decorative at all
They have another purpose entirely
What
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere
break for what
-- --   Barnes, through a half-closed door, pacing, talking on the phone
it's definitely something alien another civilization, yes, sir
Well, we don't know yet, but we think we've found a door
Edmunds, Barnes, and the team members (minus Ted) look at the monitor
So how do we get it open
Ted seems to have some ideas
-- Ted pushing on the  door
Banging into it with his shoulder
Maybe we shouldn't
What
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all
(nodding to Norman) Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows
The anthropomorphic problem
Good, Norman
The what
mentioned it in my report
Didn't you read the report
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human
If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding
So
What's the problem
It's nonsense
There's enough difference between our own species to prove that
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty
Cannibalism, to be extreme
And now we're talking about a new life form
Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible
Like "Thou shall not kill"
Or maybe, it can't be killed
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal
don't know
That's the point
Everything can be killed
Not everything
Even on earth
Take yeasts
Yeasts
Thank you, Beth, but  don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures
What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional
So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it
Good point
don't know what you're talking about, but good point
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind
It could
But the odds of it being any use to us are against it
You don't know that
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe
Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a  set
There wouldn't be any place to plug it in
Just tell me worst case
Worst case of what we might find
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think
Produce radioactive waste and disintegrate us into nothing
: , : "Surface winds at 25 knots -- Estimated Time of Departure -- 01:45 hrs" : -8 Empty, sterile
the repeating sound:
Almost like a dripping faucet
Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at his cheek:
You realize, Norman, that we are all going to die
Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry
Don't be so optomistic, Harry
'm completely serious
There is something very important missing from that spacecraft
You know what that is
Not a clue
sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible
don't follow you
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event
" They didn't know what a black hole was
Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible
So what
Harry leans his head over his bunk
So, we know (beat) We know it went through a black hole
We saw it
Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we
It'd go in some report like some big discovery
So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole
(beat) But they didn't The called it an Unknown Entry Event
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive
to tell anyone
Norman gets out of his bed
can't believe that, Harry
Gimme another explanation
Norman pacing
can't
If  had a minute to think, maybe, but  know you're wrong
Am
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight
You mean, you think 'm cracking
No
didn't say that
Then what, Norman
Norman stops pacing, a beat
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry
Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you
Curious, isn't it
What's inside
Before  die, 'd sure like to open it and see
: Video of the sphere
rewinding
What caused it
Nothing
don't know
Everything was normal
No changes at all
When did it happen
Seconds ago
Here
:   the sphere -- idle
Nothing around it
Then it's slowly , revealing  inside
beat
And then it closes
Let me see that again
Edmunds plays it again
This time
, staring at the monitor
(to himself) 'd sure like to open it and see
-- those cold, intelligent eyes
: , : "
30 knots --  -- 00:19 min" : -- Norman and Barnes
Don't get hysterical, Norman
'm telling you, Harry's lost it
He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us
Look, the ships are clearing out
They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes
Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant
All 'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him
Just worry about yourself
Barnes on the phone with the surface
Ted talking to him anyway
Can  stay, sir
'm willing to risk it
am
After what we just witnessed
(into phone) What
No,  know they're civilians
-- gathering his things
Stuffing his shotty dufflebag
Beth, at her bunk, doing the same
Norman stands up
Looks at the bunk above him: unpacked clothes, unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying:
-- panicking, looking around for Harry
: -- (into phone) said send the subs down, damn it
Barnes out the door, Ted at his heels
Did you hear me, sir, because -- Ted, shut up
Are you packed
Ready to go
want everyone packed
Now
-- running at them
Harry's missing
What do you mean, he's missing
He's missing
He's gone
He left
He's here somewhere
Find him
The sub's on it's way
(they look at him) Go
'mon
Norman runs off
Barnes storms down the hall
How can he be missing
Sir, about leaving -- We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside
Edmunds working the monitors, stops
Seeing something on a screen
Staring in horror
(to herself) Oh my gosh
Barnes, phone to his ear
Gimme a report,  want -- (
) Ladies and Gentlemen
Who is that
Where's that coming from
(
) Please watch your closest monitor
Barnes turns
-- Harry, in jumpsuit and helmet, stands in front of the Barnes quickly puts on his headset mic
What's he doing there
Edmunds, Norman, Beth, Ted staring at the monitor
thought he was with you, Norman
Through the speakers
(
) Get him out of there
thought told you people -- (into her mic) Harry
Can you copy
-- Harry, before the
Pay close attention
think you will find this of interest
The sphere  slowly opens
What the hell is he doing
Harry steps up and into the sphere
The door closes slowly behind him

You can't just leave Harry down here, sir

But sir -- No "buts"
If he wants to be left, we'll leave him

We come down as a team, we leave as a team
What are you -- his mother
Get Norman,  want everyone ready to go
(into mic) Edmunds, the subs
(
) Nothing, sir
What the hell is going on here
Beth rushes by Ted, carrying bags to the door
Norman
Where's Norman
By the bunks
Beth running in
Norman
Norman
Can't see him anywhere
Norman
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman
(
) Yes, sir
Well, where the fuck is he
(
) In the ship, sir
Barnes spins to see the monitor
What
-- Norman, in jumpsuit and helmet, running through the ship
Barnes slipping on headset mic
Norman
Norman
Norman running across a catwalk
(
) You get your ass back here
You have no authority whatsoever to be in there
You hear me
Norman
Don't go hero on me now

) They've left, keep watching
Sir
Sir, the door -- it's opening

Revealing: (
) Where is he
Damn it
Can you see him
still moment and then Harry tumbles out the sphere, and falls to the ground
Barnes, squinting at Harry on his monitor
(
) How does he look
Can you tell
Harry lies motionless
(
) He looks
dead, sir
-- in the hall, hearing that
Norman, running, blindly, through a hall, around corners
(
) Norman, get out of there now
Norman
If the subs aren't here yet, sir -- Barnes, into his headset
They'll be here
Norman -- can you hear me
-- running
(
) You don't have time
Get the hell out of -- Barnes' voice goes static, and cuts out
-- flickering, losing power
Sir, we're losing it
-- flickering, fading, and all the lights and monitors -- lying still, face down under the sphere
Goes to him
Checks Harry's
Still blinking -- he's still alive
Norman, pauses, looks up, staring at
Mesmerizing
He can see himself, reflected in the swirling mass, staring back at himself
The door begins to open, closes
Begins to open
Dark
Ted, Beth, and Barnes wander throughout
What the hell happened
The lights flicker back on
They switched us over
To what
Internal power
What for
: -- a cable falling from the surface, coiling around and around
: their dufflebags piled in the corner by the door
They've been left behind
-- -- it's quiet
inside the cafeteria
(
) The surface ships will be back
After the storm clears
(
) How long will that be
Barnes speaks to the team (minus Harry and Norman)
They told me about sixty hours
Two and a half days
How long can we last down here
Comfortably
Seventy-two hours
Comfortably -- what's that mean -- with oxygen
: ' Harry lies on his bunk
He begins to slowly awake
, like nails on a chalkboard
It gets  as Harry comes to
He puts his fingers to his temples
Norman stands beside, him writing in his notebook
What is that
That noise
What noise
It's like
Norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the  stops
Harry sighs
Norman looks down at his pen
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere
What are you still doing here
You remember opening the door
You were all supposed to leave
You weren't supposed to stay down here
Tell me about the door
Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere
Harry
You don't understand about the sphere
Then explain it to me
Harry pauses, staring almost like a frightened little boy
Norman
What is it, Harry
What happens on page 87
Have you ever read page 87
Page 87 of what, Harry
could never read that far
never wanted to
That far in what, Harry
Harry doesn't say anything
Norman waiting
You shouldn't be here, Norman
It's too dangerous for you and the others to be down here
/ Beth comes out from behind a vinyl shower curtain
towel wrapped around her
(
) Beth --  wanted to have a word with you
Barnes washes his hands at the sink, looking at her in the mirror in front of him
Back at the door --  asked you to back away
Yeah
heard you
There are procedures, Beth, that want followed
My procedures
And considering what's going on,  want you to follow them very closely
(a beat) Forgive me
've never read the Navy manual
wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures
He walks to the door, then turns
And Beth, one other thing
'd like from now on for you to address me as Captain or sir in front of the men
--  into the cafeteria
Harry is eating at a table, seems more relaxed
The team members around him, eating too
Beth, cold
Harry sprinkles salt on the dish of food in the middle
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya
We're not a bunch of icy streets here
Salt's good for you, Ted
Helps you from getting impotent
Impotent
'm not impotent
(off food) These aren't half bad, Fletcher
You might have a second career coming
What are they
Squid
Harry stops mid-chew
Frightened
there was a whole flock of them out there earlier
It's strange
It's dead down here, and then all of a sudden -- Harry drops his fork
He begins
loudly
He  out the squid from his mouth
: long, empty corridor
All is quiet

Minutes ago
Harry's trying to decode it in his room now
Where's it coming from
No idea
We have no surface support
It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater
Is it coming from our own computer
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but 've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this
-- of pretty, pink
Everywhere
-- Fletcher swims up to them with a net
It's beautiful
Eerie
Almost idyllic
Harry, on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands, turns to Norman, entering the room
Getting anywhere with those
There's some sort of pattern here
It'll take a minute
Have you looked outside
Jellyfish
Everywhere
hate jellyfish
(sits on the table) Harry, what happened in the cafeteria
Don't do this
Don't psychoanalyze me
hate squid
Period
Just like you hate jellyfish
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die
Did
You don't remember that
don't remember much
It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but  can't taste any of it
Funny, my senses are much keener though
Purer
Hearing, seeing, smelling
Like,  can smell your sheets, Norman
You tried to wash it out earlier, But  can still smell the urine
(beat) Don't worry, 'm not going to tell the others
It's normal, really, isn't it
In a crisis
The stress
The panic
Beth, Ted, and Barnes watch
-- Fletcher outside, with the jellyfish
(into the mic) Fletcher
What are you doing out there
(
) They're like pink snow, sir
Sticky
She says jellyfish are a delicacy
You know,  never knew that
Get out of there
don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood
(
) They're warm
can feel the heat on my legs
Fletcher,  want you back here
: -- Norman sitting on the table
What happened to you inside that sphere, Harry
long beat
Harry becomes concerned
Why
Does someone else want to go inside
: -- Fletcher, the jellyfish clinging to her facemask, her suit
(
) can't see, they're smearing the faceplate
My arms
the fabric
Fletcher's suit tears
Fletcher, get away from there
(
) It's burning
Get out of there
(
) can't see
Fletcher
Now
(
) can't
-- bolting out of the room
Barnes turning to her
Nobody move
But she's -- Nobody move
(
) They're eating through
Somebody -- : --  -- jellyfish eating into her plastic faceplate
she's ,
They watch
-- Her body twisting, contorting
Her suit, ripping apart
She convulses
Her body falling
-- Fletcher's face
Cold, dead
Eyes open
Jellyfish rooted in her skin
: of a jellyfish
-- in the corner of the lab, inspecting a
What is this, Beth
You taking valium
Beth, looking into the microscope
Sedatives
Whatever my mood calls for
Norman picks up a book, next to the kit: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
Where'd this come from
The library
We have a library
bad one
It was the only book in there
Norman, come here, look at this
No, thank you
hate jellyfish
Walking toward her
when  was six, my younger brother and  -- we went swimming in the Pacific
At my mother's beach house
We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe
Killed him
My gosh, Norman
Yeah, it was awful
What about you
What happened to you
Me
Well,  was wrapped in seaweed
It itched for a while, but survived
(beat) Beth, do you find it
curious that we're seeing all this life down here
Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid
Then jellyfish
Normally, 'd say no
Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity
Makes sense
But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish
What do you mean -- not normal
They have six tentacles
new species
And the squid too
They had no stomach
Wait a minute
What
You knew about the squid not being normal
Before Fletcher went out there
Yeah, why
And you didn't tell anyone
Beth, nervous
What
Why
Beth -- mean, 'm not
wasn't absolutely sure if
they -- They are or they aren't
Which is it
What
Wait
Don't
why are you -- Beth
Nobody said
Norman
What
Why are you looking at me like that
Beth -- She backs away from Norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it on the floor
She starts breaking down
Norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass, hurriedly
didn't do anything wrong
didn't mean
Beth
She's crying, glass in her hands
She looks up at Norman, frightened, nervous
You wouldn't go and tell the others, would you
Norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him away
hate this place, Norman
want out
: -- -- at the room where Barnes was on the phone earlier
He stands there now, hand on the knob
it shut
: Barnes sits, Norman in front of him, worked up
'm not paranoid
know Beth
She can be drastic
How drastic
You don't want to know
think  do
while back, Beth and  -- we worked at the same university
She was assisting a chemist there -- forget his name -- doing research, experiments
She was also living with him
(off Barnes' look) Yeah,  know
And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement
She should've known better
She put a razor to her wrists a day later
(a beat) When was this
'81,  think
She tried again five years ago
(beat) thought you should know
So you knew this when you wrote your report
At the time,  don't know,  thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation -- Wait a second -- -- and then brought her down here -- --  didn't know it would come to this -- -- without a cautionary word to anyone
(beat) You know, Ted said something to me earlier
think he's right
He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy

It's definitely nonrandom
See
Harry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a of the screan -- indicating a pattern
It's a single sequence repeated over and over
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it
Maybe it's a message
From what
The sphere
Maybe the sphere -- We're not hooked up to the sphere
Well, if it's a discharge -- It's not a discharge
Right, Edmunds
You said before, right
So it's gotta be a message
From the sphere
What's inside the sphere
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code
'll work on it
Yeah, 'll work on it, too
(to Ted, flat) You do that
/ Ted, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has Norman's ear in front of the sink
He's manic, Norman
You know that
This reliance on Harry is misplaced
You hear me
Totally misplaced
He's overlooking things
Obvious things
Like what
Ted hands him a printout
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation
You mean a picture
Take a look
rearranged the numbers
Put 'em up to the light
(Norman does) Go ahead
Squint at it
don't see anything
Squint harder
Please, Ted
(hands him another printout) Try this one
This is like nursery school
Don't you see it
It's a picture of the creature
The creature
Inside the sphere
Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms
There's no head, so 'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know
-- Ted's lost it
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with
Sure, why not
Give him the trophy
That pretentious son of a bitch
You heard him, Norman
All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit
And "impotent"
Where does he get off saying 'm impotent
He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick
: -- spirals now
asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code
If you're trying to communicate, why use a code
(to Norman) See
No code
What'd  say
Codes are for hiding information
So it's making a mistake
It's making a code without intending to
figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters
Then  began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard
And since we're getting spirals,  imagined the keyboard as a spiral
So translated it
That's brilliant
Ted grimaces at Norman
spiralling out of the center, you see: "" is one, "" is two, "" is three, and so on
when  got the message
What's the message
have to tell you
It's strange
How do you mean, strange
Harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads: "Hello
How are you
am fine
What is your name
My name is Jerry
" : Barnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him
He translated it wrong
"My name is Jerry"
It's like "See Spot run
" The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence
It's smart
It's approaching us in a simple way
Like you would a dog
Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you
What am  -- a dog, now
Barnes ducks his head into the Video Feed room
Edmunds, get in here
need you for this
In a minute, sir
- Barnes storming through the room, the others (minus Edmunds) around the monitor
want a name
real name
This thing's full name, rank and serial number
Captain,  personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions -- am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry
(on the keyboard, typing) First, we have to see if he'll talk at all
-- "0032125252632" The monitor , reply: "0032125252632" Okay, Jerry's talking
Harry types -- "0002921 301321 0613182108142232" What'd you say
"We are friends"
Cut the friends crap, get a name
"004212232" "Yes"
Good
Now let's see if it'll switch over to English letters
"0032125252632 = Hello" Reply: "0032125252632 = Hello" It's not talking, it's mimicking
Give him a chance
He's speaking our language, not the other way around
(typing) Good idea, Ted
(confused) Thank you
"0032125252632 = Hello
Hello = 0032125252632" No reply

"We are" what
Harry types: "We are the entities from the

You make a journey
We make a journey together am Happy
" Great, okay
Ask him about his weapons
That's smart
Let's talk about guns and violence
You don't think weapons are important
think we should be careful
Consider his emotional response
You want to put him on your couch, Norman
Grill him about his childhood
When he uses a phrase like " am Happy",  think we should think twice about what we ask him
"Do Not Be Afraid" The all stare at the screen, stunned
Jerry, can you understand what we're saying
"Every word" Norman walks up to the screen, close to it
Jerry, can you read our minds
"Yes Norman" Barnes goes to the intercom
Edmunds,  want you in here
Now
Norman focuses on the screen, staring
-- blank
Norman concentrating, on the screen
-- blank
Jerry, are you there
"Yes, Norman" We shouldn't talk here
Shut it off
" do not wish to Intrude" We would like to talk alone
" do not agree
That is not possible
enjoy to talk with you
" And we enjoy talking with you
"Let us talk now" We'd like to talk with you more
We admire your talents and your great power and understanding
"Thank you" And in your great understanding, you know that we are entities who must talk in private -- with each other
"Do Not Be Afraid" We're not afraid, we are uncomfortable
"Am  offended you
" Not at all, we enjoy you very much, but we need to talk alone, without you listening
" shall oblige" Thank you
"But  am Not Happy" Jerry
"We'll be Right Back after a short break for these Messages from our Sponsor" Jerry
Are you still there
-- blank
Jerry
-- blank
(into intercom) Edmunds
Get in here
want to know exactly how this is being transmitted
She's not gonna know
She wired this system
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic
- Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman
Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition
It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up
With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit
- It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer
He'd run screaming "witchcraft"
And you couldn't explain it to him, either
Modems, microchips, particle physics
(into intercom) Edmunds
- Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here
Frankly, Ted, 'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect
Why's that
(into intercom) Edmunds
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional
Damn it, Edmunds
it raises a very serious question: What happens if Jerry gets mad (
) Edmunds
Can you copy
An empty chair
Edmunds is not here
a repeating
(
) Edmunds
--   her body, wedged in a light stand bracket, floating in the water, lifeless
Her helmet  against the wall of the habitat
-- Norman and Beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the habitat
Still  the
They pause, looking around
Coast is clear
They go to the south end of the habitat
The  louder
Norman climbs up the grid-like , the support beam holding up the habitat
The  above him -- flapping in the current against the wall
He climbs, reaching the body
swings, catches the  in his air hose
shoot out
Norman, your suit -- it's leaking
The  comes off in Norman's hand -- and the  , gray flesh, purple toenails,  his faceplate
Startles him
Norman
Look at this
'  -- a long  in the fabric, revealing red, mangled Droplets of  float past Norman's faceplate
Her flesh has been macerated
Chewed
've never seen a bite like this before
Norman pulls her body out
Edmunds'  whips around -- and Norman  her staring eyes, mouth open in horror
can't feel her bones
She's like a sponge
She was crushed
Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper
What could have done this
:
Barnes at the monitors, Ted with him
What is that
The sensors are picking up something outside
What
Barnes flips a switch
It won't register
It's too big to image
Too big
, the size of golf balls descend from above
Hundreds of them
Beth catches one, inspects it
Norman
What are they
Eggs
From inside their helmets
(
) You people need to hurry back
The sensors have activated
don't think you're alone out there
Ted walks with Norman and Beth
What was it
Barnes didn't know
Couldn't get a reading
Has Harry spoken with Jerry
Not that  know of
Why
Norman and Ted at the console
Jerry
No reply
Jerry, are you there
No reply
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds
With what's out there
'm not sure
Beth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell
Looking at the coating here, it's definitely marine invertebrate
Barnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood
What was Edmunds doing outside
Resetting the sub
What sub
In the dome hanger
All our tapes are transferred to the sub
It's on a 12 hour timer
If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes
What for
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened
At least our obituaries will be accurate
That's reassuring
-- splitting open
slimy pinkish-brown  oozes out underneath
They cover their mouths from the smell
What is it
Beth picks at it with forceps
'm not sure
've never seen anything like it
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you
Can't you tell us something
Beth glares at Barnes
-- Beth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside, pressing on him
He lied to us
He left us down here
'mon, Beth
Don't make this personal
He told me himself they were taking us back
Yeah, he told you
Think
What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose
He was on the phone
Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman
They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out
So what
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute
Nobody
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth
Don't get worked up -- Fuck you, Norman
It's right here
She shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the words, reads
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft
Signed, Barnes,
" Where did you get this
In Edmunds' things
You went through Edmunds' things
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon
Calm down, Beth
Alright
Don't tell me to calm down
It's done, alright
It's over
And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay
He turns to leave
You said something to him, didn't you
What
You told him about me
-- pausing, staring at her
Beth -- You did, didn't you
Don't do this
You bastard
Beth,  didn't
Hold it together
Alright
She looks at him, piercing into his eyes
Yeah, okay
Sure, Norman
Beth -- No,  should stay calm
Like you say
Right, Norman
Stay calm
Norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him
Fletcher and Edmunds are dead, Norman
And the only one we can trust to run this place is a fucking liar
: -- bobbing up and down -- keeping track of the little that's left
: Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted are gathered around the monitors
Barnes addresses Norman
don't want you talking to Jerry
But sir,  think it's imperative think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier --  think they're all related
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman
He said earlier -- we were his friends -- Of course he did
He's been isloated for 400 years
He wants someone to talk to
Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic
We're talking about 400 years here
An alien that shows emotional responses
think we need to address him, before he reacts further
You think he killed Edmunds
Yes,  do
Whatever's out there, think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier
Bullshit
What's out there isn't alien
It's an animal
Maybe so
But  think we need to ask Jerry about it
No
think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat
He might be listening now
think he already is
They turn to the monitors: : "   " Nice work, Captain sir
Shut up, Beth
don't want to hear it
Jerry, we don't want to ignore you
"Don't underestimate my power" We don't
"Yes you do" Jerry -- blinks back --   the sphere

We're a habitat
Not a castle
The only defense we have is High Voltage
High Voltage
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface
But we've never used it underwater before
Forty yards
But you've tested it
Sure
Each time it started fires inside the habitat
Thirty yards
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there

The monitor blinks to

The relief, the jubilation
That whole time --  couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier
What was that, sir
About the time paradox

Don't bother me, Norman
It's not worth the risk
It's also our only way out of here
It holds three people
And there's only three of us left now
You, me and Harry
You, me and Harry

Wake him, then

You only have 15 minutes to reset it

Thank you
My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- What happened to her
What do you mean
She's not here
When  woke up, nobody was here
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me
Her suit's gone
Beth left
thought she was with you
Norman and Harry at the mic
(
) what do you mean
'm in the ship
What are you doing in the ship
(beat) Beth
(
) Getting food
We were out of food
what's wrong
You sound mad
Yeah, well,  get that way when 'm facing death and someone deserts me
(
) Deserts you
Harry said he'd take over for me
He what
Harry shakes his head: "no way"
(
) When he woke up, he said we were out of food
He told me to get some from the ship
never said that
(
) Yes you did
Norman,  wouldn't leave you out there
You know that
We never even had a conversation, Norman
(
) Harry
That's bullshit
We stood right there -- Harry covers the mic
She's cracking, Norman
You didn't say that about the food
was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there
Take a look for yourself
But why would she --
She's lying, Norman
Just like she lied about fixing your suit
Harry uncovers the mic
(
) You get it straightened out
think so, Beth
Yes
Norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken
salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table
Beth walks in, carrying a bag of food
What's Harry doing with your suit in there
Fixing it
Fixing it
But  fixed -- (notices the food) Where'd you get all that
The refridgerator
The refridgerator
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any
That wasn't in there before
We must've had it delivered then
Wait a second -- 1-800-Deepsea delivery
hear they're good
None of this was here before
Did you look
It was on the top shelf
No, it wasn't
swear none of this was here
None of it
(beat) You think he hid it
Earlier
He must've hid it
You think
You don't believe me
All  know is  opened that refridgerator -- Damn it, Norman
swear
had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit
You think it's me
You think 'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't
don't know, Beth
wasn't there
Damn it, Norman
He's lying
Don't you get it
There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it
Why can't you believe me
-- she looks --  is standing in a doorway, cold, holding Norman's jumpsuit
He turns away
-- looking back at Norman, tears rolling down her eyes
: Harry neatly hangs Norman's jumpsuit under the hook labled: ""
Smoothens it out for him

Wraps cellophane over the chicken

Norman now looks at the
Goes to them
Books, neatly stacked
Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with All of the books are the same
Entitled: "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea by Jules Verne

What is it, Norman
Norman
She comes to him
He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing
Norman
Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair, trying to think
Stops
Turns to Beth
Page 87
What
Page 87
" could never read that far
" Norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page 87
Reads
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long
Some skeletons of squids
Squids
"
according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long
That would make a formidable monster
" He looks up from the book, realizing something
Norman
the book closed
: '  -- Norman rifles through notebooks
Turning pages
off the first Jerry transmission
Beth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall
Norman, what is it
Norman grabs Harry's
: -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor
Norman ushers her into the Control Room
Looks around
the door
: Norman  on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of paper
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up --  don't know --  thought he was an illusion
But  checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him
Manifested
Created
Brought to life
don't know
But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry"
And -- Norman stops, staring at the pad
He translated it wrong
What
Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads
Hello
How are you
am fine
What is your name
My name is Harry : Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters
(
) Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name
But Harry never would
He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry
We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry
or a part of Harry
(
) What do you mean, a part of Harry
-- When did the messages start
The animals outside start showing up
After Harry came out of the sphere
You think, in the sphere -- He acquired some sort of power power to manifest things
But how
don't know
How can the sphere do that
don't know, Beth
'm not the fucking alien that built the thing
But it can
When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87
How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to
Then you found the book, remember in your lab
Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid
Which  told Barnes was attacking -- It's his fear
The squid
He's manifesting his fears
Making them real
But why is he doing it
He must not realize he is
Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then
He must've manifested his dream
His dream
You can't control your dreams
And you can't control your fears, can you
(shaking his head) No
mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences
You ever read the Bible
(off her look) It talks about our sinful nature, you know
mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled
It's evil
It's inside us
It's what we are
: -- It's dark
Harry lies on his bunk, asleep
(
) And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested
(
) Must be
And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control
Harry opens his eyes, stares at us
-- a transmission comes across
"
" Beth and Norman watch
Looks like some sort of code
Why would Harry go back to using a code
(
) You mean Jerry, don't you
Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room
Jerry
Right
said Jerry, didn't That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth
'm sorry
Slip of the tongue
Yeah,  don't know how you could make that confusion
Norman watching them
Wisconsin's your answer
Wisconsin
(off screen) Navy transmission
They're sent from Wisconsin
How do we decode it
Don't have to
Watch
It'll do it for you
-- jumbling it's letters until finally
"      : 1600
" Norman and Beth smile
The cavalry is on it's way
-- "16:00:00"
it begins decending in count
Just in time, too
In time for what
What
Just in time for what
Beth, nervous, tries to cover
Our habitat,  mean
This place can't handle another attack
Another attack
long beat, as Beth stares at Harry
Why are you looking at me like that
Like what
'm not -- You're staring at me
No 'm not
'm not star-- Yes you are
Harry looks at both of them, suspiciously
Did  miss something
You two seemed to patch things up awfully fast
tense beat
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to
work together through this
The three of us
That's right
(beat) Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag
Norman glances at   behind Harry: "

Norman quickly digs through the medicines

Here we go

Three to six hours
'll just boost the doses
What
Wait -- isn't that dangerous
How fast does it take effect
Doesn't say
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman
What if it takes an hour
And he can fight it off
We can't afford that
Beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine
Norman comes over as she adds it to the mix
What is that
What are you doing
What do you want to do -- kill him
beat
It's an idea
Beth -- To be on the safe side
mean -- You want to kill him
Look, it's either him or us, Norman
Another attack, and we go down with this place
She fills the   with the clear liquid mix
You ever given an injection before
Thirty years ago

You
Only lab rats

She hands him the syringe
Give him the whole thing
Hurry, before he wakes up
Norman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle
Where do  stick it
: Harry sleeps on his bunk
The door to the room is closed
Norman spirals down the stairway from the lab
Hurrying through the dark cafeteria, the syringe at his side
shuffling down the corridor, nervously
Glancing at the syringe
and  in front of the Living Quarters

Norman stops, hides behind the wall
: Norman comes in
He's got Farrakahn's army standing guard
What's plan
Suddenly,
The room shakes
Shelves fall
Cabinet doors swing open
Norman falls to the floor
-- crashes down in front of his face
It reads: " " Norman and Beth running

Water shoots through the wall
Gushing out onto the floor
The walls

You know what it is, Harry
They lose their balance, still running
It's the squid
Stop it
Stop what
What are you --

You know damn well what
You're doing it
Norman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall
Doing what

Quiet now
Norman and Beth sit at a table, sipping coffee
'm sorry
For what
Not believing you
You're not sorry
You're scared

You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth
And now you're scared because you're not sure you can tell anymore

The grooves around the door -- they've shifted

Norman looks at the    -- the sub is gone from under the dome

Shit
No reply

Beth

There's something -- He scans the , looking for movement
Anything

And whatever it is, it's not coming from Harry
Norman looks at the monitors: -- a bright  blinds the

The Sub's   drops one of the , plumping it softly on the muddy floor

Beth
Can you copy
Get inside, there's something out there

Churning up the sediment
It stops again, and releases another box
Norman  on the headset
Damn it, Beth,  know you hear me

What the hell

It releases it's last box
Norman can read the lettering now: ": " Beth

Norman turns the faucet off
The water stops
But the   remains
Norman looks at the faucet, queerly
Turns it back on
Then off
The   still there
It isn't the water
Norman looks down at his feet

Something swimming in the water

His pants  as the  slowly slides up past his knee
As more  comes through the crack in the wall

Another  begins  itself around the outside of Norman, sliding up around his neck

Their forked tongues  and

Trying to get inside his mouth
What was that

Your watch
Oh yes, my watch

She looks at her watch
Splendid
She begins grabbing the  off of him, carefully dropping them to the ground
writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists
Shakes them off
Some drop in the sink
She bends out of view -- and the  inside Norman's shirt,  back down the way it came

Norman looks at the cup
Go ahead, drink it
Norman places the cup down
What's wrong, Norman
'm feeling better
Are you
Beth takes a seat
Stares at him
long beat
It's getting cold
You think 'd really drink that
You don't think  put something in it, do you
You put explosives around the habitat,  can't imagine what you'd put in a drink

beat
She picks up the drink, and begins sipping it
Norman watches her
How do you feel about snakes
Snakes
What do you mean, exactly
You know what  mean
Am  afraid of them
Not during the day
Sea snakes are diurnal
When the sun's out, they don't bite
Fortunately for you,  had on my watch
(off cup) This is quite good
What are they doing down here
In the bathroom
Suddenly appearing
You tell me
Do you fear them
Don't you
Are you manifesting them
If  was, then  would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't Did you
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth
Same reason  put explosives around the habitat
For defense
For the power
To protect myself
Against what
Harry's unconscious
He's not a threat
No, he isn't
He can't manifest
No, he can't
Then why, Beth
Why go in
Why put out explosives
Why manifest the snakes
You think  manifested the snakes
Someone did
Yes, someone did
But it wasn't me, Norman
(beat) It was you
You manifested the snakes
long beat between them
Beth you're losing it
'mon
'mon -- what
You're lying -- Am  lying
Are you sure
Are you absolutely sure 'm lying
(off his look) Then explain to me about the jellyfish
Earlier
Why did we see jellyfish
Harry doesn't fear jellyfish
You do
They're your fear, aren't they
But -- And the snakes
You want to know about the snakes
You saw one outside earlier, didn't you
When you thought  had deserted you -- you were terrified
(realizing) That's when you went in the sphere
One lonely, terrifying sea snake
You manifested that, Beth
Did
Or was that you
(beat) When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you
Terrified
Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor
You did that, Norman
You're insane
Am
Or am  making so much sense that you're going insane
never went in that sphere
You don't remember you did
But 'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you
You remember that
Yes
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened
(off his look) That's right
But you can't remember going inside, can you
No, of course not
Harry couldn't either, could he
"Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said
That's bullshit
Is it
Beth, the message said Harry
"My name is Harry"
My name isn't Harry
No, it isn't
Your name is Norman
But your younger brother -- what was his name
The one who was stung when you were younger
The one that died
The one you couldn't save
What was his name
(imitating) "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming
" "But  don't want to go swimming, Norman
'm scared
" "'mon, Harry , it'll be fine, it'll be fun
" (resuming) You heartless fuck
That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it
Shut up, Beth -- When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking
Do you know
" can't get Beth on the radio
'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean
All alone
Surrounded by all this water
" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears
You never really saw what it was, did you
Norman stares up at her, frightened
Is she right
'm not scaring you, am  Norman hope 'm not frightening you
The last thing  want to do is frighten you
You feel okay, don't you
It's not me, Beth
swear
It can't be
"It's not me, Beth
It's not me
It can't be
'm not doing anything
" Just like Harry said before stabbed him with the needle
Norman looks at her palm --  the  in her hand
Norman backs up, away
Don't, Beth
But  have to, Norman
promise -- Promise what, Norman
Tell me
Beth -- You think 'd belive you
Believe anything you might say now
After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past
About my problems
My problems
Not yours
Not his
Mine
Don't, Beth
Please
It's either this
or  kill you
The  in her other hand
Beth -- She comes at him, needle in hand
It's your choice
Because it's not safe for you to be awake
To be walking around
To be thinking about things
It's not safe for you to be either
You think  care
You think  care if  die
(almost laughing) Would  put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if  cared about myself
Would
've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't  try a third time
'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, 'm thinking about you
Your safety
Protecting you from your own self
She lunges at him with the needle, missing
He  for the leading to the lab
Norman grabs the handrail, begins climbing the stairs
Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles
Norman
'm doing this for you, Norman
He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels
Norman
Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the  never seem to end
He looks up: -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in number
He climbs, racing,
Beth, right behind him, laughing almost
Come here, Norman
She  his
She raises the
Norman turns,  her in the
She , blood  from her nose
Climbing, climbing
The  increasing above

Pulls himself up
Scrambling
He stares down at Beth -- the  pointing at him
Norman -- He  the  , on top of her,  her head down
He holds the  closed
Trying to regain his breath
(
) This is what 'm talking about, Norman
Don't you see
It's in you
This vindictiveness
This rage
Get away from the door, Beth
He slides a heavy   over on top of the door
(
) Oh, Norman,  don't want to come in
The door's   turns
: -- on the stairs, spinning the door's
want to lock you in
: Norman staring at the wheel
It's locked from the outside
Norman falls to his knees

(
) You're a psychologist, Norman
You of all people, don't want to admit to your shadow side
: --   Norman -- sitting in a corner of the lab, staring up at

) You have a professional stake in believing in your own mental health, don't you
Don't you, Norman
: Norman, huddled on the floor
(
) Of course you're going to deny it
You want to blame someone else
You want to blame Beth
Because you hate Beth
Don't fuck with me, Beth
(
) 'm not fucking with you, Norman
You've fucked yourself
Norman  up, looks at the ground --  on the floor
Rising in level
Turn off the water, Beth
The entire floor is covered in water, rising higher, and rising fast
Beth
(
) You're frightened, aren't you, Norman
Norman,  through the water, searching
Where is it coming from, Beth
(
) Don't you know
Rising higher
Beth, stop it
Stop what
Don't blame me
It's not me
Norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak
Then where's it coming from
(
) From you, Norman
From your mind
You're doing it
It's up to his waist
He climbs on top a lab bench
Puts his hands to his temples, straining
Beth laughing
--  right next to him
(
) There's no ventalation in the room, Norman
The pressure's going to kill you
Another  , shooting fragments of glass across the room
Stop it
(
) It's you, Norman
Your fear of drowning
You have to face it
Microscope lenses
Bottles, Test Tubes, Dishes
(
) 'mon, Norman
Let me put you under
Before you kill yourself
Bottles floating in the water
The water too high -- Norman swimming in it now, keeping afloat
His  strains from the pressure
He looks at the  in the corner

) It's over, Norman
Next to the , he  the   in the ceiling

) Don't even think it
You don't have your suit, Norman

He swims to a cabinet near the floor,  it, searches, floating out --    and  -- he  it

) It won't help, Norman

along the pipe, hand over hand
He loses grip
His body thrusts upwards

Barely gripping

Pulling himself

He stops
Can't continue
He clasps his hand to his , it's burning
He  the airlock
His eyes fluttering, he's losing consciousness
He can't do it
And he lets go of the pipe
-- is he gone

His body flat underneath it
Being sucked upwards against it
He pushes forward
trying to grab the floor with his hands
He's inches from the airlock
Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward
His body and away

He flails his arms over to the ladder
Grips the ladder, but his hands are like ice
Can't hold it

Flailing in the water

You hear that
Hear what
Get away from me
Beth -- Get away -- From behind her -- Harry --  Beth across the head with a , sending her to the ground
Norman goes to her, checking her pulse
Did  kill her
don't think so
could hit her a little harder
More toward the cranium
Norman stares at the  on the  above him
If she's still conscious, you can't fight her
You can't stop the numbers
Over the intercom

) Eight minutes and counting
Killing her's the only way -- Hey
Look
We didn't kill you, alright
And believe me Harry, would've found great pleasure in bashing your head in
Norman  off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around her head
Fine
Help me lift her
Norman, carrying Beth in his arms, races awkwardly down the hall
We're never gonna make it
Shut up and open the door
Harry does
Harry, in his suit now, helps Norman slip on Beth's boots and jumpsuit
How much time you figure to get to the surface
Two and a half minutes
Once we're in the sub

Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock
Alright

Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist
can't reach her
Hold on
Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist
Push her, c'mon

Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after
The pocket of air around the sub
The three of them crammed inside
Norman opens the door on top of the sub
Alright, here, 'll

Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub
The sub sways back and forth
Norman, what are you -- They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her
Shit
Alright, Harry, get in there
Harry jumps on top of the sub
Slides inside it
Reaches his arms out, catching Beth's legs

Get her out of the seat,  need room to sit
Harry

Norman drops inside
Norman in the seat
Beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder
Harry looks at Norman who assesses the flight controls
You know how to work this thing
No idea
Well, press something

How long did you say -- Shut up
Let me think
Norman presses a button

Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it

It's not fast enough, Norman
There's a helluva lot of explosive down there
The sub ascends past the spacecraft tail fin
Harry looking down below him
(
) Thirty seconds to detonation
The shock wave's gonna crush us, Norman
Maybe
Brace yourself
Harry just stares at Norman
Norman grabs Beth, trying to stablilize her
(off Norman's suit) How's that working out, by the way
Good
Thank you
Now that  have it on

You don't even know what that means
No
don't
But  always said to myself, when  die,  want to die laughing

You know,  think you really need to see a psychologist
She stares back at him, and smiles
Begins laughing with him

#1 Has anyone spoken to them yet
#2 (shakes his head) The Admiral's going over the tapes they brought up now
#1 Does he know yet what really happened down there
Looking  -- Norman, Harry, and Beth sit at a table
At the table
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them
We can refuse to talk
Won't make any difference
The tapes document everything

There is one possibility
We all kill ourselves
(laughing, then) Bad joke
Sorry, Beth
She smiles
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right
What if we feared the power to go away
You mean forget
It would erase all our knowledge of it
All of our power
Would it work
Yes
And  think we already know it will
How's that
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die
Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone
Death was the only logical explanation
But sitting here, we still know
So how is that possible
(beat) Unless we make ourselves forget
