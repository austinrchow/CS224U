Fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn't matter

He never, ah,  mean never
He kept his own counsel
He never wanted money
You can't do a thing with a man like that
Your uncle Jackie needed a lot of money
But even though he got his money from me, he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you
And  think about this
So what are talking about here
Fact is you're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and  don't see you up the dog track as a general manager

The only thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen

He has a knife open in his hand
He waits, listening to (faltering) footsteps: a , face invisible in shadow, turns the corner
pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a knife
As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy
It's a
backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street
, sweating, staggering, hurries along
No sign of Billy, no sign of a follower
But he does notice:  cameras at the intersection
He spins and gets out of there, heading off through
Colin, holding his envelope, walks, sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon (the ideograms say--flash--"Departed")
has lost Colin
He hears a hubbub from the corner where a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement
backs away, gets out of there

We see , unrecognizable on cheap video
Then we see a blurred image of
Crossing the street in beats
No more use as  than the Shroud of Turin

() Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her packing
on the door, which leads only into Madolyn's basement apartment

The chain on
Your name's on the pill label thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients
How obsessive are you
Medium
Are you okay
Why are you here

've been
regretting that we didn't continue
our conversations
'm glad you want to see me
it's nice to see you
enjoyed talking
enjoyed having coffee with you, very much
but  don't see people
don't see people in my home
Billy gets soaked
' looks around and sees: boxes, transition
The furniture already gone
An air-mattress on the floor
There are still tea things on the counter
basic life is still possible here
Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here, reading in bed
Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking vulnerable and honest
Thanks
If this is inappropriate
can leave
takes a moment to react
() 103
: No, it's, it's, it's not inappropriate
you're not a patient
You moving in or out

(') That's me
Yeah,  know
He hangs the picture on a nail
(the kettle whistles ) Would you like a cup of tea
nods
Yeah
Yeah  would
Thank you
Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment
In the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea
She perseveres, comes out holding two cups
Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment
Do you want some
Sugar
No
She hands him the cup of tea
Strung out, he spills his tea, slightly, unobserved by Madolyn
Madolyn looks over at the bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin
've always needed my own place
() 104
: (2) Hedging your bets
No
'm not "hedging my best" told you when we had coffee
There's a choice
You choose
you have to make a
Decision

and stick by what
you choose
you have to
Move in with your boyfriend
Yes
Stick by what you
otherwise it's
have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now
Is it real
Yeah,  think so
Tick

No

That's good
Colin is still studying the blurry image of Billy
' In the tiny kitchen  is kissing  and unbuttoning her shirt
Her hands start to move to push him away
He continues
105
Still studying the blurry image of Billy,  tenses as someone comes into the office and switches off the tape
He glances at his coat
The envelope is visible folded into the breast pocket
He takes his coat and goes
Wet empty streets
The "gaslights" are on
About midnight
Costello business
The restaurant is closed for the night
One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the takings
In a darker alcove of the bar  sits alone at a broad table, drinking brandy
On sound, classical music
As a knocking is heard Costello looks up
lets Billy in
watches Billy approach
We hear him sit down
You got a girlfriend
No
No
What does that matter
Depends
'm sure you know by now there's an informer in my crew
Cop
Staties or Boston Police department, 'm not sure
He pours Billy some brandy
Then starts to draw a sketch
What about the
It ain't
Trust me
The ex-wife, an old friend or stupid
that's what brings you down in this business
Stupid
Well, that leaves me out
Past days, case like this killed everybody who works for me
Better safe than sorry,  suppose
() 106
: On the other hand, back then, it was only five
or six
and French
But , maybe, is sorry
look around at your guys
They're all murderers right think "could  do murder
" And all can answer myself is, "what's the difference"
Give em up to the Almighty
Like that
Yeah, that's my point
You accuse me once,  put up with it
You accuse me twice,  quit
If you make me fear for my life,  put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else
looks up
This is new: but he's impassive
And impressed
(to Billy) You got something you want to say to me, William
You're seventy fucking years old
One of these guys is going to pop you
As for running drugs, what the fuck
You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you
And you don't need the money
smiles, and continues with the sketch
Later he will light up the paper
haven't needed "the money" since took Archie's milk money in the third grade
Tell the truth, don't need pussy any more,but still like it
() () 107
: (2) (') Point 'm making
you see
got this rat
gnawing, cheese eating fucking rat
questions come up
questions
see, Bill, you're the new guy
and the girlfriend
Why don't you stay in the bar when get the numbers
Your numbers
Everybody's numbers
Is there something you want to ask me, Frank
Start with, you agree there is a rat
You said there is one
base most of what  do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do
Sure, sure, all that aside
but you Bill, what would you do
sketching
How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled
Who needs more money than you pay them
You don't pay much, you know
It's almost a feudal fuckin' enterprise
( nods, accepting this) The question is, who thinks that they would do what you do better than you
Only one that can do what  do is me
You want to be me
stares over a precipice: he knows this as well
probably could be you

But  don't want to be you

You're sure
No other departments, no codes, like that

No way, he says
Thank God for Billy
Everybody is busy in the office
It's 's first day of Internal Investigations

Morning
He comes up to Queenan's door just as Dignam comes out
faces  down

Yeah,  run rat fucks like you don't like them
The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know
And wouldn't even have a job if you did yours
Fuck yourself
need to know the identity of your undercovers
Blow me
Not literally, there's no promotion in it for ya
He walks away
goes into Queenan's office
110
' puts the cig into a cup of water, and throws it into the trash
Morning, Captain
Look who's here
The Queen of the prom
They are not happy with me
Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam
What do you expect
Everybody knows you're assigned here to find Costello's rat
They want to find the leak as much as you do
What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat
sits uneasily
Fair enough
Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right
Two days ago, my undercover guy in Costello's organization---- Who is that
Lots of luck
(Not a chance
) You can go over my head, high as you like
You still won't get an answer
Fair enough
As  said, two days ago, my guy nearly found out who Costello's rat is
He lost him in the street
() 111
: Really
Did he get a look at him
No
Nothing that could help us
Nah
(swallows) (Too bad
) Any advice
Generally
Costello can't do (much) business without coordinating with his source
(gestures out window) Who is here
In
Follow Costello and you'll find his rat
realizes: Just follow Queenan and you'll find his rat
(') (turns away) You're going to be looking at my people
Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records
Don't expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses
Let me get you a coffee
'  #2 is sitting in his office alone, remembering what Queenan has just told him: (
) Follow Costello and you'll find his informer
In the fishbowl of his glass office,  is being stared at by pissed-off cops
calms down
He opens the gray envelope
He takes out the forms that he was given by Costello, opens up    and starts searching
He types in  numbers
One, then another, then another
The result is always: "Person not found"
He types in Costigan, William , hits return
It comes up: "Person not found"
keeps working

'  #2 of all of Costello's guys
He looks at them desperately
no one squares up with the blurred, impossible, images he saw on the  screen (which he has printed out)
closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger), locks his door
He picks up the phone

Nothing
There's nothing going on
Just thinking
Okay, all right
(thinking about it; blows a breath) And what about money

Another city

Another city doesn't seem unattractive to Madolyn, who's in her own cut-and-run crisis -- but maybe she can't believe that Colin is thinking about it
She blows a breath
Another city
It'd be a clean slate

He looks at her intensely
want you to know you don't gotta stay
If we're not going to make it, it's got to be you that gets out
'm not capable (a beat) 'm fuckin' Irish, so 'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life
Long pause
Not a bad idea, another city
and  are smoking on the sidewalk outside the restaurant
Of course  know how to spot a cop
Oh yeah, how's that
If he's not paying attention to us, he's a cop
: across the street is looking into the window of an antique shop
(') See that guy over there, he's a cop
He's not paying attention to us
He's a cop
Lot of fucking cops

No response

You're a cop

Around the corner, he opens his phone

Yes, go ahead

To find out about the good Catholic life

What informant
Queenan's guy
He called me when he found out Queenan was dead
'm running him
Everyone is impressed
No
You give him to me
No
But  can give you Costello's destination
You know where he's going
Yes
And what he's about to do
Call off the tail, and get Special Ops
Get them on standby
We meet him where he's going
Suit up
We're gonna take this prick tonight
(to crew on the road) All units fall back
Everyone moves at once
is checking the rearview mirror
He sees: The exit the highway onto Atlantic Avenue smiles
The cars exit the highway
The cars pass through a maze of industrial streets
() 135
: , riding in the back seat, is trying desperately to see where they are
He sees a   and taps out a text message on his phone
() , in vest, observed by Brown, reads the message
It's the heavy equipment warehouse Costello owns on Sheffield
He must have a container or a truck in there
(his big moment of decision) Go
It is an unfinished structure, the lower parts used, the upper parts accessible but still under construction
It is built on a pier, the harbor lights beyond it
The and   pull up with lights off disgorges   who spread out through the dark
(into mic) There's an exit on the other side
Cover it
We'll take him when he comes out
checks the load on his pistol
unlocks a  with a construction company logo on it, opens the doors, and steps back
looks into the container
It's cocaine or heroin in kilo bricks
Men stand around with MP5s under their coats
Load it
, trying to save Costello
How do you know you don't have a tail
looks at him
() 136
: Were you in the fuckin' car
What if they took one off and put another one on, Frank
Load
The drugs having been loaded fast by the crew, including 's, the container is hosed out
turns from ' as everyone gets it
Frank told me to check out the back
You guys go ahead
Watch your ass
Instead of getting into '  on the other side of the container, he steps back into shadows as both cars leave
' with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as they come out of the garage
realizes that something has gone wrong
Cocksucker
come on, and Policemen are everywhere, guns in their hands
is not visible among them
open fire at Costello's car
reverses back into the garage
(the driver) is shot in the arm, and the car crashes into a wall
gunfight opens up
's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and are shot down expertly
, limping, gets out of the action, fast
He runs into the parking garage
French drives away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide)
, shot through the stomach, is moving through the dark
All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for the big dig
Plenty of places to hide
We hear gunfire in the distance
hides between two pieces of heavy equipment and dials his telephone
To his surprise the phone rings quite nearby
And keeps ringing
() 137
: moves out into the open, and sees, at a near distance, , his shadow long on the concrete
He has a gun in his hand
Costello moves out to face him
You're an  informant
comes out of the shadows
Jesus Colin, grow up
Course 'm talking to the
Do they know who  am
says nothing for a moment
never gave up anybody who wasn't goin' down anyway
instantly raises the pistol to shoot him
Did you give me up
'  wavers
Nobody knows nothin'
shakes his head and cocks the gun
Frank, Frank, do they know about me
know you, Colin
You know 'd never give you up
You're like
son
to you
Is that what it is about, all that murderin' and fuckin' and no sons
What are you, shooting blanks
tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve
He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways as  shoots him
() 138
: (2) topples backward into the bucket of the bucket loader
Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one last shot from ' gun
Ricochet
fires into the dead body again and again
He backs away
(') got Costello
got Costello here
/  - Colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello
[Dialog separate document]
enters, tired from a debriefing
Applause from everyone in the office--the full crew
is embarrassed by the attention
is leading the whole team to a standing ovation
looks past the heads of the crowd and sees: Dignam, staring at him evenly
(to crowd) It's not any reason for, ah
'  brings him some wine
(') Thank you
' No, thank you
He takes a glass of wine
Then guiltily, almost in tears, he drinks
jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2
He's waited a long time for you
( looks up and sees ) How'd you get him without the files
Caller
On Queenan's phone
You know that guy
() 139
: Yeah, we were classmates together
'm gonna go talk to him
goes off
'  #2 In Colin's office  sits with his ankle on his knee
He looks very tired, dirty
Wearing a  badge
Good to see you Trooper
Yeah
"Trooper"
Colin Sullivan
We spoke on the phone
How long have you been undercover
Long time
Long fuckin' time
can't begin to tell you what a debt we owe you
want you to know 'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit
Medal of Merit
Oh, yeah
That's kinda like a gold star around here, right
It's the highest honor we got
just want my identity back
You want to be a cop again
No, being a cop's not an identity
want my identity back
takes it
() 140
: (') You'll have to excuse me
My only contact has been with a police shrink
(throat clicks) police shrink
(instead of asking the obvious) Was that
helpful for you
What are you gonna do about the rat in this building
'm gonna find him
Don't you worry about that
You got anything
Did Frank, ah, say anything
'm all done being a cop
just want to get my money and go home
Fair enough
You've given a lot
can get you your file
just need your password
The password's my name, William Costigan, Jr
They gave it to me in case something happened to them and  had to explain myself to someone like you
He writes it
Colin takes the paper and hides his astonishment
All right, Bill
Just give me a minute
'm gonna go in the other room
This computer's gone blooey on me
Billy nods
He goes

accesses the personal database, enters the password
Billy's confidential file opens up
Every fact about the man

'  #2 Billy takes a drink from the bottle  has put on the desk
As he puts the bottle down he sees, sticking out of a box, a
On it is written "
" picks up the envelope
and knows everything
is reviewing it Billy's file
Outside the glass wall we see , staring at 's back
and then moving on
'  #2 enters, holding a printout of Billy's personnel file
He looks around the empty room
He sees the lying on the desk, and understands everything
He sits down at his own computer--which does in fact work, and opens the personnel file
clicks
"Do You Really Want to Delete
" clicks "Yes" and Billy's picture, file, life, disappear
exits the police building and moves across the plaza
'  - waits outside Madolyn's office
, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees him standing and waiting for her
She's a little spooked, opens her mouth to speak
know
'm not here to
'm not here for that
've got something to
to give to you
something need you to keep
For me
What is it
() 142
: (stopping her from speaking) need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions
That's for you to hold
He gives her a manila envelope
(') Only you
Open this if 'm dead or if  call you and tell you to open it
Please do exactly what it says
Exactly what it says, please
Madolyn is a friend
She's not going to ask questions
She accepts the envelope
All right
'm sorry to show up here like this
There was no one else could give it to
'm sorry
There was no one else
He backs away, and then turns to go
we
(he turns) 've, it's, been so confused just want to say
He turns and looks at her
She doesn't speak: can't
Whatever you have to say, really think about it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all right
She moves her head slightly, watches him go
'
sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of light
The envelope lies on her blotter
She sits on
then straightens up, takes a marker and writes "" on the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer

It looks to him at first like a  picture blown up
stares as if at something in a horror film

What
was dreaming  was dead
Death is hard
Life is much easier
Referring to the envelope What's this
Open it He does
Really
Yeah
Really
Yeah
You're joking
It's not a joke, it's a human being
Colin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in these circumstances and kisses her
() 144
: '  - is in the shower
moves into the     kitchen and puts the kettle on
She checks the mail, lying     there on the counter
It's tied with a string
She undoes       the string and sorts through the mail
Suddenly, she freezes      looking at: addressed to : [ , 20 Pickering Street, Apt , Boston, , zip ], with a return address of Wm
Costigan, 13 Conant St
, Boston, etc
, etc
] stares at the envelope, listening to the shower going
Billy has written to her fiance
She starts to put the envelope down, and then realizes
she has to hide it
she has to open it
Inside the envelope is a jewel case:
And a note:
puts the  into the machine
She puts on the headset and listens
and listens
comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t- shirt, barefoot, his hair wet
He looks at Madolyn, realizing that something is wrong
What
pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and roughly the following booms out of the speakers
[: -- ] (') Your guys shouldn't have done that
One of us was going to have to die
It tends to be the other guy
stares at her and we ought to think murder is a possibility
'm now in charge of everything here
Including Queenan's informers
Theoretically
can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam
If the brass squeezes Dignam
() 145
: (2) So Dignam's the only one with the keys to the kingdom
He's fucking resigning
He put his papers in
He's not talking
Give me his location
Tonight
and  stare at each other
thought  was the liar
can explain
She goes into the bedroom
'
He answers it
is walking, on the phone, happy, and twisting the knife
Costello recorded everything
He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer
That was his insurance
His lawyer came to me
Costello trusted me the most
Imagine that you rat fuck
Sound quality good enough
was a little worried
' closes a door to speak privately
What do you want
want my identity, you two-faced rat prick
Where are you

: Three o'clock
Where Queenan died
You keep your cell on
goes to the bedroom door and tries it
Locked
He knocks
No answer
Did we not talk about this
This is my job
It's over
He starts to punch the door, and then does not
comes along and walks into the lobby
He is not looking for a tail
looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much a cop clearing his corners
He steps out and-- takes him from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his skull
Get your hands up
Hands
Hands
Put the fuckin' gun down
turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's forehead, hard enough to break the skin
He takes out Colin's belt gun and puts it in his pocket
(Billy screams "hands
" at Colin every time he makes a move)
(') came here to talk some fucking sense to you
You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and can get you your money

is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open
Billy throws away Colin's ankle gun
(') (spitting teeth) Fuck, shit

Arrested
Arrested for what

Fuck you
Prove it

Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth
What is this, a citizen's arrest
Blow me, prick
Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill
Nobody knows who you are
Nobody knows who you are
Would you shut the fuck up
'm a sergeant in the Mass
State Police
Who the fuck are you
Nobody

You erased me
Go ahead
Shoot a cop, Einstein
See what happens
What would happen is the bullet would go right through your fuckin' head

: (2) Watch what happens
What, you think you're gonna get the parade
The bagpipes and bullshit
Fuck you

That's the stupidest thing you could do
Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up

Head down, blood in his hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next move
He seems to realize he's fucked
(') [You are what you do
] Get up
( doesn't move
) said get the fuck up
grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to Colin's head
crunch of gravel, off
and  both hear it
Put down the weapon and step away from Sergeant Sullivan
drags  to his feet and using Colin as a shield aims the pistol at:
Brown is aiming his weapon
called you
You specifically
You know who  am
'm not gonna shoot
told you to meet me downstairs
Help me
() 149
: (3) Billy realizes he's in a truly shitty situation:   appearances are everything
Put the weapon on the deck and step away from Sergeant Sullivan
(a mess, bloody-mouthed) Shoot the fuckin' prick
(desperqte) Where's Dignam
told you to bring Dignam
Shoot the motherfucker
Put the weapon on the ground and we'll discuss it
He was Costello's rat
got evidence
Tapes
Other documents
Maybe you do, but right now  need you to drop the weapon
told you 've got the evidence cold linking this prick to Costello
( wavers) You fuckin' know who  am
'm taking him downstairs now
, weapon ready, follows into the elevator lobby
/ moves  into the elevator and as the doors close looks back at , still in a Mexican stand-off
, nose broken, blood masking his face
can't wait for you to try to explain this to a Suffolk County grand jury
This is gonna be fun
() 150
: The indicator ticks
Down, down, down
Colin sobs
(') Just fucking kill me
am killing you
The doors open and for a frozen moment , holding the gun on , stares out of the car
is shot through the head
sprays the walls, and  is hit by flying blood and matter
falls, crumpled, on his face, half in and half out of the elevator
The doors try to close
open
, covered with blood, looks up
lowers his pistol
slumps, covered with blood
uncuffs him feels his wrists
picks up ' gun
The other elevator doors open and  emerges
He looks into the bloody elevator and down at the dead man
(holstering his gun) Shit
raises '  and shoots  in the head

Did you think you were the only one he had
Costello was going to sell us to the
It's you and me now

: has been cleaned up a little by paramedics
He's maybe had his lip stitched, but he's still wearing his bloody clothes
At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in , intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head
(drinks water) At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol
was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me
was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired

As we transition to the

The same cemetery as his mother is buried in

She looks away from him, apparently forever

But later

What about the baby
She moves away from him without answering
walks out through the cemetery gates
hesitates
' has a bag of expensive groceries and wine
Living the Beacon Hill dream
He climbs the steps slowly
He nods to a neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and briefly seems aware of this)
(Don't be afraid to get a bit French here)
He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and nearly crumples
But he gets the door open
He looks up and sees a gun
Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows, Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the right thing to do
looks down and sees that Dignam has plastic hospital boots on his feet
(accepting it, sort of, but only in a  way) fires
Flash groceries fall all over the floor
'  step over 's body, crushing one of a half dozen croissants, and  goes down the expensive staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open
The strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the dead man's croissants
