3 - - , 600  - Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our planet is mythical and majestic
The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in the endless void of space
It is a blue planet, and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow and brown
It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India
The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its Eastern edge
It is beautiful
And so full of life
But not here
Here it is completely silent
- - small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth
If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is far away from us
It is the size of one football field
It is- The    ()
It resembles a dragonfly
Its solar panels stretch out, like wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules
It floats with a sense of proud achievement
It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level
It moves at an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15
7 laps around the Earth per day
It is cruising over Zimbabwe
To the East, the island of Madagascar
Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia and Ethiopia
Soon, the  curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright spec grazing over the blue atmosphere
- Orbiting at an altitude of 600 km- The    becomes visible
This icon of space exploration has played a key role in all of 's missions since the late 90's
Faintly we hear static, voices murmuring over radio frequences

Houston,  have a bad feeling about this mission
Please expand
Okay, let me tell you a story
It was '96
'd been up here 42 days
Every time  passed over Texas, 'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me
Six weeks 'm blowing kisses to that woman
Then we land at Edwards and find out she'd run off with a lawyer before  was off the launch pad, so packed my car and  headed to
Tijuana
You've told this story, Kowalsky
As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74
Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype
Matt smiles, checks the monitors of the sleek device strapped to his back
Five hours off the reservation and show 30% drain
My compliments to Engineering
Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust
( ) Engineering says thank you
Tell them  still prefer my '67 Corvette though
Speaking of which did ever tell you the-- ( ) We know the Corvette story, Matt
Even Engineering
Especially engineering
We're going to miss you, Matt
Matt grins, fiddles with a control and propels himself away from the Shuttle
Stationed around the telescope are   carrying out a repair mission
They are also wearing space suits but unlike Matt, they are not wearing Manned Maneuvering Units are the only things stopping them from floating away into space
Comm card reboot in progress
( ) Thank you doctor
Shariff, what's your status
Nearly there
Replacing battery module A1 and
is an Indian engineer in his mid-thirties
He is attached with tethers to a platform on one side of the Hubble
This is his second mission into outer space
( ) Could you be more specific
Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious
No
no
no Houston, don't be anxious
Anxiety is not good for the heart
The system is ready to re- activate
( ) Hubble Telescope engaged
Upgrade fully functional
That applause you hear is for you, Shariff
Congratulations
Kick back, take the rest of the day off
Shariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in Hindi, bursting into a Zero- Bollywood choreography that is repressed by the stiffness of his space suit
() Woohoo
Jaise Baadal Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai
( ) Matt, please advise as to Mission Specialist Shariff's current activity
He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort
Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part
Matt is now approaching the Explorer, skillfully maneuvering his thrusters
The other astronaut stands perched on a   attached to the Shuttle

This is her first mission
Ryan eyes the Card, then

( ) That's a negative
'm afraid we're getting nothing on this end, doctor
Ryan eyes the Card, then
Try again
(a beat, then
) Still nothing
Houston, could you please turn that music off
( ) Kowalsky
Not a problem
Matt toggles a switch and the music stops
Thank you, Kowalsky
Ryan moves the Card around
(') Now, Houston
Negative
Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--
( ) We're not receiving any data
Engineering is recommending a vis- check for component damage
Again, as if to herself- Mmmm
Let me see what's going on
She starts to disengage one of the panels
(') () What have you got here
Ryan takes out a card from under the plate and begins to examine it
Matt begins to approach her
(') Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components
The problem must be originating in the comms panel
( ) That seems to be the case
Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen
That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them
We should've listened to you doc
Without losing any time, Ryan puts the card back into the - 'm on it
( ) Copy that
How long do you think it'll take you
Matt begins a wide loop around the telescope
An hour
( ) Outstanding
We appreciate your patience, Doctor
Installing your system in the Hubble is the main purpose of this mission
Ryan doesn't respond, continuing to work
Matt closes in as he circles the telescope
(') Houston trusts Mission Commander Kowalsky realizes that this delay is not of sufficient duration to enable him to surpass Anatoly's Solovyev's spacewalking record, as most recent calculations indicate that he will be left
Seventy-five minutes shy
Never crossed my mind
( ) Matt, It's been a privilege
Matt hesitates ever-so-briefly, then
Right back atcha, Houston
( ) Enjoy your last walk
Am  a go to assist Dr
Stone in removing the panel
Assistance appreciated
( ) Permission granted
Thank you, Houston
( ) Mind if  join the fun
Certainly
Ryan begins unbolting
Matt lands right next to Ryan and grabs onto the telescope
She is frustrated, determined
How are you feeling
Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried
Matt takes out his pistol grip, and with fast precision puts its head to a bolt and begins unscrewing
Matt removes the bolt with confidence
It's been a rough week
If it makes you feel any better,  puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride
Ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip, and when a bolt - She
Whoa
The bolt spins floating away
She tries to grab it but , barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push that makes it change direction
She turns and reaches out to grab it, but she is strapped to the Robotic Arm
The bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when- hand  it before it has gone too far
It is Matt's
Ryan looks at him, embarrassed
(') Thanks
Sorry
In my basement lab things usually fall to the floor
Matt puts the bolt away
He begins to unscrew another bolt

Call me a genius if  can get this board initialized in the next hour

The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour
Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory
We'll keep you posted on any developments
Ryan glances at Matt
Should we be worried
Let the boys down there worry for us
Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay
( ) Standby for arm maneuver
The robotic arm moves very slowly, pulling Ryan along while Matt begins to unharness from the telescope to shift his position
So doc, now that you work for , how do you like it
Kinda like winning the lottery, isn't it
She grins at the memory, glances at him
Confesses: was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research
How long was your training
Six months
Including holidays
So, what is this scanning system
Nothing rad, it's just a new set of eyes to scan the universe
Assuming it works, it's just for hospital use
This one is a prototype
Standby for marking
Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes, even for your pretty blue eyes
She gives him a look
My eyes are brown
Matt stares at her, a faint smile on his face
Right now your eyes are blood shut
She grins, looks away -- he got her
Then
Kowalsky
Matt turns
Shariff raises his arms again
(') Is this great or what
Shariff  and   from the Shuttle, screaming and flapping his arms
long   attached to his waist - Brings Shariff to an  , snapping him back like a bungee cord
(for Ryan's benefit) And to think he went to Harvard
Ryan doesn't react to this, too consumed as she is with the panel
Matt looks out
sad smile is on his face
(') You gotta admit one thing
You can't beat the view
, with its ever-changing surface of blues and whites, greens and browns, is massive and serene below him
Mm-hm
"Mmm
" So what do you like about being up here
She hesitates -- trying sincerely to articulate her feelings as we  down at the silent planet below
The silence
() could get used to it
Matt laughs softly
We arrive back on him as he turns back to look at Earth
Something flickers briefly in Matt's eyes-- something -- Hmmmm
Terrific
Ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a small mirror
Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead
Am  a go to cut link to auxiliary
You're the expert, doctor
It's your call
Ryan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm, offering assistance, but- She does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her toolbox, leaving Matt with his arm outstretched
Ryan starts looking for another tool, but Matt is one move ahead of her, offering her a pair of tweezers
Ryan hesitates and takes the tool
She starts working on the panel
Houston,  have a bad feeling about this mission
Please elaborate
It's the same feeling  had at Mardi Gras in 1987
He waits, letting the moment hang knowingly
Then: That is affirmative
Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story
Please proceed
Well, it's day one and 'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine
The streets are swimming with people, 'm thinking there's no way 'm finding this girl
Ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself- Proceeding to over ride
Matt continues his story without missing a beat- Then all of a sudden  look up and -- there she is

Explorer, new data coming through
As it floats away, Matt gives the telescope a small spin
What's the blowback, Houston
It's not good
Most of our systems are going down
Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding
Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling
Matt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back

It's too fast
- Ryan swallows harshly, her throat suddenly dry
(') can't breathe

She inhales and exhales with quick short breaths- Ryan's eyes are wide open and desperate as her breathing accelerates
Her limbs look fragile against the black and incalculable void
She inhales
And her throat closes
Her mouth is open, but she cannot exhale
Not a breath
Ryan's choking
The lack of oxygen is making her veins pop out and her lips turn blue
Her eyes open wide, and- She exhales
And begins breathing deeply
As her breathing steadies, she begins to focus, her eyes searching the distance
- Ryan can see her face reflected against the visor, lit by the control panels
She dims the light and she can see- Her legs and arms floating against endless space as she drifts towards the empty void, broken only by lonesome stars whose position change as she rotates, giving way to- , Very still and very distant

Instantly, they begin to spin together
Matt takes out a tether
Now, 'm going to tether you to me
Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him in fright
He stares back

You never realized how devastatingly good-looking  am
Matt grins
(') But  need you to stop staring and help me with the tether

Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle nudge
Drifting again she begins to freak
(') Nooooooo
Dammit
The tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from Matt
Matt ignites the thrusters, tugging Ryan behind him
But this proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing his direction
See
Where you go,  go
Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position
As he does so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again
(') Better
Let's get out of here
Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and, igniting a long thrust, he jets away
Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and  - Ahh Dammit
know what you mean
Ahhh Dammit
You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle
How's that for a plan

Why aren't they answering
It seems like communications are lost
Can they hear us on an alternate frequency
We don't know
That's why we keep talking
If someone is listening they might just save your life
Set your watch for ninety minutes
Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for- 90
Why ninety
Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour
Factoring in our current orbit,  reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again
Ryan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count down

Am  a go to retrieve
Silence
(') Roger that
Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff
He has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting against Ryan's momentum
Where is he
Where is he
Shariff's body is tethered to a  that was ripped away from the Explorer
Matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and- He grabs onto it
Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against Shariff's body
The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him
(') Oh, my God
Oh, my God
Matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it
He detaches Shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself
He lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster, pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring Ryan and Shariff closer together
Grab him
'm trying
'm trying
Quick
You're pulling me away
got him
got him
Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all directions
Clutch him like he's your Valentine can't gauge my thrust with you two yo- yoing around
Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto Shariff's body harness
And she sees- Shariff's broken helmet
hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess
Ryan's face is inscrutable
Finally she looks away, but this time something arrests her gaze: floats next to Shariff, tethered to his suit via a small chain
In it, a    with abandon, happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his Transfixed, Ryan is unable to look away, something complicated confusing her eyes
The photograph floats in the empty space above Planet Earth
As they approach, the damage to the Shuttle becomes apparent
Explorer has been badly hit
(under his breath) Jesus
The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage
The tail is beyond repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage

At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff
As she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's window
All right, here we go
Careful of the edges
Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit
Ryan pulls herself up and looks- - The cabin has been destroyed
disarray of objects, smashed and devastated
At the end of the cabin, among the floating objects, a lifeless body drifts among the wreckage
Ryan regards it silently, mesmerized
The face of a second astronaut appears right in front of Ryan and crashes against her visor
The eyes are frozen, unblinking
Ryan , wheeling backward and away
Matt clicks Shariff's harness onto the Shuttle

To confirm
Mission Specialist Dr

Matt turns to Ryan, who is staring at the dead astronauts inside
apologize for not complying should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to
We were going to be hit no matter what
There was nothing you could've done to change that
He begins to reach out, hesitates briefly, then lightly touches her shoulder
(') Hey

Alright
We have to get ourselves to the Space Station

Agreed
She stares at the dot
(') Dr
Stone
(as she turns) Agreed
She studies his face and then, finally, nods
Agreed
Alright

He gently pushes her into space
She slowly drifts away from the Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether
Matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small thrusts, he combats Ryan's swing
And with a  - He shoots forward, pulling Ryan behind him
The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble
(') Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky
Dr
Stone and  have determined to proceed to  and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry if copy, please send rescue mission
Repeat please dispatch rescue mission
They are heading toward a small point in the distance, the Space Station, which is in a lower orbit
550
We see the two astronauts crossing the distance - a thrust, and they coast ahead, and then another thrust
Matt pulls Ryan behind him
Two specks glide across the dark sky as a sliver of light grows on the darkened hemisphere
looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of Earth's atmosphere
The oceans and the continents brighten as its light spills over the Earth beneath them
Warm rays of sun caress the two astronauts as they propel themselves across the empty expanse
02 down to two percent
We're getting there
(') Beautiful, don't you think
What
The sunrise
That's what 'm going to miss the most
But Ryan is not into the view right now
She's stricken with fear
Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed
Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles
(') So, where's home, Dr
Stone
Ryan keeps her eyes closed, doesn't answer
Matt, trying to - (') Ryan
Where's home
Ryan opens her eyes, but still she doesn't dare to look out of the helmet
Home
Ah ha

Where do you pitch your tent

Where the hell is that

Central time zone
That makes it roughly
8pm right now
What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the evening
Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out
She frowns, terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the helmet
don't know
What would you be doing
She tries again
This time she forces herself and stares out at the Earth, which is over 500 kilometers below her
(') Come on
It's 8 o'clock
You've just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary 18-hour shift
You're driving home
Ryan's wide open eyes are transfixed on Earth, like a deer in headlights
The radio

There we go
Let me guess
Classical
Top for-- Anything
Doesn't matter
As long as they don't talk

Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her, taking over her body
It is not fear, it is something deeper and more painful
Matt studies her curiously
What do you miss down there
Ryan looks at the Earth
It never felt so far away
long silence without an answer
(') Is there a Mr
Stone
She frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head
No
Nobody special
Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you
Ryan closes her eyes
She remains silent
silence that can't hide an unspeakable pain

Her eyes flutter, then open
She is frozen in this moment, as if stunned
Her gaze shifts and finds- Matt, studying her in his

Matt finally averts his eyes
He rolls his wrist over, consults the timer, watching the numbers slowly count down

Well, well, what d'you know

The tank may be empty but there's still oxygen in your suit, so sip, Ryan
Don't gulp

She nods

Matt gives Ryan a gentle push, waiting until the tether goes taut, and- He gives a   to position himself in the right direction
He holds this   for longer than all of the previous ones, immediately gaining speed, descending towards- - Which is half a mile away, and now all of its modules are clearly visible
It also becomes clear that- (') Houston in the blind we have visual of the

Ryan's losing her breath
Shouldn't we be turning
We're -- Sip, Ryan
Sip
Drifting is good
We want to drift

This can has one or two good thrusts left

She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate

She looks down, eyes the Station passing beneath them
(') Ready

It looks as though the Station is going to slip away altogether

Matt triggers his , turning sharply
Ryan's trajectory carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses, breaking Matt's direction
He fires again to counter her momentum
sends both of them in the right direction, straight down toward the Station, but at great speed
The Station is getting very close, and they're going very fast
Matt ignites the  , which begins to slow him down, but the thrust stops
Ryan, following her own momentum, begins to pass Matt
Break
You have to break

Can's empty
We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard
Grab onto anything you can and hold tight
Just then Ryan  against the  , but is unable to grab hold
As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms
Matt misses the solar panels, and  against the Station
As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing
Ryan passes flying above him
The tether tenses, pulling Matt
The momentum is to great and he   of the railing
Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but she's floating too high
She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void
She extends her arm and  the handle tightly for dear life - She's holding onto the handle
got it
got it
- She looks up and sees- Matt is floating straight toward her and- He  against her
For a moment they are face to face, only the glass of their headgear separates their faces
But she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her into the emptiness
Her drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel
She crashes against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it
Ryan bounces down towards the Earth, tensing the tether, pulling Matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel
The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two
(') The tether broke

Grab a hold
Grab anything
Ryan is drifting away from the Station
She sees the infinite black void ahead of her and- It becomes tangled in the strings and fabric, slowing her down
Ryan is panting, her face covered in sweat
She turns back and - Matt rolling, drifting in her direction
She stretches out her arm
Matt's arm is also outstretched
(') ( ) Give me
give me five here, Ryan
He's trying to make light of it, but he's really struggling to reach her
Ryan stretches farther
Matt's hand comes closer to hers
The tips of their fingers are almost touching
've got you
've got you-- The very tips of their fingers touch -- As Matt drifts past
Shit

No
No
No
Don't you
No
Don't you
Don't
Don't As the parachute tenses, she
The tether attached to Matt's suit passes two feet away from her - Ryan grabs the tether
It slides through her closed fist, until- Her grip tightens and the tether
(') Gotcha
Matt's momentum is now pulling Ryan, dragging her loose from the parachute
You have to let me go
What
No-- You have to
No
Those ropes are too loose, 'm pulling you with me
You have to let me go or we both die-- 'm not letting you go
We're fine
Her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further out, being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her foot
(We move from high-angle to low angle two shot)
As this : Ryan
You're not going anywhere, you're not -- It's not up to you
Matt begins to unharness the tether
Please don't do this
Matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand
(') Please don't do this
Please don't do this
You're going to make it Ryan
(
) No
He opens his hand, letting go of the tether, and Relieved of Matt's pull, the parachute begins to retrieve, pulling Ryan closer to the Station

Matt drifts away from the Station into the empty space
Ryan bumps against the station, pulled by the parachute, and she twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail

(') What kind of name is Ryan for a girl

Ryan continues to the Airlock
(') So, now that we have some distance between us- you're attracted to me, aren't you

(') ( ) You wanna know the good news

No
'm coming to get you
You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl
Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges
It's amazing
Ryan starts to respond, then falters, watching Matt's figure grow ever smaller
of   crackles through the dying radio
(in a daze) Matt
Only static hisses
(') Matt
Static again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming lost in a sea of white specks and- The transmission ends
- Ryan is dizzy, sweating, and having trouble focusing
She sees - Nothing more than a dot
She stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him with the tips of her fingers
But the dot has already vanished into never-ending darkness
Ryan is about to lose consciousness, when- new
She takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely
If she doesn't move, she'll die
Ryan pulls herself forward, reaching for a handle on the Soyuz
She grabs it and reaches for another, climbing her way toward the Station's airlock
But she's losing focus
As her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a blur, and she misses
- Her brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen
She struggles to open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible
She reaches up again, almost blindly
Her hand grips the handle, and with one huge effort- She sprints across the Docking Module, swinging from handle to handle, in one continual push, until she reaches the- She stops, takes one deep breath and- She turns the latch and  the re-entry hatch
The hatch   as the air inside the cabin escapes into the vacuum, almost throwing Ryan back into space, but she holds tightly onto the latch
She hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen inside her life system
She sees her feet dangling against the emptiness of space and- With one last effort, she pulls herself into the airlock
500
As she enters she does a 180-degree flip
As soon as her legs are in, she grabs onto the latch, and- She turns the latch and- - Ryan is suffocating
With very little oxygen and her body intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood, her breathing is coarse and painful
She can hardly keep her eyes open, and she pushes herself through the cabin, an empty cylinder lit by two circular mercury lights
She reaches the- , a small computer with a screen that monitors the atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock
She presses a button on the panel and- low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the Station begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock
The control panel's monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising
- Ryan gasps for air, but there is none
She stares at the red-orange-green graph on the control panel showing the atmospheric levels
It reads red
Her pupils begin to dilate as- - In the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves, but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly fills the cabin
The sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world heard from within the womb
beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious and halting
The Control System's graph slowly moves from red to orange
The cabin is still not fully pressurized
But that will have to do
With one sharp motion- - And pushes it from her head
She gasps for air and coughs
She contorts and shakes, fighting to breath in the thin atmosphere of the airlock
Her helmet bounces around the walls of the cabin, floating
The beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable - it is an alarm ringing out across the Station
Orange is turning to green
Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen and her breath becomes more even
Her body floats, relaxed in the confined space of the airlock
Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove
And then the other
Desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist
She squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half
Then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the claustrophobia of the suit
Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air, relieved and exhausted
The hum of the Space Station surrounds her
Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms, floating in a fetal position
For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber, surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in the cabin's womb
500
The International Space Station, with its modules, its torn solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out from its center, is dwarfed against Earth's orb and the infinite universe stretching out beyond
The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below
Everything is still
The module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets, a small eating area and a small gym
reverberates across the station
At the end of the module there is an open circular hatch leading - 1
spherical space with three hatches, each leading into different modules
and- Ryan floats in
She stops at the center and holds onto a handle
She looks in all directions and launches to her right, towards - There are sleeping bags fastened to the walls
Clothes, shoes, a strip of three condoms -- all kinds of personal objects float in chaos around the module
It's clear that someone left in a hurry
Ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet on the wall

They float around her face like perfect pearls of different sizes
She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath
The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag
She checks the count on the - 14 minutes and counting down
She takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing herself off of a wall, she dives into the- 2- (') Where are you

The Spacecraft is made out of three modules- the , the , and the  at the front
Detached from the Space Station, the rumbling has ceased, leaving only the gentle hum of the cabin
- The distance between the Soyuz and the Docking Module grows little by little as the vessel drifts away from it
Ryan sits tensely and checks the manual and- She presses different buttons, bringing to life a new set of systems

She grabs the joysticks with her hand, and- 500
The lateral thrusters give a small thrust, and as the spacecraft moves away from the Station it drags its parachute, which floats lifelessly in space
, and as the Soyuz pulls away from the Station, the parachute's ropes tense, and- Her seat belts prevent her from being projected forward as the Soyuz is pulled to a sudden stop
Ryan is very confused, unaware of the reason for the sudden stop
She looks at- - The Station is drifting out of the scope's sight
She turns to- - And through the glass she sees that- The Station is coming straight at her and it looks as though- '

With plenty of oxygen in her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task
She pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around the Soyuz and reaching- - An impact has blown open the cover
Three ropes float out of the container into space
Three meters away from the vessel each rope branches into dozens of parachute strings
Next to it- second cover is also badly damaged
Harnessing herself to a handle, she inspects the ropes
The three ropes are bolted to the container's frame

She unzips the bag and takes out the   tool, without noticing that behind her- pass, zooming less than thirty meters away from the Station

Ryan stares intently at the head of the bolt turning as the debris zooms by behind her
She quickly pulls the rope loose from the frame and lets it float away
Shaken by the impacts, the Space Station drags the Soyuz with it
She braces herself as- - some pieces hit the Station, others crash against one another
Each collision creates more debris that ricochet and fly away in all directions
The Soyuz is pulled by the remaining parachute rope, as the Station spins out of control
Ryan starts humming even louder, the bravado is full tilt now
Her face is now covered in sweat, which pours into her eyes, making it difficult to see as she unscrews the last bolt
Behind her, a cluster of debris

She pushes again, and again, and again- Come on
Come on
300
But
The Soyuz stays in place
Ryan looks at the  - 30 percent
She taps on it and the frozen needle drops to
You gotta be kidding me
She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the needle to go back up, and once again- (') Where's your backup
She taps even harder this time
(') Where's your goddamn backup
She bangs down on the control panel in frustration-- (') -- 300
Inside the capsule, through the portal, Ryan hits and hits, bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting all her anger, until she herself is out of fuel
She grabs the radio and- This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me
Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me

Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me

magical cosmic act
As the sun nears the edge of the Earth, the atmosphere brightens, shining with a luminous orange light that is reflected off the surface of the Pacific Ocean
At the Soyuz's orbiting speed this does not last long
The sun quickly dips behind the edge of the Earth and the whole face of the planet is in shadow
The vessel is almost lost in the deep black of night
Fluorescent green light pours out of the porthole, like a lonely firefly lost in the deep of night
And the night has brought with it its cold grip
Ryan shivers and her voice is now weak, but she continues searching for help- Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me

Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me

She turns her neck stiffly, looks at the- , -8 degrees and dropping

Ryan puts it on and brings the mouthpiece to her lips

Ryan begins to , giving in to the mad joy of it all
Moments later, through the , she is joined by a  of --Aningang's --    in a mad, crazy harmonic cacophony
Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with abandon
Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking emotions that have been festering over time, and- , clear as crystals, spilling from her lashes and floating   , glimmering   in the cool moonlight
They float away, like tiny satellites orbiting her face
Aningang can be heard intermittently, , as if trying to silence the dogs
Then the dogs, one by one, cease their wailing and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice
She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue light
'm going to die, Aningang
The  ebbs, losing its battle with the
(') mean, we're all going to die
Everyone knows that
But 'm going to die today
The  waffles in and out
(') Funny that
To know
The  breaks and Aningang's   begins
(') And you know what Aningang
don't care
don't care if  die
don't have anything
not anymore
Ryan is floating now over her seat
(') But the thing is
'm still scared
'm really scared
She rolls in space and stares upwards
(') No one will mourn me
No one will pray for my soul
Will you mourn me, Aningang
Is it too late to say a prayer
'd say one for myself, but have never prayed in my life
no one ever taught me how
The tune is lyrical and soothing, tinged with a touch of melancholy
(') No one ever taught me how
Ryan listens to Aningang's melody and smiles softly, closing her eyes
Ryan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness, buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song
Then
a   cuts through the static
Ryan's eyes pop open
(') baby
There's a baby with you
beat
Aningang stops singing, speaking in a soft voice: Ieukpalliktuq upatimi
You are singing to your baby
Is that a lullaby
That's so sweet
Ryan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby as Aningang coos to it, then begins to  again
(') used to sing to my baby too
Painful memories flash before her, haunting her
Ryan's lump in her throat is washed away by a gentle sob
(') hope  see her soon
She reaches for a valve and opens it
sound is heard inside the vessel, and- - The Oxygen in the cabin's atmosphere begins to drop
Ryan closes her eyes, simply listening to the lullaby as it grows fainter
(') (growing ever drowsier) That's nice
Keep singing, Aningang, just like that
Sing me to sleep
'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Sing to me, Aningang
sing
sing
The transmission grows fainter
and fainter
and then is
gone
For a long beat Ryan merely sits there
She is gently humming a tune
It is a
quiet deep sorrow that silently grows in intensity and that finally explodes into- float around her like tiny satellites
The cold and the gentle humming of the Soyuz cradles Ryan
She closes her eyes, and as her breathing relaxes she begins to fall asleep, until- Ryan opens her eyes, startled
Ryan turns in confusion and looks at- - , the helmet of an astronaut is looking in
He knocks once more, this time louder
Ryan is still drowsy and does not understand what is going on, when she sees that- The latch on the porthole begins to move
(') No
no
don't
But the latch continues to open
Ryan immediately straps herself to the commander chair
The latch keeps turning
Ryan covers her eyes and face with her hands when- and The  of space sucks in one sharp gust all the air inside the cabin and with it every sound
The straps hold Ryan back as objects gush out through the hatch
Her hands press tightly covering her face
On the Control Panel alarms begin to flash
makes its way in and with one sharp motion- Turns and closes the hatch
Presses a green button and- The cabin begins to pressurize
And sound re-emerges with the beeping of the alarms as- The red-orange-green graph on the control panel show the atmospheric levels reaching green
Ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the figure, who straps into the seat next to her
He unlocks the ring around his collar and- escapes into the cabin
Ahhhh
Alright, check your watch
13 hours, 11 minutes
Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped
The figure glances around
(') Bit gloomy in here
How `bout a little light
He taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms: Matt
Ryan stares, mouth agape
How did you
Trust me, it's a hell of a story
But how did you
He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches
Instantly, the alarms go silent
That's better
How
Ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how- found a little extra battery power
'm just happy you're still alive
To be honest,  thought your chances were slim to none
By the way, did you find the vodka
You never told me where
Matt fishes a   from under his seat, spins off the cap
Oh well
To Anatoly
Na zdorovje
and takes a big gulp
He offers the flask to Ryan, who appears to be dozing off
She blinks, shakes her head
No
He studies her
No
Right, let's get out of here
He looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen
(') We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station
little Sunday drive
We can't
Course we can
There's no fuel
tried everything
Well, there's always something we can do
tried everything
Did you try the soft landing jets
They're for landing so
Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training
never got to land the simulator, told you
But you know about it
And  crashed it every time
Ryan is falling asleep
Matt studies her as she dozes off
Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here
get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody
Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the cabin lights off
(') There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe
Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living
When the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan
(') Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now
If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride
You have to start living life, Ryan
Ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open
How did you get here
Ryan, you have to learn to let go
Hey
Ryan is almost sound asleep
What
Ryan is asleep
It's time to go home
Her eyes snap open
Her gaze shifts
The flask is floating in front of her
But no Matt
She turns
She turns back
Ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is shaking, making a percussive sound
shines in through the condensation that has frozen on the glass
It is- caressing Ryan's face
Landing, landing
Landing is launching
With a new surge of determination she
She pulls the  floating above her and puts it on
She connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the Oxygen Valve, and begins to breath
As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of determination brightens her face
She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing Oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin
She grabs the
(') Okay, landing, landing, landing is green
She opens the green binder and browses through its index
(') Okay, okay landing, alright
She stops, turns some pages and stares closely at the manual
Ryan notices the Energy Bar floating by her
She grabs it and as she opens the wrapper, she stares intently at one page of the , where there is- - An  of the Soyuz Capsule two meters before landing and hitting the ground
thrust is shooting out from under its bottom, cushioning its fall:
(') Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing
you're a clever son of a bitch Matt
So to land  need to get rid of the  and Engine module, okay
She puts on the communication headset
(') Listen to me Matt
You're going to see a girl with brown hair
She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess
That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it
She looks out of the porthole, down at Earth
(') Tell her mommy found her red shoe
She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed
She turns back to the console and places her finger over one of the buttons
(') You give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her
Tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that  promise 'll try and make her proud too
You tell her that 'm not quitting, that 'm going to keep fighting
You tell her  love her Matt
love her so much
Ryan smiles, remembering
and then- (') Tri module separation, go
She presses the button
The locks connecting the three modules of the Soyuz release
, , and the
mechanism pushes the   away from the  and the , and it slowly gains distance from them
Ryan scans through the complicated charts and diagrams in the manual
Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth
pause, and then- (') Let's reset you then
Using the manual as a reference, Ryan uses the cursors to select the   on the computer screen
The current  is- 2600
She uses the cursors and presses a button
on the computer screen comes on
She presses another button, and- , the  goes blank
Ryan punches a new set of commands
The  now reads- 3 meters
(') Okay
only have one shot at this
One shot
She extends her finger
(') What's the point if we don't try
ignites at the back of the cabin, pushing it at great speeds toward the Chinese Station
The strength of the thrust pushes Ryan back in her seat
She looks at- - The Soyuz is approaching the Tiangong
The center of the crosshair is aiming three degrees above the Chinese Station
The Soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the Chinese Station
Ryan is looking out of the window, at Earth- Wow
you were right Matt
it's magnificent
She then turns to- - The Chinese Station quickly grows in size as the Soyuz gets closer and closer
- 155 km and dropping
(') You're losing altitude, Tiangong
You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere
But not before  get to you
You have my last ride home
new sense of urgency comes up on Ryan's face
She unhooks the umbilical from her suit
She unstraps herself
She floats over and looks out of- - The Chinese Station is approaching, getting closer
She disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the
She pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it tightly against her chest with one arm
With the other arm- She reaches for the Latch
The Station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going to pass it
(') Okay, 'm done with just driving
Let's get go home
She turns the latch, and- shoot the porthole into space
The brutal force of the infinite  of space out of the cabin, and- Ryan is  out of the cabin at a tremendous speed
as she goes through the hatch into- is launched up from the Soyuz's hatch
She passes the Chinese Station as she twirls up toward the Heavens
The Soyuz continues its straight trajectory toward Earth
- Ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain
- Everything twirls
Earth and Heavens
An  in her
It's been -
And she spins and sees- , one mile below her
And below it- bright comet leaves behind a yellow scratch over the Earth
It - upon contact with the atmosphere
Ryan drifts away
She holds tightly to the fire extinguisher with one hand, and with the other she checks her right shoulder
But there's no time, the Tiangong is getting farther away
She points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and - - It acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the Station
It helped, but she is still off target
- She is in pain
The glass visor is steaming up
She begins  as she looks at- The Station drifting ahead, less than five hundred meters away
From this distance the damage caused to the Tiangong by the debris is clear
The solar panels are shredded to pieces, and several modules appear to have been badly hit
- - Propelling herself even closer to the Station
- She stops humming
Her breath is fogging up the glass, giving her a blurred view of- The Station, which is less than a hundred meters away
She can - The , the , a vessel very similar to the Soyuz, is docked on a module
It's now clear that she's not flying straight toward the Station
Ryan attempts to correct her trajectory by giving- - But only a very   comes out of the extinguisher, not enough to push her on the right track
She  the trigger again- But only a few dust particles come out
The extinguisher is empty
She lets go of it and it floats away
She drifts toward the Station,
She is less than twenty meters away, and getting closer
And she misses it by a hair
She drifts, very slowly, two meters above the Station
Her arm, outstretched, tries to grab hold of anything it can
- Ryan winces in pain and looks at- Her outstretched arm reaching toward- - She slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers almost touching the surface of the Tiangong
handle passes under her, almost within reach, but she does not manage to hold onto it
- She's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it
She looks ahead at- - solar panel, following the rotation of the Station, comes into view
She stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it
But the solar panel continues its rotation and she is approaching very slowly
The panel is rotating away
She , and- She  onto a rod on the Solar Panel,  her momentum
Ryan hangs from the Station
She holds her right arm tightly to her chest
- She catches her breath and is clearly in pain
- It hovers above the Station and glows as the sunlight hits its surface
It passes very quickly
And there's   cruising farther above
She pulls her right arm up
Ahhhhhh
The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod, - , and clinging with her leg, she secures herself to the panel
- She's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far away over the horizon- Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere
swarm of incandescent locusts that- Is coming directly at her
Ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible, she climbs up to- She goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling herself from handle to handle
When she reaches the end of it, with one last   she makes it to the- that leads into the airlock
With her bad arm she holds onto a handle
With the other, she pulls on the latch and- gust of  bursts out, pushing the hatch wide open
Ryan holds on tightly to the handle
- Clusters of  pass by, flying at different distances and at great speeds
Pieces  with each other, exploding into more debris
is flying downward, missing the Station by ten meters as it continues its descent
And- 250 meters below, it  like a shooting star
The Station is rapidly approaching Earth's atmosphere
And over the Eastern horizon- is quickly approaching
150
Ryan secures the hatch
The airlock is smaller than the one in the International Space Station but, like the , there is a small control panel on one side
- The glass is almost fogged up
She makes her way to the- - The red, yellow, and green graph is bright red
Under it, with Chinese ideograms on them
Her finger hesitates as she takes a wild guess
- is heard
As oxygen fills the space- Unrecognizable at first is a rhythmic pattern under a syncopated murmur
But as air allows sound to conduct its waves, it becomes clear
Over it a recording plays in a
It is in Mandarin
The in the recording is urgent
Clearly it is not good news
She's in pain and more tired than ever now, and she's punchy
(') She waits, floating
- The glass is completely fogged up
Through the condensation, she can only discern a   filtering through
She waits
Come on
Come on
And when the   turns to - Ryan  her helmet and, using only her left hand, struggles to take it off
As the helmet floats, bouncing off of the cabin walls, Ryan massages her injured shoulder
She does this gently, as even the smallest pressure inflicts pain
The orange light is turning green when- She feels the Station quake fiercely, reverberating through the handle she's holding onto
The Tiangong is plummeting
The tip of a solar panel is already grazing over the outer layers of the atmosphere, leaving a trail behind it as it parts the gases
passing under the Station burn up
1
Ryan rushes out of the airlock
new intensity sparkles in her eyes
Her fearlessness and determination are bordering with madness
She inspects her surroundings
Through a hatch she sees a long corridor-like cabin that leads to another node
It is the The  keeps on playing
She enters the hatch into the- The only light is coming from flickering emergency lights
Objects float in chaos
Ryan makes her way, dodging the disarray of lab objects- Scientific instruments:  plant drifting by with its roots exposed, clusters of liquid floating like wobbly spheres, two eggs hovering, one of which is broken
as- She reaches the end of the module and goes into the- 2
She floats to the center of the node
There are three open hatches- , , and- - Docking Module, very similar to the one in the
At the far end of it an open hatch leads into the
, defeated by the friction with the atmosphere, breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down, where it quickly burns, dissolving into sparks
The   of debris is catching up with the Station, a cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight
can be seen as debris burns, scratching through the atmosphere
2
Ryan springs into the- Floating through it and reaching the open hatch at the other end, she tosses the helmet inside the Shenzhou
The Station is collapsing
She dives through the hatch into the- It is almost identical to the Soyuz's airlock
She does a quick flip and- the outer hatch
Then she pulls on another latch and- the inner hatch
The Shenzhou is   from the rest of the Station
She throws the helmet into the Control Cabin and follows through, into the- She struggles to turn around in the confined space, and then- She pulls the hatch
The Shenzhou is smaller than the Soyuz and has only one seat
In this confined space, the  of the station is felt even stronger
She sits,  herself in, and looks at the- It has more monitors than the Soyuz's panel, and the main board is arranged differently
All of the buttons are labeled with Seriously
- - thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window
The yellow halo envelops the whole Station as it glides over the outer atmosphere
The remaining   resists breaking off from the structure, but still goes up in flames, leaving a trail of In the Soyuz the power button is erm
here
She passes her finger over the board, trying to make sense of the buttons
(') Ah, ok ah undocking, undocking
eenie, meenie,
An  , and under the ongoing , a , clearly warning
Ok
That doesn't sound good
She glances around frantically, turns it off
It's shaking very intensely but she's wide-eyed now, clearly close to being beside herself
(') Miini
moh
She tries a   that says- , followed by a  , also a warning- And with a horrible accent- (') No hablo chino
She keeps searching for the right button
(') Mini
moh
And she presses a new one
The  on the Control Panel
The cabin makes a humming sound as
On the control panel lights go on in patterns reminiscent of the switchboard in the Soyuz
(') Okay
okay
She begins going through the progressions she used on the Soyuz, only quicker this time, jabbing button after button
(') Good
good
There
And this should be
She presses one more button and systems turn to green
(') Okay
Houston in the blind
She raises her voice to be heard over the

'm about to undock from the Tiangong and  have a bad feeling about this mission
She presses a new button and the system goes to green
And on the  a  appears
(') Reminds me of a story, Houston-- She reacts to a bad shake of the cabin
(') Okay, you know what, Houston
Never mind the story
She looks around as the cabin starts shaking even harder
(') It's getting hotter in here
She watches the  on the - 3:59
3:58
(') The way  figure it, there's only two -- Ryan keeps her eyes fixed on the countdown
Raises her voice to compete with the rising chaos
(') either make it down in one piece and 'll have one hell of a story to tell
And now the noise and the shake are nearing their peak
(') Or  burn up in the next ten minutes
Ryan smiles, flips the safety lid of a button open
(') Whichever way it goes, no harm no foul
As the cabin
(') Because either way-- She closes her eyes, puts her finger over the button
(') It'll be one hell of a ride
Ryan presses the button
(') 'm ready
The Station is bouncing over the atmosphere
One end of it is glowing more brightly and catches

Not far off some pieces are already burning

Yeehaaa

She sees- above her, but she can only reach it with her bad hand
(') Ahhhhhhhh
- - separates from the rest of the vessel and from the Station
It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere
The two fragments of the Tiangong follow, spinning in a rage of sparks and fire
The spinning is punishing
Ryan is shaken violently
She is also mumbling words to herself that we can't hear
It looks like she rambling
Some
130
The capsule's aerodynamics slow down the spinning, positioning the vessel nose up
It cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds
Its metal is burning hot
Smoldering  and the fragments of the  chase the Shenzhou in its descent
- blinding light pours in from outside the window
The spinning is over, but the cabin vibrates with a loud rumble
As the -Force restrains Ryan against her seat, she clenches her face and sweats
On the ceiling, condensation begins to form
120
The Shenzhou is a ball of fire precipitating from the skies
It's followed very closely by  and the two fragments of the
The    and  into a ball of fire that breaks into many pieces
An avalanche of fire cascades towards the Shenzhou, rapidly closing the distance
In  - Outside burning debris is passing by
The gravitational pull keeps Ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face
She - - where condensation is dripping
100
The avalanche is about to swallow the cabin when the burning debris disintegrates before reaching the cooling
The capsule escapes the inferno as the debris crumbles in a final explosion expelling- that- towards the Shenzhou and- its surface, tearing one of the outer shields
The impact is felt inside and a panel falls off
small smoke trail is formed around its wires
Ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational force of the fall and- 70
The Shenzhou has left the burning debris behind
As it touches the lower atmosphere, it immediately  , dimming its brightness, surrounded by a purple sky
It  9
8 meters per second and- The long fabric comes out and  as the air fills the red and white canopy
When it's fully open it   the cabin's descent and lets it glide in a diagonal path over the Earth

expands
It slows the fall even further, shifting the cabin into a more vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now seems tangible
Ryan starts
The cabin is quickly filling with , and- The white cloud of smoke overflowing the small space is getting thicker
1
The Shenzhou drops, hanging from the parachutes, at a speed of thirty kilometers per hour
It is surrounded by a blue sky
It passes through a layer of clouds
She coughs as the white smoke is becoming unbearable
She's suffocating
100
The Shenzhou is rapidly approaching the ground
It is falling straight toward a lake
Two meters before hitting - , giving the downward thrust meant to cushion the landing on a hard surface
The thrust parts the water, creating a curtain of steam, and the Shenzhou gently falls down- - Making a wave that spreads out in a circle
Ryan feels the cabin hit the water
She has landed safely
But she cannot celebrate because she can't stop coughing
She is asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke
She  herself and- Reaches a  at the side of the hatch
She
With a small controlled explosion, the hatch cover is launched away from the cabin
Smoke pours out through the open hatch
She begins to unstrap herself when- through the open hatch
She tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and- She struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly filling the cabin, but it is too strong
The water has reached Ryan's chin when- She manages to take     of air before- The metallic capsule, which weighs almost three tons, sinks quickly into the lake
As the ropes of the parachute tense, the long fabric follows the cabin down
Air trapped inside Ryan's suit leaks out through the collar and small bubbles float up
Ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm, she swims out
She pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the - dark cloud of mud swells up around it
Ryan struggles to   to the surface, but she can only use one arm and the wet suit is
She strokes rapidly, but she isn't moving up
Instead- '  , and She looks up and sees- The rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray
crosses in front of her, effortlessly swimming on its way to the surface
Small bubbles of air come out of Ryan's nose as she struggles to open her suit
She takes off the   of the suit
- , a net about to trap her
She struggles out of the   of her suit
And squirming out from under it- She frees herself from the heavy garments and   as- traps her foot and begins dragging her down
But with a kick- , and- , stroking with her good arm
She is completely out of breath, only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose
She is about to lose consciousness, when she sees- swimming ahead of her, sliding smoothly through the water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface
Ryan's eyes are closed as she floats up, her body limp
The surface is coming closer and closer
She reaches the thin boundary between water and air and she come out to the- And she takes an enormous breath
Almost primal, like the first breath of a newborn child, it burns her lungs but reclaims life
She only has enough strength to keep her face above water
She , catching her breath and taking long gulps of air
She looks up at- - Where the clouds move, caressed by air and light
And beyond - , but- '
She turns around, and- - She , breaking through the water and harnessing every last bit of energy in her
And soon she arrives to the- She drags herself from the water, like the first amphibious life form crawling out of the primordial soup onto land
The water laps gently over her, washing in and out around her legs
with her face against the muddy shore and her eyes closed, recovering her strength
And as her breath steadies- She pushes her face against the ground, enjoying the sense of weight, and- Then she looks at her surroundings, taking in the almost unbearable beauty of the planet Earth
She's breathing deeply and begins to cough
It's not a cough, it's a chuckle
Ecstasy overcomes Ryan and- Joyful laughter fills her body
Thank you
She    against the ground and- With an effort, she pushes herself up
, and manages to rise to her hands and knees like a four-legged mammal
And she
heavily on the ground
It sinks into the mud and - Ryan's  are solidly planted on the mud
(') Ahhhhh
One foot moves forward and lands on more solid ground, unstable, coping with the weight
And then- The other foot follows as- , laughing
