(
) You know the problem with Hollywood
They make shit
Unbelievable, unremarkable shit
'm not some grungy filmmaker- wannabee searching for existentialism through a haze of bong-smoke
It's easy to pick apart bad acting, short-sighted directing, or the purely moronic stringing together of words many of the studios term as prose
No, 'm talking the lack of realism
Realism
Not a pervasive element in the modern American cinematic vision
: - Three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and talking
Two of the men sit on one side of the table; is in his early thirties,  , early forties
Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough said
The  across, however, is quite different
He is what they used to call a "cool-cat
" () Take Dog Day Afternoon for example
Arguably Pacino's greatest performance, excepting The Godfather, Part , and Scarface, of course masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet's best
The acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch
But, they didn't push the envelope
What if in Dog Day, Sonny really wanted to get away with it
What if, and here's where it gets tricky
What if they'd started killing hostages
No mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter
What
Still no bus

And this was 1976
No
, no , no
No Internet
Fast forward to the present, same situation
Can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media
In hours it would be the top story from Boston to Budapest
All caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected
You would practically taste the brain matter
Six hostages die
Ten
Twelve
Twenty
Thirty
Relentless
One after another
All over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured
He sits, letting the pictures sink in, then: Just a thought
mean it's not really within the realm of conventional cinema, but what if
You know, this movie of yours, don't think it would have worked
Really
How come

Pacino escapes
With the money
Boyfriend gets the sex change operation
They live happily ever after

Not a soul in the place

Outside the open doorway are crouched a squad of heavily body-armored  members, packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside
Thanks for the coffee
He gets up
In his left hand, which has been hidden by the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking spring-loaded grip
Gabriel is looking back at them
Smiles
Rene Descartes is sitting in some bar in Paris
Bartender says, 'Hey, you want another drink
' Descartes says, ' think not
' And disappears
He smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to the front door

Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway
Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues across the sidewalk and into the street
He nonchalantly looks up
Suddenly the  of and the  of  dominates the soundtrack
Pandemonium
the sky,
County  and a bunch of news vultures
Squad cars block off both ends of the street while  trucks, news vans, and looky- loos are packed together into the distance
Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are positioned on every open rooftop
Hundreds of weapons are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in the world
Slowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street
Gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus blocks most of the windows
He walks beside the bus, under a huge " " sign, and through the glass front door, which shuts

Three Hummers sit in the middle of the floor, surrounded by broken glass
Between them rests a bright red Ferrari F50 (Gabriel's)
All but one of the front windows of the bank, the one with the door in it, has been welded over with 3/4 inch plate steel
Over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms cable-tied behind their backs
Something has been duct- taped around their chests and each is wearing what appears to be a dog collar
The other occupants of the room are nine men
All of whom would look as if they were attending the fashion event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons each one carries
How we doin'
One of the   finishes putting a collar on a young, normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara, whimpering blonde girl

Torvalds is watching anxiously as his bags are torn into like Christmas day at the Griswalds
The two   eye his three laptops suspiciously
(heavy Finnish accent) Please be careful -- -- one of the Agents cuts off his plea with a glance
(to himself, almost inaudibly) -- that equipment is quite expensive
Torvalds is wary of time
After several moments his bags are being repacked when another passport is found
The customs official holds up two passports takes them and walks over to Torvalds
Mr
Torvalds
Could you step over here, please
Torvalds glances at his watch

How long am  going to be delayed
It'll be just a moment
Torvalds stands to the side, while two customs officials compare his passports
They step over to a computer terminal and punch in some data
It's 1:50
Torvalds notices a customs department employee wheeling a cart of confiscated items out of a nearby service elevator
He pushes the cart out of the oversized elevator
Torvalds shoots a glance back to the two officials discussing his situation

It is unlikely, sir
It was a routine check and Torvalds freaked out

This ain't good, boys
The Vortex has used Torvalds before
What do the feds know
Nothing as of yet
He's refusing to speak English and the Finnish consulate has already contacted the State Department
So we haven't been compromised
We're not sure
We're working on that right now
You better get sure real quick, son, 'cause someone's cock's liable to end up on the block on this one
And  promise you it won't be mine

Stan looks completely different than he did in the opening sequence
He hasn't taken very good care of himself
His hair is long, and right now standing on end
He is wearing nothing but a dirty towel, and is slicing golf balls off the roof
Whack
As the Ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at it, but he just isn't very good
Nevertheless, after a dozen bad hits, a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum hood

She is what the hack writers of the Thirties would call a vision
Thesauruses could be exhausted searching for adjectives that do her justice
In the low-rent light of Stanley's white trash haven, she is, by definition, a goddess

She walks into: 29

Stanley, pulling on his pants, lets the sentence hang, unfinished

Look at your situation, Stanley
For twenty months you've been in court six times, each time your custody case has been thrown out
Your situation doesn't look good, sweetheart

How much would it cost to retain the best family lawyer in the country and regain custody of your daughter
All the way through the jury trial
Yeah

Roberts sits down in a chair facing Torvalds
He stares at him a moment, just smiling, then
Why would the number one cracker in the world risk life imprisonment to enter the continental
My client has repeatedly reserved his right not answer any questions at this time
Torvalds looks at Roberts' badge and says something in Finnish, the only recognizable word being "Roberts
" The attorney and Torvalds both laugh
Roberts looks at the attorney

' Again they smile
Roberts looks at the lawyer's cup of steaming coffee and with one finger pushes it over into the lawyer's lap
You need another cup of coffee -- (jumping up in great pain) Goddammit
Roberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the wall, then pushes him out the door with a kick in the ass
He grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him and locks the door
He turns on Torvalds, smacking him across the face
He pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of him
Until a year ago  was head of the largest task force on cyber- criminals in the entire world
But,  burned out
It happens snapped
shot a suspect in the fucking hand
Accident
Do you know how hard it is to work a keyboard with one hand
Whatever you can do to me, he can do worse

But you haven't given me shit
Torvalds knows this and smiles at Roberts arrogantly
The door opens, an   sticks his head in
#1 Excuse me, sir
you have a call
So, take a message
#1 It's Assistant Director Joy, he said it's important
At least it's not my wife
(to Torvalds) You need to think about what else you know

The  Agent positions himself outside the door

Apparently his attorney is trying to convince him of something
Torvalds, unfazed, walks over to the one-way mirror
Torvalds to reveal Bad Agent #2 calmly screwing a silencer on to his

Torvalds leans closer to the glass
Bad Agent #2 sticks the silenced barrel of the gun up against the glass -- right between the eyes of Torvalds
Bad Agent #2 moves the barrel up and down between Torvalds face and neck

He lifts his hand, holding up his middle finger

He depresses the trigger slightly

Unbeknownst to him however, a tiny red aiming laser has zipped through the glass and is now positioned as a dot on Torvalds' throat

'm happy with what 'm wearing
You have no self-esteem, Stanley

They walk into one of the booths in the back
Sitting around a large, oval table is our antihero, Gabriel Shear, surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle of beautiful model-types
Ginger kisses Gabriel and with a healthy exchange of fluids, then
Miss me
Gabriel smiles, then looks back at Stanley
Gabriel, Stanley
Stanley, Gabriel
Gabriel just stares
(very familiar) Big Stan
Nice suit
Thanks
You know, they say it's the clothes that make the man
You buy it
Hope not

Actually you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand
But that's not the point
Stanley sits down
Gabriel pours Stan a glass of Crown

He did what the federal judges wouldn't do and kept the government out of our Privacy

Story is he went to jail and the federal Carnivore program is back in full swing
It was a real tragedy
What can  do for you
Changing the subject
Stanley, meet Helga
Gabriel smiles
The beautiful  to Stanley's right slides closer
() (heavily accented) Hi, Stanley
Stanley looks at her, she's a knockout; artificially perfect
He looks back at Gabriel
Look,  don't have a lot of patience for this -- Stanley, we have a problem, maybe you can help us out

Helga moves closer to him
Take a look at this
He is handed an open laptop, it glows
He sets it on the table and spins it around in front of Stanley
(like an alcoholic faced with a fifth of tequila) You know  can't touch that
Helga pours a shot of tequila
You like tequila, Stanley
Helga shoots the tequila, then turns to Stanley, places her lips against his
The gold liquid drips from their lips as she spits it into Stanley's mouth
He pushes her away, breaking the liplock, and swallowing the tequila
She licks it from his face
No need for modesty, we're all friends here, Stanley
This is bullshit

Impossible
Stanley's having a little trouble concentrating on Gabriel
Nothing's impossible
Helga begins sucking on Stanley's fingers
He pulls them away

Is this an interview
Sort of
Marco, let's give him some incentive
The drapes close
Two of Gabriel's crew step out
Marco yanks out a
40 caliber Glock and quickly screws a well- used silencer onto the end
Marco walks around behind Stanley
(now totally confused) What are you doing
Helga smiles, then drops her head into Stanley's lap
We hear his
Relax, Stanley
He has to go with it
've been told the best crackers in the world could do this in sixty minutes
Unfortunately, need someone who can do it in sixty seconds
You're kidding
'Fraid not
Stan realizes now no one is smiling
He grabs the blonde by the hair but can't pull her up
Forty-five seconds
Time is a wasting, big guy
The silencer is pressed into the back of his head
Stanley tries to focus on the screen
Stanley sucks air through his teeth, trying to focus
You have thirty seconds, Stanley

He kicks the wastebasket across the room
Shit
He pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink
He turns on the water and washes his face
Slowly he leans his forehead against the mirror
Ginger appears behind him
What are you looking at
Relax, Stanley
You can do this

Help
Help what, squeegee my brain off the ceiling
It was just a test, Stan, you passed
Ginger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her plastic overcoat
test
don't know why  let you talk me into this
can't believe how desperate  am
She exhales toward Stanley
thought you were here saving your daughter, Stanley
He turns around
(pissed) Look
'd do anything to get Holly back
But, if  end up in a box or back in jail, then  really can't help her, can
What should do, is take my money and go back to court
Back to court
Back to Melissa's gladiators
You throw a hundred grand at her, she'll throw five back at you
It's not about Holly, it's about beating you
You know that
Think, Stanley
What 'm thinking about is that you're willing to put a gun to my head to see if  can hack -- Suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom

When the kids realize that the urinals are occupied, they leave
Slowly Ginger takes her tongue out of Stan's mouth
They look at each other
She smiles at him
(coyly) Sorry
beat, for a moment there exists something between them, then bam, she's all business again
So, let me sum it up for you, Stanley
You live in a trailer
(beat) You're a felon, working a dead- end job
You want to get Holly back, Gabriel's your only shot
As he realizes she's right, he's got nothing to lose
Slam
He smacks the mirror with his fist, then walks out of the rest room
Ginger slowly lifts the cigarette
She exhales, then slowly smiles
She's got him

They look up when Roberts stalks into the room
He yanks off his jacket, crumbles it and throws it across the room
They just look at each other
Tell me you have some good news for me

Check this out
On one of the 25-inch screens we see a terminal at with hundreds of people streaming by at 20x speed
Torvalds is being apprehended
He freezes it
#1 See these two guys
He points at two men watching this action from the sideline
He pulls another monitor forward
#1 Now watch this
He fast-forwards through the crowd until the two guys show up again
He freezes it
#1 Recognize those two, same guys, next day
Question is -- He slowly moves the action forward -- #1 -- who's that
The footage stops and zooms in on one of two travelers who the two men are meeting

Roberts looks at it
Then at the screen
pop-up screen shows Stanley's history
#1 His ex-wife lives in Malibu
#2 The new husband owns Backdoor Films, a shady porn production house in Chatsworth
Decent production value but they only shoot on video
His wife actually starred in a couple of his videos
Apparently she's an 'actress

Who's the chick
#1 We don't know yet, sir
#2 Serious piece of talent
#3 Way outta his league
Something's up
#2 You know he also has a ten-year- old daughter, who he's not supposed to see

How'd you do it
Do what
Break the code
At the club
You broke the entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in someone's mouth, all in less than sixty seconds
How
used a logic bomb, dropped it through the trap door -- No, you didn't
You didn't have time
'mon, you can do better than that
How'd you do it
used a password sniffer
Gabriel glances at Ginger who shakes her head
Uh uh

How'd-you-do-it
don't know exactly

In my head
All my life
don't answer equations, just see the answers
Same with code
can't explain --- Ginger eases over to where Stan is sitting
She runs her hands across his shoulders as she moves around him, dancing to the
Mozart always said he didn't write music; he just wrote down what he heard in his head
So did Faulkner, just with words

need a worm, Stanley
hydra, actually multi-headed worm to break an encryption and then sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network
What kind of cypher
Vernam encryption
Vernam's impossible
Its key code is destroyed upon implementation
Not to mention being a true 128 bit encryption
Actually, we're talking 512 bit
It's impossible
Tell ya what, 'll pay you ten million dollars
That should be enough to get your daughter back
(beat) unless of course it's impossible
Stan thinks about it
Nothing's impossible
They shake hands and Gabriel heads toward the back of the house

Stan looks over to see Ginger staring at him

Ginger pulls herself up on the desk, spreading her legs on either side of the keyboard

He backs away
It won't bite you,  promise

It's gonna be pretty hard without a gun to my head
She reaches out and pulls him to her
Well, let's put a gun to your head
She kisses him and slowly he responds
She smiles
Tell me about your worm, Stanley
They kiss
You surprised that a girl with real breasts and an
over 70 can give you a hard-on
Stan shakes his head
thought you were Gabriel's
She looks at him a moment
She smiles at him and slowly bends forward to whisper in his ear

She stares at him a moment then slides off the desk

You figure me out
She hands him the bottle of expensive wine she's been drinking, and then grabbing Stan by the belt-buckle, pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house

She's reading Steven Hawkings'  Brief History of Time
shadow falls over her
The shadow moves
Ginger glances nonchalantly up, then: (sitting up, grinning) Don't you have that just-fucked- the-neighbor's-cat look this morning
She reaches over, lights a cigarette, and inhales deeply
He smiles, looking her up and down
Problem
Pretty impressive
thought we went over all that last night

Ohhh

Get out of my light

Stanley nervously clears his throat
She's got him
Can  borrow your car
There's something  need to do
She reaches down beside the chair, grabs her keys and tosses them to him
Then: If you're going to see your daughter, you might want to reevaluate the way you look
(goes back to her book) Just a thought
He looks at her with open mouth amazement
In just 24 hours, she already knows what makes him tick
She looks up from her book and winks at him, then returns to her reading

Look, creep,  don't think so -- She stands up, ready for a fight
And there, next to her is her father; transformed
Under his arm is a three- foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow
Daddy
(recognition) Daddy
She runs to him and wraps her arms around him
Hey, sweetheart
Daddy
What are you doing here
missed you so much
Me too, baby
brought you something
He holds the stuffed giraffe to her
Oh, Daddy
If Mom finds out you're here she's gonna have you thrown back in jail
It's okay, baby
Let me give you a ride home
He grabs her stuff

He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes  which he's borrowing
Holly runs and jumps on his back

You believe in me, right
Of course, but -- 've found a way to get you back, sweetheart
It's my one shot and 'm taking it
Just give me a couple of days
(crying) don't want anything else to happen to you, Dad
Holly, everything's going to be okay
You just have to trust me
(crying) love you, Daddy
Holly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying, from the car at full speed, with the giraffe
Stanley, tears rolling down his face, slaps the steering wheel, trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so badly
Suddenly, the passenger door opens and a man in a and fed-issued shades gets in
Who the fuck are you
#1 (flipping out his badge) Friend of a friend
Let's take a ride
He motions toward a black Taurus, now parked across the street
In the back, he sees a face he recognizes

The man kinda smiles at Stan
#1 (being a dick) Gotta suck to be you
Yep
Stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge of his nose and jumps out of the car
Stan runs across the hood of the Taurus and just jumps over the railing
66
-                                          66 We realize what Stan did probably wasn't the smartest move in the world
The cliff is just barely on this side of 90 degrees and drops off about five hundred yards straight down to the
Stan falls in   about thirty feet before the cliff face angles out enough to break his fall
He begins a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff

Roberts then hops the railing, as his men scramble for the car
68
-                                          68 Roberts hangs in mid-air a moment, then he too begins the rolling fall down the hill
as he tries to keep his balance, is being beaten and battered by the sharp, rocky ground
Finally, he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for fifteen feet
Then it really gets bad
Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill to help control the erosion
To Stanley however, it is the world's largest Slip and Slide
He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent
Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent
Roberts, above him, is doing little better
As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of blazing afternoon traffic on the
Finally, Stan bounces onto the black-top road
He runs headlong into the traffic
,  , as they slide into each other
Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of escaping
Roberts, now at   the bottom himself, watches as a sideways   into Stan, flipping him over it
Stan, not stopping to   feel the pain, runs across the hood of a freshly-stopped   car

-                                             69 On the other side, Stan runs down to the beach and runs down the sand at full-tilt, looking for any escape route
Roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian accident which slowed him down a little
Stan however is faster
Stan does his best Jerry Rice, as he runs down the beach at full speed
Suddenly, the Taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach at Stanley
Stan veers, now running through the surf
The Taurus veers as well, and Stan is forced to slide across the hood to keep from getting whacked
The Taurus breaks left, and slides further into the surf
The  driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus down, tires spinning, throwing sand
Stan continues to run as Roberts makes it to the Taurus
Fuck this
He pulls his

from his shoulder holster and it into the air
Roberts bends over trying to catch his breath
Stanley stops, putting his hands up
#2 Why didn't you do that earlier, sir
Roberts looks at the agent
#2 Sorry, sir
Go get him
Three of the agents bring Stanley over
Stan slides down by the back wheel
What are you doing in

We just wanted to talk
Are you arresting me
For violating your parole by leaving Texas without permission or for evading a federal agent and almost getting me killed in the process
Stan just looks at him
No, 'm not
Then why are we talking
Didn't know the court lifted the sanction preventing you from seeing your daughter
Fuck you
You just want to cut through the pleasantries and get down to business
Fine
can help you with your daughter, Stan
Help me, 'll help you
You'll have to forgive me, the fact that you put me in jail for 18 months doesn't inspire a lot of trust
Whether  agreed with what you did or not, you broke the law, Stanley
guess we were both doing what we had to
This was a nice trip down memory lane, but if you're not arresting me

That's right
Ya know it's funny
Axl Torvalds was just here for a vacation, too
Isn't it odd that the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time

(getting up) Tell Torvalds  said hello
If you're not careful you can tell him yourself
He's dead
Stanley looks at Roberts
(to his men) Give him a card
They do
Stan looks at it
In case you think of anything else you want to tell me
Stan turns to walk off

Hey, Stan
Stan turns

It's a long walk back up the hill, Stanley

Glock and its thigh holster, dropping it on the dresser

Reisman is not happy

'll never understand the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim
little too much like masturbation for me, without the payoff
Gabriel looks around, suddenly realizing something
This's a catch-and-release stream, isn't it
That's right
Gabriel starts to laugh
Reisman doesn't catch the joke
Oh c'mon, Jim

Anyone who infringes on America's freedom
Terrorists' states, Stanley

Customers scream and try to flee but are quickly corralled with 80-85

It shifts into reverse and slowly backs over the curb and into the bank
huge armored bus rolls down the street, through two parked cars, and up onto the sidewalk, effectively sealing off the front of the glass bank
Mercs begin welding metal plates around the armored bus
We hear the approaching  of a fleet of cop cars

-  -                                      127 (dropping the mic and turning to the hostages) Ladies and gentlemen, we will be in your lives for approximately 55 more minutes
This bus has just become your new yard
So sit back, think happy thoughts, and this will be over before you can say 'cat in the hat

Whaddaya think, Stanley
You'll never get away

Five hundred bucks says do
Tell ya what, Stanley, 'll even spot you the five bills

Behind the bus, a huge caravan of police cars and  trucks follow
Stan, c'mere
Stan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with Gabriel
All the hostages' eyes are on him
At the front he looks at Gabriel
Take a look
Cops block off side streets as the convoy, ala The Gauntlet, rolls through
Gabriel seems to be in complete control, despite being surrounded by every law enforcement officer within a hundred miles

He grabs him, pushing him
How the fuck can you justify all this
You're not looking at the big picture
Gabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail
Stanley, here's a scenario
You have the power to cure all of the world's diseases
But the price for this is that you must kill a single, innocent child
Could you kill that child to save the world
No
You disappoint me, Stanley
It's the greatest good
Silence for several beats

How about a hundred
Gabriel becomes intense
How about a thousand
Not to save the world, but just to preserve our way of life
No man has the right to make that decision
You're no different than any other terrorist
You're wrong, Stanley
Some men are put here to shape destiny, to protect freedom, despite the atrocities they must commit
am one of those men
Thousands die every day for no reason at all, where is your bleeding heart for them
You give your twenty dollars to Greenpeace every year and think you are changing the world
What countries will harbor terrorists, when they realize the consequences of what will do
Did you know  can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for forty million each
buy half a dozen,  even get a discount
