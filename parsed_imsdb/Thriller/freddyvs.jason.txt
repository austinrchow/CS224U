Freddy's coming for you
On "you" there is a  and a flash -- like quick lightning only evil
(Choice flashes from Nightmare on Elm Street 1 & 2)
Meagan turns at 1665
beautiful white, two-story house, thick with lush green foliage
Several beautiful children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch and jumprope on the front walk

Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number "4" drawn on concrete
Another  and flash -- longer,

Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a little harder now
The trees are brown, the leaves peeling away
Moving up the walk, closer to the house
only now it's a little darker, needs some paint
On the front porch, a   rides a tricycle

The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka" we all recognize as Jason's theme
Meagan turns to find that the children in the yard have vanished
It's nighttime
The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon stretches off into utter nothingness
Meagan turns back to the little girl
But the little girl has gone
Only the tricycle remains
It circles once, the front door  open, and the empty tricycle peddles inside
Meagan follows it into the
- Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri- cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears
Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan
She tries to open it -- locked
Then faint  cause Meagan to pause
She listens, trying to make out the low murmur
Then a little girl's Meagan recognizes it as her sister's
Lizzy
Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall
following the voices (we recognize the other voice as belonging to Freddy)
Meagan enters a door at the end of the hallway, moving into
'  () - On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year old sister --
Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and draws with crayons
Lizzy
What are you doing here
Playing with my friend
Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings of Freddy
Your friend
He lives under the bed
Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under Lizzy's bed
Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out the door
Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five tiny slash marks on her cheek
Lizzy clucks
(continuing) You scared him
Meagan looks out the door, incredulous
scared him
But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone
(continuing) Lizzy
Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing in the
- The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut
Meagan goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid
Inside -- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling all over it
Meagan screams and slams the lid back down
The casket starts to move --
Then it stops
Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again
Inside --
He grabs her arm
Where ya been all my death, baby
Meagan screams
Freddy leaps out of the casket in a tuxedo, crooning: (continuing) 've been waitin' at the altar for a long, long time
Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress, spattered with blood
Behind her, the chapel has filled with dozens of   in various stages of decay
appears in the pulpit and asks: Are the bridesmaids in attendance
Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets, dressed in body bags
(continuing) And the groomsmen
Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest
(continuing) If anyone here believes that these two should not be joined in unholy matrimony, let him speak now or forever rot in hell
>From the back of the chapel, a voice: Meagan
Meagan turns
It's her boyfriend --
He stands in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms outstretched
Jesse
Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms encircling one another
She looks up into Jesse's eyes
only it isn't Jesse
It's Jason
Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing it down between her eyes
: '  - Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock
she was dreaming
She gets up quickly and crosses to her dresser
She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts on her cheek, and clucks
Then she exits, going into
'  - Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed with a doll
Meagan smiles and starts to exit when she notices something not quite right about the doll
She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal a hideous little Freddy doll
Meagan gasps
Freddy
Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers: Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch
The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives, thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest
: '  -  (for real) Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest
She looks down and sees that there is nothing there
Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad dream
-- her alarm clock
Meagan sits up with a start again
Her fright turns to rage as she pounds the alarm clock into submission
Meagan climbs out of bed
'  - Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching her Raggedy Ann doll
She gently pries the doll away, tossing it disdainfully away
Meagan picks up a small glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's head
Wake up, sleepy head
Time to wake up
Lizzy's eyes flutter open
She smiles at her sister, then frowns
had a bad dream
Me, too
was scared
Don't worry
they can't hurt you
Promise
Promise
Lizzy hugs Meagan
(continuing) 'll never let anyone hurt you
- a small television set on the kitchen table
flashy graphic flashes across the screen: --
--  13 stands in front a police blockade
In the background, dozens of  and surround a small run-down, two-story house
Freddy's house
(filtered) As the sun rises on yet another morning, still no end in sight for the standoff between police and the mysterious group known only as the "Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned house behind me just thirteen days ago
These cultists -- mostly run- away teenagers -- have managed to keep police at bay for almost two weeks while inside they take mind- altering narcotics in order to communicate with their god -- Freddy
The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen where '  is sitting watching the , gulping down orange juice
Across from mom is ' , who is having coffee, reading the paper
Meagan pours herself a cup and sits
Morning
Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news
Dad looks over his paper long enough to smile and say, just a little too cheerfully: ' Morning, Meagan
Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her father, mouthing the words "How's mom
", when suddenly Meagan's mom bellows: ' (calls upstairs) Lizzy
Get down here
Breakfast is almost ready
Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back into his paper
Meagan sighs and sips her coffee
-- a police booking photo of
Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger was released on a legal technicality but later burned to death at the hands of a vigilante mob of grieving parents
Some years later, a rash of bizarre and unexplainable teen- age deaths began leaving many in the area to wonder
is Freddy really dead
Meagan's younger sister --  -- comes down to breakfast
The microwave  and Meagan's mom pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her family like playing cards
Lizzy picks up her Pop Tart, whining
' Hurry up and eat
You don't want to be late for special school
Mom
Don't call it that
hate that school
The other kids are mean
and they're all re- tard-ed
Meagan snickers
' We don't use that word
They're "special" children just like you're "special"
Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look
Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind the paper
-- The cult members have declined to an on-camera interview but did send out a note with a message
The note -- which, by the way, appears to have been written in blood -- reads
(reads the note) To the parents of Springwood -- Freddy lives
Soon he will come and take one of your children as his virgin bride
Then Freddy will -- and his -- upon her -- and -- and behold, a soulless child shall be born
The vessel for Freddy to rise and rule the darkness forever and ever
horn  outside
That's Jesse
Let's go, Lizzy
Meagan collects her books and her sister
This is dad's cue to look at his watch and say: ' Oh, look at the time
've got to be going
anyone need me to bring anything home tonight
need an alarm clock
' What's wrong with your old one
Broke
Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the door
Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says: ' We're almost out of vodka
'  -  - Meagan and Lizzy climb into 's car
Good morning
Hey, what's the matter
My mom
And
had another dream last night
Was  naked
No
You were Jason
Jason
Oh, yeech
(then) Was  any good
Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car  off
- Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to say something
' Do you have to watch that crap all the time
Months and months of the Simpson trial, and now this
Mom reaches over and switches off the
Dad smiles slightly and exits
Mom waits until the door closes, then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit into her orange juice
She takes a deep drink and switches the set back on
as the news reporter interviews -- State Trooper
'm standing here with State Trooper Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the Governor has called in to deal with the cultists because of his past experience with occult-style murderers
In fact, Trooper Murdoch is the only law enforcement officer ever to survive a one-on-one encounter with notorious Camp Crystal Lake killer -- Jason Voorhees
(to Murdoch) You received some pretty nasty injuries in your battle with Jason, didn't you, Captain
Nothing serious
just a few stitches
What about these so called "Freddy" cultists
They seem like pretty tough customers
Think you'll have any trouble getting them out of there
No
Now that the Governor has given me complete authority to deal with these punks  should be putting an end to their situation pretty quick
Unless of course their attorney is able to get them to come out peace- fully
but  don't hold out much hope for that
(to camera) Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and gentlemen
tough cop
for tough criminals
: ""   - Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next to the
sitting behind the wheel
Damn media
oughtta be a law
(gestures to house) Is that shyster still in there trying to talk them out
Yeah
he's making them some kind of deal
Damn lawyers
what a bunch of assholes
Shakespeare was right -- kill all the lawyers
Then we could kill all the punks with no hassles and the world would be a safer place
Smaller anyway
Ahhhhh
what did Shakespeare know
Long-haired, English freak
He was probably a punk
- Meanwhile, inside the house
the cult's sleazy is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room
He is surrounded by  -- heavily-armed teenage punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy
They stare out at him through sunglasses with red flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and disfigured faces
The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held neatly on his lap
Then he lifts his head, wiping his nose nervously as he speaks: So, as  explained to you before, the revenues between the  movie deal and the book sale should be adequate to fund your joint-defense
And  think with my mass media hypnosis argument  could get each of you a reduced sentence on appeal -- say
twenty years each
Out in fifteen with good behavior
Hmmmmm
: - The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's windshield with a loud
Jesus Christ
Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging the house as he  away with two nickel-plated 45s
Suddenly  erupts from every window in the house,    the cops cars, windows and emergency lights
The
follows Murdoch through the hail of  as he kicks open the front door
- -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the team move in
The windows have been covered with foil, the walls have been painted black with cult slogans written in red, making the whole house black as pitch
The
team puts on their night vision goggles and starts moving through the house
as the
team goes through the house  cultists (ala the computer game )
Then a blinding flash of light and a
guy goes down -- shot in the face
Several of the cultists lead the attacking
team deeper into the house
As one of the
guys follows his foot trips a wire
trap door opens in the floor and the
guy falls into a pit, waist deep in water
Suddenly, the water starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's a tank of piranhas
Two other
guys grab his arms and pull him out
Too late -- his legs have been shredded to the bone
Another
guy kicks in a door to a room and steps in,  his machine gun
large scythe swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows
His arms fall to the floor, still  the machine gun
The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing bolted over head
They swing like monkeys across the ceiling just as a
guy charges into the room behind them
'  as he steps onto a floor covered with upturned nails
Several nails puncture both boots, the points coming up through the laces
The
guy screams and another
guy barrels into the room to see what is wrong
He knocks the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails
Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally
He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three cultists as they try to escape out a window
As the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells: Freeze
Murdoch exits, laughing to himself
The running  continues as the cultists retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov cocktails
Soon the first floor is ablaze
guy screams as he is consumed by
The cultists thunder down a back staircase to the
- The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the house and most escape through the underground tunnel just before the
team comes  into the basement
As the last of the remaining cultists is capped off, a faint voice cries for help
The commander raises up his hand
Hold your fire
He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his flashlight into the basement
Through the dense smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied to a chair sitting on a crate
Underneath the chair -- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer : 30

Help me, mister
please
The
commander rushes to the girl, kneeling down to look at the bomb
Then he takes a Leatherman tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's timer
Hang on, honey
'll have you out of there in a second
Murdoch comes down the stairs
He goes to the secret passageway and says: Looks like we'll have to hunt the rest of them down
Let's go before they get too far
We can't leave
Can't you see we've got a situation here
Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs
Leave her
You're crazy
can't just leave her
Forget it
've seen this before
There's nothing you can do
've got to try
The
commander wipes his brow and leans in to work on the bomb again
: 24

The basement ceiling is now fully  and chunks of   fall around the skittish
team
Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion
You're wasting your time
The
commander studies the wires for another second, then glances back at the timer

Fuck it
The
commander whips out his Spyderco knife and cuts the little girl loose
He carries her out in his arms as he shouts to his men: (continuing; yelling) ' '
The
team exits the basement with Murdoch bringing up the rear
- The
commander staggers out with the little girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men and finally Murdoch
The commander throws himself to the ground, covering the little girl with his body as -- -
-- the Elm Street house
Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him
He mutters: Punks
As the dust settles, the
commander rolls off the little girl and starts checking her for injury
Are you okay, honey
Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the
commander, flashing a glove of knives
She hisses: Freddy lives
With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the commander's face
She dives back for a plunge to his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off
He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution style
The
commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in time
Several cops rush in and grab the girl, dragging her off, kicking and screaming
(continuing) Jesus
you were going to kill that kid, weren't you
told you you were wasting your time
Once these kids go rabid, best thing to do is put 'em down
You can't be serious
Dead serious
See
the world is made up of rules
Kids don't like rules
They rebel for a while, but ultimately they start to fall in line and become ordinary Joe's like you and me
But some kids
dope smokers mainly, watching their
Satanic lyrics melting what's left of their brains
these kids grow up to be punks
And when these punks step as far over the line as these "Freddy" punks have -- then we as peace officers have no choice but to kill them
didn't become a peace officer to kill kids
Punks
There's a difference
(under his breath) barely
: - written across lockers -- We move from this to a small classroom window
Through it we see Meagan sitting in economics class
The instructor --   -- is lecturing
(Blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah
) It's hot
Several of the kids fan themselves, struggling to stay awake while others have already passed out on their desks
Meagan's eyes are heavy
She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along in his book, fast asleep
The antique oscillating fan on Miss Krepps' desk  loudly as she drones on: (continuing) (Blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah
) Meagan starts to drift off, when
(continuing; loud) Meagan
Yes, ma'am
asked if you were ready to give your oral report
Yes
'm ready
Please come up here to the podium
Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the snickers of some of her classmates
Miss Krepps snaps her fingers for quiet
(continuing) You won't think it's funny when you haven't learned the fundamentals of a free market economy
oh, why do  waste my breath
You're all going to grow up to be gas station attendants and waitresses anyway
Go ahead, Meagan
My report is on Global Economic Trends
(clears throat; begins reading) Try and think of a world where there is no poverty
no sickness
no crime
world where everyone is happy to be alive and everyone lives together in peace
This is my dream
The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to  louder, harder
Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues with her report
(continuing) This dream is becoming a reality with ever-growing international business
as it changes
getting creepier
turning into a Freddy-fan
harder louder
Louder, Meagan
We can't hear you
Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her voice to be heard over the fan
Then pages of her report start to blow away
She grabs at them as the increases
bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and spills to the floor at Meagan's feet
She bends over to pick it up, when her skirt blows up
She presses it down but the  is too great and the skirt billows up, revealing her underwear
The class roars with laughter
(continuing) Louder, Meagan
we still can't hear you
But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's busy trying to push down her skirt when --
-- the  blows her skirt off
Her classmates fall over themselves, laughing
-- Meagan's blouse blows away
She tries to hide behind the podium when that too is swept off
Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start to drift away -- thread by thread
She is almost naked
Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the face
Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are all a bunch of old rotten skeletons
And up front, in the center where Miss Krepps sat
is Freddy
He wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs: Aww
all dressed up and nowhere to blow
Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands of cloth that cover her body
She calls to Jesse, pleading: Jesse
please, help me
But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead
He reaches up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale, expressionless face
Looks like a photo opportunity to me
Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan flashgun attached
The flash bulb is the size of a beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the front
Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and sneers: (continuing) Say
cheesecake
-- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic light
Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back against the blackboard -- vaporized
: Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly
The classroom as normal
Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking: Meagan
Meagan
Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused
(continuing) asked if you were ready to give your report
Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls herself together
Sure
Meagan stands up and faints
: '  - '
as the   comes into , standing over her
Meagan
Can you hear me
Do you know where you are
Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head
was day dreaming and then  woke up but then it was like  was still dreaming and then  woke up and then  guess  fainted and now 'm awake again
Are you sure
Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment
(continuing) Meagan
'm waiting to see if you're going to turn into Freddy
Freddy
see
You've been watching too much
That crazy "Freddy" cult thing -- it's all over the day and night -- you can't get away from it
No wonder you kids are all having nightmares
But this one was different
it felt real
But that's just it, Meagan
dreams aren't real
They're just broken fragments of the subconscious mind
Fear is real though, isn't it
And if nightmares are fear, then doesn't that make them real
(gets excited) And if the nightmares are real then is reality like a dream
(cutting her off) Meagan
You've got heat prostration
that's all
The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face
- Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the nurse's office, muttering under her breath: Old witch
what does she know
She isn't even qualified to give a shot and she's telling me that my dreams aren't anything to worry about
So she said you were okay
Oh, sure
Madame Curie in there says it's just a case of heat pro- stration and an overdose of  news
Ruined my makeup, too
So you're going back to class
No
She gave me last period off
Well, what are you bitching about
could have a compound fracture of the skull and she wouldn't excuse me from
Jesse
've been having nightmares for almost two weeks now and they keep getting worse
Now 'm having daymares
want to know why
Okay
well, didn't the nurse say it was heat probation
Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration
You don't understand
want to know more about dreams
What they mean
why we have them
Okay, Meg, go look it up
You've got the rest of the day off, that's all 'm saying
That's a good idea
Why don't you cut last period and come with me
Sure
Where are we going
The library
You want me to cut school so we can go to the library
: - Meagan pours through a big psychology book
Across the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book
Find anything
Jesse looks up suddenly
What
Oh, no
nothing yet
Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of  & tucked inside his psychology book
Did you know that our sub-conscious retains everything that ever happened to us
Everything
From the time we're born until we die
Really
That's how Freddy gets at us
by using our sub-conscious fears
Fears our conscious minds have repressed or forgotten
've got a news flash for you
Freddy's dead
'm not so sure
if Freddy exists in our sub-conscious then he can never be fully erased
Like a bad memory
you may blot it out of your mind but it will alway be hiding someplace in your dreams
(off Jesse's disbelieving stare) Weren't you scared as a child by something so stupid that you're ashamed to admit it
No
No
Well, yeah
Well, what
What is it
Well
when  was kid, my brother took me to the carnival
And in the penny arcade there was this robot gunslinger
Black Bart
You know about Black Bart
Duh
You put your quarter in and he says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot
" And then you pull your gun out and shoot him
That's just it --  never could
'd point the gun right at him and shoot, and  could never hit the guy
So  always got killed
No one can hit him -- it's a gyp
Scared the shit out of me
Meagan tries to hide her smile
(continuing; flustered) Isn't that scary
mean
for a kid
Meagan laughs
Somebody shushes her
(continuing; mad) Okay, smartass
what about you
What scared you the most as a kid
dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back
remember
Lizzy wandered off one day and we couldn't find her
The police came and everything wasn't really worried until  saw her picture on
then  got really scared
(then) Jesse,  can't explain it
but think something bad's going to happen
: - Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching her books and Raggedy Ann doll
waiting
Behind her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning disabled kid -  - taunts her
You're stupid
No, you are
They forgot you again
No, they didn't
Yes, they forgot and you're goin' to wait out here until it's dark and then the monsters are goin' come and get you
No they won't, because 'm walkin' home
Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking
Leonard calls after her: Come back, Lizzy
You can wait with me
got forgot too, you know
Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school yard
Leonard turns to go inside the school when he bumps into a passing
The cultist pushes him down as he follows after Lizzy
(continuing) Okay
'm going to have to report this
Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling she's being followed
She turns and sees a cultist standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her
Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she glances back, the figure is still standing
but closer
Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as she flees down the sidewalk
As she comes to the street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front of her, the door swinging open wide
Burned arms reach out to grab Lizzy
She screams
The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as it roars off down the street
-- laying in the gutter
: '  - Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked in front of Meagan's house
Meagan gets out of the car and rushes inside
'  - are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house, calling for her family
Jesse enters behind her when Meagan's dad comes up, asking: ' Didn't you get my message
What message
' called the school after lunch
had to stay late after work
Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where she is talking to a policeman taking notes
She is drunk and has been crying
' Don't you dare blame this on her, you sorry bastard
It's all your fault
(to Meagan) Where have you been anyway
The library
' likely Goddamn story
Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing
Dad
what's wrong
What's happened
Where's Lizzy
' She didn't come home from school today
The police got a report that a girl fitting Lizzy's description was forced into a car by some crazies
They're pretty sure it was this "Freddy" cult
(shocked) Oh, my God
Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to comfort her
' Now don't worry
The police are doing everything they can
Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his men when a voice from upstairs calls down: (
) Hey, Cap'n
better have a look up here
'  - As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and the small glass menagerie there
Murdoch picks up the unicorn and admires it when a  draws his attention to the floor next to the bed
Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy, including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across the top
Meagan enters and sees the drawings
She gasps
Looks like she was in the cult all along
No
no, she wouldn't do that
Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult
know it's hard to believe, miss
But a lot of good kids get caught up in this kind of trouble
Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles tightening
He clenches his fist, pulverizing the little unicorn
Punks
Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan
'  - Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking: ' Captain Murdoch
is there any- thing we can do
You can pray, sir
Pray we find your daughter before
well, before it's too late
But rest assured, if can't persuade her to come back to her loving home, then 'll do what's best for her
know you and your wife wouldn't want her to suffer
(to his men) Come on
want to go talk to Erwin
Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit
'  - As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls Jesse out of the house
Where are we going
Over to Stormie's
Stormie
thought you and her weren't friends anymore since she stole that twenty dollars from you
That was her "klepto" phase
when she was dating that gang member
She dumped him a long time ago
still don't understand
What has she got to do with Lizzy missing
She used to be in the Freddy cult
Maybe she knows where they took Lizzy
They exit to Jesse's car
: '  - Meagan's high-strung best friend --  -- is blurting out at a mile-a-minute: If  did know  would call the police, you know that
love Lizzy
No telling what those freaks will do to her
Those Freddy cult guys are hard core
thought you were in the cult
was in the cult for a week cause my boyfriend at the time
Slasher, he was
But  just liked the music and the clothes
when they were clean, but not like the violence and stuff
But that was just my "cult" phase
but  got past that
You know, just like my "gang" phase when  was dating Ramon and then before that was my "death rock" phase when  was dating Stuart
Uh, excuse me
but what phase are we in now
Militant feminist, man-hating phase, what's it fuckin' to ya
(to Meagan) Why don't you just let the cops find her
That guy Renton Murdoch -- he knows how to deal with these cultist psychos
He was the man who got Jason Voorhees
That guy in my dreams
Jason kicked his ass
: -    - Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as younger-looking Renton Murdoch is  away at Jason in panic
(
) Well
yeah
But Murdoch put thirteen bullets in Jason before he hacked his head open
Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete
Murdoch staggers back, raising his pistol
(
, continuing) But even with his head hacked open and his brains leaking out, Murdoch still managed to put his last bullet in Jason's eye
Murdoch , the bullet  Jason in the eye
Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's body hits the ground
- Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages
Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of medical contraptions
(
) Well, one of my mom's boyfriends worked at the hospital where they took him
He said that Murdoch lost more than half his brain and what little that was left was all twisted up inside
And they had to replace his skull with a metal plate to keep that from leaking out
In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us
(
, continuing) They say he hasn't been the same since
: '  - So what's different about him
One thing
he used to be a Democrat
Now he votes straight Republican
think he thinks Lizzy joined the cult or something
Oh, my God
he'll kill her
've got to find Lizzy myself
've got to find her and save her from Freddy before that crazy cop kills her
Just where are you going to look
mean, these cult guys could be holding her anywhere
Murdoch said something about going to talk to somebody named Erwin
Erwin Kelper
He used to be in the Freddy cult
bet he knows where they took Lizzy
Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak that used to eat bugs
(annoyed) Who else
(to Meagan; bright) Erwin is scary smart -- always brought home ""s -- but he was kinda fucked up, too
mean, who isn't really
Anyway, he quit the cult a few months back and the cops put him away for his own safety
They say Freddy's put a death hex on Erwin
death hex
Yes, a death hex
You know
where someone wants you dead
Where is he
: - Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign and into the parking lot
As Jesse puts the car in park, Meagan turns to him and says: want you to stay here
Why
Don't be mad
it's just that you might scare him
Scare him
What she's subtly trying to tell you is that this needs a woman's gentle touch
butthead
Just stay here
okay
Jesse grudgingly agrees
Meagan kisses Jesse on the cheek
Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance
- The  of the insane echo through the building as the   escorts Meagan and Stormie down a row of cell doors
He stops at one, tapping lightly on the glass
Yo, Erwin
you've got a couple of visitors
Now be a good boy
(to Meagan & Stormie) You've got five minutes
'll be right down the hall if you need me
The guard exits
Meagan and Stormie peer through the thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant
They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a little closer to the glass
Erwin
--  suddenly presses his horribly burned face to the glass as he screams: Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled
Then they quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's inspection
(continuing) Where do you shoot
Shoot
He's talking about dream dope -- the stuff the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to Freddy
don't do drugs
You're not in the cult
No
Didn't Freddy send you to kill me
/ No
don't trust you
better take off your clothes so  can check you for tracks
Chill, Erwin
We're here for some hard data -- not a floppy disk
Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small mattress
Well, what do you want
Can't you see 'm busy
Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister
told her you might know where they took her
already told the cops everything know
Tell me
please
Look
'm sorry about your sister, but 've got my own problems with Freddy
'm a marked man, you know
Then tell me why they took her
To bear his child
Freddy wants to be human again
In order to do that he has to be "reborn"
How can he do that
He has to marry a virgin on holy ground
Then the cult consumate the marriage by impregnating her
The whole cult
Yeech
Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs
It's sort of a tradition with him
So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant
And Freddy enters the soul of the fetus through a dream state
Voila
Rebirth
There is a moment as the girls take this in, then: That's the stupidest shit  ever heard
Hey, they're not my rules
some- body else wrote 'em
Erwin
you've got to help me find Lizzy
You're my only hope
Erwin thinks about this for a second, then: 'll help you find your sister, but you've got to help me
Anything
Just name it
You have to help me kill Freddy
Meagan and Stormie exchange looks
But Freddy's dead
Freddy lives
(looks at Meagan) If only in our dreams
Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull her away
Come on, Meagan
our five minutes is up
He's giving me the creeps
But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin: How can you kill a dream
When it's not a dream
(then) Do we have a deal
Erwin presses his palm against the glass
Meagan thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass over his
Deal
: -  - Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of a pay phone, arguing
No
won't do it
Come on, Jesse
Please
It's illegal
could go to jail
How will they ever know
Don't be such a pussy
Oh, yeah
Why don't you call then
Okay,  will
No
They'll never believe her
can disguise my voice
(lowers voice) Hello, how do you do
My name is Jesse
think 'm a man but 'm actually a wimp
They'll never believe that
Come on, Jesse
for me
Okay
okay
'll do it
(to Stormie) And 'm not a wimp
Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth
After a moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make the call
Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both girls shut up, he says: (continuing) need a quarter for the phone
Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him
Jesse re-enters the booth
as Jesse dials a number
- The security guard picks up his phone as it
Springwood Mental Center
how can  help you
(filtered; disguising his voice) There's a bomb planted in your building
Who is this
If  were you -- 'd get my ass out of there
In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper something to Jesse
(continuing; adding) Oh, yeah
Freddy Lives
-- The guard's eyes grow wide
-  - The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a fire
Soon all the  start filing out into the yard, loosely herded by the
Erwin files out with the others, still wearing his straight jacket
Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car flashes it's lights
Erwin starts to casually wander off towards the fence between himself and freedom when the   spots him and says: Hey, Erwin
where do you think you're going
Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence
(continuing) 'm talking to you, asshole
Erwin breaks into a run
The guard takes off after him
In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the guard closes the distance
He's not going to make it
We've got to do something
With grim determination, Jesse starts his car
Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for the fence
With a loud, metallic , Jesse's car drives into the fence, knocking that section down
Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into an open window
Then, with a  of tires and the of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence, does a 180, and  off
as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out of his straight jacket
Once freed, Erwin extends his hand to Jesse
Hi, my name's Erwin
Thanks for busting me out of there
Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the fingertips are all heavily bandaged
Yeah, right
Look, Erwin, just do me one favor -- don't eat nothing disgusting
My stomach is tight enough as it is
The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the street
Then he spots something in the fence and plucks it out
Jesse's front license plate
: - , screaming and crying as the cultists close in around her
They rip her sleeve off and inject her with a syringe
After a moment, Lizzy starts to settle down
falling asleep
The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry her towards the big boiler
Inside -- a raging
'
-- as the cultists reach the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant gate
The two halves swing open wide to reveal
-  - narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop a tall, narrow mountain
On either side of the ledge is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled with    and
Hundreds upon hundreds of voices are  and  -- a terrible chorus of the damned
The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to the mausoleum
The outside of this ancient structure is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of mankind
In the center -- a large iron gate that swings open as the cultists near
The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding her tight as they push her face forward into the mirror
The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's face disappearing into the mirror
() -- Lizzy's face stares out into utter blackness
Then, some- thing large and evil looking swims up out of the darkness
Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering out
The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss, locking it's lips over hers
Several slippery some- things slither into her mouth
Lizzy struggles, but the big evil thing is way too strong
Finally, it releases her and the cultists pull her back out
The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into the
- Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi- conscious state
Her eyes grow wide with fear again as she opens her mouth to scream
Suddenly, she doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a cultist thrusts under her
Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's mouth -- the Dream Demons
- Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car pulls up next to a run-down building
- Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the old, burnt out boiler room
They work their way towards the back, to a large table and a collection of sofas and easy chair scattered about
Erwin starts sniffing around, pointing out several used syringes laying scattered about the floor
Damn
We must have just missed them
Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor
Oh, my God -- she was here
This is part of Lizzy's shirt
It's all torn
(grabs Erwin) Erwin
we've got to find her
We're too late
There's no way
except
Except what
We could go after Freddy
How
Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way up underneath
After fishing around for a moment, he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch box
Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes, and several pairs of cult shades
We'll inject ourselves with Dream Dope
It's a mild narcotic that brings on a dreamlike state
Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her approval
Okay
let's do it
Meagan
we don't do drugs
mean, what if one of us gets hooked or something
(whispers) We could turn out like him
Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin
Don't worry about it
We need you wide awake anyway
What for
We're going to go under and try to find Freddy
When we do, we'll grab him and bring him here
Then you kill him with this
Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver
This rusty chunk of shit
What good is this
It's not the gun, it's what's in it -- silver bullets blessed by a priest
Will that work
(shrugs) Should
But then
(finishes for him) You don't make the rules
yeah, yeah
What should we do
Have a seat over there and make yourselves comfortable
Roll up your sleeves and put these on
Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens
Stormie puts hers on immediately and says: Oh, cool
What are they for
It's how the cult keeps in constant contact with Freddy
The little lights flashing are a sustained occular input that causes your brain to resonate at approximately the same frequency at which the dream state is most likely to occur
All of this went over Meagan's head
Stormie shrugs: Whatever
(to Meagan; excited) Put 'em on -- they're really cool
Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling up their sleeves
Erwin comes over and reclines the chairs, giving each girl an injection
Then Erwin takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself
He lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his glasses
It helps to hold hands if you want to go together
Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie
Jesse watches with skepticism and concern
Erwin ushers a final warning: (continuing) And remember
Freddy knows what scares you
Then all three   their chairs into
- Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace (fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands
The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells: ,
- Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all asleep in their chairs
- Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night- mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below
As they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice: (distant) Meagan
help me
please
Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her
Stormie and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't
Freddy's trying to split us up
- Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length mirror, practicing drawing the pistol
He pulls it and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from the muzzle as he says: Okay, Freddy
there's a new sheriff in Dreamland now
- Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy boiler room, calling for Meagan
strange shadow stalks them -- it's Freddy
He drops down in front of Erwin and Stormie
Looking for some-body
Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of lost souls
In the center -- Meagan
Stormie charges Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams to Erwin: 've got him
Wake us up
Wake us up
But Erwin is paralyzed with fear
(continuing) Don't just stand there
Wake us up
Hmmmmm
feel like seafood tonight
Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster claws
She jerks away from Freddy, but too late -- Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman
Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and apron
(continuing) Stew on this, bitch
Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side
She falls into the boiling water far below -- -
: - Stormie wakes with a start, yelling: Shoot him
Shoot him
Jesse spins, aiming the pistol
But nothing is there
- Freddy turns toward Erwin
Well, well, well
if it isn't my ol' pal, Erwin
Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot
(continuing) 've got something special in mind for you
Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls out a pin
Freddy gawks -- surprised
Erwin pricks his finger
: - Erwin wakes with a start
Stormie smacks him
You didn't help me, you pussy
could've had him
(smacks him some more) You gutless
spinless
jelly fish
Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping
-  () Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following Lizzy's voice
(
) Meagan
help me
Meagan
It leads her to her house
Meagan enters the front door
'  - Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen table, reading his paper
The headline reads: Daddy
He looks up and quietly shushes her
' Shuuuuu
'm trying to be invisible
And with that, Meagan's dad disappears
Only the newspaper remains
Then Meagan hears Lizzy's again
upstairs
As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes her mother's room
The door is open a crack
Meagan looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle to her lips
The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face
Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry for help draws her to
'  - Meagan enters
She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the covers
Help me
Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from her night gown
Something inside is trying to push it's way out
(continuing) Meagan
Lizzy screams
Meagan moves to help her sister when Freddy's glove   of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing Meagan in the chest
: - Meagan wakes up suddenly
She looks up at Stormie, Erwin, and Jesse standing over her
Are you okay
They help Meagan to her feet
(shaky) He got away
had him and he got away
Oh, God
Lizzy lost her
Well, atleast you're not dead
No
'm not dead
(realizes) No
'm not
But Freddy killed me
He killed me, too
But look
Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is unharmed
Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him
Meagan gets to her feet, asking: Now that  think about it -- he's killed me in all my nightmares
But 'm not dead
what does it mean
It means we've still got some time left
Until his remains are host to the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't hurt us
Hello
The Dream Demons
Freddy made a pact with Satan when he died
so Satan bestowed upon him the Dream Demons
They're the source of Freddy's power to manipulate our physical reality
Without them
he's powerless -- nothing more than a bad dream
(off Jesse's cynical look) Hey, like  said
don't make the rules
But we've still got a chance, right
chance to kill Freddy before he gets back his power
We already tried that
There's no way for us to kill Freddy
He's too clever
He knows how to get to us
Then let's get somebody else
Some- body strong
Yeah
We could hire somebody to kill Freddy -- like a hit man
You would have to hire a thousand of them
or one really big guy who isn't afraid of anything
No fear
Nada
Then you got a shot
Where are you going to find a hit man
The yellow pages
In your dreams
Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder- bolt and she stammers out a name: Jason
Jason
Jason Voorhees
(brightens) Jason Voorhees
that's brilliant
The perfect dream warrior
no fear
Sounds like our man
Uh
excuse me, Einstein
but isn't Jason Voorhees dead
Seriously dead
Buried up by Crystal Lake somewhere
But don't worry, know how to bring him back to life
Somehow  just knew you would
But that's not the problem
The problem is control
Once we bring Jason back from the dead
'm not one hundred percent sure he'll do what we tell him
Well, that's okay
as long as he doesn't chop us all up
Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain
Erwin
'm trusting you on this, so tell me the truth
Do you think if we do this -- if we go and get Jason and bring him back to life, that he could kill Freddy
No doubt about
Jason could wreck Freddy on this side of the Dreamline
But if Freddy has home court advan- tage
don't know
Too close to call
The trick would be to get Jason to enter a dream state, grab Freddy, and drag him out to our reality
haven't got a choice
've got to try something
(turns to Stormie & Jesse) can't ask either of you to help me do this
it's illegal, immoral, disgusting
Hey, we sisters have to stand together, right
Where you lead -- 'll follow
Count me in
Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse
He looks them over and sighs: Let me get this straight
we're going to go dig one dead maniac up to fight another dead maniac
That's about the size of it
and 'd be doing you a disservice if said there weren't a modicum of risk involved
Meagan
don't want to do this
You don't have to, Jesse
it's not your fight
understand
But  damn sure don't want you to do it without me
Count me in
Meagan hugs Jesse
Erwin tries to hug Stormie but she pushes him away
Look out Freddy
here we come
: - In his shack, listening to a small portable radio, is the
His small  suddenly perks up her ears and  low
The watchman turns down the radio
What's matter, girl
you hear somethin'
Then the old man hears it, too
low
Moving closer
The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints into the darkness when a line of several hearses approaches
The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and the driver's window rolls down
(continuing) What's this
funeral procession
Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window and says: That's exactly what it is
(suspicious) Yeah
Whose
Yours
-- the cultist  the old man right through the head
The night watchman falls to the ground with a lifeless
The little dog starts ferociously when another  silences her as well
Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt cutters
He swings the gate open and the funeral procession proceeds inside
- The cultists are standing around a small pit that two cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the wrecking yard
Inside the pit, the uncovered remains of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of charred bones
Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists, and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed around
She no longer struggles, accepting her fate with droopy eyes
'
-- as she watches one of the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into Freddy's broken jawbone
Her vision gets blurry
more surreal as another cult member steps forward with the tupperware
He pours the dream demons into the funnel
'  as the dream demons swim around inside his skull
His bones start to bleed
blood becoming arteries and veins
vessels becoming muscle
muscle growing scarred flesh
There is a  from the pit
Then suddenly, Freddy Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him -- leaps out of the pit and cries: Smokin'
Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints
The cultists their weapons into the air and cheer as the building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding them  their  and  their
: - Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that reads:   - 13
(
) We're almost there
(
) We should pull over and ask directions
(
) If it doesn't offend the men
ooops, sorry
There aren't any
(
) Very funny
- Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service station
don't think they're open
It says, open all night
Jesse  the horn and yells: Hey
Can we get some service out here
don't think there's anybody here
Suddenly, a  '  appears on the opposite side with a shotgun
Everyone in the car jumps
' What do you kids want
We're looking for the old cemetery that's supposed to be around here
somewhere
' What do you want to know for
We want to see it
' Ain't nothin' to see, girly
'cept a bunch of ol' graves
Look, mister
can you give us directions or not
The old man gives the occupants of the car a going over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding under a baseball cap
' You're not goin' up there to do somethin' stupid, are you
(laughs; nervous) Stupid
Like what
' Like dig up Jason Voorhees -- that's what
Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold busted
Then they start saying "No
No
" and shaking their heads innocently in a big performance that wouldn't fool a stick
(looks at Meagan) Jesus
why would anyone do that
' dunno
but people do
Been dug up a few times already, has he
' More times than  care to remember
Well, we're just doing an article for our high school newspaper about the dangers of breaking into cemeteries at night
You know, stuff that can get you hurt
The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he acquiesces
' Well
okay
as long as you're not going up there to do something stupid
(pointing) Take this road up about a mile and make a left at the ol' saw mill
That road will take you right on in
Eternal Peace Cemetery -- can't miss it
Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust
- Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- -- illuminating a sign: Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their shoulders
As they search through the cemetery, Meagan asks: What's the story on Jason Voorhees anyway
Where have you been
Jason was that guy who ran around in a hockey mask, chopping up camp counselors, duh
knew that
What  mean was why
It started a long time ago, back in the fifties, when Jason drown at Camp Crystal Lake
His mother went berserk and started killing the counselors
She got her head chopped off by one of the girls she was trying to kill
Right
And then Jason came back from his watery grave to get revenge
He came back from the grave
Yeah
Chopped up a number of people before they finally caught up to him
What happened to him then
They killed him
How can you kill somebody who's back from the grave
Not very well apparently
Jason keeps coming back to life and chopping people up
It's a never ending cycle of terror up here at Crystal Lake -- a real problem
Why does he keep coming back to life and killing people
They say he's looking for revenge on the camp counselor who murdered him as a child
Jason just happens to go about it in the socially unacceptable way of hacking through every teenager he finds until he gets the right one
(spots grave) Here it is
Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave
--
Born:1945
Died:1953
Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc
Jesse and Erwin start digging
-- cemetery statues watching them dig
Stormie and Meagan take their turn
Then
Jesse hits something solid
Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the coffin below
Jesse takes a sharp breath and then jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open
The casket lid cracks open a bit when --
-- noxious gas escapes
Everyone covers their mouth and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl
Then roaches
hundreds of roaches
Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at their hair and clothing
Jesse rolls around on the ground
Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his shirt, and calmly eats it
: - Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave, holding the light and a can of bug spray
Their hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps
Duct tape around the cuffs of their pants
They aren't taking anymore chances with bugs
Jesse and Erwin open the casket
Everyone recoils at the stench
Then they shine their lights inside -- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey mask
: The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming the lid closed
Everyone piles into the car, exhausted
In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror
Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie
Look
the boogerman
(laughs) Get it
Stormie slaps his hand away
Get back, you nasty-ass bastard
Ug
thought  had seen the last of those when my brother graduated third grade
We just dug up a rotting corpse and you're worried about a little snot
Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball beside him
She purrs: 'm exhausted
wake me when we get back home
Uhhh
better not fall asleep -- we've still got a lot of work to do and Freddy's out there
waiting
This news sobers everyone up immediately
Well, that means we've all got to stay awake
Duh
know
We'll sing a song
(starts singing) Row
Row
Row your boat, gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream
Come on, everybody
Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into the night
: - Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly to herself as she drifts off to sleep: merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream
In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's breasts, sucking his thumb
Both are fast asleep
Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids drooping
The car starts to weave
-- we flash past Freddy holding a cardboard sign by the side of the road: Jesse shakes his head -- nah
He tries to concentrate on the road, his eyelids falling once more
Jesse's car zooms past a billboard
Behind the bill- board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking out of the driver's window
as Jesse's car passes in the back- ground, the red digits cascading up
Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind the wheel
The radar gun's display is reflected in his mirrored shades
It reads:
Shouldn't dream and drive
Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car -- it's Freddy's  -- big chrome pipes belching
'   as Jesse's eyelids close and his head nods forward, revealing the night- maremobile closing from behind fast
The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's car just an inch from the bumper
Freddy moves one of the dozen of levers on the dash
'   -- a small version of Freddy's glove
It extends out towards the back of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into the trunk lock and turning with a slight
The trunk lid opens
-- the plastic bags with Jason's remains are moving
Freddy works another level and the tiny glove slits each bag
The various pieces of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc
) crawl out of the bag
(continuing) Looks like the cat's out of the bag now
Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk
The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's car,  into the rear quarter panel
-- all four occupants of the car are jolted awake, startled
Meagan looks out her window and sees the nightmaremobile as it closes in again
It's Freddy
fly
Everyone screams
Freddy laughs as he falls back for another shot
Meagan sees the dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night- maremobile, staring out at her through the back window
small yellow sign reads:
Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly, the pieces of Jason ,  from behind the back seat
One hand crawls up the back of the front seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat
Jason's intestines out of the backseat,  and their way around Stormie and Erwin
One of Jason's boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards the gas peddle
The other boot is content to lay under the back window and kick Erwin in the head
As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face, she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between her legs
Meagan screams
Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches forward with the acceleration
The nightmaremobile into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it to swerve violently from side to side
Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever
as a panel opens up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, into Jesse's car with a flurry of
Inside, Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg, forward towards
'   as the saw blade  into it
The tire  and Jesse's car lurches off the road, veering into a tree line
-- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree, the  stuck on,
Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into overdrive,   and disappearing with an of  that wisps away in an instant
In the distance -- an old farmhouse
The lights go on inside
The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound
rear door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in embrace and not seriously hurt
Meagan staggers around to the driver's side and opens the door
Jesse is laying unconscious against the steering wheel
Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the  stops
Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess
(continuing) Jesse's hurt real bad
we've got to get him to a doctor
Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see the farmer on the phone
Don't worry
an ambulance is on the way
Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying: Oh, God
Jesse
Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it
Inside -- the garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside -- untouched
Erwin goes to Meagan and says: Meagan
listen to me
The cops are on their way
If they find me and Jason Voorhees in the trunk there, we're finished
Go
get out of here
Take Jason and Stormie with you
'm staying with you
Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says: 'll call you at the hospital
How
Somehow
Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains into the night as   in the distance -- growing close
: - '  - Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a special tent
Meagan and Stormie watch from the doorway as a  checks Jesse's vitals
As he finishes, Meagan asks: Is he going to be okay
Yes
But he needs a lot of rest
His leg is broken in four places and he has four broken ribs and a concussion
Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand
Stormie turns to the doctor
Hey doc, is there someplace could get us something to eat
'm afraid the cafeteria is closed
There are some vending machines in the lobby
(to Meagan) 'll be back to check on him in a couple of hours
The doctor exits
'll be right back
'm goin' go score us some munchies
Meagan nods weakly
Stormie exits
Meagan lays her head on Jesse's hand
- Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse and Erwin
Stormie dashes for the staircase
- '  - Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep
Jesse's heart monitor
On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life
Freddy peeks out from behind the other side
He snickers and ducks back down
Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress
Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs onto the curtain
as the curtain pulls free of the rings
Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing away
Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing
She rises up again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires are pulled down after him
Meagan grabs a handful of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back
But the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the mattress
() - Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon
As she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running along the floor and out the door
Meagan follows them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks out into
() - Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge, and gunbelt
Meagan calls to him from the saloon door
Jesse
But Jesse can't hear her
He's too busy shaking with fear
staring at something coming down the street
It's Freddy
Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit
(ala John Wayne) Okay, Sheriff
This nightmare ain't big enough for the two of us
draw
Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol
He pulls it out and
Freddy laughs
Jesse again
Freddy just laughs
Jesse  again and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs and laughs
From the saloon, Meagan screams: Jesse
Wake up
Wake up
Freddy looks over at her, annoyed
Three's a crowd, bitch
Why don't you just go get [] - '  - The  of Jesse's heart monitor  erratically wakes Meagan with a start
She tries to wake Jesse
Jesse, wake up
() - Jesse keeps  at Freddy
until his gun empty
Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn gun you ever saw and says: Go ahead
make my dream
Freddy
: - '  - Jesse's stomach  with  -- splattering Meagan
Jesse's heart monitor  continuously -- flat line
Jesse is dead
shows up to answer the alarm
She sees Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood, and screams
Stormie enters the room a half-second later and gasps
Freddy killed Jesse
Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out of the room
-  - Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall, the screams of the nurse fading into the distance
Jesus
get a grip, lady
You'd think a nurse in a hospital would have seen a dead body before
Jesse
Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting off the elevator
They hear the nurse's screams and come running towards Jesse's room
Stormie pulls Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch and company go thundering past
Then a  on the
says: (filtered) Attention
Would Meagan or Stormie please pick up the white paging phone for a message
Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks
The announcement repeats itself again
Then again
Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up and picks up the white paging phone
(into phone) This is Stormie
Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's station again
Stormie turns her back to them but Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking: Did you see a couple of girls go by here a moment ago
Stormie gestures to the elevators
Just missed 'em
Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his men right behind
Stormie exhales a giant sigh of relief as the   says: (filtered) The message is from Erwin
he says to meet him at the side entrance in two minutes
Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the staircase
-  - Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck
He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan inside, climbing in after her and asking: Where'd you get the truck
Same place 've got Jason hid
And where's that
place where no one ever goes
Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck out of the parking lot
: - The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather- worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp, past the cabins, down towards the lake
He stops a short distance away from the pier and the three of them climb out
Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving platform tied up to the end
What'd you do -- take him for a swim
Almost
Erwin jumps down on the diving platform
In the center, a large form is covered by a tarp
Erwin helps Stormie down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the pier
She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant
Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan, asks: (continuing) Is she going to be alright
don't know
She's pretty fucked up
God,  don't know why 'm not
You're a strong woman
What's that supposed to mean
Uhhh
nothing
didn't mean anything
Stormie gestures to the tarp
Is this him
Yeah
(whips back tarp) Meet the new and improved Jason
laying spread eagle on the diving platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of coiled leads trailing off into the water
Erwin has done a good job of sewing Jason back together with barbed wire and fishing line
His arms and legs have been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with bailing wire
Jason looks nineties
and butch
Why'd you put that stupid mask on him
Take a look
Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask and quickly replaces it
Good idea
Not exactly a beauty queen entry, is he
So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy Osbourne song backwards or something
'm afraid it's not that simple
thought you said you knew how to bring him back to life
do
But when  was putting him back together,  noticed something was missing
Stormie thinks about this for a second, then: Awwww, he won't be needing that
mean, what girl would let him put his rotten ol'
(cuts her off) No-no
Not that
It's his heart
it's missing
Well
does it really matter
Can't you use an aquarium pump or something
No
he has to have a heart human heart
good one
Meagan speaks for the first time: know where we can get a heart
good one
: -   - sign reads:
Through the front window a  can be seen sitting at the reception desk
Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up, parked a safe distance away
That guard in there might pose a problem
Do you think you and Stormie could keep him occupied for a few minutes
Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why not
(continuing) Okay
let's do it
few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick- up swerves wildly into the parking lot
He gets up and goes to the glass door, peering out
as Stormie and Erwin start making out -- hot and heavy
- Meagan  a small window near the ceiling
She crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops to the floor
She shines her flashlight around the dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars full of organs, etc
Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens one of the drawers and shines her light inside -- ug
Wrong guy
She opens the next drawer -- ick
Even worse
Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse
Her lip starts to quiver as she caresses his face
-   - At the glass door, the guard is watching the action in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window
He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a better look
Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around
Hey
Watch that
'm just trying to make it look real
Just keep your hands above the bra, pizza face
The windows are starting to steam up
- Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber gloves
Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru- ments (saws, rib cutters, etc
) and selects a large knife
Meagan stands over Jesse's body
She pulls back the sheet, exposing his chest
Meagan raises the knife far above her head
Forgive me, Jesse
Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a sickening
-   - The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged, obscuring the guard's view
He licks his lips, deciding to investigate closer
The guard unlocks the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin
They spot him coming and break their embrace
In another moment, the pick-up is  out of the parking lot
The guard watches the truck go, shakes his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds
Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards the morgue
He's head right for her
Do some- thing
Erwin panics for a moment, then  the
- Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle fiber keeps pulling it back
She jumps at the , then starts pulling harder
In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the and stops
He starts back for the front, when suddenly the  stops
Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling to Jesse's heart
As the last strand goes, Meagan tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud
The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue, drawing his gun
He tip-toes to the door and carefully unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock
Taking a two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot and kicks the door
-- the door flies open and the guard leaps inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights
He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room
One of the drawers is open
the stiff's chest has got a huge hole in it
blood spattered everywhere
a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the cabinet
Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window and cries: Stop right there
Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard
The unbroken section of the window
The guard curses and races for the
- The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan close the passenger door and the truck  away
He shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now
The guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds that the door has closed and locked behind him
: - The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the cemetery
' They said they were writin' for some newspaper
Teenagers are notorious liars
' Well, after  heard about the accident on my police scanner, came up here to have a look
When found it  figured you'd want to know right away
You did the right thing
The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty grave
' Damn kids
just knew they were comin' up here to do somethin' stupid
The
commander comes up to Murdoch
Just got a call on the radio -- three juveniles just broke into the morgue -- one male, two female
The guard is pretty sure the male is in the Freddy cult -- burnt face
' Sounds like the same kids  saw
Did the guard say what they took
Yeah
that murdered kid, Jesse -- they carved his heart out
(beat) They got away in a pick-up -- the guard didn't get the license
You want me to put out an
No
that won't be necessary know just where they're going, and just what they're up to
And this time
'll be ready
: - Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using dental floss
Stormie comes up behind her and puts her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside her and says: You've got to quit blaming your- self for what happened to Jesse
it wasn't your fault
He didn't want to come with us
but he did anyway
He did it for me
'm not sorry  came
don't think Jesse would be, either
just can't believe he's dead keep thinking he'll show up any minute
Well, that just about does it
Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto the pier, cutting the diving platform free
He kicks it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free
Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading them over to where a short trench has been dug leading from the water's edge
In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power cable
(continuing) As you can see, 've excavated the power cable that runs across the bottom of Crystal Lake
've cut away the insulation, exposing a patch of cable right near the water's edge
Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it at the head of the trench
(continuing) Now when  kick this over, the water will wash down the trench and bridge an eletrical gap between the cable and the lake
There's plenty of voltage, so it should work
So you kick the bucket and Jason lives
Yeah, right
(then) Okay, keep your fingers crossed
Erwin kicks the bucket over
The water washes down the trench, over the cable, and --
---
huge
Then the lake begins to glow and the water begins to churn
Erwin and the girls jump back as   from the lake, engulfing the diving platform
The  of  leap from the chicken wire onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing
as we   -- the electricity spirals down into the eye hole like water running down a drain
'  as it opens
We dive into the eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to
: - 1953 - (1950's version of a hockey mask) reflected in the water
young hand reaches up and pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy beneath
This is  --  9
'  comes to the doorway of their run- down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of rye
He bellows: ' Jason
Git your ass over here
Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly several paces away
' (continuing) What did  teach you, boy
Don't ever take your mask off out in public
don't want nobody to see that ugly mug of yours
Jason stands, looking at his bare feet
His father smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the woodshed
' (continuing) Go git in the woodshed
Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he knows what's coming next
' (continuing) Drop them overalls and lay over them logs
Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt
Suddenly, '  is just outside the doorway, calling: ' Jason
Come here
Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries towards his mother
' What are you doing woman
Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with dollars and change
' saved up some money
want you to take and go on up to that summer camp just up the road
Tell the man you want to stay there
' Just what the hell do you think you're doing, bitch
' 'm sending him away for a few weeks
' You ain't sending him nowhere
(to Jason) Bring me that money, boy
Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to obey, when his mother shoos him away
' Go on now
go
Jason takes off up the road
His father sneers: ' Goin' ag'in me
'll take you to the shed, woman
Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron
' You ain't ever taking anyone to the shed ever again
Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him back into the shed with the knife
Jason looks back
Through the open window he sees his mother's arm coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's arms flailing helplessly
Then both disappear from view
After a moment his mother appears in the door- way, spattered with blood
She smiles and waves to him, calling: ' (continuing) Go on, son
have a good time
Mommy will come and git you some day soon
Jason turns and runs to
- 1953 - Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance to the camp with his jar of money
In the office, the   takes his money and shakes his hand
Welcome aboard, son
'm sure you'll have a great time
: The other  dance around Jason, taunting him
laughing at him
pointing and teasing
Jason breaks away, running towards the pier
Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own reflection
He removes the mask and watches as the distortions in the water make his face look normal
Someone comes up behind Jason slowly
Jason isn't aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection appears behind his own
Jason turns to see who when he is suddenly pushed into the lake
Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to stay afloat
hand pushes his head back under the water
'
-- a distorted image of whoever is holding him under
Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to the surface
fighting just to see who is killing him before he dies
: - Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock, the electricity all over him like a spider web
On shore, Erwin and the girls gasp
Holy shit
It worked
Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly
But something is wrong
Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire
It's kill him
Shut it off
Shut it off
Shut it off
it suddenly occurs to me that  hadn't really planned for that contingency
Just don't stand there
Do something
But all Erwin can do is scratch his head
Meagan rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake: Jason
You've got to get up
Do you hear me
Get up
Jason clenches his meaty fists and  them down against the diving dock
it to bits
Water rushes over him and --
-
power transformer on shore , causing Meagan and her friends to cringe
When they look back, the electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but smoke and floating debris
Meagan and Stormie turn to Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says: Well
it's off now
Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would shrink any man to pus
much less Erwin
He cowers between them, offering quick excuses and humble apologies
All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from the lake
Then they do see him
scream and run
Jason charges after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer" gait
Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie dash past
He closes the door behind him and squirms out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door and steps inside
Erwin races around to the front and closes the door
He fastens the latch and padlock, then calls to the girls: (continuing) Hey
Come back
've got him locked up in the tool shed
Just then, the  of a  as the blade through the tool shed door
Erwin screams like a girl and runs away
- Meagan and Stormie run into the main room
Stormie spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically
Who are you calling
The cops
Who else
Are you kidding
They'll lock us up and throw away the key
Fine by me
(clicks the receiver) Damnit
It's dead
Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming the door shut behind him
He's right behind me
Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough, Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw
(to Erwin) You're the one who brought him back to life
And
Well, do something
Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside
Stormie clucks: (continuing) Oh, some hero
Just then, the chainsaw  through the front door
Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the closet, closing themselves inside
They cower in the closet, listening
for a long moment
nothing but the sound of their heavy breathing
Then, with the  of , Jason chainsaws the closet door -- knocking it to the floor
Erwin draws out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger
Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands up in front of him and yells: To everyone's shock
Jason does
(continuing) Now
just stop
We're the ones that brought you back to life
And you have no right to kill us with that chainsaw
In fact
you owe us
That's right
She gave you her boyfriend's heart, you know
That's right
Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup
(continuing) Look
Here's his picture
Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and opens the locket
She shows Jason the photo of Jesse inside
Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of Jesse with a meaty finger
(continuing) Now,  know that you've been through a lot
And  know that you're pissed off about being murdered and all
(interjects) know  would be
But if you help us kill Freddy Krueger
promise to help you find the little bastard that killed you
What do you say
Have we got a deal
Meagan sticks out her hand to shake
Jason stares at it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan
Finally, he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when
Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the windows, freezing everyone to the spot
Anxious to get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across the floor and peeks out over the window sill
-- a dozen police cars shine their lights towards the cabin, two dozen  aim their weapons
In the middle of this impressive show of force is Murdoch
He raises a bullhorn to his lips
(through bullhorn) You in there
This is Captain Renton Murdoch -- State Trooper
am ordering you to come out with your hands up
'll give you until the count of three
(beat) Three
Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the closet
(whispering) Jason, you have to hide
Stay in here and don't come out until we tell you
Stormie
help me
Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet, closing the door
Then they quickly smooth down their hair and clothes, moving towards the door
- Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands raised high above their heads
As they walk towards the police cars, several of the
team moves in and arrests them
As they are handcuffed and searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again: (through bullhorn) Alright
anybody else left in there had better say their prayers
There's no one else inside
Is that a fact
(into bullhorn) Okay
you had your chance
Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin and shouts: Hey, look
All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's massive frame is filling the doorway
Holy Mary, mother of God
would you look at the size of that guy
(almost happy) knew it
All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get behind him
(continuing) Stand back
'll handle this
Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers: (continuing) You
Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too
Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out a pistol, he holds a laser designator
Murdoch fires
big red dot appears on Jason's chest
Jason looks down at it like it was a harmless bug
He looks back up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says: (continuing; into radio) Let her go
60,000     - military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a laser-guided napalm bomb
- slight  sound grows in the skies above Camp Crystal Lake
Jason looks up
as it drops down on Jason -- homing in on the laser dot on his chest
-
-- Camp Crystal Lake  in flames
All the cops take cover as    on them
Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched as he embraces the terrible sight
That'll teach you to fuck with the law, Voorhees
cop behind him says: Uhh, sir
your hat's on fire
Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat is burning above the brim
Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone
Then a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie
Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange worrisome looks through the windows just before the cars pull away
As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices something moving amidst the flames -- a large form, walking towards the lake
As it stumbles out onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says: Hey
do you see that
But just then, the form falls through the pier,  into the water below
The partner looks, sees nothing, and shrugs
See what
thought  saw something
He shrugs it off and exits after his partner
Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the sight one last time before climbing into his patrol car and driving away
: -  - cell door  in front of Stormie's face
cell door  in front of Meagan's face
Both girls are behind bars, separated by a cement wall
The hefty female  in charge of the cellblock goes back to her desk
Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother, watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and begins to devour three combo-burritos
We've got to try and stay awake
Getting something to eat might help
(calls to Deputy) Yo, Butch
It's Deputy Miller
Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could we have something to eat
thought you psychos only ate human hearts
And  thought you pigs only ate donuts
Don't make me come back there
(low; to Meagan) Cow
hope she chokes on her three combo-burrito cud
Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to the floor in defeat
What am  going to do
'll never be able to find Lizzy now
You should be worrying about your- self
know  am
Stormie plops down on her cot
bet you're sorry you came with me now
Nah
what are best friends for
Afterall, you stuck by me through all my crazy phases,  figure owe you one big crazy phase, right
That's for being my best friend, Stormie
Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's cell, unlocking it
Come on, Meagan
Where are we going
Your parents are here
: -  - Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock, where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch
Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan
' Oh, Meagan
are you alright
Let me look at you
'm okay, mom
' Your mother's been worried sick, Meagan
So have
Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes bloody and soiled
Sorry
Today has been a bitch
- The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that passes behind her
The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by a slight
Freddy's glove materializes, raking the knives along the metal cross bars
Freddy stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside
Stormie is fast asleep
Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through the bars
Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy, jumps to her feet and screams
Help
Help
Freddy's here
He's here
But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and licking her meaty fingers clean
Freddy puts his forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie, pointing to her cot
Stormie looks over and sees her- self asleep
(continuing) Oh, shit
'm still asleep
She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says: You know what they say
when you sleep -- you die
Freddy flashes the glove of knives
- ' Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said you helped one of those cultists escape from a hospital
mental hospital
' And he said you desecrated a cemetery and some other really terrible things
Tell me you had nothing to do with it
Tell me there's some mistake
There's no mistake
(to Murdoch) What did you do with Erwin
Your boyfriend is headed back to the looney bin where he belongs
But don't worry, you'll be seeing him soon enough
at the arraignment
- Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime
Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool
You don't scare me, Freddy
Thanks to my various phases and many hours of watching violent televison, have become immune to violence
Seen it all and done it all
Nothing you do can gross me out -- so why don't you give it your best shot, bitch
Then maybe 'll just  to the chase
Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her defensive stance
'm warning you, Freddy
my father is a drill sergeant in the Marine Corps and he taught me just how to defend myself against slimy bastards like you
Oh 'm so scared, honey
Come on
Hit me
Punch me right in the nose
dare you
Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to take a punch
Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy right in the nose
(continuing; surprised) Owwwww
Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her fist is stuck in Freddy's nose
Freddy takes in a breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow
She screams
Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right up his nose, her screams turning into a faint
Freddy smiles
(continuing) Now that's what  call getting a buzz
'   - Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs
Stuck in those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk -- boogers
Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the distorted voice of Harry Manfredini): Hi there
'm the Boogerman
Heh- heh
get it
Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying to put distance between herself and Boogerman
(continuing) Aww, don't go
we can play "Star Wars"
You can be Princess Leia and 'll be Jabba the Hutt
Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba
Stormie screams again
- Meagan is getting more and more agitated
We're wasting time
We've got to close down all the churches -- Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy ground
Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused, frightened looks
(continuing) Don't you understand
He has to come to our reality to do it
It's our last chance to kill him
Okay,  think we've heard enough of this crap
Take her back to the lockup
couple of  grab Meagan
She throws them off and they grab her again, roughly
Meagan's parents watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming
Dad
Mom
Don't let them lock me up
have to save Lizzy
' Oh, Meagan
you're sick
You don't even realize what you've done
did what  had to do to try and save Lizzy
Yeah, including murdering your boy- friend and cutting his heart out
Liar
Freddy killed Jesse
He was already dead when  cut his heart out
Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror
(continuing; manic) Goddamnit, you don't understand
Freddy lives
Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into the cellblock
Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside
know how you must feel
had a dog once
loved that dog treated her like my own daughter
We went camping, picnics in the park
even had a little stocking for her nailed up on the mantle for Christmas
Then one day, she bit me
so  had to blow her brains out
(sighs) God,  loved that dog
'  &   - Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger knife
giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics
Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose again -- gotta go
Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the nostril cavern
Stormie watches the massive knife blade as it comes right for her, then at the last possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman
She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing ahead
(continuing) Well, excuse me
-- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into his head
The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his front
Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is pulled out, kicking and screaming
Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end
He twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger- man across the cell
Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack- ing into the far wall with a giant
Boogerman flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo, his nasty head still alive in the center
Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to the deputy's desk
He feels around on the table until he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into Stormie's cell
Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she clings to life deep inside the nostril
Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling up -- the beginnings of a sneeze
Ahhh
ahhh
ahhh--
Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose with globules of snot
She flies across the massive cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman, screaming her head off
Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he screams too
: -  - As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they hear a loud
Stormie
The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's cell
then promptly puking combo burrito
Meagan runs up and looks
The wall to Stormie's cell is splattered with blood and bits
Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more come running into the cellblock, answering the deputy's puke-choked scream
(continuing) Oh, God
what have  done
What have  done
We   of this chaos and go to
- An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency lights flashing
In back Erwin lays strapped to a gurney
Up front sit a  and an
They chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead
The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up with a terrible
-- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking it some fifty feet down the road
The driver and the attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock
Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says: 'll go check it out
You stay here
The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the road
He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in the face
He falls to the ground, unconscious
The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights -- it's Jason
Burnt and blackened but ready for action
He starts towards the ambulance
The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver, emptying into Jason's chest
Jason recoils only slightly as    his coveralls, then he grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty pistol in panic
Jason slams the attendant's face into the side of the ambulance
In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with a sickening  of  and
Then
silence
-- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his weight
He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his eyes
waiting for the inevitable
Then
nothing
After a second, Erwin opens an eye
Jason is standing over him, hand outstretched
In his big, burnt palm -- Meagan's necklace
Erwin looks from the necklace to Jason
Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently
You
want me to tell you where Meagan is
Again with the thrusting
(continuing) Well why didn't you say so
Jesus, for a minute there  thought you were going to kill me
(then) You're not, are you
Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time
(continuing) Okay
okay
'll take you right to her
Could you help me out of this
Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps
Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close behind
Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying: (continuing) 'll drive
Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into the passenger side door
(continuing) Okay
you drive
As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a  goes off as a female   in a pleasant tone says: Fasten your safety belt, please
Erwin fastens his
Jason watches him and pulls the safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach
Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts
The  goes crazy
(continuing) Fasten your safety belt, please
Fasten your safety belt, please
Jason  the dashboard with his fist, silencing the voice and chime
He turns suddenly to Erwin as if to say, "Yeah
What about it
"  Erwin shrugs nervously: Fuck the bitch
Let's roll
With tires , burning rubber and smoke, the ambulance roars away into the early morning
: -  - Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun as it peeks out over the horizon
The deputy gets up to leave for the six a
m
shift change
As she goes, she switches on the cellblock
-- An early morning religious program is on
(filtered) This is Channel 12 -- Station
-- where the "" stands for "Worship" And now
"Daily Affirmation" with Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy
shot of the   at the podium in his studio, giving kind words of encouragement
Good morning, friends
the Good Book says that each morning brings a new light into our lives
The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be answered, etc
Meagan turns and watches the sunrise -- glorious
Tears stream down her cheeks
Then a commercial comes on: (filtered) You can own a videotape of Reverend Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only $19
95
: - In his booth at the main gate, the   watches as a procession of hearses approaches
As the first hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says: Hello
What can  do for you
cultist sticks his head out the window and says: We're here to see the Reverend Lovejoy
We need him to perform a wedding
Do you have an appointment
No
have a Beretta
The cultist produces a pistol --
- The   is at his podium, his  at the organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over
The   counts down -- three
two
one
-- the cultists burst into the studio
The and   are killed
The Reverend Lovejoy and his , at the organ, are taken hostage
-  - as the cultists take the reverend and his wife hostage
Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed
- The cultists break into the control room, killing the and
One slips into the sound booth, garroting the   with a piece of wire
Another  the control board, killing the signal
All the feed monitors go snowy
- as the picture goes to static
Just then, the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell
Something just happened at the station
Don't worry about it -- get undressed
What for
Time to get you cleaned up for court
Meagan looks back at the  as she slowly starts to get undressed
-  - The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers
Inside, a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed skin, and greasy hair
They eye Meagan like the dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite side, sneaking into a corner
Meagan turns on the shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and catcall
Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan to the mercy of the bitches
The head bitch slides over to Meagan and says: What's the matter, honey
you don't like our company
like you
sure
It's just that usually shower alone, that's all
Oh
So you're shy
like 'em when they're shy
The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists
But this bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists as she tries to kiss her
The other bitches laugh
(continuing) Don't fight it, baby
You know you want me
Meagan scratches the head bitch's face
She backs off screaming, wiping blood from her face
Then she spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and produces a shiv
(continuing) If you won't give me a piece then 'll just cut one for myself
The head bitch moves in
Meagan takes a cautious step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go
She holds up her hands
Wait a second
didn't mean to do that
'm sorry
It's just that you come on a little strong, that's all
Just give me a little time to adjust to my new surroundings
The head bitch stops, curious
Are you saying you want me now
Yes
want you
Prove it
Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms
In a flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular -- a warning
Meagan carefully puts her arm around the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth
After a long, uncomfortable moment, they break
The head bitch smiles
(continuing) Now that's more like it
(to the others) Hey, this bitch is alright
The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight
(continuing) You're okay, honey
what's your name
Meagan
So
what're you in for, Meagan
(sniffles a little) Oh, my friend
The bitch that died last night
(starts to cry) Yeah
they said she had some disease that made her
explode
Oh, God
Please hold me
The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs, smoothing her hair
The other bitches share a look of concern as one asks: #1 What's this bullshit about some killer funk make you explode
(to Meagan) Easy
honey
It's goin' be alright
But what  asked you is why you're in here
Oh
well
the cops
Well, they think  gave it to her
The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan were Satan himself
She runs for the other bitches but they aren't having anything to do with her
All the bitches race for the exit
The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and shouts: What the hell is all the screaming about
-- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys from her belt
They unlock the cellblock door and go running into the police station, screaming butt-naked
After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and drags the unconscious deputy into the shower
- The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming through the station
Several deputies chase after them, tackle them and try to cuff them
brawl ensues
Chaos
Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report
He looks up at the madness and mutters: Punks
-  - enters the showers and sees a naked woman on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle
The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the head with her baton and she falls to the side, revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's uniform -- laying on the shower floor
The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to her knees, screaming and clutching her face
Meagan leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit
On her way out, Meagan is passed by several charging into the showers to restore order
She gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit to freedom
- Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls up
She reaches in and grabs the  , pulling him out
Then she slips behind the wheel and  off
The junior trooper calls after her: Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car
: - The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously shakes his head, saying: won't do it
It's a sin
Blasphemy
One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs
Lovejoy's head
Wedding or funeral
your choice
The reverend swallows and says: And who would be the bride
Lizzy is brought forth
The cultists take her arm and inject her with the dream dope
Lizzy's head lulls around as she chants softly: One
two
Freddy's coming for you
The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the needle from one to another
(continuing) Three
four
Better lock your door
The good reverend watches this with a lump in his throat
He shudders and asks: And the groom
He's coming
Lizzy is almost asleep
Five
six
grab your crucifix
The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker
Then with a sharp  of electricity, the cross falls over, turning upside down
It hangs there for an instant then --
-- the cross , catching the curtains on
As the  consume the curtains, a hole in reality appears -- a Dreamgate
Freddy comes springing out, leaping in front of the podium
He laughs and turns to Lizzy, asleep on the bench
That's for the lift sister
(to the cultists) Hiya, kids
(in unison) Hiya, Freddy
Ready to get hitched
Ready, Freddy
Then let's do it
Lizzy looks up and smiles
love you, Freddy
: - comes up to Murdoch and says: We found your patrol car, Captain
It was abandoned near a local religious station
Religious station
Is there a padre there
Yes, sir
Reverend Lovejoy broad- casts out of that location
So that's where they're hiding
: - Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy
and if there be anyone among you who has any reason why these two should not be joined in holy
Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah"
(continuing) in matrimony
Let them speak now
(under his breath) please God
(aloud) or forever hold their peace
-- Meagan bursts in
Stop
Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit
(continuing; to Freddy) Take me, Freddy
Take me instead
You're a virgin
Oh, that's right -- tell everybody
Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm
Mmmmmmm
Yes, you are a bit juicier than your retard sister
okay, you've got the job
(to cultists) Get her ready
- Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to the fence
Murdoch and the
commander get out of the lead car
Murdoch picks up his bullhorn and says: (through bullhorn) This is Captain Renton Murdoch -- State Trooper
'm giving you until the count of three to come out with your hands up
a shot at Murdoch, the bullet hit  the emergency lights atop his car
The other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns calmly to the
commander and says: (continuing) Hand me that flare pistol
The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding: Good idea
Throw a little light on them -- see if we can spot their firing positions
As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol carefully and
-- the flare streaks to the roof of the  station,  the sniper
He  into  and tumbles to the ground, screaming
Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying: (through bullhorn) Alright, now 'm through playing "nice guy" --  want the rest of you punks to come out right now with your hands up
The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead --    the cop cars,  glass and  metal
The cops  back, all along the sides of the  station
- The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with dream dope
She takes her place at the threshold beside Freddy
- As the battle outside between the cultists and the cops , Murdoch and the
commander squat down behind a fender to reload
Well, it doesn't look like they're going to surrender
What we're going to need then is somebody to charge their lines -- make a hole for us to slip in
Where are you going to find anyone that crazy
Just then, an ambulance comes  through the police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice
Here comes one now
(yells) ',
Murdoch squints to see who's driving
it's Jason
Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger side window as the ambulance zooms past
Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and  after the ambulance
The other  join in a moment later, off the back of the ambulance as it through the front gate
Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at the cops, then he turns to Jason and says: That was easy enough
Erwin looks ahead and screams
as three cultists stand directly in front of the speeding ambulance, machine guns
The glass  just as Erwin ducks down
Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the ambulance into the middle one just before plowing into the side of the station with a
Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a cultist closing in with a gun
He reaches through the smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's machine gun laying on the hood
Erwin turns, the cultist just in time
As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is greeted by two cultists  at him
Jason the driver's side door and hurls it at the two punks, knocking them down like bowling pins
Then Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts towards the front door
- The wedding proceeds
Once again
if there be anyone among you who does not want these two people to be joined
let him speak now or forever hold his peace
Meagan looks around
no one says anything
The reverend clears his throat to continue when
-- the studio door flies open and Jason appears in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life
Uh, oh
The cultists attack Jason
Jason grabs the first one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like a rag doll
Another attacks with a machete
bad idea
One more cultist down and now Jason owns the machete
Jason finishes off the last two cultists as Erwin barricades the studio door
The cultists on the other side start
Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete, slicing through a camera cable
as it falls to the floor
Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it behind him
Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy
He tries to wake them but can't
As Jason lumbers over, Erwin looks up and says: can't wake them up
Freddy's got them trapped
Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a couple of dead cultists
He takes their syringes
Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full of dream dope
(continuing) Go get him, boy
Jason staggers forward, falling into
- Jason falls into a boxing arena
The ropes are entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human head
The spectators are all , , and the
Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy
Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing boxing gloves
steps into the ring
(into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the fight of the century
'm your ring announcer
Ted Bundy
-- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead, his brains out the back
He falls over and the crowd cheers
Ted sits up and pulls the wig back over his shaved head and electric burns as he calls into the balcony: (continuing) Verrrrrry funny, Oswald
--  stands, his rifle still smoking
(angry; defensive) It wasn't me
Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro: In my left corner, weighing in at only ninety seven pounds
the nightmare master himself
The one
The only
Freddddddddy Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr
Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild
(continuing) And on my right
weighing in at a whopping four hundred and thir- teen pounds
that killer of countless teenagers
the big guy
(gestures to Jason) Jason Voorhees
and
(continuing) And the prize tonight
not one but -- count 'em --  virgins
ripe for the picking
Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena
Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother
(continuing) Hey, have one now and save the other for the ride home
That's what  did
from the crowd
Kick his ass, Jason
-- the bell sounds
The first round begins
Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a blow when -- -
-- knife blades jut out of the glove
He punches Jason in the stomach and starts him open, rotten guts spilling out
Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an axe in her head
This is
Jason reaches over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of her head
Bloody Mary whips around, yelling: Jason swings with the axe -- -
-- Jason Freddy's arm
The crowd
Freddy looks down at the open armpit,  with  , and shrugs: Oh, well
just axed for that
Freddy  a new arm, complete with glove of knives
Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it
The axe flies into the audience,   square between the eyes
He falls back to the floor turns to   and says disdainfully: Peasants
The bell sounds
Freddy and Jason break, going into their respective corners
As Jason sits down in his corner, the   mounted on his corner post starts in: That's it, kiddo
You're really giving it to him out there
Use the left more -- jab
Make him hurt
That's the ticket to a knockout
Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy
- Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists  down the studio door
- The bell sounds again and round two begins
Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on each other
Jason swings wide
Freddy ducks under Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for a close look
-- Jason knocks the ref's head , it goes flying up into the balcony
The crowd Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an opening
Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's decapitated body as several   drag him out of the ring,  his body apart and  it
Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with disgust
Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him high above his head
Then Jason body slams Freddy to the mat
The crowd
Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back
Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty can of spinach
In a grotesque parody of Popeye he opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots -- and gulps it down
Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his chest and arms
At the end of his right hand -- a heavy metal boxing glove
Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the massive glove for a blow
-- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal glove
Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes
He bounces off and falls to the mat
The fans go nuts
As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning into a giant mallet
Jason looks up just in time to see the mallet coming down
-- Freddy drives Jason into the mat
The crowd goes wild
>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream: Jason
Get up
Get up
-- it's a dark, foreboding (under- water) abyss
Jason's legs kick, trying to get back up
Something slithers up from out of the deep
wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots
Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down
Jason struggles but keeps slipping
This looks like the end of Jason
Freddy laughs
(continuing) Jason
You've got to get up
'
of Freddy looking down at him, pushing him down
drowning him
: - 1953 - as he is being drowned
He fights to get to the surface
to see
who it is
Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and his killer comes into sharp focus
It's  ( 13)
His Camp Crystal Lake nametag reads:  Hi
My name is Freddy
He pushes the young Jason down again, laughing
: - Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the mat
laughing, when Jason snaps
With a burst of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the mat
Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes him up with him
Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the ceiling, where they  through to
- Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above the studio
light  and Freddy cries in pain
then realizes, he's been brought into the real world
Oh, shit
Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a boot and stomps Freddy's head,  it like a tomato
The Dream Demons squirt out
Just then, the cultists   the studio door
They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads suddenly
They fall screaming to the floor -- dead
-  - The remaining cultists  it out with the police suddenly grab their heads, screaming
Their heads  and they fall to the ground
Murdoch sees this and says to the
commander: Now's my chance
give me sixty seconds to get in there then move in
Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and running into the station
- Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance and embrace
Then Meagan looks up at Erwin
What took you so long
Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings
What ever you do
don't let this guy drive
Meagan smiles at Jason
knew you would come
Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is fast decaying
turning back into blackened bones, scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives
The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor, then swim into the open end of the camera cable and disappear
In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every monitor, laughing
Oh, no
Freddy's in the transmitter
Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races from the control room via a long thick cable running overhead
(continuing) He's going for the satellite dish
If he uplinks with a communications satellite he can beam himself any- where in the world
We'll never be rid of him
Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots past them, going through the ceiling to the
-  - The satellite dish mounted on the roof
It begins to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting ready to beam Freddy
- Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it hard
- The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky
'   - The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite tumbling into deep space
The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun
Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up and screams
His face burns away, leaving a screaming skull
That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons
One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun
as the beam , causing a solar prominence
-  - The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish
ton of dust billows up
Just then, Murdoch bursts in
He sees Lizzy and Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun
Erwin sees this and jumps in-between them, yelling: No
Wait
Murdoch
The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across the room, where he lands in a heap
Meagan and Lizzy run to his side
Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his chest
With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin out and pricks himself
Erwin smiles and dies
Erwin
Erwin
He's dead
and so are you if you don't put your hands up right now
Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch
He knocks her to the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun as he says: (continuing) It's time  taught you girls some respect for the law
In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen cultist and  it at Murdoch's head
-
-- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a , revealing his bald, hideous head -- a large open wound with a metal plate underneath
He turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face
(continuing) So
you wanna be a punk
Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan
(continuing) Then die like a punk
Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him
Jason jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble
We see Murdoch's name written into his shorts
As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat of his pants
Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth
Jason cocks the shotgun and
-- Murdoch's head and shoulders  from his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out of shirt
Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his metal plate comes  down, rolling around and spinning to a stop like a hubcap
Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the floor just as the
commander and his men come charging in
They see Jason and raise their guns in panic
Too late
The cops let loose with a  of - on Jason's chest
Meagan grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets past
More cops hear the  and come running
They start  too
Soon the doorway to the studio is crowded with muzzle flash
More and more    Jason
bullet hole outline appears on the wall behind him
The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes up, "More ammo
More ammo
"
cops going for hideout pistols, opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans, passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the cops in the studio
Jason keeps getting
Pieces of his are flying off
Fingers shot off of a hand
knee shot away to reveal the bone
Dozens of   going off of his chest and head
Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo
The subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of gunsmoke in the room
As it clears, Jason still stands
He teeters a little, then falls backwards with a mighty
Jason lays dying
Meagan rushes to his side
Jason reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and pulls something out -- Jesse's heart
Jason hands the heart to Meagan
Then Jason's head rolls back -- he's dead
Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio, revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch
: '  - Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed
She gives her the Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight
As Meagan turns out the light, Lizzy asks: You forgot to check under the bed
Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed -- nada
No monsters here
But what if they come back
Then we'll just have to kick their ass again
Lizzy giggles
love you, Meagan
love you too
Go to sleep
'  - As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up to her from the bottom of the staircase
' Meagan
Meagan looks down at her parents
Yes, dad
' Your mom and
well, we want to thank you for saving your sister's life
we know you went through a lot
' We're going to be there for you from now on
for both of you
And that nice lawyer we hired for you said he thinks he can get all the charges dropped
except maybe for the grave robbing and human desecration ones
' Everything is going to be fine
know
' And 'm going to get sober
' We're going to be a normal, happy family again
know
' Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight mom
goodnight dad
' Goodnight, Meagan
'  - Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers, when the phone
She picks it up
Hello
(filtered) 'll be seeing you in your dreams
Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and licks Meagan in the face
She yelps and slams the phone down
(sighs) know
Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it
She climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy
She smiles and puts the pistol back under the pillow
: The phone
: Then
at the very end
: - Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made when they went back to reality
waiting
Finally, somebody says: don't think they're coming back
Okay, folks
show's over
Every- body can go home now
All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit
: now it's over
