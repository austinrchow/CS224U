sprawling industrial facility that makes most of what America eats
Grain elevators, cooling towers, processing plants, loading docks and a six story concrete bunker of an office building
He parks his car in a monogrammed space

He has a kind word for everyone
Smile flashing like a casino sign
He sees his pal Kirk Schmidt from accounting
Hey there, howdy
Hey, Kirk, we got to get out and hit some balls

Guten Tag
Whitacre scans the room full of busy co-workers
His secretary,  , 35, wears earrings that are made of gold

We adjusted the dextrose again, but the vrus keeps showing up-Thought we had it surrounded this time
We're starting a new set of cultures
We'll Vet it
We just gotta stay after it
The things eat sugar and that's what we're giving them-- a warm place filled with sugar
They walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak
Each flask is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered to by a

Takes less muscles than frowning
Whitacre closes the door on the very loud room

( ) don't give a shit about the Japanese
You just gotta get the Goddamn lysine bugs to eat the dextrose and shit us out some money
We're still having problems with this virus
don't want to hear about the damn virus anymore
Terry, what are we losing a month
We're off like seven million per

That's why the Indians ate it with beans or lime
You feed a chicken corn and it gets sick
Yo feed it corn and lysine and it goes from egg to supermarket fryer in six months instead of eight
Whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken, and then at his wife
She has gotten dressed up for dinner
She looks pretty
(
) Breasts and thighs in six months
You look great
They got the first wall of the stables up today
You see that
They're doing this thing in hydroponics where they're feeding lysine to jumbo shrimp
Imagine you're a sh rimp and one day some corn goes floating by, what do you think about that
Alexander smiles

His secretary,  , buzzes him on the intercom
r-- Yeah
(on the intercom) There's a call,  can't pronounce his name, he said he works for Ajinomoto Corporation
Whitacre picks up
Mark Whitacre
(
) Hello, Dr
Whitacre
My name is Fujiwara from Ajinomoto Corp want to discuss with you lysine if you have a moment

Marty Blocker used to sell us Charm's Blow Pops for three cents, which was a great deal cuz at Valley Drug they cost a nickel
He said his Dad worked for Charms-- said he invented the Blow Pop and got a special deal-- like a life time supply
Then they opened his locker
cuz of all the ants
In a line
His Dad worked for the post office, he came down to the school in his uniform
Nothing ever happened to Marty-- just ants
He blew off part of his thumb on the 4th of July with an -80
9   '  -  9 At 6:30 the next morning Whitacre walks across the trading floor and straight into Mick Andreas' office looking flustered
Mick you're not going to believe what the hell's happened
think know the reason why we've been having all these problems at the plant
Well, 've only been asking you to come up with one for the past eight weeks
'm all ears
Whitacre paces
His story comes out in a rush of words
Andreas listens silently
It's not start-up problems like we thought
It's the Japanese
This guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto, he's been calling me-- sometimes at work, sometimes at home cuz of the time difference-- you met him, he was here a couple of weeks ago
() Draft: 1/15/03 9
(') Well last night he calls me at home just after 8, and Mick, he knew everything
He says to me, `You remember the total nightmare you had during May, June and July
' And before  can ask him what he means he says, `Those months when was losing about seven million dollars a month in the lysine business
' Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the company should know that
Andreas is still stone faced
couldn't believe it
But, Mick before  can even ask him how he got those numbers, he starts making little comments about us having microbe problems
Jokes, like he's toying with me
Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high
And then he tells me that one of our highest paid employees is actually an employee of Ajinomoto and is sabotaging the plant
They're injecting some kind of virus into the dextrose and contaminating the whole deal
That's the problem
'll tell you Mick, it's like Rising Sun, that Crichton book, it's just like it
Fujiwara even said that his boss, Ikeda, would have him killed if he knew he was calling
So  asked him why he was talking to me and he said-- he said-- he wants 10 million dollars
10 million and he'll tell us who the saboteur is and give us a new lysine bug that's immune to the virus
We could be up and running in three days
Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then
How well do you know this guy
Uh, um, well  met him a few weeks ago when he came over
And then, he called a couple of times
So, not very well
Draft: 1/15/03 10
Very well
No,  can't really say that
Andreas ponders the situation
Okay, if you hear from him again-- talk him down on the price
want you to find out the least amount of money he'd settle for
If we can get a bug that's resistant to the virus, it might be worth it
But, want you to keep this quiet, if there is a mole, we don't want him to know we're onto him

People would come from all over Southern Illinois and probably Missouri, too
Famous name brand labels and appliances at savings of up to fifty per cent every day
Maybe a food court with a Mexican place
After the stables, maybe a tennis court or a little pitch and putt by the pool-- that adds to resale value like nobody's business
Whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street light
(
) The birds eat the bugs, the cars eat the birds, the rust eats the cars and the new construction eats the rust
Ginger interrupts Whitacre's grand plan from across the street

That's what you told me to do and was doing it
We're not gonna sit back and let the Japs fuck us sideways

Of course he's in
If we got a mole then it's a security issue
'll be sitting in with the
But,  already told you guys everything  know
What's the point
Cheviron is annoyed by Whitacre's histrionics
We don't like the idea of talking to the  anymore than you do
Look, they're just going to tape the guy's calls-- and ask you a few questions
No big deal
Whitacre shakes his head, even more upset
Questions, Jesus

There are a lot of things going on here

Shepard wears a rumpled dark suit and tie from the day Jay Edgar Hoover set a dress code
He has been stationed in Decatur where the odd dead body in a river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state lines have made up the last fifteen years of his life
Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat
Cheviron on the other hand is an old hand at this
He watches Whitacre and says nothing
Shepard writes down everything
He told me he wanted his payments deposited by wire transfer to numbered bank accounts in Switzerland and the Caribbean
And when was your last contact with him
Two days ago
But  think he's getting suspicious
've dragged this out as long as  can
If we don't get back to him soon he may back out
And these calls, they've been coming in on your home line
Whitacre looks at Cheviron-- there's clearly a right and wrong answer here

This used to be Dwayne Andreas' house, you know that

There are things  know, but if decide to tell you what's going on, could  be prosecuted for it

can't provide you with immunity, but any information you tell me about your involvement in criminal activity would be discussed with the  attorney's office in a favorable light
Whitacre stares forward-- a beat
Shepard gets out his notebook
Everything  told you yesterday about Fujiwara was true-- except one thing
never received a call from him on the office line
Shepard looks at Whitacre-- he's confused
Why did you tell me that you did
Before  spoke with you, Mick Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached me on what to say
They told me to tell you that the calls came in on my business line, instead of my home line
Why
Whitacre pauses again
It's too late to turn back
What 'm about to tell you involves something very large
This extortion attempt by Fujiwara is nothing compared to it
Shepard says nothing
(') It involves price fixing in the lysine business
've been in several meetings with our Japanese and Korean competitors in the past few months where the sole purpose has been to fix prices
made me go to these meetings
Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark
Draft: 1/15/03 25
That's why they wanted me to lie
Fujiwara's calling on my home line
But, so are the people we fix prices with
They didn't want you to hear those conversations so they told me to say the Fujiwara calls came in on the  line
But, knew if you guys ever started looking at the records you'd see all these calls  have to Japan
And that's what scared me
Nobody has more calls than me
If you ever figured out about the price fixing, 'd be the fall guy
Shepard considers the explanation
Who told you to participate in these price fixing talks
Whitacre pauses, summons his conviction
'm operating under the direction of Mick and Dwayne Andreas

Mick and Cheviron had me call Fujiwara today and tell him to stop calling until things cool off
They told you to tell him to stop calling

Can you give me a tape recorder
can prove this if you give me a tape recorder
'll take a polygraph if that helps
Shepard is out of pages in his notebook
want to thank you for being honest with me tonight
You're not going to ask questions at  about all this
It'd be my job for sure
No, what was said here was confidential
