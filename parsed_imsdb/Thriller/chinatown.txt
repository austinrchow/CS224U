Written by Robert Towne Grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love
Photograph shakes
of a man in anguish
The photograph is dropped,  , compromising one
Then another, and another
More moans
' (crying out) Oh, no
' drops the photos on Gittes' desk
Curly towers over and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his breathing progressively more labored
drop plunks on Gittes' shiny desk top
Gittes notes it
fan whiffs overhead
Gittes glances up at it
He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat
Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk
Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does
He starts to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos of several movie stars askew
Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees
He is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually bites into the blinds
Gittes doesn't move from his chair
All right, enough is enough
You can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly
just had 'em installed on Wednesday
Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying
Gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys
Gittes pours a large shot
He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly
Down the hatch
Curly stares dumbly at it
Then picks it up, and drains it
He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry quietly
(drinking, relaxing a little) She's just no good
What can  tell you, Kid
You're right
When you're right, you're right, and you're right
Ain't worth thinking about
Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly
You're absolutely right,  wouldn't give her another thought
(pouring himself) You know, you're okay, Mr
Gittes know it's your job, but you're okay
(settling back, breathing a little easier) Thanks, Curly
Call me Jake
Thanks
You know something, Jake
What's that, Curly
think 'll kill her
& ' Noticeably less plush than Gitte's
well-groomed, dark- haired  sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling with the veil on her pillbox hat
was hoping Mr
Gittes could see to this personally
(almost the manner of someone comforting the bereaved) If you'll allow us to complete our preliminary questioning, by then he'll be free
There is the  of   coming from Gittes' Office
Something made of glass shatters
The Woman grows more edgy
'    & Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over him
Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of perspiration on his desk
(crying) They don't kill a guy for that
Oh they don't
Not for your wife
That's the unwritten law
Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting; 'll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody and get away with it
You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class
Curly shrinks back a little
No
You bet your ass you don't
You can't even pay me off
This seems to upset Curly even more
'll pay the rest next trip
We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict
We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore
(easing him out of his office) Forget it
only mention it to illustrate a point
He's now walking him past  who pointedly averts her gaze
He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be read: "
and Associates
" don't want your last dime
He throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile
(continuing) What kind of guy do you think  am
Thanks, Mr
Gittes
Call me Jake
Careful driving home, Curly
He shuts the door on him and the smile disappears
He shakes his head, starting to swear under his breath
Mrs
Mulwray is waiting for you, with Mr
Walsh and Mr
Duffy
Gittes nods, walks on in
' Walsh rises when Gittes enters
Mrs
Mulwray, may  present Mr
Gittes
Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile
How do you do, Mrs
Mulwray
Mr
Gittes
Now, Mrs
Mulwray, what seems to be the problem
She holds her breath
The revelation isn't easy for her
My husband,  believe, is seeing another woman
Gittes looks mildly shocked
He turns for confirmation to his two partners
(gravely) No, really
'm afraid so
am sorry
Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs
Mulwray between Duffy and Walsh
Duffy cracks his gum
Gittes gives him an irritated glance
Duffy stops chewing
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr
Gittes
'm afraid not, Mrs
Mulwray
These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me can't do everything myself
Of course not
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone
Mrs
Mulwray hesitates
She seems uncommonly nervous at the question
wife can tell
Gittes sighs
Mrs
Mulwray, do you love your husband
(shocked) Yes of course
(deliberately) Then go home and forget about it
But
(staring intently at her) 'm sure he loves you, too
You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie
You're better off not knowing
(with some real anxiety) But  have to know
Her intensity is genuine
Gittes looks to his two partners
All right, what's your husband's first name
Hollis
Hollis Mulwray
(visibly surprised) Water and Power
Mrs
Mulwray nods, almost shyly
Gittes is now casually but carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs
Mulwray's dress her handbag, shoes, etc
He's the Chief Engineer
(a little eagerly) Chief Engineer
Gittes' glance tells Duffy Gittes wants to do the questioning
Mrs
Mulwray nods
(confidentially) This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs
Mulwray
It takes time
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr
Gittes
Gittes sighs
Very well
We'll see what we can do
Already shimmering with heat
drunk blows his nose with his fingers into the fountain at the foot of the steps
Gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up the stairs
Former Mayor   is speaking
Behind him is a huge map, with overleafs and bold lettering: "     " Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while Bagby is speaking
Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean
Now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it but you can't drink it, you can't water your lawns with it, you can't irrigate an orange grove with it
Remember we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert
Los Angeles is a desert community
Beneath this building, beneath every street there's a desert
Without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though we'd never existed
(pausing, letting the implication sink in) sitting next to some grubby farmers, bored
He yawns, edges away from one of the dirtier farmers
(
) (continuing) The Alto Vallejo can save us from that, and  respectfully suggest that eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the desert from our streets and not on top of them
An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have been listening with keen interest
couple of the farmers applaud
Somebody shooshes them
In a whispered conference
(acknowledging Bagby) Mayor Bagby
let's hear from the departments again
suppose we better take Water and Power first
Mr
Mulwray
Looking up with interest from his racing form
Walks to the huge map with overleafs
He is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity
He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods
The man turns the overleaf on the map
In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster
It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure there
(referring to a new overleaf) Now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface
Well, it won't hold
won't build it
It's that simple
am not making that kind of mistake twice
Thank you, gentlemen
Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down
Suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced  drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep
Naturally, they cause a commotion
(shouting to farmer) What in the hell do you think you're doing
(as the sheep bleat down the aisles toward the Council) Get those goddam things out of here
(right back) Tell me where to take them
You don't have an answer for that so quick, do you
Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray
(through above, to Mulwray) You steal the water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock who's paying you to do that, Mr
Mulwray, that's what  want to know
It's virtually empty
Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks
Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds
After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls   on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed
Mulwray gets out of the car
Me looks around
Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover
He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed
There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all
Trains the binoculars on him
Sun glints off Mulwray's glasses
There's the  of something like champagne corks popping
Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed, and into Gitte's view
Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound
Power lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water at his feet
He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, toward Gittes
Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the muddy banks
Mulwray says something to the boy
The boy doesn't answer at first
Mulwray points to the ground
The boy gestures
Mulwray frowns
He kneels down in the mud and stares at it
He seems to be concentrating on it
After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly back upstream  scrambling up the bank to his car
There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of blueprints or something like them
He spreads them on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking downstream from time to time
The power lines overhead
He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets back in the car
He drives off
Hurries to get back to his car
He gets in and gets right back out
The steamy leather burns him
He takes a towel from the back seat and carefully places it on the front one
He gets in and takes off
Street lights go on
Pulls up, parks
Hurries out of the car, across the park lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings
Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in the direction Mulwray had gone
He makes it through the trees in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of the cliff to the beach below
Be seems in a hurry
Gittes moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating the climb than Mulwray did
Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent
He looks to his left
There's a promontory of sorts
It's apparent Mulwray has gone that way
Gittes hesitates, then moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in order to be above Mulwray
Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand
Mulwray picks up a starfish
Brushes the sand off it
Looks absently up toward Gittes
Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns
Flashing in the dust
Sitting, suddenly starts
He swears softly
He's in a puddle of water and the seat of his trousers is wet
Below him in watching the water trickling down from the outfall near Gittes
Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated
Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading into the sea, whipping it into a foam
' There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper
Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash light
It says: " 6
, ,
" Gittes grumbles, crumples it up and tosses it out the window
He notices other flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street
Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment
Consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches
The cheap price tags are still on them
Gittes pulls out one
He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch
It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car
He yawns again and heads back to his own car
Arrives whistling, opens the door with " " on it
Morning, Sophie
Sophie hands him a small pile of messages
He goes through them
Walsh here
He's in the dark room
Gittes walks through his office to Duffy and Walsh's
little red light is on in the corner, over a closed door
Gittes walks over and knocks on the door
Where'd he go yesterday
' Three reservoirs
Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain
' What'd you expect
That's his job
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something
' think  got something
Oh yeah
You pick up the watch
& ' ' It's on your desk
Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins
Gittes walks to his office
Is the Ingersoll watch, the crystal broken, the hands stopped at 2:47
He was there all night
Gittes drops it, sits down
Walsh comes in carrying a series of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard
(continuing; eagerly) So what you got
Walsh shows him the photos
He looks at them
They are a series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man whose appearance is striking
In two of the photos a gnarled cane is visible
(continuing; obviously annoyed) This
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle
What about
don't know
The traffic was pretty loud
only heard one thing  apple core
Apple core
(shrugs) Yeah
' Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust
Jesus Christ, Walsh
That's what you spent your day doing
Look, you tell me to take pictures, take pictures
Let me explain something to you, Walsh
This business requires a certain finesse
The  has been
Sophie buzzes him
Yeah, Sophie
(he picks up the phone) Duffy, where are you
Duffy's  can be , excitedly
" got it
got it
He's found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in Echo Park
" (continuing) Okay, slow down  Echo Park
(to Walsh) Jesus, water again
( ) Duffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern
They pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on the girl
(to Duffy, as they pass) Let's have a big smile, pal
He shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast shots
Mulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them
Turns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes again clicking off several fast shots
: "  " the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward on the tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below him where the girl and Mulwray are eating
Gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose
Gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop
He tries to slow himself down
The loose tile also begins to slide
Gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his feet in the drain itself
The loose tile falls and hits the veranda below
He stops as it's about to slide over the edge
He carefully lays it in the drain
But a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile falls
Mulwray staring at the fragment at his feet
He looks to the girl
He's clearly concerned
He rises, looks up to the roof
The roof and the sign topping it betray nothing
He slowly sits back down, staring at the tile fragment
" '
" In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart- shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken
Next to it is a smaller column, "
Gittes hired by suspicious spouse
" Holds the paper and reads while getting his haircut and his shoes shined
In fact, almost all the customers are reading papers
(to Gittes) When you get so much publicity, after a while you must get blase about it
self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes' face
(continuing) Face it
You're practically a movie star
In b
g
, customers can be  talking about the drought
Interspersed with above, someone is saying, "They're gonna start rationing water unless it rains
" Someone else says, "Only for washing your cars
" Third says, "You're not going to be able to water your lawn either, or take a bath more than once a week
" First says, "If you don't have a lawn or a car, do you get an extra bath
" Gittes has been staring outside the barbershop
car is stalled
The hood is up
man watches his radiator boiling over
(laughing) Look at that
Heat's murder
(end of conversation) Fools names and fools faces
Gittes has heard the word
He straightens up
(smiling; to Other Customer) What's that, pal
(indicating paper) Nothing
You got a hell of a way to make a living
Oh
What do you do to make ends meet
Mortgage Department, First National Bank
Gittes laughs
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on
We don't publish a record in the paper,  can tell you that
Neither do
No, you have a press agent do it
Gittes gets out of the chair
Barney, a little concerned, tries to restrain him, holding onto the barber sheet around Gittes' neck
Barney, who is this bimbo
He a regular customer
Take it easy, Jake
Look, pal
make an honest living
People don't come to me unless they're miserable and  help 'em out of a bad situation
don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank
Jake, for Christ's sake
Gittes is trying to take off his sheet
'mon, get out of the barber chair
We'll go outside and talk this over
The Customer is shrinking back into the chair
Hey, c'mon, Jake
Sit down
Sit down
You hear about the fella goes to his friend and says, 'What'll  do, 'm tired of screwing my wife
' and his friend says, 'Whyn't you do what the Chinese do
' Gittes allows himself to be tugged back to his chair
don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick
make an honest living
'Course you do, Jake
An honest living
(continuing) So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do
' ' Gittes comes bursting in, slapping a newspapers on his thigh
Duffy, Walsh
Walsh comes out of his office, Duffy out of the other one
(continuing) Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute
But, Mr
Gittes
(insisting) Sophie
Yes, Mr
Gittes
She gets up and leaves
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife
Jake, listen
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do
So he says what do they do
His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while
Just listen a second, Duffy
stunning   appears behind Gittes in his doorway
She's shortly joined by a small, -
They listen, unseen by Gittes
(continuing) and then they stop and they read a little Confucius and they screw some more and they stop and they smoke some opium and then they go back and screw some more and they stop again and they contemplate the moon or something and it makes it more exciting
So this other guy goes home to screw his wife and after a while he stops and gets up and goes into the other room only he reads Life Magazine and he goes back and he screws some more and suddenly says excuse me a second and he gets up and smokes a cigarette and he goes back and by this time his wife is getting sore as hell
So he screws some more and then he gets up to look at the moon and his wife says, 'What the hell do you think you're doing
(Gittes breaks up) you're screwing like a Chinaman
' Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off
The little Gray-Haired Man winces
When Gittes looks up he sees the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties
She's so stunning that Gittes nearly gasps
Mr
Gittes
Yes
Do you know me
Well
think
would've remembered
Have we ever met
Well, no
Never
Never
That's what  thought
You see, 'm Mrs
Evelyn Mulwray
You know, Mr
Mulwray's wife
Gittes is staggered
He glances down at the newspaper
Not that Mulwray
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr
Gittes
And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that haven't hired you to do anything
Certainly not spy on my husband see you like publicity, Mr
Gittes
Well, you're going to get it
Now wait a minute, Mrs
Mulwray
She's walked past him toward the door
He stop her
(continuing) there's some misunderstanding here
It's not going to do any good to get tough with me
Evelyn flashes a cold smile
don't get tough with anybody, Mr
Gittes
My lawyer does
Evelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her
This time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come out of his office and up behind him
- Here's something for you, Mr
Gittes
Gittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons and complaint
Evelyn walks out the door
- (continuing; pleasantly) suppose we'll be hearing from your attorney
Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand
'    ,  & On Gittes' desk
There are empty coffee cups, the summons and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him from the barber shop
The three men are sitting, worn and silent
Walsh chewing gum is the loudest noise in the room
Gittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation
Walsh stops chewing
Duffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee cups
(to Duffy) There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy
Okay
That's a filthy habit
said okay, Jake
Yeah, yeah
If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too
Look, Jake
She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address
All she needed for that was the phone book
No, no
She said not to call, her husband might answer
When  find out who that phony bitch was
Gittes is staring down at the newspaper
He suddenly grabs the phone, begins dialing
tight little smile breaks out on his face
He buzzes Sophie
Sophie
Yes, Mr
Gittes
Get me the Times
Whitey Mehrholtz
(as he waits) And how about that snotty broad
(the phone to his ear) What does she think, she's perfect
Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug
She's no better than anybody else in this town
Sophie
(continuing) Whitey, what's new, pal
Yeah, listen, where did you get those photographs
Yeah, blowing a fuse over the El Macando love nest
That's cute, Whitey
so who sent them to you
sent them
(Gittes laughs a little hysterically) Why would  be asking how you got them if  sent them
Whitey
Whitey
'mon, level with me for once, my tit's in the wringer and it's beginning to hurt
yeah
yeah
yeah
He hangs up
So he says you sent them
(after a moment) They're all a bunch of phonies
& Gittes stops outside a door marked: "
" He enters an outer office
The  looks surprised
Mr
Mulwray, please
He's not in, Mr
Gittes
May  ask what this is regarding
It's personal
Has he been out long
Since lunch
Gee whiz
(he glances at his watch) And 'm late
He was expecting you
Fifteen minutes ago
Why don't  go in and wait
Without waiting for a response, he does
The Secretary half rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door
' The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas and reservoirs in the city
On the desk is a framed, tinted photo of Evelyn in riding clothes
Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does
He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly examining the top
He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't open
He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens
He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook
He opens it, riffles through the stubs like he was shuffling cards
Drops it, finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913
Then, He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat hand: "Tues
night
Oak Pass Res
7 channels used
" Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent pane
He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses off the desk top when he does
He catches them, puts them on the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens
Enters the room
An anxious Secretary is right behind him
Can  help you
(extending his hand) Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department
(equally pleasant) Gittes
And it's not a departmental matter
wonder if you'd care to wait in my office
This is more a request than an invitation
Gittes nods, follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices down the hall
(continuing; as they're going) You see, this whole business in the paper with Mr
Mulwray has us all on edge
Smaller than Mulwray's, he has most noticeably a lacquered marlin mounted on the wall
There are a couple of other pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he's standing beside
There's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials
below it, tacked onto the wall
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth
Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't
And Mulwray isn't
He never even kids about it
Maybe he takes it very seriously
Gittes winks
Yelburton chuckles appreciatively, loosening up a little
You don't happen to know where Mr
Mulwray's having lunch
'm sorry,  -- Well, tell him 'll be back
Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk
(continuing) Mind if  take one of your cards
In case  want to get in touch with you again
Help yourself
Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his handkerchief pocket
He goes out the door, nearly running into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk, about ' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper bag
Mulvihlll, what are you doing here
, Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, remains by the desk
They shut my water off, what's it to you
How'd you find out
You don't drink it, you don't take a bath in it, maybe they sent you a letter
Ah, but then you'd have to be able to read
Mulvihill moves toward Gittes, shaking with fury
Yelburton steps between them
(continuing) Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you
(to Yelburton) Do you know Claude Mulvihill here
Hope so
He's working for us
Rings the bell
He waits
powerful   with heavy hair and a half-jacket of gold on one front tooth, answers the door
Gittes to see Mr
Mulwray
He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet
The Butler takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the doorway
Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese  trim a hedge
There's a
Gittes moves a few feet off the porch
chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a chamois
Steam rises off the hood
The squeaking has obviously come from the chamois
In doorway
Please
Gittes looks behind him
The Chinese Butler is gesturing for him to follow
Follows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes maid is cleaning in the den
They pass through it out some French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with running water
You wait, please
Gittes is left standing by the pond
It's suddenly very quiet except for the runnning water
The pond is over-flowing
After a moment, the Gardener comes running back
He smiles at Gittes, probes into the pond
There's something gleaming in the bottom of it
Gittes notes it
After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters recede
(to Gittes) Bad for glass
(not understanding) Yeah sure
Bad for glass
The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming
He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object
He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the trellised pathway
He casually belts the probe, holds onto it for poise
Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair
She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office
Yes, Mr
Gittes
Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn
He is annoyed as well
Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite
Actually, 'm here to see your husband, Mrs
Mulwray
He laughs
a little nervously
He waits for a reply
There is none
The Chinese Butler appears on the veranda
Would you like something to drink
What are you having
Iced tea
Yeah
Fine, thank you
Chinese Butler nods, disappears Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table
Gittes Joins her
My husband's at the office
Actually he's not
And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando
(sharply) That's not his apartment
Anyway
the point is, Mrs
Mulwray
'm not in business to be loved, but  am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up
's a small town, people talk
He waits for a response
Then: (continuing; uneasily) 'm just trying to make a living, and  don't want to become a local Joke
Mr
Gittes, you've talked me into it
'll drop the lawsuit
What
said 'll drop it
The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between them
(continuing; pleasantly) So let's just drop the whole thing
Sugar
Lemon
Mrs
Mulwray
(as she's mixing one of the drinks) Yes, Mr
Gittes
don't want to drop it
Evelyn looks up
Gittes smiles a little sheepishly
should talk this over with your husband
(a little concerned) Why
What on earth for
Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man
Well, 've been accused of many things, Mrs
Mulwray, but never that
Again he laughs a little nervously
Again no reaction
(continuing) You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and  want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit
'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down
so 'd like to see your husband
Unless that's a problem
(with a slight edge) What do you mean
May  speak frankly, Mrs
Mulwray
You may if you can, Mr
Gittes
(determined to be polite) Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course
She's disappeared
Maybe they disappeared together somewhere
(with rising anger) Suppose they did
How does it concern you
Nothing personal, Mrs
Mulwray, just -- It's very personal
It couldn't be more personal
Is this a business or an obsession with you
Look at it this way
Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me
Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me
They were out to get your husband
Now if  see him, can help him
Did you talk this morning
Evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans
No
went riding rather early
Looks like you went quite a distance
No, Just riding bareback, that's all
Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs
Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them
Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30
'll stop by
Please call first
Gittes nods
Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel up into the parched hills
One a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir
The chain link fence with its   sign is open and there are people milling around
The reservoir is below
Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of
Sorry, this is closed to the public, sir
Gittes hesitates only a moment, then: (to the Guard) It's all right
Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department
He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief pocket, hands it to the Guard
Sorry, Mr
Yelburton
Go on down
Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the reservoir
He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well
Gittes stops and gets out of the car
Several men with their backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently dredging for something
One of the men turns and sees Gittes
He recognizes Gittes and is visibly shocked
Gittes, for Chrissakes
Loach
(moving to Gittes, taking him by the arm) 'mon, get out of here before -- Loach tries to ease him down the path
Before what
What the hell's going on
At the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns around
He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties, Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at seeing one another
The men around them are extremely uneasy
Loach is actually sweating
Finally, Escobar smiles
Hello, Jake
(without smiling) How are you, Lou
have a cold  can't seem to shake but other than that, 'm fine
Summer colds are the worst
Yeah, they are
Gittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case
No smoking, sir
It's a fire hazard this time of year
think we can make an exception
'll see he's careful with the matches
(lighting up) Thanks, Lou
How'd you get past the guards
Well, to tell you the truth,  lied a little
Escobar nods
They walk a couple of steps
The other police, two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them
You've done well by yourself
get by
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and  guess you have
Poking around in other people's dirty linen
Yeah
Tell me, you still throw Chinamen into jail for spitting on the laundry
You're behind the times, Jake
They've got steam irons now
(smiles) And 'm out of Chinatown
Since when
Since  made Lieutenant
It's apparent Gittes is impressed despite himself
Congratulations
Uh-huh
So what are you doing here
Looking for someone
Who
Hollis Mulwray
You seen him
Oh yes
'd like to talk to him
You're welcome to try
There he is
Escobar points down to the reservoir
couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water
It can be that one of them has hooked something
He shouts
The other man hooks it, too
They pull, revealing the soaking back of a man's coat
They start to pull the body into the skiff
' Are standing over the body of Mulwray
Escobar has the sheet drawn back
Evelyn nods
Escobar drops the sheet
Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel
Could he swim
Of course
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out
Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs
coroner's assistant wheels the body out of the office
(continuing) This alleged affair he was having
The publicity didn't make him morose or unhappy
' Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and listening
At this question, he rises and looks through the doorway
Escobar sees him, ignores him
Evelyn doesn't see him
Well, it didn't make him happy
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life
(sharply) No
(a little uncomfortably now) Mrs
Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question
Evelyn shows a flash of annoyance
No
Do you know where she might be
Certainly not
Escobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door
You and your husband never discussed her
(stopping, faltering) He
we did
he wouldn't tell me her name
We quarreled over her
of course
It came as a complete surprise to me
complete surprise
Yes
But  thought you'd hired a private investigator
private investigator
(gesturing vaguely toward the door) Mr
Gittes
Well yes
Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her
She stops cold
They look at one another for a long moment
(her eyes on Gittes) But
did that because thought it was a nasty rumor 'd put an end to
She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes
Escobar is right at her back
Gittes says nothing
And when did Mr
Gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact
Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him
(smoothly) Just before the story broke in the papers, Lou
Escobar nods
They begin to walk slowly, again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the Coroner cubicles
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman
No
Or her name
No
They have walked a few steps further down the hall
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant
don't think so, Mrs
Mulwray
Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch
'll walk her to her car, be right back
' Evelyn glances at Gittes
They go through a couple of outer doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in " and "Southern Cafeteria
" Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking questions
Gittes brushes them aside
In a small parking lot
Evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something in her purse
Mrs
Mulwray
Mrs
Mulwray
(flushed, perspiring) Just a minute
(touching her gently) You left your keys in the ignition
Oh
thank you
She glances down, leans against the side of the car
(continuing) Thank you for going along with me just didn't want to explain anything
'll send you a check
(puzzled) check
Evelyn gets in her car
To make it official,  hired you
She drives off, leaving Gittes gaping
' Don't give me that, Lou
You hauled me down here for a statement
Escobar shrugs
don't want it anymore
No
No
It was an accident
You mean that's what you're going to call it
Escobar looks up
That's right
(contemptuously) Out of respect for his civic position
Resume walking
Gittes laughs
What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at your sister
Escobar stops
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people
But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam
Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know
Oh yeah
Can you think of something to charge me with
When  do, you'll hear about it
Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall
Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with Mulwray's name
is standing near it in a doorway to an adjoining room
is on, and with it the announcement that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle
Another Coroner's assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating a sandwich
Gittes ambles into the room
(a cigarette dangling out of his mouth) Jake, what're you doin' here
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, thought 'd drop by and see who died lately
Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back of Mulwray's body
Eyes open, the face badly cut and bruised
Yeah
Ain't that something
Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns
Only in
(looking at
Mulwray) Yeah
Banged up pretty bad
That's a long fall
So how are you, Morty
Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant
Never better
You know me, Jake
As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing
Gittes spots the other body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray
(picking up on cough) Yeah, so who you got there
Morty pulls back the sheet
Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to hang around Ferguson's Alley
Morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs
(continuing) Quite a character
Lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains
Had a bureau dresser down there and everything
Gittes has already lost interest
He starts away
Yeah
Drowned, too
This stops Gittes
Come again
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed
The
River
(a little puzzled) Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that
Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely
It's bone dry, Morty
It's not completely dry
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either,  don't care how soused he was
That's like drowning in a teaspoon
Morty shrugs
We got water out of him, Jake
He drowned
Gittes walks away mumbling
Jesus, this town
He's parked on an overpass
The sign   on one of its concrete columns
Gittes looks down into the riverbed below
Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its contents strewn down river from the bridge
Below him, lying half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims " $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of sorts
Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc
The trashy remains of Shuhardt's home
Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud
Gittes pulls it out, swearing
He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears the vaguely familiar   of something
Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy bank
They look at one another a moment
(calling out to him) You were riding here the other day, weren't you
The Boy doesn't answer
(continuing) Speak English
Habla Ingles
(finally) Si
Didn't you talk to a man here
few days ago
wore glasses
he
The Boy nods
(continuing) What did you talk about, mind my asking
The shadows of the two are very long now
(finally) The water
What about the water
When it comes
When it comes
What'd you tell him
Comes in different parts of the river
Every night a different part
Gittes nods
The horse snorts
The Boy rides slowly on
Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes
It is headed above toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting
Winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills
He picks up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's windwing
Along the flood channel
It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight
He turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel
The road is narrower
Gittes drives more slowly
Foliage is overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed
The road is dirt
Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus are everywhere
It is very still
Another turn and a pie- shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be - Over the road, bolted
It says " " The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible
Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the spotlight
lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination
There is only the eerie  of the tension
Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood channel itself
Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage toward a second and large chain-link fence
Lights from the reservoir still higher above can be
Suddenly there is a
Then
Gittes dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide
There is the  of men scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating
Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel
He waits
The men seem to have passed him by
But there is another  now
An echoing growing sound
It puzzles Gittes
He starts to lift his head to catch the direction
Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out
But the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chainlink fence
It stops him cold
He's nearly strained through it
Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself
Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car
' He fishes for his car keys, looks down
One shoe is missing
(grumbling) Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit
He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a stop him
Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms, holding him tightly
The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril
(shaking with emotion) Hold it there, kitty cat
Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade
You are a very nosey fellow, kitty cat
you know what happens to nosey fellows
The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage when he says this
Gittes doesn't move
(continuing) Wanna guess
No
Okay, lose their noses
With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further
Gittes screams
Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat
Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes
Mulvihill and the Smaller Man stare at him
(continuing) Next time you lose the whole thing, kitty cat
'll cut it off and feed it to my goldfish, understand
Tell him you understand, Gittes
Gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees
(mumbling) understand
Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-tone brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his blood
Comes up and lightly shoves Gittes into the ground
The of  , Gittes gasping
' Sits behind his desk,   , not moving
Duffy sits staring at nothing, Walsh moves uneasily around the room
The  is
Sophie
(pressing down intercom) Yeah, Sophie
' Miss Sessions calling
Who
' Ida Sessions
Don't know her
Take a number
bandage spread-eagled across Gittes' nose
So some contractor wants to build a dam and he makes a few payoffs
So what
Gittes turns slowly to Walsh
He lightly taps his nose
(continuing) Think you can nail Mulvihill
They'll claim you were trespassing
don't want Mulvihill
want the big boys that are making the payoffs
Then what'll you do
Sue the shit out of 'em
Yeah
Yeah
What's wrong with you guys
Think ahead
We find 'em, sue 'em
We'll make a killing
(a dazzling smile) We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit
Gittes looks irritated
The   again
' Miss Ida Sessions again
She says you know her
Okay
Gittes picks up the phone
He winks to his boys
(continuing) Hello, Miss Sessions
don't believe we've had the pleasure
' Oh yes we have
are you alone, Mr
Gittes
(clowning a little for the boys) Isn't everybody
What can  do for you, Miss Sessions
Walsh promptly starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story
' Well, 'm a working girl, Mr
Gittes
didn't come in to see you on my own
When did you come in
' was the one who pretended to be Mrs
Mulwray, remember
Walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are laughing raucously
Gittes drops the mail he's been loafing through and puts his hand over the receiver
(to Duffy and Walsh) Shut the fuck up
(then back to Ida) Yes  remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates
you were saying
' Well  never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr
Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out  want somebody to know didn't know what would happen
understand
if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions
That could help us both
' Oh no
Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over
' No, Mr
Gittes
Just look in the obituary column of today's Times
The obituary column
' You'll find one of those people
'Those people
' Miss Sessions
She hangs up
Gittes looks to his two men
Gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the , scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column from the paper and puts it in his pocket
When he closes the paper we can  headlines in the left hand column: "    "
Ten million dollar referendum to go before the public
Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so
He rises, allows her to sit
Gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly
She's wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored
Thanks for coming
drink
The waiter's appeared
Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose
Tom Collins with lime, not lemon, please
Evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves
When she looks back up she stares expectantly at Gittes
Gittes pulls out a torn envelope
The initials  can be in a delicate scroll on the corner of it
got your check in the mall
Yes
As  said,  was very grateful
Gittes' fingers the envelope
He coughs
Mrs
Mulwray, 'm afraid that's not good enough
(a little embarrassed) Well, how much would you like
Stop it
The money's fine
It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story
(coolly) have
think so
Something besides your husband's death was bothering you
You were upset but not that upset
Mr
Gittes
(icily) Don't tell me how  feel
The drinks come
The waiter sets them down
Sorry
Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass
Excuse me
Then you ask me to lie to the police
It wasn't much of a lie
If your husband was killed it was
(meaning check) This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence
But he wasn't killed
Gittes smiles
think you're hiding something, Mrs
Mulwray
Evelyn remains unperturbed
Well,  suppose  am
actually knew about the affair
How did you find out
My husband
He told you
Evelyn nods
(continuing) And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it
was grateful
Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed
You'll have to explain that, Mrs
Mulwray
Why
(a flash of annoyance) Look,  do matrimonial work, It's my metiay
When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience
Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn
Unless what
(looking directly at her) She's cheating on him
Evelyn doesn't reply
(continuing) Were you
Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it
don't like the word 'cheat
' Did you have affairs
(flashing) Mr
Gittes
Did he know
(almost an outburst) Well  wouldn't run home and tell him whenever  went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean
This subdues Gittes a little
Evelyn is still a little heated
(continuing; more calmly) Is there anything else you want to know
Where you were when your husband died
can't tell you
You mean you don't know where you were
mean  can't tell you
You were seeing someone, too
Evelyn looks squarely at him
She doesn't deny it
For very long
don't see anyone for very long, Mr
Gittes
It's difficult for me
Now  think you know all you need to about me
didn't want publicity didn't want to go into any of this, then or now
Is this all
Gittes nods
Oh, by the way
What's the '' stand for
He's been fingering the envelope
(she stammers slightly) Cross
That your maiden name
Yes
why
No reason
Evelyn turns into Gittes
You must've had a reason to ask me that
(shrugs) No
'm just a snoop
You seem to have had a reason for every other question
No, not for that one
don't believe you
Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn
(moving in) Do me a favor
Sit still and act like 'm charming
Evelyn involuntarily draws back
(continuing) There's somebody here
Say something
Anything
Something like we're being intimate
Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle his hand in front of their faces
She stares at him
(meaning his nose) How did it happen
(quietly) Been meaning to talk to you about that
(quietly) Maybe putting your nose in other people's business
(quietly) More like other people putting their business in my nose
Evelyn actually smiles a little
' You son of a bitch
Gittes looks up and flashes his smile
Mrs
Match
How're you
is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, and a menacing look in her eye
Don't give me that, you son of a bitch
Okay
Gittes turns back to Evelyn
(softly) Another satisfied client
Another satisfied client's wife
Look at me, you son of a bitch
You
you bastard
Are you happy, are you happy now
She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse
Gittes covers himself
Waiters rush over
You smug son of a bitch
My husband's so upset he sweats all night
How do you think that makes me feel
Sweaty
Mrs
Match swings at Gittes again and again
She catches him on the nose
It hurts
He covers it, then swings his leg out from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin
Mrs
Match drops her purse and spills her drink
She grabs her shin, hopping around a little
The waiters who had tried to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over
Let's get out of here before she picks up her purse
They rise and move toward the door
(quietly) Tough guy, huh
Gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods
Gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant
The attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn
Oh, no
've got my own car
The creamcolored Packard
(to attendant who dutifully starts for her car) Wait a minute, sonny
(to Evelyn) think you better come with me
What for
There's nothing more to say
(to attendant) Get my car, please
The attendant starts after it again
Gittes leans on the open door of his car and in to Evelyn
He talks quietly but spits it out
Okay, go home
But in case you're interested your husband was murdered
Somebody's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we're supposedly in the middle of a drought, he found out, and he was killed
There's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue
Involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they don't
It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine with me
But, Mrs
Mulwray
(now inches from her) goddam near lost my nose
And like it
like breathing through it
And  still think you're hiding something
Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door
She stares at Gittes for a long moment
Then he gently tugs the car door closed
Mr
Gittes
He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn looking after him
' : "
" Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary
She looks up
She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him
Gittes to see Mr
Yelburton
The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner office
Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment
He sees a photographic display of " ", along the wall
He stops as he spots a photo of the man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier
He is standing high in the mountains, near a pass
The caption reads "
1905"
Cross is strikingly handsome
Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's check
He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down under the middle initial , then he looks back to the photos
The Secretary returns
Mr
Yelburton will be busy for some time
Well 'm on my lunch hour
'll wait
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely
take a long lunch
All day sometimes
Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one
She refuses
He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more photographs
' Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross
One of the captions: " 1912"
Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary
Julian Cross worked for the water department
(looking up) Yes
No
(humming, then) He did or he didn't
He owned it
Gittes is genuinely surprised at this
He owned the water department
Yes
He owned the entire water supply for the city
Yes
(really surprised) How did they get it away from him
(a sigh, then) Mr
Mulwray felt the public should own the display
The water
If you'll just read the display
(glances back, hums, then) Mulwray
thought you said Cross owned the department
Along with Mr
Mulwray
They were partners
(testily) Yes
Yes, they were partners
She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office
Gittes goes back to the photographs
He hears a , apparently coming from just outside the outer door
He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door
Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise
The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor
(to Gittes) Mr
Yelburton will see you now
Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office
& There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude
He's now head of the department
Mr
Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting
These staff meetings, they just go on and on
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances
Oh yes
Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had
My goodness, what happened to your nose
(smiles) cut myself shaving
You ought to be more careful
That must really smart
Only when  breathe
(laughing) Only when you breathe
don't tell me you're still working for Mrs
Mulwray
never was
(stops smiling) don't understand
Neither do , actually
But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me
Mr
Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense
Well, look at it this way, Mr
Yelburton
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so
you decided to ruin it
Then he found out that you were dumping water every night
Then he was drowned
Mr
Gittes
That's an outrageous accusation
don't know what you're talking about
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will
Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought
That's news
Gittes heads toward the door
Wait
Please sit down, Mr
Gittes
We're
well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley
As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off
The city comes first, naturally
But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under
Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff
Yeah, a little runoff
Where are those orchards
said, the northwest valley
That's like saying they're in Arizona
Mr
Gittes, my field men are out and can't give you an exact location
Gittes nods
You're a married man, am  right
Yes
Hard working, have a wife and kids
Yes
don't want to nail you
just want to know who put you up to it
'll give you a few days to think it over
(hands him a card) Call me
can help
Who knows
Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years
Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton
Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk
Sophie tries to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office
Is sitting, smoking
She looks up when he enters
What's your usual salary
Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her
Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty for each of my operators, plus expenses, plus my fee if  show results
He's sitting now
Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very shaken
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble
Money
How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that  don't know
'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved
Gittes buzzes Sophie
Sophie, draw up one of our standard forms for Mrs
Mulwray
(he leans back; to Evelyn) Tell me, did you get married before or after Mulwray and your father sold the water department
Evelyn nearly jumps at the question
(continuing) Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he
Yes, of course
It was quite a while after
was just out of grade school when they did that
So you married your father's business partner
Evelyn nods
She lights another cigarette
(continuing; staring at her, points to the ashtray) You've got one going, Mrs
Mulwray
Oh
She quickly stubs one out
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father
No
Yes, a little
You see Hollis and my fa
my father had a falling out
Over the water department, or over you
(quickly) Not over me
Why would they have a falling out over me
(noting her nervousness) Then it was over the water department
Not exactly
Well,  mean, yes
Yes and no
Hollis felt the public should own the water but  don't think my father felt that way
Actually, it was over the Van der Lip
The dam that broke
Oh, yeah
Yes
He never forgave him for it
Never forgave him for what
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father
They haven't spoken to this day
(starts a little) You sure shout that
Of course 'm sure
What about you
Do you and your father get along
Sophie comes in with the form, cutting off Evelyn's reply
Gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of Evelyn
Sign here
The other copy's for you
She signs it
When she looks back up, Gittes is staring intently at her
What are you thinking
(picking up one of copies, folding it, putting it in his pocket) Before this  turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold,  didn't think there was a thing to it
The engines make the small cabin vibrate
Gittes threads his way down the tiny aisle of the eight passenger cabin, which is full of middle-aged men in old clothes and their fishing gear
Gittes is poked by a pole, has to move along
One of the old men says something to him
(above the engines) What
You'll have to sit with the pilot
Gittes moves forward into the cockpit, the  looks up nods for Gittes to sit down, first moving a half eaten cheese sandwich out of Gittes' seat
- Taxiing down the ramp into the sea
In a moment, it kicks up a spray of foam and takes off
The island gradually looming larger before the Pilot and Gittes
The Pilot glances over at Gittes who, as usual, is impeccably dressed
contrast to the others on the plane
(above the engines) Well, you're not going fishing
Gittes shakes his head
Not exactly
(winks) But that's what you told your wife
The Pilot laughs raucously
Gittes laughs politely
Lots of fellas do
Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island
she pretty
(abruptly) 'm going to see a man called Julian Cross
Ever heard of him
Is the Pope Catholic
Who are you, mister
ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people
'm working for his daughter
(surprised) That right
She used to be some looker
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four
You must be thinking of a different daughter
No, he's only got one,  remember her age,  read it in the newspapers when she ran away
She ran away
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time
Julian Cross' daughter
God almighty
She was a wild little thing
He gives a sidelong glance to Gittes, a little concerned he's said too much
(continuing) Course, she settled down nicely
(smiling a little) Well, you never know, do you
(loosening up) That's for sure
Why'd she run away
Oh, you know
She was sixteen or seventeen
(nudging him) We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal
Both men laugh a little lewdly
She ran off to Mexico
Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was
Went there to get rid of it
You don't say
Cross was looking for her all over the country
Offered rewards, everything
Felt real sorry for him, with all his money
pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building on the bay overlooking the harbor
The seaplane lands motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns and heads in the direction of the plane
Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign with a cross painted below the name
The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island
As the wagon continues one can  that it is actually a miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of the sea
The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered around a corral
The circle of men drift apart, leaving standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome in a rough linen shirt and jeans
When he talks his strong face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged
& Walking toward the main house
classic Monterey
horse led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates in the center of the path they are taking
Gittes doesn't notice
Horseshit
Gittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly
Sir
said horseshit
(pointing) Horseshit
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like
'll give you that
Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile
He removes his hat and waves it, inhales deeply
Love the smell of it
lot of people do but of course they won't admit it
Look at the shape
Gittes glances down out of politeness
(continuing; smiling, almost enthusiastic) Always the same
Cross walks on
Gittes follows
(not one to let it go) Always
What
Oh, damn near yes
Unless the animal's sick or something
(stops and glances
back) And the steam rising off it like that in the morning
That's life, Mr
Gittes
Life
They move on
(continuing) Perhaps this preoccupation with horseshit may seem a little perverse, but  ask you to remember this
One way or another, it's what 've dealt in all my life
Let's have breakfast
& Below them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick up their heels
Cross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to time
An impeccable Mexican butler serves them their main course, broiled fish
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr
Gittes
like that
(dubious) Thanks
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable
And it's good advertising
It doesn't hurt
It's why you attract a client like my daughter
Probably
But 'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband
No
She happens to think the last one was murdered
Cross is visibly surprised
How did she get that idea
think  gave it to her
Cross nods
Uh-huh
Oh  hope you don't mind believe they should be served with the head
Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way
(laughs) Tell me
What do the police say
They're calling it an accident
Who's the investigating officer
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant
Do you know him
Oh yes
Where from
We worked in Chinatown together
Would you call him a capable man
Very
Honest
Far as it goes
Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case
None
That's too bad
Too bad
It disturbs me, Mr
Gittes
It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride
Financially speaking, of course
How much are you charging her
(carefully) My usual fee, plus a bonus if  come up with any results
Are you sleeping with her
Come, come, Mr
Gittes
You don't have to think about that to remember, do you
Gittes laughs
If you want an answer to that question can always put one of my men on the job
Good afternoon, Mr
Cross
Mr
Gittes
You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband
don't want her taken advantage of
Sit down
What for
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't
This stops Gittes
He seems faintly mused by it
Why is that funny
It's what the
used to tell me about Chinatown
Was he right
Gittes shrugs
(continuing) Exactly what do you know about me, Mr
Gittes
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers
(grunts, then) 'Course 'm respectable
'm old
Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough
'll double whatever your fees are and 'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend
His girlfriend
Yes, his girlfriend
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando
Yes
She's disappeared, hasn't she
Yeah
Doesn't that strike you as odd
No
She's probably scared to death
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her
Maybe
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you
No
When was the last time
Cross starts to reply, then there's the  of a and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off
They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback
For the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along in disordered review to the music
Sheriff's gold posse
bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection
let 'em practice up out here
Yeah
Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray
Cross shakes his head
At my age, you tend to lose track
Well, It was about five days ago
You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument
Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise
(continuing) 've got the photographs in my office
If they'll help you remember
What was the argument about
(a long pause, then:) My daughter
What about her
Just find the girl, Mr
Gittes think she is frightened and  happen to know Hollis was fond of her
'd like to help her if  can
didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other
Cross looks hatefully at Gittes
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune
We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized
If you want to hire me,  still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about
(painfully) Well
she's an extremely jealous person
didn't want her to find out about the girl
How did you find out
've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr
Gittes, and a few friends in town
Okay
My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement
Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her
Just find the girl
'll look into it as soon as  check out some avocado groves
Avocado groves
We'll be in touch, Mr
Cross
Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans
Gittes approaches one of the  at a desk
'm a little lost
Where can  find the plat books for the northwest valley
The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little
Part of it's in Ventura County
We don't have Ventura County in our Hall of Records
Which is a snotty remark
Gittes smiles
'll settle for
County
(regards him, then) Row twenty-three, section
The Clerk turns away abruptly
Gittes regards his back a moment, then goes to the stacks
Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something
The second clerk gets on the phone
Gittes watches a moment, then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks
He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it
It's huge and there's a lot to go through
The print itself makes him squint
Showing , , , even a designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved e
g
'6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc
' These descriptions are old and faded
In the owners' column, however there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners
Hauls the huge volume back to the Clerk's desk
(to Clerk) Say
uh
sonny
The Clerk turns sharply around
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week
Gittes looks a little surprised
Then these are all new owners
That's right
(astonished) But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months
If that's what it says
Can  check one of these volumes out
(quietly snotty) Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records
Well, then, how about a ruler
ruler
The print's pretty fine
forgot my glasses
'd like to be able to read across
The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler on the desk
Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler
He opens the book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically
Beside the  column he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description
As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the  of the  being ripped
Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, narrower roads
He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard
There is a "" sign on the collapsing barn
Gittes stops, checks it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records
And a few withered pepper trees
Gittes has paused at this dried-up intersection
There is a "" sign on a drug store
Gittes looks
Coming   above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud of purple smoke
Gittes heads in that direction
Gittes parks at the edge of the field
About twenty yards away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid off it
Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth
Several  are watching the man at work
(to one of the Children) Say, pal, what's he doing
Making some rain
Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying himself with the intricacies of his machine
He's aware of Gittes watching him
Well, you're just the man 'm looking for
The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is immaculately dressed
Some associates and  are thinking of buying property out here
Of course, we're worried about the rainfall
The Rainmaker steps down
No problem with me on the Job
Yeah
(glancing around at the desolate, dry field) Do you have any references
& City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days
(nods) That's swell
But how about here
(pulling out names from his pocket) Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb
Never heard of 'em
new owners
Yeah
(climbing back up) Lot of turnover these days
Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land
Yeah, 'll do that
Is now covered with a film of dust: He reaches a fork in the dirt road
There are a couple of mailboxes
Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent
As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be , coming more and more  , row upon row of avocado and walnut groves, their foliage heavy
The few structures in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home
Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank
Gittes drives through a gate that has " " and "   " signs neatly printed on it
He drives down the road into the grove
Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes
He puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees
By contrast with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze
Then a   abruptly strips bare the branches of the tree he'd been staring at
Gittes is shocked
He looks behind him
Riding on horseback down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red- Faced Man in overalls
His hat blows off his head
He does not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used
Gittes' lane of retreat is denied him
He guns the car, and takes off down one of the orchard lanes
The dirt lane is rough
As Gittes nears the end of it, a Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit
Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes
Here he's pursued by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires
Gittes yells at it
Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes toward a dust trail rising above the trees
They've spotted it
Clearly it's from Gittes' car
This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator are ruptured by another
Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car
Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle with
The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back with his crutch
The two of them manage to pound Gittes to the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues to whack away at Gittes with the crutch
The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a mule ride up
All right, quit it
Quit now
Search the man, see if he's armed
Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes
Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet
They toss his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc
on the ground
said see if he's armed, not empty his pockets
He ain't armed
Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily
All right, mister
Who you with
Water department or the real estate office
Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer
He has trouble catching his breath
The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch
Gittes turns sharply
(to Crippled Farmer) Get away from me
Answer him
Touch me with that thing again and you'll need a pair of them
(shoving Gittes) Whyn't you pick on somebody your own size
said cut that out
Give him a chance to say something
Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer
(reaching down for his wallet) Name's Gittes
'm a private investigator and 'm not with either one
Then what are you doing out here
Client hired me to see
whether or not the water department's been irrigating your land
Irrigating my land
(exploding) The water department's been sending you people to blow up my water tanks
They threw poison down three of my wells
call that a funny way to irrigate
Who'd hire you for a thing like that
Gittes reaches into his pocket
The paper's on the ground
He picks it up
Mrs
Evelyn Mulwray
Mulwray
That's the son of a bitch who's done it to us
Mulwray's dead
You don't know what you're talking about, you dumb Oakie
The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes
Gittes kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly
The Crippled Farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head
Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt
Well, that's that
There's a  , which soon becomes defined into the talking quietly  about whether to move or not to move, doctors, etc
Is staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened in porch of the farmers
His wife, the Red Faced Farmer, and the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog
The Red Faced Farmer's wife has set tea out
The farmers, all of them, now seem awkward and a little embarrassed
' He focuses on Evelyn who sits right next to him
He's got dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of spots
(to Evelyn) What's going on
(quietly, almost as if he were in a hospital) You didn't look too good, so we thought we better call your employer
Gittes nods
He checks his watch
He looks out
It's almost evening
Gittes says nothing
The wife of the Red Faced Farmer () looks reproachfully at Dubois
Gittes feels the back of his head, It obviously hurts him
Evelyn and Gittes go out to her car, the cream colored Packard
Dubois accompanies them, along with the Big Farmer who is carrying a crate of something
Gittes has cleaned himself up a little
Look here, if it's all the same with you, we'll get your car patched up
If you'll tell me what your trousers run you, 'll make good on them, Mr
Gittes
It's okay, Mr
Dubois
, (to Evelyn) It's just that they're after everybody out here, tearing up our irrigation ditches trying to make our land worthless so they can pick it up for twenty-five dollars an acre
Gittes nods
(continuing) Anyway
Earl here is sorry, too
He wants to give you something to take back with you
Gittes looks
Earl has the huge crate he's holding brim-full of avocados
Thanks, Earl
& Evelyn driving
Thanks for coming
Gittes pulls out cigarette case, takes one, offers one to Evelyn who refuses
That dam is a con job
What dam
The one your husband opposed
They're conning
into building it, only the water won't go to
It'll go here
The Valley
Everything you can see, everything around us
was at the Hall of Records today
(whips out papers, turns on the car light) That bother you
No
(looking over papers) In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres
Jasper Lamar Crabb
Know him
No,  think 'd remember
Yeah
They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts
Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply
About thirty million more than they paid
And Hollis knew about it
It's why he was killed
Jasper Lamar Crabb
Jasper Lamar Crabb
He's pulling out his wallet, excitedly now, spilling its contents onto the seat
He pulls out the obituary column he'd folded up earlier in the day
(continuing) We got it
We got it, baby
What
What is it
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb
He died three weeks ago
Is that unusual
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres
That's unusual
Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest home, its entryway illuminated by streetlights
There is a small sign giving the name of the place in elegant neon scroll
It sits on the rolling green lawns
Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn
He offers her his arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance
Gittes and Evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his forties, with a flower in his buttonhole
He sees Evelyn first
Hello there, 'm Mr
Palmer
Can help you folks
Then he gets a clear look at Gittes, bruised, trousers torn, etc
Yes,  sure hope so
It's Dad
(indicating his disheveled appearance) just can't handle him anymore, can , sweetheart
Evelyn shakes her head
Oh my goodness
(hastily) Nothing to do with Dad
It's me, actually
They just don't get along very well
Dad's a lamb with anyone else
(not so sure) Oh, well,  don't know
Naturally,  want the best for him, money is no object
Perhaps if we could meet your father
There's just one question
Of course
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion
Evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question
(very embarrassed) 'm sorry
We don't
(smoothly) Don't be sorry, neither does Dad
Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey
Evelyn stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled
She manages to nod
Just to be certain,  wonder if you could show us a list of your patients
(polite but pointed) We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy
know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us
Gittes locks eyes with Palmer
(confidentially) That's exactly what we wanted to hear
Oh, good
wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around
don't think so
Be happy to show you
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building
It's nearly bedtime
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart
He takes Evelyn
Looking
Either by accident or design, the primarily octogenarian guests have segregated themselves
In one wing, the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange
In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a quilt
Gittes grabs Evelyn's hand
(quietly) They're all here
Every goddam name
Gittes points to the wall
It says " "
There are titles
" "
""
""
""
Below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain activities, for certain days
After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes
(continuing; indicating the ancients around them) You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire
(astonished) They can't be
They may not know it but they are
Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the quilt
Hello, girls
Two of the ladies giggle
The third continues to busy herself with her quilt, off by herself
(continuing) Which one of you is Emma Dill
Two of them say "she is," and point in different directions
The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting
Gittes approaches her
Are you Emma
Some old voice is singing softly, "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree
" Yes
've been wanting to meet you
Why
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman
(stitching, smiles) 'm not
Well you own a lot of land
Not anymore
Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it
Gittes looks at the quilt
In it is the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern
Gittes spots it
That's just lovely
Thank you
He looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish, comes across the tail and by it the initials
(indicating tail) Where did you get this material
(what it sounds like) The apple core club
The apple core
No
The albacore
It's a fish
My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us
How do they do that
Give us things
Not just some old flag like this, but - (kneeling) But what
' We're a sort of unofficial charity of theirs, Mr
Gittes
Would you care to come this way
Someone wants to see you
Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn
Evelyn is beside him
She gestures as if there's someone behind Palmer
Gittes rises
See you later, Emma
He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front
Is waiting
He's got his hand in his pocket
Evelyn looks to Gittes
The four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over everyone
Come on  want you to meet somebody, Gittes
(glancing from Palmer to Mulvihill) Can we leave the lady out of this
(a little uncertain) Yeah, why not
Okay, 'd like to walk her to her car
'll stay
(taking her by the arm) Get in the car
'll see she makes it
Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes
He makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to Gittes for a moment
Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head
He spins him around
With his jacket covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor
Palmer screams
Evelyn stands there astonished
Mulvihill's gun has clattered to the floor
(as Mulvihill hits the floor, to Evelyn) What are you waiting for
Get in the car
Evelyn goes
Mulvihill tries to get up again
Palmer starts to go for the gun, nearly picking it up
Gittes slaps it out of his hand and kicks it
It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the wall
Palmer goes screaming off into the night
Gittes turns back to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses
Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience of ancients behind him
As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops
Two men are coming toward him
One of them is shorter, and has the nervous, jerky moves of the man who slit his nose
Gittes stops
The two men fan out and continue to move toward him
Gittes spots the two-tone shoes
He begins to back up
Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly behind the two men
In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it gets near them
They look in disbelief, then dive for safety
The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass
Evelyn opens the passenger door
Get in
Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes
Two & Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving
After a moment she takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little
Gittes watches her
He smiles
Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring off into the night
Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey and an ice bucket on it
She sets it down
Gittes turns
(watching her pour) Maid's night off
Why
(a little surprised, he laughs) What do you mean, 'why
' Nobody's here, that's all
(handing Gittes his drink) gave everybody the night off
Easy, it's an innocent question
No question from you is innocent, Mr
Gittes
(laughing) guess not to you, Mrs
Mulwray
Frankly you really saved my a
my neck tonight
They drink
Tell me something
Does this usually happen to you, Mr
Gittes
What's that, Mrs
Mulwray
Well, 'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, 'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day
(pouring himself another drink) Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time
When was the last time
Why
Just
don't know why
'm asking
Gittes touches his nose, winces a little
It was in Chinatown
What were you doing there
(taking a long drink) Working for the District Attorney
Doing what
Gittes looks sharply at her
Then: As little as possible
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that
They do in Chinatown
She looks at him
Gittes stares off into the night
Evelyn has poured herself another drink
Bothers you to talk about it, doesn't it
Gittes gets up
No
wonder
could
Do you have any peroxide or something
He touches his nose lightly
Oh sure
'mon
She takes his hand and leads him back into the house
Gittes pulls the plaster off his nose, stares at it in the mirror
Evelyn takes some hydrogen peroxide and some cotton out of a medicine cabinet
Evelyn turns Gittes' head toward her
She has him sit on the pullman tile adjacent to the sink
Doctor did a nice job
She begins to work on his nose with the peroxide
Then she sees his cheek, checks back in his hair
(continuing) Boy oh boy, you're a mess
Yeah
(working on him) So why does it bother you to talk about it
Chinatown
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me
It was
Gittes shrugs
Hold still
Why
You can't always tell what's going on there
No
Why was it
thought  was keeping someone from being hurt and actually  ended up making sure they were hurt
Could you do anything about it
They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near his eye
Yeah
Make sure  don't find myself in Chinatown anymore
Wait a second
He takes hold of her and pulls her even closer, (momentarily freezing) What's wrong
Your eye
What about it
(staring intently) There's something black in the green part of your eye
(not moving) Oh that
It's a flaw in the iris
flaw
(she almost shivers) Yes, sort of a birthmark
Gittes kisses her lightly, gradually rises until he's standing holding her
She hesitates, then wraps her arms around him
On a nightstand, city lights visible through the open window behind it
It is
Evelyn's arm reaches
of something hitting the headboard
Gittes moans
Gittes in bed, holding his head, which he's just hit
Evelyn pauses in her reach to the phone
She turns to him, whispers, "'m sorry," kisses him on the head and lips
She picks it up
Hello
(in Spanish now) No, no, 'll come and help, just keep watching her and don't do anything until  get there
'bye
Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn next to him as she's talking on the phone
She hangs up
She touches Gittes' cheek lightly
have to go
Gittes stares at her silently
Where
Just
have to
And  want to know where
(she starts out of bed) Please don't be angry
believe me, it's got nothing to do with you
(stopping her) Where are you going
(near tears) Please
Trust me this much
(she kisses him lightly) 'll be back
Look, there is something should tell you
The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag
The Albacore Club
It has to do with my father
know
He owns it
You know
saw him
(sitting up straight) You saw my fa
father
When
This morning
(panicked) You didn't tell me
There hasn't been a lot of time
She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe
What did he say
(insistent) What did he say
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do
Do
To who
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing
He wanted to know where she was
Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand
want you to listen to me
My father is a very dangerous man
You don't know how dangerous
You don't know how crazy
Give me an example
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't
That's what your father said
You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing
It's possible
Including the death of your husband
It's possible
Please don't ask me any more questions now
Just wait, wait for me
'll be back
need you here
She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door
Gittes stares at it a moment
Then leaps out of bed, rummages around, tosses on his trousers
He grabs his shoes, throws them on
Then hurries out of the bedroom
Running across the driveway to the garage
There are two cars there
Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard
Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door
- Checks the ignition
No key is in it
He pulls a couple of wires from under the dash, starts to mess with them, seems satisfied
Slides out across the seat, slams the door
Gittes hurries over to the Packard
He gets down on the driveway, lying on his back, bracing himself
With the heel of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the car
He shatters the red lens, gets up
He carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light beneath it
He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and hurries back toward the house
Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, the red and white lights coming
Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance from Evelyn in front of him
' Pulls up before a small little bungalow house
She gets out, looks up and down the street
There is nothing
She hurries on up the walkway to the front door
Idles the engine with the lights off
He brings the car a few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's
Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway
The curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on the side of the house
He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch
Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living room of the small house
In a moment he re-emerges back through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and pitcher on it
Around to the side of the house
He runs into shrubbery and a short picket fence
He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series of windows at the corner of the house
These all have shades on them
He can hear someone crying in the house
Someone else talking alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish
Here the windows have blinds
He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn
There's an inch or so of space at the bottom
Gittes can see the servant again
Evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision
After a moment someone rises  , obviously from lying on a bed
The figure is just a few feet from Evelyn
Her tear-stained face comes It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen with Hollis Mulwray
Mulwray's girlfriend
She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking in Spanish
Her words are not discernible but the tone is bitter, anguished
newspaper is strewn about the room
Evelyn kneels
She insists that the girl swallow down some pills
The girl reluctantly does
Continues to watch
Emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in
Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at her
Okay, give me the keys
(stunned, furious) You bastard
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself
The police
'mon, Mrs
Mulwray
You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there
She's not tied up
You know what  mean
You're keeping her there against her will
am not
Then let's go talk to her
Gittes starts to get out of the car
Evelyn grabs his arm, nearly screaming: No
Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn jacket
He looks at it and her
It seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them
(continuing) She's too upset
What about
Hollis' death
tried to keep it from her,  didn't want her upset before  could make plans for her to leave
You mean she just found out
Yes
That's not what it looks like, Mrs
Mulwray
What does it look like
Like she knows about Hollis' death
Like she knows more than you want her to tell
You're insane
Gittes explodes
Just tell me the truth
'm not the police
don't care what you've done
'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another 'm going to know
You won't go to the police if  tell you
will if you don't
long pause
Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, her hair covering her face
She's my sister
Evelyn is breathing very deeply now
Not crying, but the kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria
Gittes puts an arm on her shoulder
Take it easy
If it's your sister it's your sister
why all the secrecy
She lifts her head and looks up at him
He's genuinely puzzled
(really upset) can't
Because of Hollis
Because she was seeing your husband
Was that it
Jesus Christ, say something
Was that it
She nods
Gittes sighs
(finally) would never ever have harmed Hollis
loved him more than my own family
He was the most gentle, decent man imaginable
and he put up with more from me than you'll ever know
just wanted him to be happy
She begins to cry softly
(after a moment) took your husband's Buick
(he opens the car door) 'll return it tomorrow
Aren't you coming back with me
Don't worry
'm not telling anybody about this
That's not what  meant
There is a long moment of silence
Gittes looks over to Evelyn
Her hair covers most of her face from him
(finally) Yeah, well
'm very tired, Mrs
Mulwray
Good night
He gets out and slams the car door
She drives off
' The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head
Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down
He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it
' Pads around in elegant silk pajamas
He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in
He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of the covers, inert
Almost immediately the
Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying anything
(male) Gittes
Gittes
Yeah
Ida Sessions wants to see you
Who
0N Ida Sessions, you remember Ida
Gittes slowly rises to one elbow
Yeah
do
Sure you do
Well, tell you what, pal
If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office
He hangs up, falls back down
Gittes swears, picks it up
684 1/2 East Tensington
Echo Park
She begged me to call
She's waiting for you
Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead
Gittes pulls up
It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco
' Gittes at the front door
It's slightly ajar
He knocks
Nothing
He opens it and enters
Morning light filters through the half-open blinds
Dust particles in the shafts of light
It's still and empty
Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table
Gittes moves toward it
It is grotesque
When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce
Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum
Gittes walks on into the kitchen
Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees   lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag
Ice cream has melted around her
Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth
She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray
Gittes kneels over her
He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter
Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name
Screen Actors Guild card
Gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse
He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, which is all but empty
Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar
Gittes enters and turns on the light
Find anything interesting, Gittes
Escobar and another   stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door
Gittes turns around is now coming down the hall from the bedroom
Gittes looks at the two, doesn't reply
What are you doing here
Didn't you call
(jerk of his head toward the kitchen) How do you happen to know her
don't
(turning toward other room) Let me show you something
Escobar points to the number " 7279" on the side of one of the kitchen cabinets
Isn't that your number
Is it
forget
don't call myself that often
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring
He indicates one of his assistants
' (a slight sneer) What happened to your nose, Gittes
Somebody slam a bedroom window on it
(right back, smiling) Nope, your wife got excited, crossed her legs a little too quick
You understand, pal
The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him
Escobar steps between the two
(to other Assistant) Loach
(Escobar pulls out a drawer) How about these
Look familiar
In the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the veranda
(no point in denying it) Yeah,  took 'em
So what
How did she
(meaning the corpse) happen to have them
Gittes takes a deep breath
Either you tell me or  guess 'cause don't have the answer
Escobar nods
You really think 'm stupid, don't you, Gittes
don't think about it one way or the other
But if you want, give me a day or two, and 'll get back to you
Now 'd like to go home
want the rest of the pictures
What pictures
(meaning the corpse) This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray
Yeah
Yeah
Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered
heard it was an accident
'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes
Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs
Now how did he get that
in a fresh water reservoir
Gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains nonplussed
You were following him night and day
You saw who killed him
You even took pictures of it
It was Evelyn Mulwray
She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died
(smiling) You accusing me of extortion
Absolutely
don't think  need a day or two
You're even dumber than you think think you are
Not only that, 'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where  draw the line, Escobar
Yeah,  once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest
That's where she drew the line
(smiling) Well,  hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou
Escobar manages a thin smile
want those photographs, Gittes
We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion
Minimum
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit
Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir
This is a little telling
(continuing) Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean
And why's that
He found out somebody was dumping water there
That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him
This stops Escobar
He's dumbfounded by it
What are you talking about
'mon 'll show you
Escobar hesitates
(continuing) 'mon make a decision, Lou
You're in charge
The men around Escobar look to him
Escobar grudgingly nods
It yawns  , only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean
Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if they expect it to talk
(squinting in sunlight) It's too late
Too late for what
They only dump the water at night
runs down the side of the cliff and Over to Escobar
Reach anybody
Yelburton, he's the new chief
know who he is
Well
He says - know what he says
(to Gittes) Shut up
(to Assistant) Go on
Yelburton says they're irrigating in the valley
There's always a little runoff when they do that
And he says is Gittes knows that, and has been going around making irresponsible accusations for the last week
Escobar turns to Gittes
Stares at him for a long moment
Let's swear out a warrant for her arrest
What are we waiting for
(meaning Escobar) Because he just made lieutenant, and he wants to hang onto his little gold bar
Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes
Have your client in my office in two hours and remember
don't have to let you go
've got you for withholding evidence right now
Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway
He looks in the garage
Evelyn's car is gone
Only the Gardener's truck is there
Gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house
He rings the doorbell
Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries it
It's locked
He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the lock
The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at Gittes
Where's Mrs
Mulwray
No esta
Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room where luggage is packed and neatly piled
The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over the furniture
(indicating luggage) Is Mrs
Mulwray going someplace
(no answer) on a trip
vacation
No esta in casa
Gittes nods
He continues through the house and out back to the veranda
Is unsettled
Sees the Gardener working by the pond
He wanders a few yards in that direction
Spots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles
In turn, nods, smiles
Bad for glass
Breaks into a big grin
Nods again
Oh yes, bad for glass
He points to the newly mown lawn
(continuing) Salt water velly bad for glass
Can't quite believe what he's heard, Salt water
The Gardener nods vigorously
Points to the pond
Velly velly bad
Gittes has moved to the pond
He kneels
Clinging to the edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd looked closely, a starfish
It has one leg missing
The fifth point on the star is just beginning to grow back
Touches the water, tastes it
He licks his lips, then spots something glinting in the bottom of the pond
What's that
down there
The Gardener peers into the pond
(continuing) there
The Gardener spots it
He rolls up his trousers, gets in the pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching the water
He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an animal
Then he grasps it
He lifts it out of the water and holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking through the frame where one lens is shattered
The Gardener seems surprised
Gittes looks at the glasses
They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun
Gittes holds the phone to his ear
On the telephone table, lying on his handkerchief are the glasses
The Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily watching him
' Hello
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr
Cross
've got the girl
' You've got her
Where
Do you remember the figures we discussed
' Of course  do
Where are you
At your daughter's house
How soon can you get here
' Two hours
tell me, will Evelyn be there as well
Either that or she'll be in jail
' What are you talking about
Just bring your checkbook
Gittes hangs up
Gittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick
He hurries to the front door, pounds on it
The Chinese servant answers the door
You wait
(short sentence in Chinese) You wait
Gittes pushes past him
Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him hurries to the door
She takes Gittes' arm
How are you
was calling you
She looks at him, searching his face
Yeah
They move into the living room
Gittes is looking around it
Did you get some sleep
Sure
Did you have lunch
Kyo will fix you something
(abruptly) Where's the girl
Upstairs
Why
want to see her
she's having a bath now
why do you want to see her
Gittes continues to look around
He sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room
Going somewhere
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch
Why
Gittes doesn't answer
He goes to the phone and dials
Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar What are you doing
What's wrong told you we've got a 4:30
(cutting her off) You're going to miss your train
(then, into phone) Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide
It's above Santa Monica Canyon
yeah, soon as you can
What did you do that for
(a moment, then) You know any good criminal lawyers
(puzzled) No
Don't worry
can recommend a couple
They're expensive but you can afford it
(evenly but with great anger) What the hell is this all about
Gittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket
Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact
Evelyn stares dumbly at them
found these in your backyard
in your fish pond
They belonged to your husband, didn't they
didn't they
don't know
mean yes, probably
Yes positively
That's where he was drowned
What are you saying
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs
Mulwray
The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water
Just take my word for it
Now  want to know how it happened and why
want to know before Escobar gets here because  want to hang onto my license
don't know what you're talking about
This is the most insane
the craziest thing  ever
Gittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself
gets up, shakes her
Stop it
'll make it easy
You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head
It was an accident, but his girl is a witness
You've had to pay her off
You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up
Yes or no
no
Who is she
And don't give me that crap about it being your sister
You don't have a sister
Evelyn is trembling
'll tell you the truth
Gittes smiles
That's good
Now what's her name
Katherine
Katherine
Katherine who
She's my daughter
Gittes stares at her
He's been charged with anger and when Evelyn says this it explodes
He hits her full in the face
Evelyn stares back at him
The blow has forced tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself
said the truth
She's my sister
Gittes slaps her again
She's my daughter
Gittes slaps her again
My sister
He hits her again
My daughter, my sister
He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing
said  want the truth
(almost screaming it) She's my sister and my daughter
Kyo comes running down the stairs
(continuing; in Chinese) For God's sake, Kyo, keep her upstairs, go back
Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes back upstairs
My father and , understand, or is it too tough for you
Gittes doesn't answer
he had a breakdown
the dam broke
my mother died
he became a little boy
was fifteen
he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear
It happened
then  ran away
To Mexico
She nods
Hollis came and took
care of me
after she was born
he said
he took care of her
couldn't see her
wanted to but  couldn't
just want to see her once in a while
take care of her
that's all
but  don't want her to know
don't want her to know
so that's why you hate him
Evelyn looks slowly up at Gittes
No
for turning his back on me after it happened
He couldn't face it
(weeping) hate him
Gittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie
Yeah
where are you taking her now
Back to Mexico
You can't go by train
Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere
How about a plane
That's worse
Just get out of here
Walk out, leave everything
have to go home and get my things
'll take care of it
Where can we go
where does Kyo live
With us
On his day off
Get the exact address
Okay
She stops suddenly
Those didn't belong to Hollis
For a moment Gittes doesn't know what she's talking about
Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his handkerchief
How do you know
He didn't wear bifocals
Gittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is momentarily lost in them
From the stairs
She has her arm around Katherine
Say hello to Mr
Gittes, sweetheart
(from the stairs) Hello
Rises a little shakily from the arm of the sofa
Hello
With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn hurries her toward the bedroom
In a moment she re-emerges
(calling down) He lives at 1712 Alameda
do you know where that is
He nods slowly
Sure
It's Chinatown
Of bungalow Gittes watches Evelyn, the girl and Kyo head for Kyo's black dusty sedan
Gittes drops the curtain, heads swiftly to the phone
He dials
Sophie
is Walsh there
yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes
relax, 'll tell you
Wait in the office for two hours
If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda
' Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it
The front
know where it is
Just do it
Gittes hangs up and goes to the door
He opens it
No one is there
(not even bothering to look around the sides) Come on in, Lou
We're both too late
Escobar and his minions appear from either side of the door
Looks like she flew the coop
Escobar nods
don't suppose you got any idea Where she went
Matter of fact  do
Where
Her maid's house
think she knows something's up
What's the maid's address
She lives in Pedro
'll write it down for you
No, Gittes, you'll show us
What for
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up
(deliberately petulant) Gee, Lou, 'm doing the best  can
(shoving him toward the door) Tell us about it on the way to Pedro
29TH steep hill overlooks part of the harbor
Escobar's unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched on the steep hillside
That's it
Yeah
Well, let's go
Do me a favor, will you, Lou
Escobar waits
(continuing) Let me bring her down myself
she's not armed or nothing
she won't be any problem
'd just like a minute alone with her
It would mean something
to
her
and to me
Escobar shakes his head
For a moment it looks like it means no
You never learn, do you, Gittes
(a little chagrined) guess not
Give you three minutes
Gee, thanks, Lou
Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the stairs
He looks back down at Escobar
Gittes rings the bell
He waits
It opens
It's a  who's not recognizable
She's got the remnants of a black eye
Yes
Gittes looks past her to Curly, the fisherman from the first scene
He's seated at the dinner table with his father, his mother, and his children
Curly looks up in surprise
(happily) Mr
Gittes
Come in, come in
Gittes enters and closes the door
Curly rises and comes over to him, greets him happily
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr
Gittes
Call me Jake
How is everything
Just sitting down to supper, Jake
Care to join us
No thanks
How about a glass of wine
Honey, this is
(coolly) Yes,  know
Thanks just the same, Curly
could use a glass of water, though
Come out with me to the kitchen for a second
(puzzled) Sure thing
Curly, where's your car
In the garage
Where's that
Off the alley
Could you drive me somewhere
Sure, as soon as we eat
Right now, Curly
It can't wait
'll just tell my wife
(pulling him out the back door) Tell her later
They head out the back door and down the steps toward the garage
Curly pulls open the garage door
Gets in, starts the car, backs it out
It's an old, late twenties Plymouth Sedan
Gittes hops in
They take off
At the edge of the alley Gittes looks back
' Escobar is getting out of his car, moving towards the duplex
Gittes slips down in the seat
' Just drive slow for a block or two, will you, Curly
' What's this all about
' Tell you in a couple of blocks
How much do you owe me, Curly
(embarrassed) Oh, gee, Mr
Gittes we're going out tomorrow
know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick
Forget it
How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada
you'd have to leave tonight
don't know
might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you
Maybe an even hundred
Plus what  owe you
'll throw that in too
(smiling) Okay, you got yourself a boat
Carry bags out to Curly's car
Curly opens the door for the Maid
She gets in
He turns to Gittes
Tell Mrs
Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there
Then if don't show, take her down to the boat
(a little worried) You sure this is okay
(mildly indignant) Curly, you know how long  been in business
Curly nods, reassured
He gets in and takes off
By the pond, cigarette smoke drifts
car pulls up
In a moment Cross can be , looking
There you are
He walks toward Gittes who stands by the pond, smoking
(continuing) Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr
Gittes,  must say
where's the girl
've got her
Is she all right
She's fine
Where is she
With her mother
Cross' tone alters here
with her mother
Gittes pulls something out of his pocket and unfolds it
'd like you to look at something, Mr
Cross
(taking it) What is it
An obituary column
can you read in this light
Yes
think  can manage
Cross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of rimless glasses
He puts them on, reads
Stares at the bifocal lenses as Cross continues to look through the obituary column
He looks up
What does this mean
That you killed Hollis Mulwray
Gittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now
Right here, in this pond
You drowned him
and you left these
Cross looks at the glasses
the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs
(finally) Hollie was always fond of tide-pools
You know what he used to say about them
Haven't the faintest idea
That's where life begins
marshes, sloughs, tide-pools
he was fascinated by them
you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs
You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty
He made this city
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley
(after a long moment) No, Mr
Gittes
That's what  am doing with the Valley
The bond issue passes Tuesday
There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir
'm doing it
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting
That's all taken care of
You see, Mr
Gittes
Either you bring the water to
or you bring
to the water
How do you do that
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to
after all
It's very simple
Gittes nods
(then) How much are you worth
(shrugs, then) have no idea
How much do you want
want to know what you're worth
Over ten million
Oh, my, yes
Then why are you doing it
How much better can you eat
What can you buy that you can't already afford
(a long moment, then:) The future, Mr
Gittes
The future
Now where's the girl
want the only daughter  have left
as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago
(with sarcasm) Who do you blame for that
Her
Cross makes a funny little cock of his head
don't blame myself
You see, Mr
Gittes, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and right place, they're capable of anything
Take those glasses from him, will you, Claude
Mulvihill moves
Extends his hand for the glasses
Gittes doesn't move
It's not worth it, Mr
Gittes
It's really not worth it
Gittes hands over the glasses
Take us to the girl
Either Evelyn allows me to see her, or 'm not averse to seeing Evelyn in jail
If have to buy the jail
Hollis and Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen years
It's been too long, 'm too old
The streets are crowded
Here and there one can see Chinese in traditional dress
Driving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly lost in the crowd
They are walking toward a car parked near a laundry truck
Gittes sees them, keeps driving
(suddenly) Stop the car
Stop the car
Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes
Gittes elbows him
The car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost
Leaps out of the car shouting: Katherine
Katherine
Wait
Gittes is after him, grabbing him
Cross tries to swing at Gittes with his cane
Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit Gittes on the side of the head
The three men crash to the pavement
Starts out of the car toward Gittes
Gittes sees him
No, Curly, get 'em out of here
Get 'em out of here
He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the sidewalk, shaking gun loose
Mulvihill and Gittes try for it but someone else has it
Holds the gun
She's shaking but apparently in control of herself
Rises to his feet
Mulvihill starts to help Cross up
No, don't help him
Don't do anything
Mulvihill doesn't move
Cross rises on his own
Evelyn holds the revolver on him
She's gone
It's no good
Where
(moving to Evelyn) Let me handle that
(to Gittes) 'm all right
(she's not) Sure, but 'd like to handle it
Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her
You're going to have to kill me, Evelyn
Either that or tell me where she is
Evelyn is backing up
Cross moving on her
Evelyn cocks the pistol
How many years have  got
she's mine too
She's never going to know that
There's the  of a
Cross lunges toward her
Gittes grabs Cross
Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd
Gittes sees them
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill
(to Walsh) Jesus Christ,  didn't tell you to bring the police department with you
Jake, it's Chinatown
They're all over the place
You oughta know better
(to Walsh, meaning Cross) Gimme your keys
Watch this old fart, will you
(moving to Evelyn) Take Duffy's car
Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery
It's the Evening Star
He'll be waiting
'll take care of this
She looks to Gittes
He looks at her
She turns and he looks at her
She turns and Escobar is standing between her and it
Mrs
Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that
Oh, Christ
Escobar, you don't know what's going on
Let her go
'll explain it later
Mrs
Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law
It's a felony
Let her go
She didn't kill anybody
(starting toward her) 'm sorry, Mrs
Mulwray
Lou, she will kill you
Let her go for now
You don't know
Gittes, stay outta this
Escobar continues to move toward her
Gittes grabs him
(to Evelyn) Now take off
Evelyn gets in the car
She starts it
Gittes lets Escobar go
'll just have her followed
She's not going anywhere
There's a single
Both men look surprised
Down the block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his double-parked car
Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street
It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a halt
Gittes rushes to the car
He opens it
Evelyn falls out, inert
Blood is pouring from her right eye
(yelling) No
He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up
Cross himself elbows through
Where is he
'll kill him, 'll kill the son of a bitch
Several officers contain Gittes
(to Escobar) Who is he, get his name
'll kill him
(badly shaken) Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident
An accident
Gittes looks down
What he sees horrifies him
Cross is on the ground, holding Evelyn's body, crying
Get him away from her
He's responsible for everything
Get him away from her
(stunned) Jake, you're very disturbed
You're crazy
That's her father
Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd
(to them) You wanna do your partner the biggest favor of his life
Take him home
Just get him the hell out of here
Duffy bear hugs the protesting Gittes, along with Walsh, literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes trying to shake free
Through the crowd noises, Walsh can be heard saying, "Forget it, Jake
It's Chinatown
