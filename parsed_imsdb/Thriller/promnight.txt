Written by William Gray From a story by Bob Guza : - : April 27, 1973 All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny Friday afternoon
Cars idle in the driveway awaiting the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children
Two faded yellow buses stand ready
The lull is shattered by the  of the final
swarm of children pours out the door and down the broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward the cars and the buses
Moving slowly through the crowd,  and  , nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway
Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub- dued than the others
As they walk quietly down the stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a girl nearby
He is  , eleven years old, two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in school
The pretty girl laughing at his antics is , also eleven, Robin's older sister
'mon, Robin
( ) -w-where's -d-daddy
He's got a meeting at the high school
We're supposed to walk home with Kim
(sees Robin watching the young couple) She's too busy
Let's go by ourselves
-n-n-no, Alex
Let's w-w-wait
Why
Robin is staring at Nick
Alex looks, understands
He's angry
() You're crazy, 'm not waiting
() : He strides away
Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim
Nick says something to Kurt
She shakes her head and pains toward Robin
Robin quickly turns away as they look at her
When she glances back, Ki_m is walking towards her and Nick is bicycling away
Okay, let's go
The sisters start to walk across the lawn
-you 1-1-like him
Who
( ) -you know
Nick
Oh, he's all right,  guess
They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at her big sister
() Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him
Robin
Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand
They walk along the road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags
Sud- denly Kim halts
() Oh, damn
Robin looks up in surprise
() Debbie was gonna lend me her new record
Look, you go on home by yourself
Tell Mom 'll be a little late
Before Robin can reply, Kim is hurrying away

(2) Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch
As she turns off the main road into a side street, Robin passes a construction site
The empty skeleton of a half-finished apartment building looms up above the dark shade trees
Hearing , Robin stops to investigate

Robin moves closer, peering through the tall bushes surrounding the lot
She sees Nick playing in
the framework with three of his classmates
Robin recognizes  , and as Kim's two best friends
The fourth child,  , is a dark-haired girl, domin- eering and loud
As Robin watches, Wendy jumps up onto the floor of the building

' Who's the killer
You, Wendy
() you, Nick
Yes, Nick
() You'll never catch me
Hide your eyes, killer
As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex- posed beam, the children scatter through the structure
Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes counting, and whirls around
The killer is coming for you
He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill
," in a low monotone
As he disappears from view, Robin cau- tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the building

The killer strikes

Nick has caught her
Immediately Jude's    the "kill" chant in unison with Nick

Suddenly, she hears a
Ter- rified, she backs against a wall

As the three "killers" move through the vast structure searching for Wendy, ", "  off the walls and hardwood floors
Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im- mense unfinished lobby
Ominous shadows slash across the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless of the children
Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door
It slips off its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor
The is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is in the structure
Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting
The quickly  and she breathes a long sigh of relief
Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls
Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a "killer" searching for Wendy
As she moves past an empty room, she hears a
Robin stops and listens care- fully
Once again she hears the ,  this time, coming from nearby
Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and peers inside
In the darkness she can see nothing
Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room
The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly ajar
As Robin approaches, she hears a   from behind her
Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched behind a cardboard box in the corner
() You better not tell
Before Robin can react, she hears a  from above
Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an opening in the ceiling
Seeing Robin, then Wendy standing in the corner, he howls in triumph
() 5
: ( ) Here, killers, here
Nick's head disappears from the opening and Robin hears the  of
() Now you've done it, you idiot
The    as the "killers" rush towards the room
Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es- cape but finds nothing
Turning around suddenly, she grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face
(; ) Kill, kill, kill
Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin
Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room, bowling over Nick in the doorway
Delighted that the game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy in pursuit of Robin
Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, ", in her wake
As she rounds a corner, Jude ap- pears, looming up in front of her
Robin screams and sprints in the opposite direction
Kelly leaps out of a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out blindly, escapes the "killer
" -  3 Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a wall, gasping for breath
As her eyes adjusts to the darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through a hole in the floor to the basement below
Stacked up- right near the opening are several sheets of window glass
Before Robin can make a move towards the lad- der, she hears a horrible  and Wendy appears in the doorway, a vicious look on her face
Killers, here
Wendy advances
Terrified, Robin begins to back away
-n-n-no
() 6
: Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting "Kill, kill
" Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening
Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates
But as Wendy and her fellow "killers" close in on her, Robin continues down the ladder
Wendy rushes up and grabs the ladder
() -p-please
Wendy grins and shakes the ladder
The chanting is deafening
Robin hugs the wooden slats
Wendy shakes even harder
Robin screams
Nick moves around Wendy to get a better look
He accidentally bumps the glass stacked next to the opening
The sudden movement is just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and send it hurtling down directly at Robin
The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the glass slices through her neck
She is instantly decapitated
Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash to the concrete basement floor
Kelly screams
Jude sobs loudly
Nick can only stare in shock
Finally, he manages to speak
( ) We gotta get somebody quick
Nick starts to go
Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his arm
Are you crazy
They'll put us in jail
Confused, Nick cannot reply
The other girls grow silent
() If we tell anyone, they'll say it's our fault
Who'd believe it was an accident
Nick starts to protest
(; ) Listen to me
() () 7
: (2) (   ) We'll go home now and never ever tell anyone
They'll think it was an accident
1,10 one but us will ever know
She looks at each of them
They are still too numb to respond
() Everybody swear never to tell
Wendy glares at Jude
() Jude
() swear
Kelly
Kelly looks from Wendy to the mangled body and begins to whimper
(; ) Kelly
The frightened girl looks up at Wendy
() don't wanta go to jail
Swear

Wendy turns to Nick
At first he appears defiant, ready to object, but he wilts under her withering gaze
() won't tell
) Good
() : (3) With a final glance down at Robin's mutiliated body, Wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the room
As their   away across the hardwood floor, there is a terrible silence
Then, starting very quietly, more  are , this time a single person approaching the ladder from above
The - and a deep, black shadow falls across the ladder;   punctuates the oppressive quiet, growing louder and more anguished
: - We slowly    the tortured features of , Robin's father
handsome, dark-haired man in his late thirties, he teaches history at George Winston High School
Wracked with grief, he stands near the opening in the floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body of his daughter from the dark basement
young Policeman standing nearby raises the white sheet covering Robin's remains
Hammond steps up and gazes at his daughter's decapitated body look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes on his face; what he sees he will never forget
Paralyzed, Hammond barely hears the in front of the construction site
He turns and looks out the window
-  5 Police Officer is getting out of his car
Walking around to the passenger side, he opens the door for an attractive blonde woman in her mid-thirties
, Robin's mother, appears pale and haggard as she steps out of the car
Kim and Alex slowly climb out of the back, With the Police Officer escorting her, Vivian and her children move toward the skeleton of a building
Catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window, Vivian suddenly breaks
away from the Police Officer and runs inside the building
- Hammond moves quickly to the door, grabbing his hysterical wife as she bursts into the room
: No
( ) Where is she
Where is Robin
Seeing the covered figure lying on a stretcher, Vivian moans in anguish
Struggling furiously, she strains to break her hus- band's hold, but he is too powerful
They are both in tears, shaking with grief, when Kim and Alex step into the doorway
) Daddy
(angrily, ) Why did you bring them here
Vivian collapses, burying her head in his shoulder and sobbing furiously, but Hammond pushes her out of the room
` 0 () Kim
Alex
Stay out in the hallway
Kim stumbles out into the corridor and begins to cry softly
Alex takes his mother's hand and tries comfort her
The Paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it out of the room
As they pass through the doorway into the corridor, a corner of the sheet slips off Robin's corpse
Before a Paramedic can replace it, the de- capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family
Alex is shocked
Kim doesn't appear to realize what she sees
But Vivian's horror wells up in her throat, bursting out in a deranged scream
: - Another , as throbbing   pulsates from a large portable  sitting on a dresser

Turn that music down
You're driving me crazy
Turning around at the  of her mother's , Kim Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen, she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open, innocent quality
( ) Okay, Mom
Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room to the pounding disco rhythm
Giving her hair a few final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph of a young man stuck in her mirror
On the picture is written: "To Kim, the best on the floor
dancing, that is
Love, Nick
" Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror
This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be- fore the accident
Her sadness passes as quickly as it came
Gathering her textbooks, she switches  the and exits

- Raymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break- fast
The years have favored him; except for a touch of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he looks much the same way as we remember him
Vivian, however, wears the strain of the past seven years in her gaunt, drawn features and high-strung manner
Thumbing through his morning newspaper, Hammond steals quick glances at his wife
She does not look up at him, but stares at the table, toying with her spoon
() 8 : (reading the paper) 'll tell you, Vi, 'm thinking of starting up an armed robbery course at the high school
've got a feeling it'd be popular
He smiles at his joke, looks at her
She doesn't seem to have heard him
() just hope there's no trouble at the prom tonight
Kim bursts into the kitchen, interrupting her father with a kiss on the head
() Mmmm, sounds like fun
() And how is the next queen of the Winston High Junior-Senior Prom
Scared tiff
She leans over to kiss her mother
Vivian automatical- ly turns her cheek to Kim without looking at her
() Morning, Mom
We got any yogurt
( ) No, dear
Fix yourself a good meal
You're getting awfully thin
Kim and her father exchange glances
He shrugs who's your lucky escort tonight
You know, Daddy
Nick
() 1L, : (2) ` () 've been trying to forget
The boy's too sure of himself
() Mom, tell him
() Seven years ago today
Hammond carefully folds his paper and places it on the table
HAMI12TOND (affects a casual ) Vi,  made you an appointment with Dr
Fairchild
Vivian finally looks up at him
() It's this morning, actually
Sorry  forgot to mention it
Today
( ) You'd better get ready
He's fitting you in early before his other
people
() It doesn't help
You know that
Now, Vi
Vivian stumbles to her feet and rushes out of the kitch- en before he can finish
With a glance at Kim, Hammond hurries after his wife
Going out through the swinging door, he bumps into a young man just entering
HAM4OND () Morning, Alex

Alex, now sixteen, a tall, slender boy, casts a knowing look at Kim
Kim nods
Alex
shakes his head, then begins to rummage through the Pantry, pulling out a Hostess viTikie
lopping down at the table, he flips open his electronics book and begins to read
Munching on his Twinkie, he swipes sips from Kim's glass of milk
Have you got a date for tonight
His mouth crammed
full of Twinkie, Alex mumbles his reply
() happen to know Jude might be available
Of course, she is older, but
Alex almost chokes
'mon, Kimbo,  may be hard up
Alex
Jude's cute
Besides, she's funny and really smart
Give you somebody to do equations with
() Great
Anyway, 'm in charge of the sound system tonight
Not bad but it's not romance
It'll do for tonight
Kim shoots him a look, then backs off
If you get a chance, dance with Jude once or twice, okay
Sure
He returns her glass of milk, empty
() 8 : (4) 8 () Any more milk

- Hammond and Vivian are standing by the fireplace
His hand is on her shoulder
She faces the mantel, her back to him
On the mantel is a small shrine to the memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph, fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a glass case
Trust me
Vivian does not move
Finally, after a long pause, she turns toward her husband
Her eyes filled with tears, she nods
10
() -  10 Hammond is driving
Vivian stares blankly out the win- dow at the grimy city streets
Sitting in the back, Kim and Alex exchange uncertain glances
tense si- lence pervades
11
-  11 The Hammonds' car pulls up in front of a towering modern building
12
-  12 Hammond cuts off the engine and turns to Kim and Alex
'll just be a minute
Vivian is already reaching for the door handle, 13
-  13 Alex jumps out of the car and opens the door for his mother
Taking her arm, he helps her out
Kim leans over in the back seat
See you later,'Mom
Vivian gives her a thin smile
Hammond takes her arm and leads her into the imposing building

14
-  14 Hammond and Vivian cross the room
Though she offers no resistance, it appears he is pulling her along
They hurry into an elevator after an elderly carrying a mop and a bucket
15
-  15 They stand in silence
The Cleaning Woman puffs on a cigarette, blithely ignoring the   sign posted on the wall
Vivian nervously reaches into her purse and removes a bottle of Valium
Quickly popping two pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and snaps her purse shut
Hammond says nothing
Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo- man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump in fright
Could  have one of those
My nerves are shot this morning
With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian rushes out of the elevator
Hammond follows
16
-  16 Hammond and Vivian move down the long, empty hallway
As they round a corner, a figure is visible unlocking a door
` ( ) Dr
Fairchild
straightens up and turns around
He's a
portly man in his fifties, trying to disguise his girth with careful tailoring
17
-  17 Fairchild bustles about the reception area, turning on lights, checking his messages and appointment calendar
Fairchild is obsessively neat, the office reflects him
We appreciate your seeing
us
know how busy you must be
Vivian is staring at a painting of a young girl playing with a kitten
Catching Fairchild's eye, Hammond nods toward the outer door
Vivian does not notice the gesture
() 17 : 17 Fairchild nods in return
Stepping over to his inner office, he opens the door
Have a seat, Vivian
'll be right in
She slowly crosses the room, turning suddenly in the doorway
( ) Don't forget we're going to the cemetery this afternoon
want Robin to have her flowers
Hammond moves over to his wife
Taking her by the shoulders, he kisses her lightly on the forehead
won't forget
Vivian looks from Hammond to Fairchild, who smiles
She enters the office, leaving the door open
Hammond shakes hands with Fairchild, and for Vivian's benefit adds
HAi12I`i () Thank you, Doctor
Hammond exits

-  18 Hammond leans against the wall outside Fairchild's of- fice
He glances at his watch
The door opens and Fairchild steps out, holding a container
Hammond walks with him down the corridor towards the water fountain
She's at it again
() Today's the date
Seven years ago today Robin was killed
Fairchild looks up from filling his container with water

The twins
How is Alex
Fine
just thank God he was too young to really understand what happened to his sister
And your older daughter
() Kimmy's my princess
Sometimes she'll get depressed for a while
but it never lasts long
Young people seem so much more
resilient
They walk back to the office
(looking up at Hammond) And yourself
No scars

Vivian seems worse this time
() The persistence of Vivian's trauma
wonder if there isn't something more serious at work here
Something more serious than her daughter's death

She seems very small and vulnerable in the large, somber office

Kim is in back
Easy listening   softly on the car

After a moment, realizing she is safe, the girl giggles nervously and skips away

You all right
They both nod
Alex massages his wrist
Hammond slips the car into gear and cautiously continues driving
You're worried about Mom

He is interrupted by    the
Play- ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass over the music
Hey, keep that
Alex groans but does as she asks
Disco sucks

The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot
They pile out
23
-  23 Hammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot towards the school
Suddenly, we  a loud coming from nearby
The sudden noise startles Kim and she huddles against her father
seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing a pair of electric hedge clippers
Good morning, Mr
Sykes
, the newly-hired custodian, bares his yellow teeth in a crooked grin and waves the whirring blades in salute
Kim shudders and stays close to her father as they walk on
He's creepy

The man is not
wacko
Kelly says he's a pervert, spying on the girls undressing in the locker room
Sykes may have some problems, but he's no Peeping Tom
He's been thoroughly checked out

Hammond glances at his watch
() You're early today
Plenty of time to study with no one to bother you
Kim reaches up
and kisses her father on the cheek
Pulling out a fashion magazine, she rushes off, call- ing back over her shoulder
'
ve got to decide on my hair style for tonight
() Wonderful
Alex
'm building an atomic bomb in shop
Smiling, he moves inside
Hammond shakes his head and hurries off
24
-  24 Hammond moves through the empty hallway, stopping at a door which reads: :
He is fumbling for his key when he sees through the frosted glass a figure moving around in his office
Reaching for the doorknob, he very quietly opens the door
25
25 As the door slowly swings open, Hammond sees the outer office covered with pieces of paper; sheets are scattered across desks and chairs and over most of the floor
Stepping inside, Hammond spies a bending over, frantically picking up paper from the floor
He slams the door
At the sudden , the startled Woman whirls around, still squatting, and falls on her rear
Who are you

25 : 25 Flustered, the attractive young Woman hastily gets to her feet and straightens her skirt

Hey, beautiful, need a lift

No thanks

The room glows tgith a crystalline light sparkling off the silver decorations put up for the Prom
Stretched across the bleachers is a banner reading: " " Gazing around, Kim feels the excitement of anticipation
Imagining herself in Nick's arms, she begins to dance, whirling through the gym to the music in her head
Suddenly, someone is clapping, slowly

Standing onstage, watching her, is Wendy

At the last moment, he tucks in and hits the water in a flipped over cannonball
He surfaces to a chorus of whistles and cheers
It was a close shave
You wanta take care of yourself, man
Kim's expecting a lot from you tonight
Nick laughs

Hammond is nowhere to be seen

Hammond steps in, gazes around
The gym is empty, silent
He walks to the stage steps, climbs up, pushes through the thick curtain
51
-  51 It's a dark cluttered area broken up by tall partitions, discarded flats from old student productions, banks of lights
Hammond crosses to a rear door, tries it
It's locked
He turns back
As he does so there's a sudden row of spotlights flashes on right in front of him, almost blinding him
He tries to shield his eyes

He turns, climbs down the stage steps and starts back across the gym

() -  52 First period biology class features  , a tall, thin Englishman in his late thirties
This stuf- fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex- ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps, daydreams or passes notes
Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively opening a handwritten note
She quickly reads it
Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply
Jude tears out part of a page from her biology book and scrawls her answer
Folding the note, she taps the boy next to her and motions for him to pass it on
Vicki grabs the note from the boy
Quickly scanning it, she nods, impressed
Kim reads it and mouths the word "Wow" to Jude who blushes happily
Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk- ing past
Seeing her in class, he stops and waves
Jude frantically tries to motion him away
Their backs to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude gestures in their direction
Seeing her friends watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick
Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class
Jude laughs in spite of herself
Kim and Vicki turn around
Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im- itation of the eminently boring Weller
Their surprise turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be Jude's prom date
Kim holds up the note, raising her eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick
Jude nods
Kim and Vicki can barely contain their laughter
They do not notice Mr
Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he rattles on about frog intestines
Slick mouths the words, "See you at lunch
, in the van
" Jude nods and smiles
With a final bow and a wave, he exits
Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr
Weller looming above her
Miss Hammond
Wide-eyed, Kim desperately tries to crush the note in her hand
() 52 : 52 () Since you obviously find your own words more interesting than those of Farnsworth on the anatomy of a frog
(pauses to share his wit with the class) , read the note
(barely a whisper) Read the note
() Now, Miss Hammond
Kim swallows and steals a quick glance at her friends
Vicki winces
Jude tries to disappear beneath her, seat

Kim looks from Jude to Vicki
But, Mr
Weller, tonight's the prom

He spins on his heel and marches back to his desk
The three girls hurriedly exit

() -  53 hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston High yearbook, the back pages where the individual photographs of graduating students are placed
The hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head shot of Nick McBride
The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures -with similar torn edges
The other pictures are of Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards
The yearbook is slammed shut
54
-  54 Kim, Jude and Vicki enter the crowded room
from several portable  can be  above the clamor as the girls move into the long lunch line
Kim spots Alex seated nearby and waves to him
() 4L
54 : 54 ( ) Here comes the incredible hunk himself
Jude looks up to see Slick slowly making his way down the line towards them
He is carrying a tray piled high with snack food: potato chips, cookies, candy
Jude smiles as he passes her, grinning
Looks like a party
Yeah --  don't think he's gonna be too good for my diet
Slick moves down the lunch line
Suddenly he is bumped from behind, sending the tray and the snacks flying across the room
Looking around, Slick jumps back, startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask
() Hey, clown, what the
Three of Lou's gang quickly step up behind the masked figure
Say what
() Forget it, Lou
() That's what  figured
Slick bends over to pick up his lunch
() Asshole
Lou and his friends shove ahead in the line until he is standing behind Kim
Lou nuzzles Kim's neck
(muffled by the mask) Like me better now
() 43
54 : (2) 54 Startled, Kim spins around
Her fear quickly becomes anger
It's an improvement
She turns her back to him
You like it so much
(spins her around to ) Have a taste
He kisses her hard on the mouth
Swinging at him, Kim breaks away
Laughing, Lou grabs her wrists and rough- ly pulls her to him
Alex instantly jumps to his feet
(; holding Kim close) Be nice
Alex leaps over the metal railing separating the line from the tables
Crashing into Lou, he drives the larger boy back into the salad counter, sending food and utensils flying
As they tumble off the counter onto the floor, Alex gets in several furious punches before Lou's gang can pry him loose
Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter
Wiping blood from his mouth, Lou grins maliciously and slugs Alex in the stomach
The boy groans and doubles over
Lou grabs Alex's hair and slams his head back against the glass shield of the counter
As Lou rears back to throw another punch, his two friends suddenly release Alex and scatter
The boy crumples to the floor
Lou turns around to see two rapidly approaching
The larger teacher grabs Lou
This time you're out, Perano
Lou points to Alex who is being helped up from the floor
He started i 'll bet
Alex
() 54 : (3) 54 Alex nods, leaning on the other teacher for support
That's not true
Alex was trying to help me
The teacher looks from Kim to Lou to Alex
You'd better come along to your father's office
() Wonder who'll get off with just a warning
Several students laugh
The two Teachers march Lou and Alex through the silent cafeteria
Lou swaggers bask- ing in the attention
Alex walks with his head bowed
They exit
55
-  55 Lou and Alex accompany the teachers down the corridor toward the principal's office
Nick and Wendy approach from the opposite direction, talking heatedly
don't care who
Just somebody else
() You never had it so good as with me
've got it now

() You don't even know

The surprised Lou tries to stop but the Teachers hurry him and Alex past the couple
Wendy watches Nick

55 : 55 ' Wendy turns to see Nick's reaction but he is already walking towards the cafeteria
The irate girl glares after him
56
-  56 Hammond is talking on the telephone
He appears agi- tated, running his fingers through his hair and tugging at the knot in his loosened tie
() No, Vi
didn't forget
told you we'd go to the cemetery
The door opens and Adele Cooper's head peers around the corner
Seeing Hammond talking on the phone, she nods toward the outer office
Hammond gestures for her to wait
She persists until he angrily takes the receiver from his ear and covers the mouthpiece
() What is it
() There are some gentlemen here to see you, Mr
Hammond
Can't it wait
didn't ask
But one looks a little like that child in the picture on your desk
Hammond automatically glances at the photograph of Robin framed alongside one of the rest of his family
(into the receiver) 've got to go now, Vi
We'll be there within the hour
There's a loud  on the other end of the line
() Damn
() 46
56 : 56 Frustrated, Hammond slams the receiver into its cradle
() All right, send them in
The two Male Teachers enter first, followed by Lou and finally Alex
Hammond gives his son a sharp look, then turns to glare at Lou
( ;) You again
() Brawling in the cafeteria
both of them
He places Lou's ski mask on Hammond's desk
The prin- cipal glances at it
() Thank you
'll handle it
The Teachers exit
() Explanations
He looks at Alex
The boy stares at the floor and says nothing
Hammond holds the mask up to Lou
() Halloween

() Kim
Hammond frowns
when this -- your son tackled me and
() Is this true, Alex
() 47
56 : (2) 56 () knew It
Hammond whirls on him
You knew what
It just figures
(his voice rising ) That 'll play favorites
That 'll go easy on Alex because he's my son
(pauses, waiting for Lou to back down and ) Damn right  will
You're a disgrace to this school and this community
( ) You're suspended -- indefinitely
Now get out
() What about your son
() If you're not off school grounds in five minutes, 'll have you arrested for trespassing
Lou stalks to the door
Opening it, he turns to Alex
See you around
He exits, slamming the door
( ) Have the nurse take a look at you, then get back here
Alex exits
Hammond angrily grabs Lou's ski mask and hurls it at the trash can_ 48
57
-  57 Kim and Vicki are sprawled on the grass eating lunch
Lou storms down the front steps
Pausing at the bottom, he turns, strolls over to Kim
Watch for me, little girl
You know 'm just a kiss away
Lou laughs and walks off toward the parking lot
Kim shudders
Wendy's white Mustang slides up to the curb
The pass- enger window rolls down and Lou leans over to look in- side
After a moment he climbs in and the out of the lot, leaving twin black tread marks in its wake
What a pair
Made for each other
Kim opens a carton of yogurt
You wearing that green gown tonight
You kidding
That was last year

- Wendy's white Mustang streaks through traffic, dodging in and out of lanes, running yellows, burning around corners
59
59 Lou sits pinned to the passenger seat, eyes wide, staring straight ahead as if he can't quite believe this trip
His bravado seems to have left him
He glances over at Wendy in the driver's seat
She's puffing on a cigarette, handling the wheel almost casually
She's in control, 60
- 60 The Mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left turn, narrowly beating a horn-honking oncoming van
The big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps into the end slot at a sprawling fast-food drive-in
61
61 Lou's still pinned to his seat
Wendy shuts off the engine, looks at him
He looks at her, lets out a long deep breath
cute little - in a cut-off costume and roller skates glides over
She leans into Wendy's window, talks through a wad of gum
- Ready to order
( ) What do you want
Lou's shifting around in his seat, pulling himself together
'm uh
a little short on cash
You can owe me
Yeah
Okay then, a couple of burgers, a large fries
what kind of beer you got
- 'mon man, this is a drive-in not a bar

Whatta you mean, serious

don't want anyone hurt
not badly
You got it

Lou, shouldn't we go over this
Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her
'll take care of it, Scout's honor
Don't worry about it
() Di
61 : (2) 61 He caresses her cheek and lips, then kisses her
At first reluctant, Wendy quickly takes over
When they finally break from their passionate clinch, he is gasping
() Jesus Christ
Don't worry about it
She unbuttons his shirt and begins to kiss and lick his chest
Slowly she works her way down
Lou begins to writhe
Wendy's head disappears from
Lou's eyes snap open in surprise
Wendy groans
Damn stick shift
Lou starts to protest, then dissolves

-  62 The Car-hop wheels up to the Mustang carrying a tray loaded with food
She leans over and peers inside
Wendy is behind the wheel, perfectly composed
mind- blown Lou is hurriedly doing up his belt, tucking in his shirt
He glances at the Car-hop then turns away to finish the job
- Enjoy your meal

Above the bluffs there's a narrow shaded park and then the buildings and parking lots of Winston High
63 : Nick and Kim walk slowly along the rim of the bluffs
Nick has his arm around her
She leans into him
am excited, it's just
in some ways it's such an awful day
It's Robin's day
64
64 My mother's all upset, as usual
My father too
he doesn't show it so much
It's hard to get over something like that
Robin would have been a junior, like Alex
This would've been her first prom
guess that's'why it seems so much worse this year
She stops, turns and faces Nick
It's hard for him to meet her gaze
() The Queen of the Prom is determined not to let it get to her
She must maintain her

She tries a weak smile
Nick stares at her, then sud- denly takes her, pulls her to him, embraces her
She's caught by surprise, but she responds
She smiles

Kim reacts
That's my father

Yeah

She hesitates a moment, then kisses him quickly, turns and goes
Nick looks shaken up
He stares after her as she hurries away
Behind Nick, in the other corner of the parking lot, a metal door slides open, loud   and  sud- denly infests the air
Nick turns, sees Jude climbing out of Slick's van
Jude looks about as stoned as she can get
She spots Nick, waves
Hey, Nick
Nick turns and heads the other way

65 : 65 She doesn't react, she keeps playing with the flowers
Hammond moves in behind her, puts his hands on her shoulders
She looks at him
() We have to get back
She stands, with her husband's support
Kim and Alex are standing quietly at the foot of the grave
Vivian looks at them both
Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a terrible sadness
Hammond carefully guides her away
Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she drops on her sister's grave
She turns, meets Alex's stare, moves off after her parents
Alex remains a mo- ment longer, then
he, too, goes
66 During the afternoon phys
ed
class, the girls play tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude
Sykes lingers nearby, watching the girls
Their instructor is Miss - , a stocky woman in her late thirties with teased, lacquered hair
product of genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing a silver whistle hanging from her neck
very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa- sionally even back over her head
Each time a ball flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the delight of Sykes
At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under Sykes' appreciative gaze
The shrill  inter- rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over
- ( ) No, no, Miss Cantrell
Never bend from the waist
Squat
() Always squat to retrieve
Otherwise, you look like the broad side of a barn
(glares at Sykes) Isn't that so, Mr
Sykes
Embarrassed, the custodian scuttles away to the girls' Laughter
66 : 66 - () That's enough for today, ladies

Kelly takes Jude aside as Kim and Vicki approach Henri Anne

She said that
Well, not exactly
- Oh, Kim

Kim, wide-eyed, can only look at Vicki
He keeps making Kim stay after school in detention study hall for no reason
Just so he can be near her
- That's horrible
Kim gulps
- () You mean to tell me that awful man girl half his age
(a very slight ) So you have detention this afternoon
Kim nods meekly
Lost in thought, Henri-Anne fondles a tennis ball, a curious smile playing across her face
- (; ) Leave everything to me
She hurries away
Kim turns on Vicki and starts to protest
() It worked, didn't it
67
-  67 Kim and Vicki, and behind them, Jude and Kelly are walking back to the gym and the dressing rooms from the tennis courts
Vicki's in high spirits and Jude still can't stop giggling
Vicki spots old Sykes heading out toward the playing field
She calls out to him
() 57- 67  67 Mr
Sykes
Vicki, don't
Oh, Mr
Sykes
Sykes stops, turns around
() This is just for you
She turns, bends over, quickly yanks down her shorts and moons him
There's a squeal of laughter from Jude and from Kelly
Vicki whips her shorts back up and runs to the gym door, the other girls in pursuit
Kim looks back at Sykes
He's just standing in the field, not moving
There's a look in his eyes
68
'   -  68 Kim and Kelly are undressing
Three girls pass them headin g for the showers

Wendy is standing in front of a mirror drying her hair
Kim ignores her and Wendy returns the compliment

Wendy finishes brushing her hair, shoots Kim

Shaking her head, Wendy returns to her locker
() 70 : 70 She's about to shut it when she sees something, a pic- ture, taped to the side of the door
It's her photo, torn from the School Yearbook
She rips it from the door, looks at it
() What's this for, Melanie
Her voice echoes through the empty room
She gazes around, fear creeping into her face
She quickly finishes dressing, grabs her books, turns to leave
Suddenly she screams

Behind her, Wendy's are

Melanie thinks it's hilarious

Wendy storms in

She waves it at Kim and Kelly
What's this supposed to mean

She storms out
Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly, shrugs, follows Wendy
in the locker room
Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their faces back to the steaming water
Neither one hears the  across the room, a Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her eyes
, She squints out through the steam at the big wall mirror across the room
She sees something
She steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear
Watch it
Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against the wall, terrified
Suddenly there's an  of
Kim screams, jumps back, stares
There's a jagged hole in the cen- ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it, spidering across its surface
For a moment no one moves
Splinters of down to the floor
There's no other sound
Kim grabs for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks
There's no one
She heads for the locker room door
Kelly runs after her

72 Kim rushes into the room, Kelly right behind her
There's no one
Kelly is quivering
She clutches at Kim's arm
Kim looks at her
What did you see
Kelly just shakes her head
Just

a shadow or

Kim heads for the exit door across the room
Kelly stays with her
73
73 Kim opens the outside door, peers down the walkway to the tennis courts, playing fields
There's no sign of anyone
She closes the door
74
74 Kim turns back
to Kelly who's started to cry
Someone was there
Someone was
in there
Kim is taking charge
She moves cautiously back to the shower room door, opens it, looks in
She gasps
() What
What
s wrong
Kelly's on the edge of hysteria
She runs over to Kim
They both look
75 '  '  75 What the girls see is the mirror
Something has changed
long wedge of glass has been lifted out o it
76    76 Kim shuts the door, presses against it, stares at Kelly

Seven years bad luck
She tries to smile
Kim just looks at her

-  79 Kim turns a corner, heading for class, and almost runs into Sykes, cleaning the floor
Sykes turns
For a moment their eyes lock
Then Kim hurries away, almost running
Sykes stares after her
80
(' ) -  80 Kim comes down the hallway and stops at the door
There's a piece of paper with a hastily scrawled mes- sage taped there
It heads: "Detention Postponed Until Monday --

) Did it work
Kim is startled, turns
Vicki and Jude and approach- ing
Vicki hurries to the door, reads the note

80  : 80 () It worked
She lets out a whoop, embraces Jude
Kim stands back, somehow less impressed
81
-  81 Several students are putting last-minute touches on the decor as Kim comes in
Huge speakers are being hoisted on pulleys to hang from the ceiling
vast, raised platform covers much of the gym floor, its plexiglass surface designed to be illuminated from below
Perched on a ladder, Weller is hanging shimmering silver strips while Henri-Anne Benton supervises from the disco floor
- Careful, Monty

Something came up

Henri-Anne mercifully interrupts him
- Let's get started
( ) Nick
Nick pokes his head out of the sound booth set on a platform near the stage
- () Onstage
Tell Alex we're ready
Alex emerges from the booth
, a pudgy, fifteen-year-old sophomore and Alex's technical assis- tant, leans out behind him
() 81 81 : All set, Miss Benton
Just have Davy roll the tapes
- Wonderful
You can be Mr
Hanunond for the rehearsal
Alex groans
Kim smiles as Nick joins her
She takes his hand, clutches it
They start to walk away, talk- ing quietly
Nick puts his arm around her
- () Nick
Kim
Come with me
Henri-Anne bounds up onto the stage
Kim and Nick fol- low her behind the curtain
82
() -  82 Henri-Anne takes Kim to one of the wings of the dark cluttered area
- You'll wait here
(looks around for ) Nick
Nick silently creeps from behind a partition and moves up directly behind Henri-Anne
He mimes choking her, a crazed expression on his face
Kim has to laugh at his clowning
- ; ) Nick
() Scary place
- You have to stand up here tonight, not me
If you don't know what to do, you'll look the fool
Nick glances at Kim
She shrugs
() 65- 82 : 82 - ( ) Come along
Nick follows her to the opposite wing
Kim cannot see them from her position
- (continuing; calls out) Can you hear me, Kim
) Yes
Kim leans against a wall, gazing around at her gloomy surroundings
She does not hear the  - coming from behind a nearby partition
She does not see Wendy and Lou lurking there, watching her
- () All right, Alex, start the tape

Kim begins to cross the stage
She smiles when she spots Nick
The curtain slowly opens
() The King and Queen of the George Winston High School Junion-Senior Prom for 1980 -- Nick McBride and Kim Hammond
They meet backstage center and turn towards the parting curtain
Henri-Anne stands at the front of the stage, her hand resting on Alex's shoulder, as Kim and Nick proceed downstage
() 66
82 : (2) 82 () () These two seniors were selected by their fellow students as the most popular boy and girl in the class
(to Kim as they ) Bullshit
Kim smiles
Peeking out from behind the curtain, Wendy turns to Lou
() Bullshit
() Shhh
() Nick is a three-sport letterman and president of the Key Club
He plans to attend State University in the fall
Because he can't get in anywhere else
() Kim is the head cheerleader and ranked number one on the girls' tennis team
She hopes to become a teacher
If she ever graduates
Nick and Kim stop downstage center
- ( ) Now, Alex
Self-consciously, Alex stumbles up to Kim and pretends to give her a bouquet of roses
() 67
82 : (3) 82 - () That's it, Alex
Now kiss her
My sister
- Alex
Alex awkwardly kisses Kim on the cheek
- () Now the king
Kiss the king

- You'll descend the steps
Nick and Kim climb down from the stage

Nick and Kim self-consciously cross the room, aware that everyone is watching them
- () Wait for the spotlights and your music cue, then dance
() It'll be beautiful
83
-  83 Kim strides down the empty corridor, flushed and ex- cited from the rehearsal
Arriving at her father's of- fice, she flings open the door
84
-  84 Kim enters and surveys the apparently empty office
Hearing  and  from behind the desk, Kim steps around and sees Adele Cooper stretched across the floor
The secretary is practicing her "Rainbow" exer- cise, arching her body towards the ceiling while keep- ing her hands and feet on the floor
Hello
Adele twists her head around to look at Kim
Her "Rainbow" collapses
Spinning around, Adele sits cross-legged on the floor and smiles at Kim
You okay
Yeah
've calmed down a bit
() 69
84 : 84 Adele launches into another contortion
This works for me
Has my father been back
Nope
Haven't seen him all afternoon
And he didn't leave a message
Not a word
() Strange
He usually gives me a ride home
Let me finish and 'll give you a lift
Thanks, but  can walk
Kim starts to leave, turning around at the door
() Guess  won't be seeing you again
Standing on her head, Adele smiles
Guess again
Three different students asked me to the prom tonight
thought you had to be enrolled
You're going
() Not with any of them
Know any good-looking fathers
) 70
84 : (2) 84 () - 'll keep my eyes open
See you later
She exits as Adele slowly lowers her legs to the floor
85
-  85 Jude approaches her locker, stops
There's a picture taped to her locker door, her picture, ripped out of the Winston High Yearbook
She looks at it, reaches up and pulls it off the door
She winces, looks at her finger
It's bleeding
She looks at the picture
There's a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it
Jude hears
She turns to see Kelly com- ing toward her
Jude
look
She has something in her hand
It's a photo of her, a, Yearbook photo with the same torn edges
Jude holds up her version
() Why
86
-  86 The   open
light is flicked on
Sykes stands there, a broom and a big waste-pan in his hands
He stares at the broken mirror with its center hole and its missing wedge
He shuffles across the floor and starts to clean up the debris
87
'  -  87 The split-level suburban residence sits on a tree-lined street in an older, middle-class neighborhood
Walking up the driveway, Kim hears a   from behind the house
As the  , Kim walks around back to investigate
88
'  -  88 Stepping around the corner of the house, Kim sees her father furiously chopping an old stump in the flower garden
() / l
88 : 88 Hammond's axe slashes into the rotten wood, sending splinters flying in all directions
Kim watches him work
He appears angry and upset
Hi
Oblivious, Hammond buries the axe in the stump
Kim moves around to face him
When he sees her, Hammond jumps, startled
didn't hear you
() Sorry
Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Hammond struggles to catch his breath
'm getting too old for this
Why are you doing it now
Your mother's been hounding me to get it done
You got nay message
() No
() told that woman to tell you had a meeting and couldn't drive you home
Your secretary
() Idiot
liked her
Hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump
() 72
88 : 2) 88 () You okay
` () This thing with your mother
Have you seen her yet
No
How is she
() One minute she's depressed, the next she's bubbling over like a child
She wants to go with me tonight
Great
'm not so sure
think getting dressed up and going out might be good for her
",24OND She's had a bad day, Kim
'm not sure she can handle it
See if you can talk to her
Hammond picks up the axe and sends it crashing into the stump
89
-  89 Kim enters from the backyard
Looking around, she no- tices that nothing is being prepared for dinner
Curious, she moves toward the living room
90
-  90 Vivian is arranging fresh roses on the mantel shrine when Kim enters
The girl stands for several seconds watching her mother before she speaks
Hi, Mom
() /,5 90 : 90 ( ) Hello, Robin
Don't eat anything
Dinner's almost ready
Disturbed, Kim frowns and slowly crosses the room to her mother
Nothing's cooking, Mom
You must've forgotten
Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to face Kim
Oh
don't know what  was thinking
() It doesn't matter
() Have you seen the new satin pantsuit 'm wearing
Vivian smiles at her daughter
Kim studies her for a long moment, then leans over and kisses her on the cheek
You'll be beautiful
91
- '  - As Kim walks down the hallway, she notices that Alex's door is closed
She enters her bedroom
92
-  92 Kim crosses the room and switches  her is  as she tosses her books onto the desk and moves to the closet
She carefully pulls out her prom dress, a mid-length, off-the-shoulder gown in a white, clinging material
Holding it up against her body, she inspects the gown in the full-length mirror on the closet door
Watching her reflection, Kim twirls around, hugging the gowm to her body
Satis- fied, she gently lays the go%
m on her bed
() 92 : 92 Kim begins to undress
Outside, the twilight shadows deepen
the , a slight movement is  among the trees; suddenly, a dark figure becomes , ap- proaching
the window
Kim does not notice the figure as she finishes undressing
She wraps herself in a robe and sits at her dressing table
Putting her hair up, she does not see the shadowy figure peering inside
When Kim stands up, the figure slips away from the window
As she crosses the room, the face reappears, hidden by the shadows, watching her enter the bathroom
93
-  93 Wearing only a bra and panties, Wendy is sprawled across her bed, talking on the telephone
black silk gown is draped across her legs
(into the receiver) What 'm wearing now
Oh, tonight
(smiles, gently stroking the gown) You'll find out soon enough
() Now, are we all set
It better
don't want her to ever forget tonight
Okay, 'bye
Wendy hangs up the receiver and glances at her night table
photograph of a grinning Nick McBride stares back
Wendy smiles and caresses her gown
94
-  94 Seated at her dressing table, Kim puts the final touch- es on her makeup
Her hair is swept up and back, fall- ing in soft waves to her shoulders
Wearing the rav- ishing white gown, she looks older and very beautiful
Vivian's  is  from down the hall
(
) Kim
Vivian comes in looking anxious and flustered
She's dressed in an elegant black satin pantsuit
Kim turns, looks at her
() 75
94 : 94 ` Mom, it looks great
Vivian doesn't seem to hear her
She's rummaging through her purse
Kim, have you got any of my makeup
No
never
That deep red lipstick, you remember
You liked it
wouldn't take it without asking you
Vivian's very wound up
It was on my dressing table,  set it aside
She's looking around Kim's room as if she expects to see it
() Why does this always happen at the last minute
Hammond's  bellows from downstairs
(
) let's go, we can't be late
( ) set it aside
She heads for the door, stops, looks fully at Kim for the first time
() You look lovely, dear
She goes out
76
95
-  95 Hammond stands in front of a hall mirror, straightening his bow tie
He seems agitated, nervous
He turns as Vivian starts down the stairs
He looks surprised at her outfit
There's a certain similarity between it and his own formal suit
HAMIM0ND My God, we're going to look like twins
Vivian stops dead, looks at him
Hammond forces a smile
() 'm joking, Vi, it's beautiful
_ 'mon
She hesitates, then comes down to him
told you 'd bought it
Of course you did
He opens the door for her
She pauses to check herself in the mirror
() we've got to go
He puts an arm around her, kisses her gently on the cheek
She just stares at herself in the mirror
96
-  96 Hammond takes Vivian's arm as they step outside, walk toward the car in the driveway
97
-  97 Someone is watching Hammond and Vivian from a car parked across and just down the street
shadow moves in the foreground, in the front seat of the car
98
98 Hammond guides his wife to their family car, opens the passenger door for her_ He looks past her, down the street, sees a car parked there
() 98 : 98 streetlight reflecting off its windshield prevents him from seeing inside
Vivian interrupts his speculations
'm going back to change
She turns back to the house
Hammond holds on to her arm
Vi
there's no time
'm not going to look ridiculous
You don't look ridiculous, you look fine
99
-  99 The figure in the front seat watches the confrontation in the Hammond driveway
100
100 Hammond takes Vivian by the shoulders, faces her
Vi
this is a big night for the school, it's a big night for me
know how you're feeling understand
It's difficult for all of us
But we've got to make a special effort, Vi
We can't let the
terrible memories of this day affect us
That may seem cold and
insensitive to you, but it's the way it has to be
He pauses, staring down at his wife
She's holding his gaze
() Now, Vi, if you think it's going to be too difficult for you
You don't want me to go
() 78
100 : 100 Certainly  want you to go, just saying
You don't think  can do it
You think 'll embarrass you
No
don't
believe me
Then why are you saying these things
Vi
just
He's trying to stay calm, to keep the lid on
She's on the verge of tears
() 'm sorry
didn't mean to upset you
You treat me like a child
'm your wife
She glares at him
He releases her from his grip, ges- tures toward the car
Let's get going
He walks around to the driver's door
Vivian stares after him with hard cold eyes
101
-  101 The figure in the parked car watches as Hammond starts up the car, waits for Vivian to get in, backs out of the driveway, and moves off down the street
102
102 The figure climbs out of his car, gazes at the fading taillights of the Hammond car
The figure is Nick McBride
103
-  103 Kim reaches for a small bottle of cologne
() 79
103 : 103 As she gently tracks the perf me across her skin, she is startled by another reflection in her mirror
Whirling around, she sees Alex
Standing up, she pir- ouettes and curtsies before her brother
Well
Alex gapes, stunned by his sister's appearance
() Amazing
() You like
You look almost like a woman
() Thanks
She picks up her corsage from her dressing table
() You want to help or just leer
You're my sister
'll leer
() Pin this on me, you creep, late
Alex takes the corsage
As he attaches the bright red flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his neck
He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin
Hey
You shouldn't have pulled away
The
() It's him

er's face is revealed
It is the nine-year-old Alex
Kim cradles the killer on the ground
She turns his head toward the light
We  his face full-on
Robin
She rushes forward, lunging for the body
Hammond grabs her, restraining her
Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family
His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny
His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's had done seven years before
His makeup has been slop- pily applied
The rouged cheeks and the smudged red lips amplify the grotesque impersonation
Kim strokes her brother's hair
Hammond presses his hysterical wife to him
The onlookers slowly close in
We    Alex's face  a photograph of the Hammond family taken seven years earlier
We the twins
Alex and Robin are smiling
