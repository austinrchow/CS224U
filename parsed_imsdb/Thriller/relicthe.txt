"The Relic", early draft, by Amy Holden Jones a screenplay by Amy Holden Jones based on the book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child March 16, 1995 -
- taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds
- In the back seat is
Early 40's, the wreck of a once handsome man
Unshaven
Sweat stained
Rail thin
Scratches on his arms, a fresh scar on one cheek
As the taxi roars downhill towards the harbor, Whittlesley leans over the front seat
(Italics indicate Portuguese to be subtitled) Faster
We won't make it
You want to die
Whittlesley pulls out  , puts it to the driver's jugular vein
Do you
Sweat pouring down his brow, the driver re-doubles his speed
- The taxi swerves around a corner, nearly crashing into a fruit cart, flies out of sight
-  - Light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters
We hear faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music from waterfront bars
One of the smaller boats, the  , is loading as the  fishtails to a halt
Whittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock
His face floods with relief
Thank God
He tosses a handful of bills into the driver's lap, sprints up the pier as the driver shouts curses after him in Portuguese
Whittlesley shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the Santa Lucia
The boat's engines churn to life
need to speak to the captain
Where is he
The sailors hold Whittlesley back
Get your hands off me
'm trying to save your lives, you fools
Several crew members murmur the word "loco"
Hearing the commotion, a squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches American
Yes
Thank Christ somebody speaks English
'm Dr
John Whittlesley
You have some crates of mine on board
They were shipped by mistake to the Natural History Museum
We have to get them off the boat
You have
Whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair, trying to keep control and appear reasonable
No
Let me explain
was on an expedition for the museum on the Upper Xingu
Something horrible happened
'm the only one who got out alive
lost everything, my , everything
have to make sure no one else dies
The crates, the crates were sent out before we knew
There's something unspeakable inside
If your boat leaves harbor with those crates on board,  can't be responsible
My God, if they reach New York
Whittlesley's fists clench spasmodically
Franco looks to his men
Loco
No
'm not crazy
As God is my witness, 'm telling the truth
Franco barks an order and several sailors grab Whittlesley by the arms
They start to lead him back to shore
Don't do this
You have to believe me
Your lives are in danger
The sailors laugh
But with an almost super-human strength born of desperation, Whittlesley throws them off
He pulls out his wallet
Cash
Cash, you see
American money
Whittlesley throws the money down on the deck
The breeze scatters the bills across the bow and all the men, including Captain Franco, scramble for the money, chattering in Portuguese
While they are occupied, Whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck
-   - Whittlesley ducks between cages of goats, boxes of farm equipment, his movements jerky with panic
As he continues searching, the camera moves past him, into the darkness of the hold
We hear Whittlesley mumbling between low, ragged breaths
At the back of the boat the camera finds
clearly labeled
Move in on these as
The
The boat has started to move
Whittlesley stands bolt upright, realizing what's going on
No
Too late
He turns to run back on deck but then stops, sniffs the air
look of desperation fills his eyes
With one hand he pulls out , and unexpectedly puts it to
Better to kill himself than face what comes next
The knife touches
of , one gold, another silver
Whittlesley stares wide-eyed into the blackness of the hold
The goats start  in blind panic
shaft of moonlight comes through a porthole as the boat turns
The moonlight falls on Whittlesley's eyes lock onto them and he inches towards them, drawn inexorably closer
closer
No
no
He begins mumbling a prayer
filled with dread as he falls to his knees, staring, always staring at
- The crew tends to business and the Santa Lucia points out of the harbor, disappears into the night
: - Squad cars roar down the back roads, sirens flashing
In the center of the column is an unmarked car
- At the wheel is a strikingly dignified and imposing black man wearing a simple, old-fashioned dark suit, narrow black tie, and white shirt
This is   ,
for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck
Pendergast hums along as he drives
rides shotgun
The cop is intimidated both by Pendergast and the morning's events
He sweats heavily as he brings Pendergast up to date
One of the locals found it at dawn
Didn't believe him 'till  saw it myself
Even then  didn't believe it
Scared my men shitless
Me too

You could smell it a half mile away, Mr
Pendergast

No sir
No way
None of us wanted to, 'm the first to admit it said, "Don't get within a mile of this thing
It's way to big for us

" Pendergast nods his approval, resumes humming along with a particularly intricate harpsichord riff
As always, the man is unflappable and totally calm as he drives
- The ocean is still, the air stifling and close
hot sun beats down on the deck of the
The boat lists at a crazy angle where it has been washed up on the shore
At first glance, it appears to be deserted
barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each successive wave
We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad cars pulls up
Joining them now are

All of the cops immediately cover their faces, gagging violently at the smell
Pendergast sniffs once and frowns
Apart from this, he doesn't react
(choking) Goin' up-wind if you don't mind
Pendergast nods
The cops all fall back in revulsion
They watch from a safe distance as Pendergast approaches the ghost ship
His shiny laced wing-tips sink in the sand
He leans down, pulls them off one at a time
He balls both socks, puts them carefully into his shoes and proceeds barefoot towards the boat
Using a piece of driftwood as a plank, Pendergast leans it against the Santa Lucia
With surprising agility, he leaps up the plank to the deck
At the top he touches a rail
It's covered in a Flies buzz loudly
lies abandoned in the stern
Chairs are overturned

Pendergast moves aft
The watch from the sand below, unwilling to get any closer
Pendergast hears   slamming open and closed
He follows the noise and sees
He approaches, pushes it open and looks down the stairwell
Below deck are stacks of them
They've been

It's
His face is frozen in a howl of terror
Flies congregate in the eye sockets
With his foot, Pendergast nudges the body over

She sips her morning coffee as she makes notes on several large
Her hair is neatly combed
No make-up
She doesn't need it
She has a natural, unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap
At Margo's elbow is a small
world news report plays
Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's been doing rapidly, in ink
Clearly this is a woman who likes order, with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time
An alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and shuts off the
She reaches for her back pack and looks out at with remarkably clear eyes
- Swooping over the fall foliage of the Park, a riot of color and botanical life
The camera picks out ' making its way along the winding roads, dodging taxi cabs
Margo wears jeans, a work shirt, a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone On her back is a    which holds her lap top computer
She emerges from the park, catches the green light and rolls up to
- As Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic arches of the
This is not an ordinary building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind
The structure fills an entire city block
Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide stone steps two at a time
We hear  of pleasure and release, the normal raucous noises of a large group of
Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids
Their teacher, , a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent, calls after them as they all head inside
Don't run, children
Stay with your partner and do not run
If anyone runs they will be sent back to the bus
Ignoring Mrs
Beasley,   charge past Margo

Henry has a buzz cut; Larry has rasta dread knots
Both are 8 years old, wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles

What did  just say
You walk right this minute
Did you hear me
Reluctantly, Henry and Larry slow to a rapid race-walk as they reach the huge doorway flanked by two Northwest Coast Indian totem poles
Above the doorway  are hanging a
It reads: "

The kids chatter with excitement, look up in awe
Margo nods to a  who smiles as she pins on a plastic
Morning, Dr
Green
Morning Joe
Beautiful day
Henry watches Margo pass through the turnstiles without paying
He swaggers over
You work here
Yes,  do

Mrs

Margo turns towards the stairwell, passing
Museum Director
a pudgy man in wire rim glasses who dresses and thinks like a banker
Hired for his amazing ability to raise money, Cuthbert is one of a new generation of Museum Directors whose focus must always be on the bottom line
Hello, Ian
Everything ready for the opening of the Superstition Exhibit
'm on my way to get the last piece out of storage right now
'd wish you luck but 'm not superstitious
You will be after tomorrow night
Cuthbert waves merrily
workman uses a  in the stairwell
Cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder, stops and carefully walks around it instead
Margo smiles, goes on upstairs
- Cuthbert enters from the lower stairwell
He is now in one of the hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the general public
He follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway lined with rumbling steam pipes
There are storage areas on both sides labeled , ,   , ,    and so on
Finally Cuthbert comes to a door marked "  1978-95"
Cuthbert pauses and gets out a key, but to his surprise the door pushes open
The lock and doorknob mechanism are both broken off
Cuthbert frowns
What the
He goes inside
- Cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall, narrow space
Stacks of metal shelves reach up into the gloom
Everywhere we see spears, shields, masks, various artifacts
Ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in plastic like corpses against the walls
And in the middle of the gloom, sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are
The same ones last seen in the hold of the ill-fated Santa Lucia
They are scattered about in disarray
One in particular has been broken open, its contents spread on the floor
Cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay, kneels by the crate
No, it can't be
Cuthbert feels gently through the packing material, lets out a sigh of relief as he pulls out a figurine
It is a small, beautifully carved statue of   crouched on all fours
The room falls totally silent as Cuthbert studies
It's a truly frightening piece
massive, razor sharp claws, large round nostrils, enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes
Suddenly Cuthbert sees a on his hand
He's been
Damn
Cuthbert rises, shakes his finger in pain
Blood drips on the floor
He pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound
The handkerchief rapidly soaks through
Suddenly a   on Cuthbert's shoulder
He's not alone
He lets out a , almost dropping the Relic and spins to see
standing behind him
His nameplate reads
He's a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling southern accent
Beauregard
You scared me half to death
'm sorry, sir
You okay
Someone broke into this room
Anything missin'
Doesn't look like it
We're damned lucky
This statue is priceless
Cuthbert holds up the  of
Beauregard stares
Mbwun
South American warrior deity
He carries a powerful curse
Every member of the expedition that found this statue, died
Beauregard sees Cuthbert's cut finger
Looks like the curse is still at work
The claws are sharp
must have cut myself
(uneasy laugh) Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe
Beauregard studies the door as Cuthbert heads out with the figurine
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr
Cuthbert
Why not
No one broke into this room, sir
Someone broke out
That lock was torn off from the inside Cuthbert glances at the evil face of Mbwun, pales
As he exits, , left alone with the crates
- Huge centrifuges, hissing autoclaves, electrophoresis apparati, glowing monitors, elaborate blown-glass distillation columns and titration set-ups
One of the most advanced technical facilities of its kind
And mixed in with all the modern machinery are Complete homo sapien specimens are scattered around the room
Standing midst all this is  , early twenties
Kawakita makes sharp, jerky overhead movements with his left hand, waving something about
He's practicing casting
We hear the zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as
fly whips out, passing right under her nose
Third from the end
Right shoulder
Aleut, provenance unknown
The fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the third skeleton from the end, labeled "Aleut, provenance unknown
" Margo rolls her eyes and Kawakita smiles with pride
If  spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that spend on this fly rod, 'd have my PhD
(small smile) But at what a price
Kawakita reels in his line as Margo drops her backpack on her large desk
An enormous  stands by the equally imposing computer topped by a tiger skull
screen saver of an animated pterodactyl plays
Margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth, hits some keys revealing columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the computer screen

We can extract  and start running tests on the extrapolator program
Call Dr
Frock
He wanted a demonstration
Margo, you haven't heard
What
Frock's been fired
Margo straightens, stunned
That's impossible
(awkward) 'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me
Telegraph
Telephone
Tell Kawakita
got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary
This is Dr
Frock's last week
Margo is already out the door
/ -  - Margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower
She half runs down an elegant, Edwardian fifth-floor corridor, her footsteps lost in the thick carpet
At the very end is a heavy oak door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply "Dr
Frock"
'  - Margo bursts into the unique office, which is in startling contrast to the modernity of her own
Two large bow windows look out over the park
Upholstered Victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint carpets featuring large red roses
Plant specimens and drawings of flora and fauna line the walls
Cardboard boxes cover the floor
Seated in a wheelchair is a white-haired man in a tweed jacket and a loud floral tie
Glasses slip down his nose
This is
, and he's in the middle of packing
He looks up, smiles apologetically
Hello, Margo
Sorry about the mess
Is it true
Greg said you'd been fired
Yes
Bit of a shock
But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood
And since 've been here since the Mesozoic Era -- don't believe it
Now Margo, don't overreact
Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow
My leaving makes perfect sense
This isn't exactly early retirement
've overstayed the party a bit
We can't do without you
You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology
You're practically an institution around here
That, apparently, is the problem
'm yesterday's news
Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants
Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm
Frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and Margo moves to his side
She pulls Frock's books back out of the box, returns them to his desk
"Phyletic Transformation and the Tertiary Fern Spike" is not going anywhere
'll talk to Cuthbert and put a stop to this right now
She starts for the door and Frock wheels into her path
Now for the first time she sees what he's been carefully hiding
the deep pain in his eyes
Please
Don't humiliate me further
Let me help
can take care of everything
No, Margo
This is one problem you can't solve
You have to stay out of it
The fact is,  want to retire
How can you say that
You know it's not true
Yes it is
'm tired and 'm no longer needed -- My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you
With all due respect, dear, that's bull
You dance rings around me with your new technology
You've left me in the dust
(stubbornly loyal) Your work is highly relevant
What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology
Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art
Frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says the discussion is over
Come on
'll walk you back to the elevator
'm not giving up
You must
- Frock rolls back down the hall the way Margo just came
Margo is beside him, downcast
She's not used to defeat
This isn't a death sentence
Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing
'll garden
'll write
You are this museum
It won't be the same without you
Everyone needs a change of scenery
've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years
That's quite enough
Margo gets in the elevator reluctantly
He smiles and meets her eye
'll see you at lunch
He waves her off merrily
But once the doors close and Margo's out of sight, Frock's smile fades and his shoulders sag
He ducks his wheelchair quickly into the Hall of African Mammals
- Two stories high, dark and dramatic
very special display
Dioramas of lions, hippos, wart hogs etc
In the middle is a large statue of a beating its chest
Frock takes refuge in the darkness of the exhibit
His wheelchair sits in a quiet corner and we see him quickly wipe the back of his hands across his eyes
- Shells and sea life line the walls
sign announces the exhibit "Mollusks and Our World
"  The    sweeps in
Larry and Henry start to sing "Mollusks and Our World" to the tune of "Welcome to Our World", the
Schwartz theme song
Mrs
Beasley shoots them the evil eye and Henry whines
Mrs
Beasley, it's almost time to go and we still haven't seen the dinosaurs
If you ask me about the dinosaurs once more, ' strangle you both
She starts to lecture about horseshoe crabs in a droning monotone
Henry and Larry hang back
(whispers) This room sucks
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs
That lady said they were on the fourth floor
Let's ditch and find them ourselves
They dart off down a side corridor and up a wide stairs
- Larry and Henry emerge and walk wide-eyed among the cases of lizards, chameleons, tortoises
High windows light the room
Outside the sun is going down
woman pushing a child in a stroller exits and the boys have the hall to themselves
Look at this
Komodo dragon
As Larry checks out, the huge, dragon-like reptile, which has just sunk its Jaws into a stuffed boar
Henry points to a stuffed Gecko climbing vertically up the side of its case
Check out this one
It can walk up walls
Larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where temporary barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room
Painting is in progress
Scaffolding just begs to be climbed
Henry runs over and starts up the scaffolding
Larry hesitates
We're not supposed to go back there
Chicken
This is a great short cut
Henry drops on the other side of the scaffolding and Larry follows
In a moment both disappear from sight
- Windowless and dark
closed display under maintenance
Thousands of little stuffed birds line the walls from floor to ceiling, white cotton poking out of sightless eyes
Henry and Larry enter and slow down
Larry's getting scared
don't want to go this way
Don't be a wuss
Come on
The boys continue onward more slowly, their footfalls echoing in the silence
- The children are now far from the other tourists and their class
Larry is frightened
The hall takes a sharp dog-leg, ending in a darkened cul-de-sac full of display cases filled with hideous carved masks
Against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood which looks much like a wall
Henry tugs at it and the barricade moves
He looks behind
Hey, there's a secret staircase back here
Cool
Henry disappears behind the barricade leaving Larry completely alone in the dark room with the Shaman masks
Henry, come back
Henry doesn't respond
The lights in the cases throw strange shadows
Larry starts to sniffle, falls to hiccuping, sits down
He pulls on a little flap of rubber that's coming off the toe of his sneaker, all bravado gone
Henry
Henry
No answer
Larry rises and peeks behind the barricade
He sees the circular stair
It descends into total darkness
From below comes a strange smell that makes Larry's nose wrinkle
Henry
No answer
Larry puts his first foot on the stair
Henry
Come up
Please
With no other option but staying alone in the dark, Larry follows Henry down
- Larry clutches the banister, whispers
Henry
Where are you
Henry
Larry takes another step
Another
And another
He stops
Below him he hears , rather like a large dog
Larry freezes, starts to cry
Henry
Henry
It smells awful
Answer me
Are you all right
Larry can barely see a dim hallway stretching out in two directions
He pauses near the bottom of the stairs, eyes wide, holding his breath
There appears to be a darker area of  at the end of the hall
It's gliding
Suddenly something  on Larry's leg and he
It's
Henry pulls Larry the rest of the way down the stairs
They stand alone together in the darkness
Henry hisses
Quiet
What is it
don't know
But  think it's bad
They keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as they back up, step by step
Move in as their faces suddenly The sound echoes in the darkness as we
: '  - Margo sits up in the darkness, gasping
Moonlight cuts across the bed
It takes a moment for her to realize that she's had a nightmare
She reaches for her light
As she switches it on, we see a photo on her bedside table
It shows a group on a mountain in
There are several people with their arms slung around each other
At the end is a younger  holding hands with
They appear to be more than friends
she looks at the photo a moment, then turns off the light and lies back, alone in her bed
: - Yellow crime tape encircles the museum
Dead leaves swirl in clusters and the sky is overcast
Overnight, fall turned to winter
The front of the museum is ringed with police cars
Margo rides up on her bike and pauses, startled at the sight
We watch as she crosses, has a few words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance
She wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up
arriving at the front entrance
Out steps - Margo enters
The huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved from the trunk of a single tree
Inside it are mannequins of Northwest Coast Indians
Milling around are at least twenty
One approaches
Worried, Margo hands it over
What's going on
All employees are to go to the room for a briefing, Dr
Green
-  - Several cops go by with tracking dogs
Margo looks back at the dogs, increasingly uneasy, almost bumps into
Surprisingly, they are alive and well and seated with outside an office
Margo exchanges a look with both boys, remembering them from yesterday
tentative smile starts but Henry and Larry don't return it
Serious and chastened, they drop their eyes
Margo continues on
stand outside the door to the rest room, their backs turned to Margo as she approaches
What was that
Six
Lost count
Margo glances past them to see an   wearing the badge of a , leaning over a sink
He wipes his mouth
Margo's eyes move down to see
'  are soaked in blood
- More cops gather, surrounded by skeletons of primates
humans, monkeys, gorillas
It's an odd sight
They all look up with interest as in walks the imposing figure of
He turns to a young eager beaver, , flashes his badge
Bailey straightens to attention
Could you please take me to the officer in charge
- Pendergast follows Bailey as they descend the rickety old metal staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum
The hall below them is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb
The stairway opens onto a maze-like set of rooms in the basement
Everything around them is and  in
There are trails of it on the floor, the walls, the overhead light
Several  stand guard as   ' goes over the area
He is a round, balding, man with an unmistakable air of authority
modern knight in shining armor in disguise
deep disguise
He has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt
His t-shirt is plainly visible underneath
On his worn plastic belt is a badge
' Don't touch anything until the has finished with those stairs
Keep everyone clear of the perimeter
don't want any contamination
There's an incredible amount of blood evidence down here
We need more light
Where's the photographer
Tell him to quit eating donuts,  need him
As Pendergast enters, 'Agosta looks up at this serious African- American in simple black suit, white shirt and dark tie
' Who are you
The undertaker
Special Agent Pendergast
' Vince 'Agosta
Am  out
Not at all

If so, could use your help
The two men shake hands
They couldn't be more different
Pendergast is an elegant intellectual
'Agosta a working class spark plug who operates from the gut
Pendergast gestures to the form on the ground
The body
' What's left of it
Mind if  have a look
'Agosta calls to    who comes down the staircase carrying lights, a donut stuffed in his mouth
' We need light in here, stat
Where's the head
'Agosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball that's in the corner
' Careful
That mess on the ground is brains
Whose footprints
' Night watchman who found the body
Sweet old man
Been tossing his cookies for over an hour
Not a likely suspect
The photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with light
And now everyone (but not us ) gets a very clear look at the body
spits out his donut
His eyes roll up and he drops in a dead faint
Just like that
'Agosta swallows hard
' Woof
Pendergast looks down, utterly impassive
Yes, 'd say we're definitely working on the same case
- An old 19th century theater
Balconies
Heavy curtains
It looks like the theater where Lincoln was shot, with the exception of the most recent addition, an   five stories high
The room is filling with museum employees, all murmuring anxiously
Margo sits down next to Frock's wheelchair
Her face is ashen
Dr
Frock,  just saw a man back there who'd been wading in blood
As Greg Kawakita sits in the chair next to Margo
(') For once 'm glad you're rumor central
What in the world is going on
Someone's been murdered
Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either
Torn limb from limb
There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal
For heaven's sake, Greg, someone's been killed
Look, it's Cuthbert
Let's hear what really happened
At this everyone falls silent and   steps forward to address the crowd
He appears drawn and grey
This has been a tragic and upsetting morning
have terrible news for us all
member of our security force has been found murdered
The police have just informed me it was Daniel Beauregard
(murmuring fills the room) Quiet
Please
With the help of our head of security, Mr
Ippolito
the museum has been secured
rises in the back and nods to the crowd
He's an imperious looking, pompous man with shifty eyes
Right now he's defensive
Overnight, his job is on the line
The police are satisfied we're in no danger, that we're all perfectly safe
We've been asked to remain in the Gem Room and be available for questioning for the rest of the day
Obviously, we will all do everything we can to cooperate
Are there any questions
Ippolito raises a hand
The party for the opening of the Superstition Exhibit
imagine in the light of what's happened it will be pushed back
No action has been taken yet
The opening of the exhibit is crucial to the financial health of this museum
So for now, we expect that the Superstition Exhibit will open on schedule, tomorrow night
Ippolito registers surprise
The audience buzzes again
- Margo, Dr
Frock and Greg Kawakita enter
The room is full of spectacular displays of gemstones of every type
Greg drapes himself over a grey sofa
Margo leans on a giant geode
That Cuthbert
What a piece of work
Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success
The museum is in debt
Contributions and public funding have dried up
Admissions no longer cover overhead
The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit
Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red
If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems
With all this bad publicity, it's no wonder he looks like that
They glance over and see Cuthbert in the corner
He appears ill, is compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a ' Frock goes over to speak to him, followed by Margo and Greg
Ian
Are you okay
(shakes his head) Beauregard
can't believe it may have been the last one to see him alive
He was with me just yesterday, when  got out the statue of Mbwun
(taken aback) Mbwun
(sensing more gossip) What's that
Margo frowns, suddenly uneasy
She and Dr
Frock exchange a look
Warrior deity of the Kothoga, an extinct South American tribe
Dr
John Whittlesley led an expedition that found the only known representation of Mbwun
The statue is said to carry a curse
(she looks away, quiet) Every member of Whittlesley's expedition died
got the relic out yesterday to put on display
Beauregard was there
The crates had been broken into and the contents were strewn about
But nothing was missing
It was downright weird
We joked that it was the curse of Mbwun
'm not laughing now
Come, Ian
We all know you're superstitious
But you're among scientists here
We deal in facts
That statue had nothing to do with what happened to Beauregard
All  know is, everyone who has come in contact with that relic, is dead
-  - 'Agosta has set up a temporary command post among the antique desks and chairs
The room is on the ground floor with a view of the park
Gawkers are outside looking in
'Agosta pulls the blinds in their faces
' (mutters) Get a life
Pendergast is looking closely at one of the large paintings of birds that line the walls
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser
Amazing have a copy of this in my office at home
' Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast
'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down
In this violent world,  believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things
' drink
After hours of course
On duty,  smoke
(he pulls out a fat cigar) Do you mind
Not at all
enjoy the smell of a good cigar
' Then you won't like this one
It's a piece of shit
He bites off the end, spits it out on the floor
Lieutenant -- ' Call me Vince
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago
Twelve bodies on board
' Who didn't
Big news
Out of Brazil, wasn't it
Yes
That's my case
Now it's yours
All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way
Decapitated
Brains extracted
Limbs torn to shreds
It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board
' So the method of death is the only connection
No
There's more
There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat
enters, interrupts
Uh, Vince
Sorry
This won't wait
' It better be good
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder
Claimed they saw a monster
They're pretty determined to tell you their story
You want to see them
' (rolls his eyes) No
If you don't mind, this could be important
' You're kidding
Unfortunately, no
- modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the purpose of interrogation
Seated on small chairs at a plain table are
and , looking like two little boys with a story they are desperate to share
Standing behind them is
, starchier than ever
'Agosta takes a chair across from the boys, at their eye level
By this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired
Pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind
This isn't hard duty for 'Agosta
He's surprisingly genial and at ease with kids
Larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in excitement
Henry tugs his t-shirt
' Hi
'm Lieutenant 'Agosta
You can call me Vince
This is Special Agent Pendergast
You can call him
(he looks to Pendergast, so formal) Special Agent Pendergast
This is Henry Weiss and Larry Bowers
' So
Tell us about this monster
We were lost and trying to find a short cut to the dino-- Henry elbows him hard
Larry shuts up
We were just lost, okay
And we went down this curvy staircase
At the bottom was a big shadow
Big as a house
Not that big
Well almost
Depends which house
It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise
Henry makes a low  in his throat
'Agosta suppresses a smile, shoots Pendergast a look
But Pendergast watches the kids intently
And it snuffled the ground like a dog
Like this
He goes on hands and knees, sniffs the ground
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's
They were yellow
You're color blind
Boys, please
(to 'Agosta) These two get in a lot of mischief and they tell some amazing whoppers
' can see that
This isn't a whopper
It's the truth
Pendergast now moves forward, pulls up a chair as if deeply interested
How did you get away
We ran and screamed and stuff
And we got through a little door just in time
There was a guard there and he went back to check
guard
Do you remember his name
He was wearing one of those
badges
His name was Bo
something
' Beauregard
Yeah
- An ambulance pulls away, lights flashing
Pendergast and 'Agosta walk to a squad car
' 've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework"
How do you explain the part about Beauregard
' They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story
Nice touch
believed them
'Agosta stops, stunned
' You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells
like hamburger
No
think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon
who wants us to believe he's a monster
' (totally confused) Oh
- 'Agosta and Pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies on gurneys
It's dark and quiet
They go into the autopsy room
- large gurney, currently empty, sits like an uninvited guest under the bright lights of the autopsy suite
Beside it is a tall, imposing doctor in her late 50's, with intense eyes
This is
With her are the  seen passing out at the museum, and a young intern,
You're late, Vince
' Sorry Dr
Ziewzic
This is Special Agent Pendergast
Pendergast, Dr
Ziewzic
She runs the best chop shop in New York
We've met
The Hacksaw Murders
'89
Oh yes
Who could forget
Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte
hope you liked it
Lovely bouquet
After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer
As  recall we split the check
' (grumbles) It's been one of those days
(she snaps her rubber glove) Shall we get down to it, then
Dr
Gross wheels the gurney over to the morgue bank and slides open a drawer
The shape under the plastic seems too small to be human
To the side of it is a large bump, presumably the head
The two pieces of cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurney's outlet pipe
Dr
Ziewzic fiddles with a microphone hanging above the body, she taps it and it gives off the proper static
(for the microphone) This is Dr
Matilda Ziewzic, assisted by Dr
Frederick Gross
It's Oct
28, six fifteen p
m
We are joined by Lieutenant Vincent 'Agosta of the , Special Agent Pendergast of the  and a police photographer
Let's see what we've got
They pull off the sheet and ' swallows hard, closes his eyes to keep his stomach in check
The photographer goes green, but is determined not to clutch this time
leans closer, totally impassive
He puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses, assumes an expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant
Caucasian male
Age about 27
Blond
Height well  can't give a height because Mr
Beauregard has been decapitated
The state of the body is such that other identifying marks are out of the question
There are numerous lacerations proceeding from the left anterior pectoral downwards through the sternum and terminating in the abdomen
This is a massive wound, two feet long and a foot wide
The head has suffered severe trauma and the occipital portion of the calavarium has been crushed and removed
It almost looks like
(beat) bite
Ziewzic turns to Pendergast
What are we talking about here
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa
Right
(back to work) The entire brain appears to have been extracted
May  see it, please
Gross passes over a grey, watery mass that sits in a stainless steel pan
Ziewzic studies Beauregard's brain, or what's left of it
Curious
There's something missing
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps
(looks up, surprised) Yes
Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision
' What happened to them
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test
Ziewzic, Gross and 'Agosta look at Pendergast
The photographer is staring at the wall, silently mouthing multiplication tables to keep from woofing all over the place
' (incredulous) Saliva test
You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain
Correct
long moment of silence, then
Zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva test, puts the result in a petrie dish
Okay
One saliva test
Now
let's look at these lacerations
They start wide and then converge
' Long fingernails
Scratches
Too extreme
Perhaps some kind of weapon
'm now probing the wound and
there's a piece of foreign material deep in the muscle, lodged on a rib
Photograph
The photographer gathers his courage, steps forward with 'Agosta and Pendergast
Zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile water
It turns brownish red
She holds it up
They all stare in astonished silence
'Agosta swallows
' Sweet Jesus
It's a claw
The photographer's flash goes off
: - black and white heads uptown
- Pendergast sits in silence
'Agosta is visibly disturbed
' don't like animals
Never have
Dog bit me when  was little
After that  gave up on pets
Animals are irrational
Give me a psychotic killer any day
If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain
My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo
It was late August
Over ninety
The polar bear was inside his cave
Kids didn't know he was in there
All they saw was the pool
They got to swimming and splashing
The noise woke up the bear
By the time  arrived, both little boys were in pieces
The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot
can still hear the mother screaming -- This isn't an animal, Vince
've been on this case four months, remember
've learned a few things
' You've been holding out on me Pendergast
You have a suspect capable of this
Pendergast looks over, nods quietly
Let me tell you about it, Vince
- The yellow crime scene tape is torn and flapping in a light rain
Most of the emergency vehicles have left
The police have released the employees who are now headed home
We see Frock and Kawakita exit
Cuthbert isn't far behind
Pendergast approaches them, headed back inside
Excuse me
Has Dr
Green left
Before eight
You must be joking
She's in the physical anthro lab making up for lost time
Pendergast nods his thanks
- The gems glow in the darkness as Pendergast passes through the now empty room
- Pendergast's footfalls are lost in the carpet as he goes down the far stairs
-  - Pendergast goes down a long, dark hall alone
He arrives at a door marked   , enters
- The skeletons throw odd shadows on the ceiling
Margo's computer screen glows at the end of the room, casting the only light
But her chair is empty
The room is quiet
Pendergast approaches slowly, looks around
Dr
Green
No answer
Pendergast glances at the computer screen, sees graphs and complicated notations
He scrolls down, leans closer
He can't figure it out
He slides into Margo's chair, fascinated
Then
() You have a warrant to look at that
Pendergast leaps up
Margo has appeared in the doorway behind him, a cup of coffee in her hand
Special Agent Pendergast
Forgive me
guess  was snooping
What is this
An invention of mine
It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator
How does it work
With a  analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was
(abrupt) You aren't here for a lesson in
No
(a moment) came to talk about Dr
John Whittlesley
Margo turns to put down her coffee
She takes a moment to compose herself
When she turns back, her voice is quiet
Somehow, when all this happened knew it would come back to John
Is he really dead
Maybe not
If he were alive he'd have contacted me
You have time to talk
- Pendergast and Margo walk together though various exhibits and halls
They pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed and stuffed behind glass
Dr
Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared
taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat
That boat washed up in my district
Everyone on board was killed
And John
Disappeared
His body wasn't among the victims
don't understand
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten
Just like Beauregard
One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision
The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact
Margo pales
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that
He was a fine man despite his problems -- You loved him
(a moment, taken aback) Yes
Once
We met at Columbia
John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when  was a grad student there
You were going to be married
How did you know that
ran an internet search on Dr
Whittlesley
Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times
also found a record of your restraining order
That was two years ago
John was still in love with me
(she looks down) He wouldn't leave me alone
You were afraid of him, weren't you
He was afraid of himself
He tried suicide once
He was ill
Manic depressive
He had wild emotional highs and lows
Not a happy affliction for a scientist
He'd been revered in our community
By the end he was a joke
Tell me about the last expedition
What was he looking for
legendary monster called Mbwun
monster
Yes
He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect
It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection
The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species"
It made no sense
But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years
What happened
No one knows
The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals
Margo's voice catches again
Pendergast reaches for his handkerchief but she shakes her head, determined to keep control
No
'm all right
won't let this affect me anymore
John wouldn't get help
His ego endangered the lives of others
His theory came first
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there
Was he desperate enough to create one
don't understand
Something came up in autopsy tonight
Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw
My God
Then it was an animal
don't think so
think we were meant to think it was Mbwun
Did Whittlesley's monster have claws
don't know
He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation
But 've never seen it
It's in the exhibit
Would you mind showing it to me
- This exhibit is unlike anything we've seen in the museum
Horrifying artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness
Patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls
There are tombs, a torture chamber, and endlessly curving, maze-like, winding halls
Where would we find it
'm not sure
We should split up
You take that hall and 'll take this one
All right
'm as macho as you are
Perhaps
Without further discussion, Margo takes the right fork leaving Pendergast behind
As she finds herself alone
The silence is intense
She heads slowly into another long, dark, tunnel passing a set of Maori tattooed heads
The eyes are stuffed with fibers, the shriveled lips are drawn back from rotting teeth
Margo passes without a look
In another part of the exhibit, he nears a Mayan tomb
skeleton in the center wears a headdress and tribal robes
Gold rings encircle bony fingers
Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into the next hall
getting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom
The walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft
There are shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells
From the New Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe- ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask
Finally the walls open up into another gallery
Beyond it is more of the shadowy hall
Margo stops and for the first time she wavers
This gallery is the most frightening yet
It features images of from different cultures around the world
In the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of , (the Eskimo evil spirit),  from India, Tibet, New Guinea etc
And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar and lit by a spot, is a small figurine
Margo is instantly drawn to it
As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters
Savage God of the Kothoga, also known as " "
The statue is terrifyingly life-like
Margo stares at The Beast
Mbwun is covered in scales and stiff hair, with glittering green eyes and crude, reptilian features
The figure is hunched over in a threatening crouch
It's long forearms trail to the ground ending in she starts, then remembers Pendergast
Mr
Pendergast
found it
No answer
She turns, tries again, louder
Pendergast
Over here -- Her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air
rolls over her
She covers her face, backs up, holding her breath
What the
She steps directly into a nasty statue of the Tibetan lord of the Dead
Margo starts, steadies the statue
The room is silent once more
But then, unmistakably
she hears it
An odd rustling sound
Slow
Deliberate
Maddeningly soft on the thick carpet
And another wave of Margo looks in the direction she came, down the long dark hall
Her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls
Pendergast
(no answer) Who's there
But now she freezes
At last she's truly scared
shadow, black against black, is gliding stealthily towards her, moving over the display cases and grinning artifacts
Margo stands stock still, her eyes on the shadow
She lets out a small gasp of shock
She can't believe her eyes
It defies reason
Slowly, she backs up
She slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other side
In the next room she pauses again, listens
now hearing a distinctly animal,
Something large is
There's no doubt
Overcome by a blind panic, Margo turns and runs
She passes through a display on mythical creatures, disappears down another winding dark hall
Behind her comes
,
Whatever it is, it's charging after her
She turns another corner
And another, tearing as fast as she can
But now the walls up ahead are narrowing, leading to a
Margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass
The hall features displays of terrifying totem poles
All around the ghoulish carved faces seem to leap out
She pounds on the door but it's useless
She's trapped
And the thing is coming behind her
It's just around the last bend when it stops
Silence again envelops her
She's afraid to turn
She can hear  , and something like a low growl
Reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long dark hall
Margo starts as a face appears
The image is wavering and unclear
It's a large, hulking form behind her
in the dark
Margo  as the thing leaps forward, hitting one of the totem poles
Margo sinks to the ground, unconscious
At last we hear Pendergast calling as darkness falls
Dr
Green
Dr
Green
: - lying on the carpet
There's a large, nasty bump on her forehead
The totem pole is on the floor beside her
Leaning over her is
Margo starts to sit up
Pendergast gently restrains her
What happened
don't know
heard you calling and  ran after you, but you kept disappearing and couldn't keep up
(she touches her forehead) You were behind me
Running after me
Pendergast nods
As Margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him off, collecting her thoughts
It's okay, 'm all right
remember now
It was an animal
Something large
could smell it
It was hunting me
saw two green eyes in the dark
Where did you see it
Behind me
Over there
Margo turns and points behind her to
large
It's carved out of wood in a horrible grimace, inset with two glowing green eyes
Pendergast sees it too, says nothing
That's not what  saw
All right
If you're positive
She leans against the wall, touches her forehead, panic overcoming her again
(') can't think straight at the moment
know how crazy this seems
Please, Mr
Pendergast,  need some fresh air
Could you get me out of here
-  - including ,  and  prepare to enter the exhibit
All are armed
Margo watches as Pendergast gives them instruction
She appears rattled and confused
Stay in formation together
Take it room by room
Check for footprints, any signs of disturbance
If you see or hear anything the least bit suspicious,  want to know
He points to , an older red-haired cop who takes up a post outside the exhibit
Pendergast hands Doyle his walkie talkie
Bailey's going to be in the guard house outside
Officer Van Dorn is right down that hall
When McNitt's done, he'll relieve you
Doyle nods
Pendergast and Margo walk out
- Margo and Pendergast exit
The cold air is like a slap in the face
Dr
Green
didn't imagine it
know what saw
Are you sure there are enough men in there
They're all heavily armed
(stops) All right
This is hard for me
'm a scientist
like order and logic
Sometimes too much
There's got to be an explanation
There can't be an animal in there
But  saw something
What was it
don't know
(she has a thought) Mr
Pendergast
Do me a favor
Get me a  readout on that claw
: - All is quiet
-    - The doors to the exhibit are closed
Doyle looks at his watch, impatient
It's almost eleven now
He pulls out his walkie talkie
Bailey
Doyle here
'm still waiting outside the exhibit
Where the hell is McNitt
Should be there any minute
They came out a side door a while ago
Said the exhibit's clear
McNitt's headed back to spell you
'm on double over-time, man
know
You can go home if you want to
'll come relieve you myself
Doyle shuts off his walkie talkie, frowns
He fidgets, looks at his watch once more
What the hell
He turns, takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it, but then he hears something, stops
It's a low  from inside the exhibit, coming from behind the closed doors
Doyle freezes, turns
McNitt
No answer
Doyle pauses
His hand goes to his gun for reassurance as he hears a footstep and a muffled thump
He moves to the door of the exhibit, opens it and takes a step inside
McNitt
Cut the crap
know it's you
You're not scaring me
Come on
Silence meets him
The shadows of the exhibit loom
Doyle takes one more step inside, scanning the darkness with his gun
Does he hear He freezes
Yes, he does
The hair on his neck rises and he loses the spit in his mouth
He takes a step backwards, but he's half a second too late
The door    and a - Officer  enters from a side corridor, zipping up his fly
The hall is still
McNitt checks his watch, sees Doyle's walkie talkie and turns it on
McNitt here
'm outside the exhibit
All's quiet
But  don't see Doyle
() He called a minute ago looking for you
He starts vacation tomorrow and he wanted out
said you were on the way
He could split
Well he's gone
() Any sign of a green-eyed monster
(chuckles) Nope
McNitt shuts off the walkie talkie, settles at his post
- In the blackness a large shape is  , dragging it's prey across the floor
We move in on the lifeless form of
His face is rigid with terror, his eyes frozen, open wide
The last thing we hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness, is the of Doyle's skull
: - Signs announce that the Superstition Exhibit opens tonight
The museum is back in business, but not many people are going in
crowd lingers at the margins, pointing at the building
Several hold a copy of the with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair
'  - Cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office, looking out at the scene below
His face is pinched with worry
Slumped in a chair is Lieutenant 'Agosta
Pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall
had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches
If you like them, they're for sale
Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block
've read about the Museum's financial troubles
We've been operating in the red for years
That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit
It was designed to pull people in
We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success
If we postpone at the last minute
No
don't want to think about that
' (chews on his toothpick, mild) We all love the museum
come here myself with my kids
We're trying to work with you
appreciate that
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if
've arranged for a large police presence
Do they have to wear uniforms
Yes
don't want to scare people
understand
But Mr
Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems
Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down
Cuthbert looks grim
- 'Agosta examines the huge centrifuges, autoclaves, electrophoresis apparati, monitors, computers etc
as Margo and Greg Kawakita look at the claw
What do you make of it, Margo
It's not mammalian, that's for sure
think it's reptilian
That would jive with what we got from the preliminary  read-out
Here, have a look
He hands them a computer read-out
Margo checks it quickly as Kawakita looks on
According to this, twenty-five percent of the claw  is unidentifiable, about a third is homo sapien, and the rest is Hemidactylus Turcicus
' (looks over) What's that
Margo pulls off her glasses
Turkish Gecko,  believe
lizard
Lizard  and human  on the same strand
Impossible
The sample must be contaminated
There's another possibility
lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage
Genetic damage
When  is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair
Viruses can damage
So can radiation, certain chemicals
Even cancer
Let's let the
sort it out
have to get started
This will take several hours
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area
Try Dr
Frock
He's the curator of Plant Biology
All the curators have keys
And he knows every inch of this museum
The rest of us still get lost
- Pendergast, 'Agosta and Dr
Frock get off are in an older, plain corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors
The doors are numbered up to eight, then the corridor turns
As the three go forward, the creaking of the wheelchair echoes faintly in the hall
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr
Frock
Happy to be useful
It's rare enough these days
According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012
How many storage areas are there
They fill seven floors
We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world
Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens
Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems
Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display
' This place is a maze
'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone
(looks over) Do you mean Dr
Whittlesley
Yes
John made quite a study of the whole museum
He had a copy of my original plans
Frock heads through a double door that leads to a that's as big as a small room
The operator,  has it decorated with a table, chair, and
Osteo prep, Karl
The doors creak closed
They are now inside
- Headed down
'Agosta chews on a toothpick, stares at Karl's home-made picture show
The photos have all been cut from nature magazines
They are of   in extreme positions and undreamed of ways
'Agosta turns to Pendergast, dead pan
' My kind of art
Karl, who is sixty and wears a red toupee, leers
They keep me company
Gets kinda lonely sometimes
' My favorite is the two camels
Really
'm partial to the skunks
Finally the doors open and they exit to a hail, enter another set of doors
Now they are in - It looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else
Deep stainless steel tanks line one wall
On the ceiling near the tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger carcasses
In a far corner of the workshop is a stainless-steel gurney bearing a
pink faced eighty year old man is working on the carcass with sharp tools
This is
Did you ever wonder where we get all our skeletons
This is the laboratory where animal carcasses are reduced to bones
(to Osterbaan) What's cooking today, Don
Zebra
Frock looks into a large maceration tank with Pendergast and 'Agosta
zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface, its flesh and soft tissues falling off
' Man, that's ripe
Frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room
Inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox
It's crawling with   which are devouring it
'Agosta and Pendergast watch the grizzly scene, properly impressed
Dermestid beetles
The second method of preparing a skeleton, used in Natural History Museums world wide
Bugs are clean and highly efficient
They'll polish that fox off in no time
As Don casually peels back the gorilla's whole face exposing the skull
Want to have a look at a gorilla brain
Got one right here
Thanks Don
We're in a hurry
Some other time
- More rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes
The light is dim here, and several bulbs are burned out
But the numbers on the storage rooms are much higher now
The three men come out of the darkness
Frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop
This should be it
Can you read the number
Pendergast reaches up above them and
It comes on and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area
'Agosta's jaw drops and his toothpick falls out
The door has been scored from top to bottom by long, vicious,
' Holy shit
Frock stares in amazement, shaken
He runs a finger down the deep ruts
Something tried to get into this room
And failed
These doors are solid steel
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum
wouldn't be so sure
Pendergast takes Frock's keys and opens the door
It swings wide on oiled hinges
'Agosta turns on a light
- They all enter
Nothing has been disturbed
The crates sit in the middle of the small room, untouched
Pendergast kneels by the only one that's been opened
This must be the one that held the statue
Let's see what else is inside
Pendergast removes the lid and hands it to 'Agosta, pulls out a ,  , a
'Agosta takes the lid and turns it
' The lid of this crate is scratched with claw marks, just like the door
As 'Agosta studies the lid, a brittle, water damaged envelope slips out
'Agosta picks it up
The envelope bears an imprint of , one silver overlaid with another of ' Look
It's some kind of letter
(excited) May  see that
'Agosta hands the letter to Frock
It's from John
Those two arrows were his insignia
It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions
Read it out loud
"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so 'm sending Carlos back with the crates
You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days
So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded
We've made an incredible find
enclose a representation of Mbwun
Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia
It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate
know because 've seen the beast
" Frock stops, looks up at 'Agosta and Pendergast
His face flushes with the thrill
Did you hear that
My God
He says that Mbwun is real
' (snorts) Pardon my French, but bull shit
This on top of the scratches
isn't it proof
think the scratches were put there to scare us
Perhaps even lead us to this note
Pendergast looks out to the dark corridors
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum
Yes
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases
Places where someone could hide
Not really
Just the sub-basement
'Agosta and Pendergast exchange a look
Where is that
don't know
It was walled over
No one's been down there in years
You said you had plans of the museum
Could we see them, please
- series of boxes labeled " " sit on the loading dock small moving van, partially loaded with the contents of Frock's office, sits waiting
Frock delves through one of the boxes while Pendergast and 'Agosta look on
know they're here somewhere
It's a good thing we caught the movers in time
They're nineteen century blueprints from when the museum was built
remember the sub-basement was below the regular basement, linked to the city sewer
only know about it because it flooded all the way up to the museum during the hurricane of '49
lost so many precious books
Frock continues to unload boxes, scattering things right and left
It's the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia
collection of wildflowers, soil samples, a stuffed owl
Finally he pulls out some very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile
Eureka
Who says it doesn't pay to be a pack rat
Now please be careful with these
When you're done, 'd like them back
- Visitors scatter as Pendergast enters with 'Agosta,  , a dog handler,   and Jonathan's pair of
The deputies are armed with large shotguns
Pendergast scans the blueprints as they walk
' How big is the sub-basement
Apparently it's huge
' think  should come with you
We haven't got time
You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight
-  - Pendergast, Jonathan, his dogs and the deputies make their way down an industrial set of stairs into the basement
- In a moment they arrive at the site of Beauregard's murder
The area at the bottom of the spiral stairway is still littered with chalk, crime tape, spray paint and the remains of scores of people tramping in and out
These plans indicate there's a walled over entrance to the sub- basement right around here
They move carefully down the dark corridor which we remember from the time we last saw it with Henry and Larry
Unknown to Jonathan or Pendergast, the dogs are walking directly towards the spot where the boys faced the monster
The dogs are picking up something, Mr
Pendergast
The dogs start barking in animation, sniffing the wall
Pendergast studies the blueprints with a flashlight, moves to the spot
There's nothing to be seen
He shines his flashlight over the water-stained, uneven stucco between two steel beams
The dogs sniff furiously at the point where the wall meets the floor
Pendergast moves his fingers to the joint between the stucco and the beam, shoves hard
The wall pushes back
It's a door
- - - They enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs
Water drips on the walls
What is this
dungeon
Jonathan looks uneasy, double wraps the dogs' leashes around his black-gloved hands
The two deputies remove their 12 gauges from their shoulders
Then they all follow the animals, descend down the inky stairwell
-  - The place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant
Two monitor a battery of closed-circuit screens
'Agosta is now accompanied by the pompous head of security,
Clearly Ippolito feels 'Agosta is pissing on his territory and he's trying to assert control
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant
You'll just scare people off
can handle the security behind scenes with this system
It's state of the art
' The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito
Why don't you just tell me how this space station works
It's fool proof, basically designed this whole thing myself
Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip
If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft
' That's great if you're stopping a burglar
Not our goal here
Are there motion detectors
In every exhibition room
The museum's divided into five cells
The reception and exhibit are in cell five
We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors
' That would leave one exit for hundreds of people
You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books
We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells
One more question
see a big hole
If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails
(snorts) You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant
There are safeguards built in
We have back-up systems with redundancies
There's no way these computers can fail
- Margo, Kawakita and Frock are studying the contents of the crate
can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked
If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here
blow dart
Seed pods
plant press
Pretty unimpressive stuff
Let me see the plant press
Frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside
What is it
'm not sure
As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years
Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct
This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui
John used it as packing material
You're right
Kawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers, as does Frock
They're curiously fleshy
And they smell delicious
Kawakita  a
Taste great
wouldn't put that in your mouth until we do a chemical analysis, Greg
can handle that for you while we're waiting on the
Kawakita rises and exits with some of the plant
What about those seed pods
Are they from the same plant
Frock takes a moment to study them, looks up
Margo, these aren't seed pods
What are they
They're eggs
- - Black as night
The only light comes from the men's flashlights
They're at a crossroads
Crooked corridors, with arched ceilings barely the height of a man stretch in several directions
Jonathan is crouched down, resting with the panting dogs
The deputies are having a smoke
They all look both uneasy and exhausted except for Pendergast
He stares at the blueprints
Hard to read in this light
The ink is so faded
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr
Pendergast
Maybe we should head back
Not yet
Let's try the fork to the left
The men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on
The hounds walk ahead, carelessly nosing the ground
The flashlight beams illuminate lime-encrusted, cave-like walls
This place gives me the creeps
At this the dogs begin to
The  on their backs rises in a ridge
Pendergast turns as a  stirs his clothes
They've got something
Keep the light up
can't see
The dogs strain and pull forward, sniffing the air ahead
The deputies raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the darkness
The flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions, barely penetrating the gloom
Suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying  which bounces off the walls
Shut them up
Heel Argo
Hobbes
Heel
The dogs drag Jonathan forward, paying no attention, foaming at the mouth
Jonathan is now frightened
They're going crazy
need help
Too late
As Jonathan tries to grab the collars, one of the dogs forward, and the leash slips through Jonathan's hands
He's loose
Argo
Argo  into the darkness
The men start after the dog, following the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the distance
Pendergast is in the lead
Suddenly he throws out his arms, halts
Stop
Holy mother, what is that
goatish odor envelops them all
Smells God-awful
Like rotten meat
Argo
Come
Quiet
sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a The men all freeze
The other dog leaps and twists with excitement
In the confusion it also breaks free
It tears after the first dog, disappearing into the darkness
Now Jonathan is wild-eyed
No
Hobbes
The deputies are terrified, retreat
The darkness is stifling, claustrophobic
The flashlights are small help
Pendergast alone remains dead calm
His voice is cool and commanding
Forget the dogs
You two, get back here
Don't point that gun at me
The deputies regain control and follow Pendergast's orders
They fall into position, pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall
In the echoing darkness ahead of them, the barking falters and stops
There is a moment of silence, then a terrible, unearthly
The deputies quail, frozen in their tracks
Jonathan leaps forward
Argo
Hobbes
Get back
Now
At that moment a  hurtles at them from the darkness
The men in terror
There are two stunning  from the shotguns, two of light accompanied by a deafening roar
The rumble echoes and dies and there's an intense silence, followed by a sob
You shot my dog
Hobbes lies five feet from them, a black shadow of death
Jonathan kneels by the dog, tears in his eyes
Down the animals side is a
My dog
(stammers) He was coming right at me
In the distance they can hear a terrified howl
It's the second dog, hurt or frightened
It's a pitiful sound
Let's get out of here
'm not going anywhere
Not without my dog
Pendergast grabs at Jonathan who slips from his grasp
Jonathan inches back down the hallway calling desperately
Hobbes
Get back
Jonathan shakes his head no
There's something out there
Let's go get it now
That's why we came down here, isn't it
(to the deputies) He's right
Follow me
But the two deputies are terrified
They cling to the wall, inching backwards, sheer horror in their eyes
No way
say we get help
lot more guns
'm ordering you
Cover me
We'll cover you from here
Jonathan is disappearing in front of them
Pendergast has no choice
Grim faced, he pulls his Colt
45 Anaconda from a shoulder harness
It's a narrow and evil-looking gun
From a pocket comes a handful of 255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain  flatnose ammunition
He loads up, goes after Jonathan, who's no longer in sight
Pendergast passes down a long, sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead
At the bottom Pendergast stops
He has to stoop down as he goes through an archway and into
dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going off from all sides
It appears to be part of the sewer system
The dog cowers in a corner
Jonathan moves to his side
Look
It's Hobbes
He's all right
Come on
Let's get back to the others
We can't leave them alone
It's alright
can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone
What is this place
Not on the map
Looks like it connects with the city sewer
Pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies
We're coming back
The words go unanswered
From the hall comes a loud
It's the shotguns, blasting desperately
Something flies up all around them as the sound echoes
Pendergast and Jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating wings
Finally the animals settle and Pendergast and Jonathan exchange a look
The silence is filled by a soft
They stand together, waiting
Pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back to the deputies
ridge of hair on the dog's back rises and it growls
Identify yourself
Who's there
No answer
The rumbling continues, growing louder
Then a dark object appears
It comes rolling out of the hallway, bounces in front of them and stops
Pendergast shines his light on
'
The mouth is open wide in terror
Across the cheek is a vicious claw mark
Oh
my
God
(hisses) Quiet
And now they hear a    that's abruptly cut off, followed by a second rumbling sound
Jonathan grabs Pendergast by the shirt, panicked
Stay calm
They head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to slope up
After they're gone a few moments the head of rolls to a stop
- Cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance
huge rotating is now turned on
Elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain, umbrellas jousting
'  - Cuthbert's putting on his tux
He adjusts the cummerbund, humming happily as 'Agosta looks on
'Agosta paces, highly agitated and worried
' 'm telling you, something's wrong
still haven't heard from Pendergast
think you should call it off
It's too late now
Guests are arriving
The Mayor's car is pulling up
' 'll go down and speak to him
(irritated) You haven't got the authority
Only Pendergast can pull the plug
' Pendergast may be in trouble
Don't you understand
He still hasn't come back
It's been over three hours -- He'll be back
Relax
We're in good shape
Your security is air tight
There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious
There's no reason to call off the opening now
- Resounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes crossing the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees leading to the Hall of Heavens
The palms themselves are festooned with orchids and violet lights
Somewhere inside, an invisible band is playing "New York, New York"
An army of waiters in white tie thread their way through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with champagne glasses
Cuthbert enters and crosses to meet The  and '
Photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop
- Food is out
Hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths
Decorations have a dark, haunted house theme
hum of activity floats up past the vast Corinthian columns into the circular dome above
'  - An explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant specimens
Margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand Greg a tissue as Frock looks on
What kind of egg is it
It's reptilian
Like the claw
(cautious) Let's not jump to conclusions
This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr
Frock
(excited) Come on, Margo
We're on the verge of something huge
Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room
What if John was right
mean, what if
And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates
When it got to the museum, it hatched
Several problems with that theory
For one thing, this egg is intact
For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat
Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard
If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go
Frock has no answer
Greg gestures to his computer screen
guess you're not interested in this plant anymore, but the chemical analysis is done
Frock reads the computer over Greg's shoulder
"Genus: Unknown
Family: Unknown
Order: Unknown
Phylum: Unknown
Cripes, Margo, what did you give me
Is this an animal or one funky shrub
" (to Kawakita) see you've been programming the computer vocabulary again
(points to a hexagonal symbol) Look at this
An ambyloid reovirus protein
That explains why the computer's confused
The plant's infected with a virus
That's not so unusual
Many plants carry viruses
Like the burls on Maple trees
But a virus normally codes for other viruses
This one's making human and animal proteins
Listen to this
(reads) "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid
Weinstein's tropic hormone
4- monoxytocin supressin hormone
" These plant fibers are loaded with hormones
What kind of hormones
Kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf
The Encyclopedia of Biochemistry, thumbs to a page and reads
4-monoxytocin is
" hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland
" Try Weinstein's tropic hormone
The tension is rising in the room
Frock takes the book, looks this one up, reads silently and removes his glasses
hormone secreted by the human thalamus gland
Kawakita and Frock look puzzled
Margo rises in agitation
This is it
This is what he, or it
is after
The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain
So what
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains
(pales) Eats them
Yes
Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant
When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach
The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing
Beauregard's head
There's a moment of stunned silence
Then a   makes them all jump
It's all right
That means the has finished analyzing the claw
Greg, you go find Pendergast and Lieutenant 'Agosta now
- Kawakita tears up the dark stairs
He turns a corner and something at him
He almost screams
It's a
Hey, where 'za little boys room
Down that hallway
But don't stay long
You don't want to be here alone
'  - Margo and Frock enter and huddle over a sheaf of papers that the printer has spit out
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw
(she reads) "Species unidentified
Genus: unidentified
Phylum unknown
Male, weight in excess of 240 kg
Brain capacity, 900 centimeters
" That means it's highly intelligent
"Quadrupedal
" Quadrupedal
The other name for Mbwun
"He Who Walks on All Fours
" Margo and Frock exchange a look
Holy shit
Margo swallows and keeps reading
"Nocturnal
External hair and bony plates
Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers
Reduced optic chiasm"
poor eyesight
"External mucoid nasal glands,"
very keen scent
"Morphological characteristics: Highly robust
Aggressiveness: extreme
" So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear
(a long moment) Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine
And it's hungry
It's been two days since it's eaten
There are five hundred people arriving right now
The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell
All those people in one enclosed space
It's like ringing the dinner bell
-  - The crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the  cuts a red ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds
Cuthbert is by the mayor's side
He steps forward and raises his hand for quiet
The crowd falls silent
Thank you everyone and welcome
We're glad all of you were willing to brave the inclement weather to be with us tonight
Our special thanks to his honor, the mayor and his lovely wife
The Mayor takes a bow
More applause
(') Some people have questioned whether a superstition exhibit belongs in a Museum of Science
Spells, incantations, demons, magic
these are forces that defy the natural laws
Superstition provides answers to the great questions based on fear
Science provides answers to the great questions based on truth
Science and superstition, then, are polar opposites
Mortal enemies, if you will
And that is why we are here tonight
We have come to learn more about the enemy, and thus to bring about its defeat
For every good, there is an evil, for every dark, a light
And so tonight
my friends,  give you ignorance, terror, unreasoning fear, pure evil
(smiles, gestures to the exhibit) Have a great time
Everyone laughs, applauds again as Cuthbert and the Mayor lead the way inside
Kawakita is making his way over to 'Agosta
The crush at the entrance is incredible
Lieutenant
It's me
' What is it
Dr
Green has to see you
' Got my hands full here
It's important
Please
You have to come
Pendergast, too
She's found out something
'Agosta pulls out his walkie talkie
' McNitt
'Agosta here
-  - Officer McNitt stands in the corner of the computer room, bathed in neon light
Running the security system is , your basic computer nerd
Multiple screens all over show various rooms in the museum
Most are empty with the exception of those showing the exhibition
On these, the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms
McNitt holds his walkie talkie
Yeah Lieutenant
'm here
' ( ) 'm heading to the Evolutionary Bio labs
Any sign of Pendergast
Not yet
At this moment a  comes from the adjoining room
McNitt's head It's a
Hold on Lieutenant
(to George) What was that
Probably just something wrong with the air conditioning
There's a shit load of electrical rooms back there
George is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying attention
McNitt returns to his walkie talkie as the  comes again
Now he looks distinctly nervous
Lieutenant
There's something wrong in the computer room
' ( ) Goddamn it
'll get Ippolito and send him up
George rises
You're over-reacting
Sounds like the air conditioning to me
McNitt watches uneasily as George opens the door, disappears into the next room
-   - 'Agosta turns to Kawakita who waits, shifting from foot to foot
' Damn
There's some kind of problem in the computer room
have to go get Ippolito
You wait here
'Agosta heads into the exhibit before Kawakita can protest
- We see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms () and her  () examine a lidless, rotting European style coffin, complete with corpse
white haired gentleman (
), leans on his cane as he looks at a display on primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture tools
Cuthbert and Ippolito are at the head of a press of people, giving the and   a guided tour
Here we have a very rare sacrificial table from Mesoamerica
The priests would kill the victim on this slab, cut out the heart and eat it while it was still beating
could use one of these things in City Hall
Cuthbert laughs right on cue
They pass a Congo power figure with its bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails
Several people recoil from it, looking repulsed
The 's  sees it and looks distressed
' You're letting kids see this should think they'd have nightmares
Kid will love it
They're our target audience
Nothing here is as violent as what they see on
They pass a  dripping in
The Mayor gestures to it
don't know
That could be a little over the top
It's not even scientific
Mummies don't bleed
Cuthbert's smile fades as he sees the mummy
the '   as he extends his hand to point at the mummy
The pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by a falling
Cuthbert sees it
So does the Mayor and Ippolito
They look up as another    falls right on Cuthbert's face
And yet another droplet falls on  ' ' white bosom, exposed by her low cut dress
Oh
my
God
above the mummy's head, the top of the case is cut away, exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork
hand, a watch, and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the case
small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger
And another drop
Conscious of the panic factor, Ippolito yells
Quiet everyone
But it's too late
The room is packed with people
And 'Agosta himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries out
There's a body up there
ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room, titters as people wonder if it's a joke
At that moment from the darkness above, the ceiling buckles and something
It's  '  , dripping blood
breaks loose
The close space  with screams and shouts
People claw at each other, stumbling desperately trying to get to the door
falls and 'Agosta runs to her to keep her from being trampled in the stampede
- McNitt is staring in horror at the remote camera images showing the chaos in the exhibition, the faces registering blind fear
Alarms start going off all over the place
McNitt calls out
panicked
George
Get out here, now
McNitt looks around, desperate
But George still isn't here
The door to the electrical room is still open
The ceiling shudders from thundering feet
McNitt can hear distant
It's raising the hair on the back of his neck
He calls out
George
Where are you
No answer
He moves to the open door, a new fear in his eyes
He looks inside
- McNitt can't find a light switch
He stays in the doorway, silhouetted by light from the computer room
With shaking hands McNitt pumps a slug into the chamber of his shotgun
There's a strange, low, gurgling sound
It's McNitt's stomach
He silences it, swallows
Hey you
George
Damn it
Where are you
No response
McNitt edges into the darkened rooms
The first one's empty
He tries the next
George
We've got an emergency
Are you here
Suddenly there's a   and a scuttling to his left
It's a terrifying sound
McNitt drops to his knees and pumps three rounds, each with a light and a deafening blast
and a gout of flame licks upwards, illuminating the room with orange light ducks out the door
Oh God
Oh God
Gunpowder hangs in the air like a blue fog
On the far wall, a mounted metal box is smoking from three large, ragged holes
With a sudden pop, an electrical arc slices across the ruined box, followed by a crackling and a shower of sparks
McNitt ducks back into the computer room, slams the door and locks it, breathing hard
- Every single screen flickers and dims
But to McNitt's relief, George has returned
He is sitting with his back to the doorway in his chair
George
saw something in there fired but  think  missed it
George remains still, his back to McNitt, staring at the computer game on the flickering screen
George, for Chrissake answer me
McNitt puts a hand on George's shoulder, swivels his chair around
His face ripped off
- sparking and shorting as an - Everyone pours out of the exhibit, running for the door leading to the Rotunda
People are getting trampled
It's a terrible crush
Screams
Tables over-turned everywhere
Food scatters to the floor
' pushes his way out of the exhibit, crosses to Kawakita, who is appalled
Above, the chandeliers are flickering
What happened
' There's a dead body in the exhibit
People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out
Ippolito runs over to join them
' What the hell is going on
Above them   dim again and come back on
The whole system is shutting down
We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall
' What doors
told you
They seal off all the cells
They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure -- ' You said the system couldn't fail
At this there's a low rumble from above
'Agosta looks up and sees from a slot in the ceiling, and not in an orderly fashion
It's falling fast
Below are crowds of people, all pushing to get out
Officer Bailey, near the door, sees it
Above you
Look out
His voice is lost in an ocean of screaming
Kawakita stands in total horror a moment, then joins Bailey and 'Agosta
All of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door
Ippolito, on the other hand, elbows his way to the front of the fleeing crowd
' Ippolito
Get back here
Like hell
Ignoring 'Agosta, Ippolito pushes past
He barrels over an who stumbles and falls
Ippolito jumps over him and is out
The old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and
' runs forward, dives for the old man but he's not in time
Kawakita covers his eyes, unable to watch as the lights flicker a third and last time
The room is plunged into darkness
And over the screams we hear the rumble and , the horrifying cries of the old man, as the door comes down
'  - Margo and Frock stand in the darkness
Through a high window we can see lightning flash
What's going on
Some kind of power failure
Maybe it's the storm
Do you have a flashlight
think so
She gets one from a cupboard
Greg's been gone over a half hour
We'd better get out of here
Get the crate
- Frock wheels his chair as fast as he can
Margo runs beside him carrying the crate with the fibers inside
peel of thunder ends and distant screaming is heard
Margo stops, appalled
Dr
Frock
Did you hear that
Don't stop now
Up ahead they hear   and a
They round a corner and come up against a huge
What's that
It's one of the fire doors
Good Lord, Margo
We're trapped
- Pendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac, studying the blue prints by a stone wall
Jonathan and the dog are with him, exhausted and terrified
Jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as Pendergast works
know where we are now
We're getting out, Jonathan
This should be another door
Taking a pen knife from his pocket, Pendergast places it into the plaster and gently twists the blade
piece of plaster the size of a dinner plate falls, revealing the tracings of another doorway
Pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark, dusty room
Hallelujah, Pendergast
Where the hell are we now
""  - Jonathan and Pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door
Pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with specimens
All are stored in jars of alcohol
There are fetuses of many different species
We see a pig, a cow, a duck billed platypus as well as brain sections, a disembodied monkey head
One rectangular glass container holds a skinned human foot
Jesus, what is this
Another storage room
Pendergast tries the light switch to no effect
Something's happened
The power's out
They cross the room to the main door and exit
Now they're in
-  - Pendergast shines his light on the maceration tanks
The humming of the bugs can be heard in their cabinet
All right
know where we are
This is the osteo prep lab
was in here earlier
We're safe now
With these words, the dog
Jonathan freezes and sniffs the air
Oh no
smell it
Keep the animal quiet
Jonathan kneels by Hobbes as Pendergast listens, every nerve on end sound comes from the adjacent hallway that leads to the secure storage area
It's unmistakable   and the creeping movement of claws
Pendergast lifts his gun
Go out the other doorway
There's a stair at the end of the hall
Up five flights is a corridor that leads to the Hall of the Heavens
Find Lieutenant 'Agosta
Bring help
Jonathan doesn't have to be told twice
He takes the dog and exits from the other side of the lab leaving Pendergast alone
Pendergast waits a moment until Jonathan's safely out of sight
He switches off his flashlight, backs up slowly, step by step
He opens the door to the alcoholics storage
As he slips inside a   appears
""  - Slowly, making no sound, Pendergast lifts the
45 Anaconda, passes his finger over the cylinder, checking the loaded chambers
Then he steadies the revolver and levels it at the door
The hideous pickled specimens seem to hover all around him
The smell is overwhelming and the snuffling is louder now
It's coming closer
After a long moment there is a faint bump at the door
This is followed by a low scratching noise
Pendergast watches frozen in horror, holding his breath
Not knowing what else to do, Pendergast simply grabs it from the inside and holds on
he hears an  , then a
There's and the door shivers
It's over now
Pendergast kneels down, bracing the gun in both hands
From this position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell
His mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees
a , red-rimmed,
Involuntarily Pendergast  , nearly falls and drops the gun
Beakers crash around him
He scrambles in the darkness
The flashlight falls and pops back on
The beam streaks up crazily
It's chaos
Pendergast is an easy target now
He grabs for the light, the gun, steadies himself, breathing fast and low
His heart pounds
But nothing more happens
The silence is heavy
The eye is gone
And suddenly Pendergast understands
In the distance he can hear   and a rolling wheelchair
Somewhere nearby are
The monster has left him to get bigger game
Fear for Margo and Frock lights Pendergast's eyes
All panic and disorganization are gone
He holds his revolver at 12 o'clock and  the door open, leaps out as It's headed for the secure storage areas again
Pendergast takes off
Not knowing how else to address this thing he finds himself calling
Halt
-  - Pendergast runs into the hallway but he's already too late
The hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed
as he levels his gun and shoots
stops, rears back on its haunches, looks once at Pendergast, pissed
As the  around the far corner fall silent, Pendergast
The shot blasts off a piece of the wall
With astonishing speed and agility for its bulk, the beast turns and leaps around the corner, passing out of Pendergast's sight
Margo
Frock
It's coming
Run
Are
Frock holds the keys to secure storage area 1012 in his hand
Margo has the flashlight and the crate with the fibers
They can hear the sound of thundering movement
Look
Margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast
It's descending like a freight train
One split second of sheer amazement, then
Dr
Frock
Quick
Frock, immobilized in his wheel chair, stares at the monster, like a trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk
Margo grabs his keys from him, fumbles desperately to open the door
It swings wide at last
She grabs the handles of the wheelchair, tugs with all her might
The wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn thing inside
- Margo shoves Frock behind her, slams the door shut
Seconds later, the beast throws itself against the storage door
They hear it outside, growling in fury, claws lashing out
Margo and Frock press back in the darkness, terror in their eyes
- Pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway, his gun drawn, his flashlight on
few more steps and he holds hard
His eyes go wide in astonishment as his light illuminates the beast
It's tearing at the steel door furiously with incredible force
As the flashlight beam hits it,  roars and looks up
Now we see it clearly for the first time
The monster is , putrid, rank
Slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red
ridge of stiff black hair rises on the creature's buffalo-like humped back
The withers are muscled and covered with plates
forked  licks out as purple lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth
The claws raise up to fend off the light
steadies himself with difficulty, takes a few seconds to aim with the greatest care
Mbwun makes a move towards him and he squeezes the trigger hard
The gun echoes in the hall
split second and a white streak moves right up the beast's cranium
direct hit
The shot echoes and Mbwun drops it's claws
The flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the beast's eyes
Angry and blinded, the creature turns and in a moment, lopes off
Pendergast watches, unimaginably relieved
Realizing what just happened, his knees start to buckle
He catches himself, wipes one hand across his eyes
voice comes from the storage room
() Pendergast
Are you all right
No
think 'm hallucinating
The storage door opens slowly and Margo looks out
You're not
Where is it
(shakes his head) Gone
Wounded
No
chromium alloy tipped
45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball think it was bothered by my light
That would fit
It's nocturnal
Quick
Come inside
- As hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain
crying, terrified, unclear what exactly happened
These are the lucky ones
Among them we find
His walkie talkie is squawking
The windows of the museum behind him are black
' Ippolito
Where the hell are you
We're trapped in here
We need help
Ippolito
Come in, dammit
Ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain, knowing the extent of what he's done
The wheels are working hard now, trying to figure out damage control
The walkie talkie keeps calling
He doesn't respond
- Tables are overturned, food lies on the ground, people cower in the darkness
'Agosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie talkie
He shuts it off, rises, looks around
Light comes from a few sputtering candles
Most of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the lowered steel door
Among them are  and
From the  of the man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood
Bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door
Manual overrides aren't working
'm getting nothing, Lieutenant
' Great
Frank, the father of the teenage girl, Lauren, steps forward
There's no power
The whole system's down
The crowd starts to murmur
One man yells
We're trapped
And there's a killer in here
' We'll get out safely if everyone stays calm
Is anyone else hurt
The  stands
His wife's forehead is bleeding
Yes
My wife
' Is there a doctor
The distinguished grey haired man with a cane comes forward
'm Dr
Pound
' Check this woman and see if anyone else needs you
Pound moves off
Everyone spins now at the incongruous sound of a 'Agosta pulls his gun
The door to a stairwell at the far end of the room opens and Hobbes bounds into the hall
He's followed by Jonathan, who is filthy and wild-eyed
(calls) Lieutenant 'Agosta
Don't shoot
' Where's Pendergast
(crossing, breathless) Five flights down
We were lost in the sub-basement
Something's down there
It killed our two deputies
When  left Pendergast it was coming back
He sent me for help
We have to hurry
'Agosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight
The remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to disappear
In the center, two men are bending over a still form
One of them is Dr
Pound
' Both of you
Get back here
But he's still alive -- ' Get back now
The urgency in 'Agosta's voice gets everyone's attention
The Mayor brings his wife over
Cuthbert comes too
They huddle apart from the others
Cuthbert's white with fear
What's going on
'Agosta speaks low
' There's some kind of animal loose in the museum
Pendergast's alone
He needs help
want volunteers to go with me
'm in
(swallows) Me too
(voice rising in fear) 'd do it gladly but someone needs to stay with these people
' All right
You're elected
Bailey, get all the guns and flashlights, give the mayor your walkie talkie so we can keep in touch
Cuthbert, keep everyone together and make sure they stay quiet
Frank steps forward
was in the Marines
Give me a gun
'd go with you, too, but 've got my daughter
' What's your name
Frank
' All right
You guard these people and your daughter
'Agosta gives Frank his service revolver
' (to 'Agosta) Where are you going
Don't leave us alone
The remaining crowd begins to whimper
The Mayor rises
Everyone quiet
The Lieutenant's in charge
Bailey and 'Agosta carry shot guns
They quietly move to the back stairwell at the far end of the Hall of the Heavens
Everyone else bunches together and watches
' Bailey, we'll go first and check the stairwell
Jonathan, you and Greg guard the door
Jonathan gives Hobbes' leash to the Mayor
'Agosta hands Greg Kawakita a shotgun, tightens his grip on his own
Then he gives the signal and Bailey yanks open the door to the stairwell
- 'Agosta and Bailey go in slowly
Jonathan stays in the doorway, sweeping the stairwell with his flashlight
Kawakita gingerly holds his shotgun
He's scared out of his mind
He turns to Jonathan, whispers
Excuse me
Could you tell me how this thing works
Oh Jesus
Don't point it at me
Just aim and shoot
'Agosta heads down the stairs in the lead, with Bailey close behind
The stairwell is windowless and dark
'Agosta shines his light and it cuts into the blackness
He moves quietly, makes the first landing and stops
Bailey watches his back from several steps behind as 'Agosta signals for him to wait
The flashlight flares into a glass door one flight down
'Agosta raises his hand
' (low) Hold on
thought  saw something
Everyone stops
Bailey pumps his shotgun
So does Jonathan
Kawakita fumbles to do like the others
They wait
'Agosta moves alone down several more steps
The silence is heavy
Suddenly 'Agosta wrinkles his nose
' Whoa
You smell that
Lieutenant
Get back
Too late
At this something
huge dark shape , descending two floors
It lands, pounces on and the marble walls echo with a
' Bailey  in terror as Mbwun pins him down
Three claws close on his neck and
There's a horrifying snap as Bailey's
Blood  all over and drips down the stairs
' levels his shotgun at the monster and fires, with no apparent effect
When the shots stop echoing we hear  and from the hall
'   look up and it's
The monster   Bailey's body and heads for the door
'Agosta, seeing what's happening, screams at the top of his lungs
' Jonathan
Don't let it get into the hall
frozen in the doorway, Kawakita by his side
Both of them are rigid with horror
Disbelief in their eyes
The  leaps up directly at them as they jump to try and close the door
'Agosta keeps firing until he's pumping an empty chamber
Plaster is falling all around
resound in the Hall of the Heavens as 'Agosta stumbles up the stairs
- 'Agosta throws open the doors and charges into the Hall
Jonathan lies on the ground, dazed
Kawakita stands to one side, teeth chattering in shock
His hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the gun swings in his hand
' (yells) Where is it
don't know
It hit me hard
'Agosta pumps two shells in the shotgun
Screams can be heard from the people crouched together at the edge of the room
Hobbes is barking wildly, foaming at the mouth
It's too dark to see what's happening
' (screams) Somebody tell me
Where is it now
(quiet) Lieutenant
In the south corner
'Agosta sweeps his light to the Mayor who stands rigid in front of the others, points to his left
The light moves to the far end of the room where      crouches over the body of a man
It's lunging up and down with odd, jerking motions
The man is long past making a sound
From the monster comes a faint crunching and slobbering
Jonathan rises, comes to 'Agosta
So does Frank
They stand shoulder to shoulder, raise their guns
'Agosta motions for Kawakita
' On three
Kawakita stumbles to join them, tries to join in
The barrel of his shot gun still swings wildly
He steadies it by taking it in both hands
' One, two
three
All three fire
There's a loud report
The kickback knocks Kawakita backwards
Screams erupt from the huddled group
Hobbes abruptly shuts up
The men fire and fire until there's nothing left
'Agosta reaches for more shells, comes up empty
' Jonathan
Get everyone behind me
Jonathan moves
'Agosta sweeps his light across the room but already the shape is gone
Cuthbert hides behind the Mayor, calls out in a terrified squeal
It went out the door to the rotunda
'Agosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors
There's a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam both doors
He picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles
Backs up
The doors shudder as something hits them hard
' Get everyone into the stairwell
Jonathan, the Mayor, Cuthbert and Kawakita together herd everyone towards the stairwell
They move inside
- Dark and close
The smell of gunpowder and death
The Mayor's Wife sees Bailey's body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up
Sweet Jesus
' Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan
Move
My office is on the third floor
There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone
We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help
' have to help Pendergast
Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me
The rest of you can go with Cuthbert
think we should stick together
(taking Bailey's shotgun) Me too
'm leaving
Whoever wants can come with me
No one follows
' Wait
Cuthbert's gone
' Jonathan, go with him
He isn't armed
Jonathan grabs Hobbes' leash from the Mayor and bounds up the stairs
Good luck
Everyone else follows 'Agosta
Together, they head down
- Police cars are pulling up outside the museum
Sirens wail
Torrents of rain limit the number of onlookers
Crowds of people are scattered about
There's disbelief on everyone's faces
Many people are in shock
Ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a near the gate
He yanks the door open and jumps inside
- number of museum security personnel are milling in confusion
All right everyone
'm in charge
Status report
One of the security men, , rises
Swat teams are on the way
Fire trucks with them
Everything's slowed down because of the rain
We're bringing in portable generators
They'll get the emergency lights working but they won't pump enough power to lift the doors
Ippolito pulls out his walkie talkie
'Agosta
Ippolito
Come in
' ( ) (a string of curses followed by
) Where the hell are you
made it outside
'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here
Help is on the way
Just sit tight
' ( ) It's a little late, you son of a bitch
There's a friggin' monster loose in here
Get the , the fire department
Find metal cutters, cut through
And bring a cannon
The damn thing is huge
long moment as the men look at each other
Did he say monster
Panic attack
- 'Agosta's group has reached a lower floor
Here this stairwell ends
Ahead stretches the hall of the Asian peoples
() 'Agosta, put on the Mayor
'Agosta passes the walkie talkie to the Mayor
Mayor Jordan here
( ) This is Ippolito, head of museum security
Relieve 'Agosta and take command
Don't tell me what to do you chicken shit bastard
saw you cut and run
Lieutenant 'Agosta stayed with us
He is in charge
There is a monster
saw it
Cut through those doors and get us out of here, now
The Mayor shuts off the walkie talkie and they round another corner and disappear from sight
- Ippolito finds Waters and the others staring at him
Humiliated, he swallows hard
All right
The steel doors are designed to retard cutting
We can go through them, but it would take hours
The quickest way in would be to go through the roof, sir
Cell two goes up to the fifth floor
There are sky lights up there
Co-ordinate with the fire department and  teams
Move
- It's very dark
The huge shape of  can barely be seen sliding out of the stairwell and into the Hall of the Asian Peoples
Then come on in the corners of the ceiling
The monster utters a low growl
The emergency generators are beginning to come on
The animal lopes to the spot where we last saw 'Agosta and his group, sniffs the ground
It looks up and, with a curiously human gesture, cocks its massive head
The silence is broken by
They're in the distance and muffled, but definitely there
The monster crouches eagerly, lopes forward with great stealth
The voices are getting louder
We follow as it goes through the hall and down
At the bottom, Mbwun quickly turns a corner
The voices have stopped
Mbwun creeps forward, enters
- huge room several stories high
hangs suspended from the ceiling
Dioramas of fish line all the walls
Mbwun pauses next to a diorama of the gentle, vegetarian sea cow,
The two make a startling contrast
pause and then the voices are heard again, much louder now
The source is right around the edge of the Manatee display
Mbwun , claws lashing out
He turns the corner and crashes through a wall of  as he grabs at the source of the voices
display of small, extraordinarily life-like
They've been re-activated with the emergency power system
Each little talking figure is no more then five inches high
They move around a small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung systems of fish
stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms, mesmerized
He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a
Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch one of the holograms
But the shadowy creatures can't be caught
The beast seems to realize this,  and moves off
As he goes he passes behind a It stands in middle the open room
The elevator is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story exhibit
In the dim light, with his poor vision, the monster doesn't see 'Agosta, the Mayor, Kawakita, and their entire group The monster exits the exhibit and quietly 'Agosta slides the doors open
Everyone, all thirty-five people in evening clothes, quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the far side of the hall
1012 - Margo, Frock and Pendergast wait in the darkness
Pendergast, for the first time, seems fazed
don't know how to deal with this
It's hellish
Like nothing  ever saw
'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that
It's not supernatural
Mbwun is an animal
Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam
But this isn't the jungle
This is New York
How did it get here thing like that crossed two continents
It makes no sense
(lame) We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate
don't believe it
None of that matters now
The people upstairs need us
We have to help
We can't
We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements
If we go outside, we're risking more lives
You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do
The building must be swarming with police by now
It won't take long for them to get through the doors
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes
But what can we do
Our guns are useless -- We have the fibers
Don't you see
The creature is hungry
It wants the hormones in these plants
It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers
We're just a poor substitute
To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants
'  - Cuthbert enters with Jonathan and the dog, Hobbes
Cuthbert locks the door with shaking hands
He mutters to himself in terror
Solid oak
Two inches thick
Tell me they'll hold
Cuthbert scurries to his desk and pulls out a Ruger
38 Magnum
got it after  was mugged in the subway last spring
Where's the walk-in safe
Behind you
What's the combination
'll do it
Just let me find my portable phone
He rummages in the darkness, going through his desk
Forget it
Calm down
found it
Cuthbert flips the phone open and turns it on
Battery's dead
Shit
Let's go
Cuthbert crosses to a huge wall safe, starts frantically turning the tumblers
Jonathan follows with the dog
That thing won't come after us, right
It's going for bigger game
The group blundering around in the basement
Poor fools
Hurry up
Just a minute
'm shaking
Take the gun
Cuthbert fumbles to hand over the Ruger
As he does, something drops
Oh God
dropped my rabbit's foot
Cuthbert drops to his knees, groping in the darkness
For Chrissake, 'll do it
What's the combination
To the left twice then five no
sorry
think it's fifteen
it's been a while
Oh Jesus
Jonathan starts again, sweating
The tumblers fall with agonizing slowness
Cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck charm
Meanwhile, unnoticed by Jonathan, the dog is staring at the oak doors
We see the     rise
Fifteen
what's next
Eight to the right
Look
found it
Clutching the rabbit's foot like a talisman, Cuthbert leaps up just as the last tumbler falls
At this the oak doors behind them  , splintering like so many match sticks
Cuthbert  in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast
The dog barks wildly at Mbwun
Jonathan lifts his shot gun
But the monster barrels past him and zeros in on Cuthbert
and encircles Cuthbert's waist
It squeezes him horribly, drags him towards the open jaws
Cuthbert bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter
He opens his hand and the rabbit's foot drops
The last Jonathan sees of Cuthbert is his head disappearing down Mbwun's throat
Hobbes barks and whines in terror
Jonathan takes the leash and drags the animal out
- Jonathan and Hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear
Behind them comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls
-    - The door opens slowly and Pendergast appears
He shines his beam in both directions
All clear
Margo and Frock quickly come out
Margo holds the crate
Frock tries to follow in his wheelchair
'm coming with you
No, Dr
Frock
You can't
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger
Unlock one of the other storage rooms
We're going upstairs
We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here
Margo, this is too dangerous
You always think you can solve everything
This time you don't have enough information
The animal might behave in unexpected ways
(to Pendergast) Leave her here with me
Don't put her in danger
He's right
No
You'll need me -- At this a   comes from upstairs
What's that
Footsteps
No, not footsteps
People running for their lives
All three know this ends the discussion
Frock opens the door to room 1010
Inside are shelves of priceless ivory tusks
Margo takes Pendergast's handkerchief and wraps her hand
She quickly sprinkles some of the fibers inside the door to room 1012
Before Dr
Frock disappears into room 1010, he looks back to Margo one last time
Come back and get me
We will
Remember, it has poor eyesight
It hunts with its sense of smell
So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes
- Margo and Pendergast emerge from the hall to the storage rooms and run for the far stairs
From somewhere above the sound of running is louder now
- 'Agosta and his group enter the large domed space in disarray
They're spread out and panicked, the young helping the old
Dr
Pound is finding it hard to keep up
Frank and his daughter Lauren bring him along
The Mayor quietly urges people forward
His wife's face is streaked with tears
Kawakita runs with 'Agosta
It's still back there
' know
Now a voice is heard in the distance
() Where are you
Who's there
Everyone stops
'Agosta shines his light into the large space
Above them constellations glow
'Agosta calls out
' Pendergast
- Margo and Pendergast run
Margo carries the crate carefully wrapped in Pendergast's jacket
That was 'Agosta
The planetarium
(calls out) Vince
' () Over here
There's a double steel fire door at the end of the hallway
Pendergast and Margo run for it
Pendergast shoves at the door
It won't budge
There's a small glass window
In it, 'Agosta's face appears
' (through the window) Pendergast
Help
It's right behind us
This door's locked
Try shooting the hinges off
- 'Agosta turns to his group
' Step back
'Agosta, Frank and Kawakita aim their guns at the door and shoot repeatedly
The shots echo wildly
The sound is terrifyingly loud
The small glass window shatters
Then the men lean heavily on the door
It still won't budge
'Agosta looks through the window
' It's no use
We have to get out of here
(to Kawakita) Give them your walkie talkie
Kawakita hands his walkie talkie through the window
Margo takes it
Is Dr
Frock safe
Yes, he's fine
Greg
take care of yourself
- Pendergast looks desperately at the blueprints
Is there another way around
No
The planetarium is in the next cell
This is one of the fire doors
Pendergast returns to the window
Vince
There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down
There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit
' The sub-basement
've been down there
It links up to the old sewer system
can guide you out
'Agosta turns to the others
' How much ammo do we have to make a stand
You're asking me
don't even know how to load this thing
Four rounds
There's a movement of air
and a ripe, fetid smell
' Oh shit
'Agosta pumps his shot gun
' smell it
It's here
Go out the north exit
There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases
Run
' Everybody
Get behind me
The others move past
'Agosta, Frank and Greg Kawakita hold the rear
The group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment, disappears
- Pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously
From the south entrance to the planetarium, an    slinks into view
Pendergast steps back from the doorway, turns to Margo
Hide quickly
What are you going to do
Pendergast checks his gun, totally calm
Buy them some time
Margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas
There's a plain door at their end of the hall
Pendergast faces the broken window
the beast is slinking away after 'Agosta and the others, headed to the north exit from the Planetarium
calls out
Hey you big tub of lard
Over here
, turns
Pendergast puts his palms up at his ears, wiggles his fingers and makes a face through the window
Come on, you smelly pile of refuse
Come get me
dare you
surprised  comes from the beast
It crouches as if to pounce
Pendergast makes more faces, sticks his tongue out
The beast watches in silence, its evil eyes fixed
watching Pendergast
She can't leave him yet
What is it doing
(loud) It's scared of me
Suddenly there's a  and the door  like cardboard lash through
Margo screams as the claws pass inches from Pendergast's face
He leaps back, lifts his gun which looks like a pea shooter in the face of Mbwun
Two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door, then Mbwun simply  it out of the frame
This leaves Pendergast face to face with the foul, enormous monster
It regards him evenly, blinks once
Then the tongue slides out, licks its lips eagerly and
Pendergast  on his high powered , shining it at close range right in the beast's eyes
Then carefully, with total calm he ,
The beast howls more in anger than pain, and swipes at Pendergast
Pendergast dives to one side and, the claws miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light
Now Pendergast spins and runs for all he's worth
Margo's been waiting, holding the door
Drop the fibers
She leaves the crate behind as Pendergast dives inside with her
Margo shoves the door shut hard as Mbwun, still blinded, leaps into the hall
But now, suddenly, all is quiet
No sign of Margo and Pendergast
The beast moves forward, snuffling slowly
It starts for the door which hides Margo and Pendergast, but stops as it finds
The beast moves to it, clearly surprised
It pokes at the crate carefully, inhales the fragrance and grunts
The monster seems to be struggling with itself
It sniffs the fibers, lifts a few out carefully, then
Then it rises on its haunches and squints into the dark
On all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo, gazelle, wild horses, wolves, giant elk, sabre tooth tigers
Mbwun moves close to one after another
Suddenly we notice, in the back of one of the dioramas
Margo and Pendergast
They stand frozen, crouching behind mannequins of native Americans riding horses across the plains
The beast sniffs , then turns away
Confused, it heads back towards the Planetarium and slinks from the room
Pendergast and Margo exchange an astonished look
They whisper
What happened
Its eyesight is worse than thought
It couldn't see us
And it couldn't smell us through the glass
It didn't want the fibers
What does that mean
think
it means it's full
Then it won't go after the others
No
It's still hunting, but not for the hormones
For what
think
for the pleasure of the kill
-  - Greg, the Mayor, 'Agosta and the others are in a hallway lined with at least a dozen vases
has been shoved aside revealing the outlines of a door
Behind is a sloping dark corridor
The last of the thirty-five people pack in
Greg and 'Agosta cover the corridor
' That's it, let's go
Grim-faced, 'Agosta follows Kawakita as they duck through the doorway, shutting it behind them
The impact rattles the wall and the Greek vase falls
- - Kawakita and 'Agosta reach the bottom and turn to see the Mayor, his wife, Dr
Pound and their whole group standing in several feet of rushing water
Lauren is shivering
Her father has his arm around her tight
Behind them are two corridors, one forking left and the other straight
'Agosta gets out the walkie talkie, clicks it on
' (into walkie talkie) Pendergast
We made it
You all right
- Pendergast has the plans open as he studies them
He speaks into the walkie talkie
Margo paces behind him, thinking hard
We're fine
Take the left fork behind you
You'll be in a straight passage
When the hall forks again in fifty yards go right
Then radio back
- - 'Agosta shuts off his walkie talkie
Everyone's staring at him
' All right
Kawakita, cover the rear
Oh shit
No, Lieutenant
He's not a good enough shot
'll do it if you take care of my daughter
'Agosta nods
Frank expertly reloads
'Agosta holsters the walkie talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage
Kawakita takes charge of Lauren, who is confused and terrified
The tunnel has a slight downhill grade, and the water begins to move faster, tugging at everyone's legs
People slip and slide as they half make their way down the hill
'Agosta calls behind them
' Damn
It's getting deep
See anything
back not far from the first fork
He looks towards the head of the tunnel, calls out
You'll be the first to know
Frank turns and plunges after the others
But then suddenly, he stops
'
he reaches the second fork and takes a right
This tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper
Slimy plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on
'Agosta pulls out his walkie talkie
' Pendergast
made the right hand fork
We're already in about three feet of water
Where should we go
But before Pendergast can answer, 'Agosta hears the loud report of Frank's gun
Everyone freezes in the darkness
The walkie talkie cackles and 'Agosta shouts
' Hello
() Sweet Jesus, help
They hear  in the water
Lauren , tries to run back
Kawakita grabs her
There's more thrashing water and then silence
' Frank
Are you all right
'Agosta starts for Frank but the Mayor catches his arm and holds him
It's too late
Everyone waits, staring into the darkness
Still no answer
Lauren Dad
'Agosta turns his flashlight on the water
It's running red
He spins to the Mayor, points down the tunnel
' Run
People start to cry and whimper as the Mayor urges them on
He takes charge of Lauren
Only Greg Kawakita stays with 'Agosta
They stand shoulder to shoulder and completely alone
Thrashing in the water can be heard as the beast comes closer
There's a low, pleasurable growl
Both men lift their guns
' On three
Kawakita nods
Behind them in the tunnel is total blackness
Ahead is equally dark
The noise of their friends gets ever fainter
The water now rushes half way up their thighs
Kawakita's teeth start to chatter
He bites them shut, steadies his gun
' One
two
Silence as the water murmurs
'Agosta holds the count
long, agonizing moment
Kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel
think it's gone
Suddenly a   snakes out of the water right in front of them and the beast roars up
It was beneath the surface, directly before them
The claw closes on 'Agosta and his shot gun goes off
'Agosta screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth
For one horrible moment, Kawakita is frozen
Then he leaps forward, shoves the barrel of his gun behind 'Agosta, right in the beast's open jaws
He pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes, the recoil throwing him back, ass over tea cups in the water
With a roar of pain the monster drops 'Agosta and retreats in the dark
'Agosta grabs Kawakita
' think you took its tonsils out
They haul ass down the tunnel, firing behind them as they go
Ahead is another fork
The group is waiting
When they see 'Agosta and Kawakita, a cheer goes up
Which way
As he runs up, 'Agosta grabs for his walkie talkie
The holster , the walkie talkie gone
Without missing a beat he registers what's happened, then covers it up with the next breath
He points to the right as if there's no doubt and says
' This way
'Agosta exchanges a look with Kawakita, who understands exactly what happened
As they plunge into the right tunnel, Greg mutters
Holy shit
- Pendergast and Margo come out of the door leading to the back entry to the dioramas
Pendergast holds the walkie talkie, desperate
Vince
Can you hear me
Vince
Nothing but static comes in response
Margo paces in agitation
We have to try and draw it off
How
The answer's right in front of us
She points to one of the dioramas
It shows a bird being stalked by a fox
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing
The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest
(starts running) It's deceptively simple
Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse
Margo heads for the Planetarium, calling
Help
Please someone
Help
They disappear down the hall with the Greek vases, both calling with all they've got
- There are increasing numbers of  vehicles around lands on the roof
The rescue effort continues to be slowed by rain pouring down
Ippolito is in the thick of the action
The
commander, , comes over buckling an ammo belt over his fatigues
We're ready
We've got enough firepower to turn a herd of lions into a fine red mist
Then do it
Jennings nods, goes off
As Ippolito watches the
team break the glass skylights, gets ready to go in
- Jonathan crouches in the staircase at the end of the Hall of the Reptiles
Hobbes is still by his side
He keeps the gun pointed out into the room, his eyes scanning the dark
He whispers to Hobbes, as if to comfort both of them
It's okay, Hobbes
We'll be all right
Help has got to come eventually
We'll make it
We'll be fine
Suddenly he sees something
What appears to be a  lying on a glass case
Jonathan pumps his gun, approaches slowly
The man wears a tuxedo, is lying very still
As we get closer we see it's Kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago
He suddenly
Jonathan starts
Now the man gently snores
Jonathan moves to him, shakes the drunk's shoulder
Hey
Wake up
The man snorts, opens his eyes and frowns
Who the hell are you
You first
Jonathan helps the drunk off the glass case
The man's a little unsteady as he tugs at his tux
got lost tryin' to find the bathroom
was walkin' in circles
lay down for a nap
What's going on
You wouldn't believe me if  told you
Hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw Jonathan's attention
What is it, boy
From above comes the beating of a distant  and then the sound of breaking glass
Hobbes pulls Jonathan back to the staircase
Jonathan grins, follows behind with the drunk
Where we going
think we're going home
- Huge skeletons of Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus loom in the darkness
Rain is pouring in
Jonathan, Hobbes and the drunk enter, looks up to the sky lights
hits, illuminating the dinosaurs and a
team which is descending on a series of ropes
It's a sixty foot drop
Jonathan steps forward
Hello
We're over here
They run across the long hall and wait as the the men descend
The first one down is Jennings
Are you hurt
We're fine
don't know about the people downstairs
In the Hall of the Heavens
The basement
you'll need help
There's a monster down there
sling suspended on ropes is lowered down
The rescue workers will lift you out one at a time
Jennings signals to a group of five men, heavily armed and in flack jackets
They prepare to get the drunk out
- Pendergast and Margo are at the top of the long, narrow shaft
Pendergast's flashlight sends a circle of light onto a sheet of black, oily water below
Both of them continue calling, trying to draw off the monster
Help someone
Oh God
Help
They suddenly hear the sound of splashing
An updraft rustles their clothes
Margo sniffs the air, turns to Pendergast
You smell that
It's coming
Run
- - The group has reached another intersection of tunnels
The left fork turns back uphill
'Agosta indicates this tunnel
' At least we'll be dry
They all press forward in the low vaulted darkness
As they move steadily upwards the water recedes
Kawakita's flashlight flickers and he bangs it
It comes on again
believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection
' Not so loud
'Agosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in a large round
What's that
' All right everybody, hold up
Kawakita and 'Agosta move past the shivering people who are strung out along the sides of the tunnel
'Agosta touches each person as he passes
' We don't know what's in there
Let me go first
- The Mayor follows behind with the group as Kawakita and 'Agosta lead the way
The pipe is dry and rusted
They move forward with stealth
In twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness
'Agosta steps out first
- The group huddles at the mouth of the pipe, confused, as 'Agosta pans his flashlight around the huge space
The walls are carved out of dirt and rounded like a cave
From the ceiling hang huge cobwebs
There's a large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed
On a mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag
Greg moves to it, shines his light on the side
name is written in marker
' What does it say
(looks up, shocked) Dr
John Whittlesley
' What's that doing here
don't know
thought Dr
Whittlesley died in South America
(interrupts) Look
There's a ladder at the end think it goes up to the street
They move forward into the darkness eagerly, towards the ladder which leads up to a manhole
But as they pass the bed of twigs, something loud  underfoot
What is that
'Agosta shines his light down and everyone freezes
Then one woman The wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white
The noise is louder and we see its source
Atop the bones is the body of
It's covered with
They're stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh
The group panics and breaks for the ladder
Kawakita and 'Agosta once more guard the rear
Dear God
Where are we, Lieutenant
' 'd say we're in its home
- Pendergast and Margo run down the long dark room, passing an enormous hollowed-out canoe
As they exit the far end, the dark shape of Mbwun emerges
It leaps forward, closing in fast
- Margo and Pendergast enter a series of maze-like room with hidden corners, nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric Buddhist and Japanese Art
They're running through the twists and turns as fast as they can
We're not going to make the storage room
Listen to me, Pendergast
Mbwun's is part homo sapien
In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain
If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it
Shoot it in the eye
It circled ahead and was waiting in front of them
The animal swipes at Margo and Pendergast
The force of the monster's blow sends Margo reeling and slams Pendergast into the wall
He falls, crumples and drops his gun
The case beside him  spewing relics, as Mbwun pushes past
Pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty
is frantically crawling away in the dark
The beast makes a low sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw, easily pins her down
Pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon
now   the heaving body of the monster
Powerless, she looks up into the horrible face of death as Mbwun raises an enormous claw
Pendergast, desperate, cries out -- Please, no
Don't hurt Margo
Oddly enough, the beast pauses for once
Talking to the damn thing is the one tactic no one has tried
The claw halts in mid-air
The beast blinks once and looks from Pendergast to Margo
Margo sees a flash of something unexpectedly in its eyes
In astonishment, she whispers
My God
You understand
As they stare, amazed, imperceptibly, the beast appears to narrow its eyes in response
Margo controls her voice, keeps it even
Please let me go
We won't hurt you
strange noise comes out of the monster
low, confused growl
He doesn't loosen his grip on Margo, but he leans down to look at her closer with one green, unblinking eye
She struggles not to turn away in revulsion
His enormous jaws are right near her throat
Everything is very still
And then
breaks out
The
team is in the doorway, laying down everything they've got
The creature  as if betrayed, leaves Margo and
It barrels down on the
team, picks up Jennings and
Jennings hits the floor with his neck at a crazy angle
It snaps like a twig
The other men drop back
Mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath
Pendergast moves to help the
team
Margo struggles to her feet and her hand touches the wall
Beside her is a   in a cabinet
In a split second Margo hauls it out, throws a switch and gets a
She turns it on the beast as it grabs for Pendergast
The force of the water is enormous
It pushes the monster out the end of the hall
Pendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it
Run
She takes off blindly in the maze-like room
From somewhere behind her she hears a horrible
as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases, tearing blindly in the dark
Ahead is a door
She dives through it and finds she's in
'  -  - row of mirrors and urinals line the wall
It's a huge room, designed to handle crowds of visitors
Margo ducks into one of the stalls as crashes in
Margo looks through a crack in the door to see
'
The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound
The claws lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with glass
Then the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered
Margo sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood
The mouth, too, appears to be bleeding
The
team's bullets had an affect
Margo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer
It's just outside
It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door
Margo screams and the thing grabs her
It holds Margo up before it and roars
It closes its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for everything
The claws tighten
She struggles and fights to no purpose but then the beast pauses
it's seen something
It stops and its grip loosens
pained look flashes across its bestial face
And in that split moment Margo looks down
gleams around the beast's throat too
The necklace is the twin to her own
Can it be possible
She stares at the thing
John's necklace
You killed him
Incredibly the beast shakes its head
noise comes from it
a sad noise, like a groan
And now Margo gets it
She can hardly believe it
Her eyes widen in astonishment
She whispers
Oh Jesus
John
The name is a knife through the monster's heart
No
It's not possible
The last piece of the puzzle falls
The monster is John Whittlesley
Margo, still desperately frightened, tries to keep control
John
If it is you
can help
The monster shakes its head no and releases her
As she watches he moves away, quickly limps out the door
- Mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet, headed for the stairs
In the darkness of the hall of Asian Peoples, Pendergast is waiting
He lifts one of the
team rifles which he holds in his hands
He aims, is about to fire, but then Margo comes up behind him
No
Don't kill him
Pendergast, you were right
It's John
What
That thing is John Whittlesley should have seen it before
The fibers are infected with a virus
You eat them, and the virus alters your
He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states
He probably entered the country as a man
It would have taken several months for the change to take place
That's how he got from the boat to the museum
Pendergast looks over and sees the monster
His eyes show disbelief
Mbwun looks back at both of them briefly, then it disappears up the stairs
don't believe it
You have to
Listen
All viruses pass on their own
Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses
This one was different
It inserted a whole array of genes into John
Reptile genes, sixty five million years old
Those genes remade him
It's not his fault
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it
Margo tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off
- helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the roof
Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a sling
Waters approaches, holding the walkie talkie
We can't raise the
team
No one's answering
What do you want to do
Ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them
Holy shit
Pull him up
Lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons all around as
The men on the roof stare down astonished
Their mouths hang open at the sight
Get more guns
Now
The men get the drunk up and abandon the sling, leaving Jonathan trapped below
- Jonathan and Hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide
Mbwun sees Jonathan, lifts both claws,  at the skeleton, sending it crashing down
Jonathan , Hobbes is caught and falls
He scrambles into a corner, whimpering, as Pendergast and Margo appear in the door
Fifteen more
team members with rifles now line the hole in the roof
They all point their guns at Mbwun
Get back
We're going to shoot
Now Margo runs forward
No
Wait
Let me talk to him first
(screaming) Kill that thing
Kill it now
No
turns and sees Margo
She speaks desperately
John
you can give up now
Just lie down where you are
Mbwun seems to consider for a moment, but then its eyes gleam and it With renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to like a ,
Some of the
team fall back in terror
Now that the monster is on the wall it's out of range of their fire
Holy shit it's coming this way
It's headed for the roof
Run
Ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror
Astonished, Waters tries to regain control
Get back here, you asshole
We can't let it get out
(to the
team) Surround the opening and kill it
But the men are terrified, retreating like Ippolito
Waters shouts
Back, everybody
That's an order
But the team is in chaos and losing precious time
- The  is now half way up the wall
Margo is distraught, crying
Her cool demeanor is cracked
Pendergast is with her
She shakes her head
Just like John
He won't listen
have to shoot
Do it, quickly
Please
Aim for the eye
Pendergast raises a    with a laser sight
He aims the red laser beam directly at Mbwun's left eye
He has to look here or  won't get a clear shot
Call him, Margo
can't
You have to
Do it now
Margo takes a moment, her eyes streaming
She has no choice, she calls out
John
John, look at me
The beast looks down, sees Pendergast's rifle
There's a long, awful, moment
Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail
staring, stunned
steady
She's crying as she raises her arm as if to say good-bye
And the gun
its head shoots back in pain, and it falls
sixty feet straight down to the ground
Silence
Thunder rolls
It's over
Pendergast turns to Margo and quietly folds her in his arms
: - There are cops and journalists, ambulances, and medivacs all over the place
Greg Kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from Columbus Ave
Behind him the Mayor and 'Agosta help the rest of the company to the ambulances
Waters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue efforts as Kawakita runs up to Pendergast
Margo Green
Have you seen her
She's over here
Greg turns to see Margo come out of the Rotunda with Frock, Jonathan and Hobbes
Her face is devastated
He moves to her side
She reacts as she sees him, and teacher and pupil hug
' is lost in the swirl of people
And he likes it like that
He rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet match
He's struggling hopelessly
Finally he tosses the useless pack of matches, sighs
But then a flame lowers right before his face
He looks up to see Pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter
'Agosta smiles, takes a nice long hit
Nice to see you, Lieutenant
' The sub-basement, huh
Great idea
We go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back
: -  -  : Christmas decorations are up
light snow is falling
There is a very long line
-   - All the registers are doing a booming business
People are buying Mbwun posters, t-shirts and hats
- School tours, old ladies, parents and children, foreign tourists with cameras snake through the displays
In the room with the Relic, there's a tremendous crowd
'  - Margo closes her computer, looks out a window at the falling snow
She turns and walks into the back office
Kawakita is working there alone
His fly-fishing rod stands in the corner, untouched
Margo goes to it, smiles softly
No time for fishing anymore
Greg looks up from his work and smiles
Got to finish this thesis sometime
How about lunch
Not today
Besides,  think the director of the museum is expecting you
Okay
Margo exits
Greg returns to his work
-  - Margo heads down the hall to the Director's office
She walks through the new double oak doors to find
seated at Cuthbert's old desk
Dr
Frock
Look who's here, Margo
and ' rise out of two high-backed chairs
Margo smiles for the first time, takes Pendergast's hands
'm so glad to see you
What's the occasion
'm in town on a case
Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display
- Margo, Pendergast, and 'Agosta follow Frock past the familiar dioramas
Dr
Frock,  was wondering
What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta
' Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed
The virus itself might have positive applications
They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made
(beat) Greg isn't joining us
He's changed
He's always working on his thesis
He comes in early, stays late
tried to get him to join us, but he never takes a break
They pause on a
It's huge, filling one entire end of the hall
In the center is a life-sized representation of  standing on the tepui amid the plants
Behind is a painting of John Whittlesley as he once was
He wears the necklace with the two arrows, of silver and gold
As Margo looks, she touches her own
Pendergast turns to her, sympathy in his eyes
We did the right thing, Margo
Margo smiles warmly
Yes
know
'  - Greg Kawakita wears gloves, high powered glasses, works in solitude in the lab
Suddenly he stands up, throws off the glasses, then he sits down again
He seems to be struggling with himself
He glances over his shoulder to make sure he's alone
Quickly he moves to a locked drawer
He opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small envelope, looks inside
the envelope is full of the
Greg has managed to keep his own cache
Moving quickly, with jerky motions, he lays one fiber down on a slide with a shaking hand
With an exacto knife, he cuts off a tiny sliver, pops it into his mouth
He closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the taste
Then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver, leaves it on the slide
He takes a deep breath, returns the envelope to the drawer
He turns the key carefully and we
On the back is
