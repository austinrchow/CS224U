/ large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer, makes its way along a stretch of motorway
2
/ At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger
His eyes closed, head drooped
Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose
It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep
He pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his MP3
3 Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, Chris' head peaking above a back seat
We hear the music from his MP3 begin to play
It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day", a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye
The track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white text
4 We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to house the east end after the Second World War
: We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through those morning streets
He blows on his hands to warm them up
Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a fence, making a short cut
5
/ Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset, pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water, holding his nose
:  ,    , ,

Chris stares out of the window
The music still playing on his MP3
The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just catching a glimpse of the sign:
7
' Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of cocaine onto a clean glass table
8
'  / Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white dressing gown, prepares breakfast
9 Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping over a fence at the end
10
'  / Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits
11
'  / In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work
He climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation
12 Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land Shifty just walked across
13   ' Glen splits the cocaine into two piles
14
'  / Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor
His mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him
3
15
'  / Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water
16 The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his shoulder
He turns and walks off
17   '  / Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his face, he seems a little more with it
18
' Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one half of the cocaine
He mixes it carefully
19
'  / Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house
20 Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his shoulder
He looks around at the old place
Soaking it in
21
' Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes it with citric acid
He sucks it up into a syringe
22
' Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house
23
'   / Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad facial burns on the side of her face
He injects the cocaine mix into her arm
She lays back on the bed, taking on the rush
4
24 Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of paper with a scribbled address
He finds the right house
He stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3
Our soulful soundtrack comes to an end
He pulls down his head phones, walks to the door and knocks gently
25
'  / Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters
He hears the knock and walks to open it
He takes off his jacket, puts it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris
Fucking hell, man
Shifty can't help but smile
(') You're early
Shifty
smile creeps across Chris' face
Yes, rude boy
You alright geezer
'm sweet
come in, man, come in
Shifty and Chris embrace
Good to see you, mate
Good to see you too, geezer
26
'  / :
Chris stands splashing his face from the sink
His bag perched on the cistern
He looks at himself in the mirror

27
'  / ' Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom
He puts down his bag and pulls on a fresh tee shirt
He looks around at the room
New player,  on the wall, a new game console, 's, 's, lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side, books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked pile of mobile phone bills with the word "" scribed across them
picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of Allah
He approaches the window and looks out at the morning sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town
He stands, staring
28
'  / Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast ready
Shifty turns to face him
You alright son
Yeah  just needed to splash my face, freshen up a bit
Have you slept
Did  fuck
Mate, neither have
just got back from some girls yard
You got a bird
No, no
just some fucking booty call
What, Break Glass Arse
In case of emergency's, man
you know it
They both laugh
Shifty lays sausages into a pan
She fit
What
6
She fit
Yeah, she's alright you know
She's got fucking massive Gary's
Chris laughs
You always loved your titties, bruv
You know that
Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan
(') Mate, do you mind halal
No, no, that's sweet mate, whatever
Were you on just one bus
Yeah
no sorry, two
had to change at Luton
Yeah, man
Fucking random
Shifty covers the sausages with a lid
We hear someone moving about upstairs
Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer, opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large bag of sweet corn
(') 've got a few things to do today geezer, you can stay here if you want, just chill out
He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack
He places them in the pockets of his hooded top
Chris watches Shifty closely, but doesn't say anything
7
(') Or you can come with me
Whatever
(') (whispers) Does your brother know you keep those there
Shifty shakes his head
(') (Whispering) You not worried
Mate, he doesn't eat vegetables
Shifty walks past Chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm
' ,
(
) (') Apart from in a pot noodle
29
'  /  / We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth Vader into passing stools
Katie a three year old baby girl eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst talking on the phone
(on phone) she's living like a drifter babe, 'm telling you, she's split
sort of
with Stefan
know she did
but she stays at Mike's in the week, and then she's back at Stefan's at the weekend
with the kids (to baby) Katie, darling, stop banging your bowl
Trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out for him
His stomach churns
Cold sweat smothers his brow
8
(') (on phone) Neither knows about the other, and then she expects me (she drops to a whisper) to fucking cover for her (normal volume) Stefan's my mate for Christ's sake, 'm not getting caught up in that whole mess (to boy) Freddie, sit down and finish your breakfast
This is too much for Trevor
He turns and walks away from the table
(') (on phone) and she has a go at me for taking on too much (she laughs - then without looking up) Babe, 'm cooking you some eggs
- the front door crashes shut - he's gone - his breakfast untouched
(') Oh
what
nothing, Trevor's just walked out without touching his breakfast
don't know,  thought so anyway
30 Silence
Trevor soaks it in - deep breaths - panic subsiding
He approaches his work van
"
- ' " inscribed on the side
He gets in - suddenly his mobile rings - he answers
What's the matter
Off screen Katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray
Nothing, 'm fine
Why didn't you say good-bye
You were gassing away to Nicola
And why didn't you touch your breakfast
9
'm not hungry
Off Screen Freddie yells
What's the matter with you
'm fine
She runs the tap, water gushes on to the discarded eggs
Where's the grey suitcase
What
can't hear you babe
want to start getting stuff ready for next week - where's the grey suitcase
'll find it when  get home
It's all right babe 'll get it
Jasmine, 'll get it when  get home
Babe it's fine, 'll get it down
(Stern) ' He breathes in hard, takes a moment to calm down and then starts the engine
31
'  / Jasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor's temperament, and watches through the front room window as he drives away
10
32
'  / Shifty's laying out the breakfast
At that moment, Rez, Shifty's brother, walks in
Mid 30's, portly
He sees Chris
( - ) Motherfucker, the return of the white man
Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and grabs a glass of orange juice from the side
How you doing Rez, good to see you, man
wondered why  could hear voices
thought he'd brought home a rent boy again
Shut up you prick
(To Chris) You look like a rent boy
What are you talking about
Points at Chris
That top cost more than my education
My pants cost more than your education
(sings) Cold blooded
Shifty lays down three plates of breakfast
Rez fakes a heart attack
() Soak it in fat boy
take it this doesn't happen often
11
You know what, 'm emotional, where's my camera, bring me my camera
Quick, man, quick
Yeah, fucking laugh it up
() Don't worry  will
Shifty sits down and they begin their food
33
' Trevor sits at the wheel, parked in a residential street
He dials a number on his mobile but gets the following message (
) This number is currently unavailable please try agai
He puts down the phone, and sits there, waiting, agitated
34
'  /
All three of them eat in silence
Chris' eyes dart occasionally to Rez who pays no attention to anything but the food
There is an uncomfortable air in the room
35
' Trevor does a line of cocaine of the tip of his car key
We see that he doesn't have a huge amount left in his wrap
36
' / Shifty's putting away breakfast, Chris and Rez sit at the table
Rez stabs away with a tooth pick measuring up Chris, who reads a magazine
(to Chris) Do you think 've put on weight
Chris looks up
What
Do you think 've put on weight
12
dunno
Not really
He's lying
(to Shifty) told you  haven't put on that much weight
Shifty lets out a sarcastic laugh
(') How long since you've been back
Shifty sits back down and answers for Chris
Four years
Is that the last time  saw you, fucking hell
Yeah
Was it
Yeah, four years ago think
Where you living
Manchester
What you doing
What, work wise
'm in recruitment
Good money
Chris abandons his magazine
do alright, yeah
How much
13
(laughs) Enough
You need to get this Gadha (donkey) some work, four -levels and no job
pay you fucking rent don't
Silence
Girlfriend
No, not yet
Gay
No

'm asking the questions padre
for your information
no, 'm not
but Shifty is
Jokes
(') (to Chris) What have you got, rent or mortgage
Fucking hell, tag team
Mortgage
That's nice
Yeah, mature, man
Why do you leave without saying goodbye to my brother
Chris is stumped
Shifty looks down at the floor
14
Rez, man
'm only joking
(') But really, why
Leave him alone
need info, man
'm like a sponge, do you know what  mean, 'm like a flannel
How come your back, what's the deal
invited him to a party
Who's party
Rachel's
Rachel who
Rachel Price
Who
Mate, Rachel and Serena
Rez pauses, thinking
Chris clocks him with an almost icy stare
Oh right
Chris looks back down at his magazine
Rez knows he hit a raw nerve
An uncomfortable silence
Shifty tries to break the ice by talking about a more trivial topic
(to Rez) You remember Rachel, you fucking lunged her at Jazzbo Browns
15
that's
Yeah, yeah, you went in for the kill and she lent away like she was doing the fucking limbo
Chris is back in the conversation
Her ponytail swept the floor
Shifty and Chris touch fists
You boys need to get your facts straight
she fucking lunged me
You couldn't even remember who she was five minutes ago
Shifty and Chris crack up laughing
(to Chris) wouldn't mind if he did it discreetly, but he lunged her from about three feet
Shifty mimics Rez's historic lunge, Rez starts to laugh at the memory of it, covering his face with his hands
37
' Trevor tries the mobile again but gets the same message
He throws his phone onto the passenger seat and exits the car
38
'  /
They still sit around the table
(to Rez) You can come along if you want
(sarcastically) Yeah,  feel like it now, don't fucking hell
Suddenly the door bell goes
16
(') (to Shifty) Get that, it's probably your viagra delivery
Fuck off
39
'  / Shifty opens the door
(suspicious) Trevor
Alright mate
Shifty steps out and pulls the door to behind him
40
'  / Rez stares at Chris who's still reading a magazine
So come on, why are you back
really
Chris looks up at him
He's not ready for this question
Because of the, erm, because of the party
There's been hundreds of parties mate, what's so special about this one
dunno,  just wanted to see Shifty didn't
Rez just stares at him
Chris looks back at the magazine, trying to pretend he's reading
41
' was trying to bell you geezer, your phones off
17
Yeah  know, mate
(') Trevor, what do you want
Trevor doesn't say anything, just nods his head, as if Shifty should know what he's talking about
Shifty closes his eyes taking stock
(') Mate, you haven't
you haven't paid me for last week yet
Trevor looks a little uncomfortable
Do me a favour, 've probably put your fucking kids through college, do you know what  mean
Mate, keep your voice down
Shifty considers
(') Meet me at the top of the road by the telephone box
Mate you're a fucking diamond
42
'  / Still watching Chris, Rez speaks
For some reason
dunno why
he still thinks of you as his best mate
He get's up to leave
(') Why don't you try acting like one
'
'    '
18
43   /
'  / Trevor goes to walk away
Trevor
Yes mate
Don't ever fucking come to my house again
Yeah, no worries, 'm sorry, man
Shifty walks in, shutting the door
Rez walks past him to go upstairs
Who was that
Nothing, geezer wanted to talk to me about a job
What job
Labouring
Rez ascends the stairs
What did you say
'd think about it
Shifty goes to walk off
44
'  /
Rez, reaching the top of the stairs, calls down
Shafiq

) What
Don't forget

(
) What
Mum and dads

' Trevor, sits in his van, by the telephone box waiting
20
49
'  / Shifty and Chris stand in the hallway putting on their jackets
They go to leave when Shifty stops and considers something
Actually, let's go out the back way, it'll be quicker
They head for the garden
50
' Trevor sits
Waiting
He taps his finger on the steering wheel
Agitated
Every second an eternity
51 Shifty and Chris walk for a moment in silence
We gonna see your mum and dad later
No
just heard
erm
wasn't being nosey,  just heard Rez
Chris doesn't want to push the subject any further
There's silence as they walk
Do you know they've ignored me for about a year
didn't know
my mum puts the phone down when she hears my voice
(') My dad crosses the road if he sees me in the street, then they fucking summon me for a fucking job interview
Silence, the two carry on walking
21
For what
They just want me to meet some up- his-arse-paki who'll look at me like some lost fucking cause
You gonna go
Am  fuck

Rez turns around and stares at Trevor

( 2) Freddie is on his games console
He's at the controls of a racing game
It's on really loud
: Holding up the pregnancy test Jasmine see's it turn to a plus sign
She's pregnant again
: Tight on the screen as Freddie's computerised car screeches around a corner
: Jasmine stares forward, her face fretful
: Freddie's car smashes loudly against a barrier
: 22
Sitting, staring, suddenly Jasmine notices something on the tiled surface
She rubs her finger over it to reveal the residue of a white powder
: The game is loud
Echoing through the house
: She dabs finger with tongue, her face sours
She was almost hoping she was wrong
: Freddie laughs as his car smashes into another opponent
: Jasmine's eyes are alive with rage; the  bellows out - suddenly she stands, pulls up her kickers and steams towards Freddie's room
(screaming) Freddie little face is totally bewildered
55 Shifty and Chris approach a clapped out, red four-door Golf circa 1986
As they loom closer Glen exits the car from the back
What you saying you fucking rag- head, you alright bad boy
Dowdy
You been on the roids mate you're looking bigger
Shifty's almost exasperated with Glen already
No,  haven't, no
You getting ready for a fucking uprising
23
Yeah, just a small one
Shifty and Glen knock fists
We better be careful, seems like there's a Tally-barn in town
Give it a fucking rest geezer
You know 'm only fucking about you prick
Glen looks over at Chris
He takes him in
(') How you doing mate, you alright
(warily) Alright
Glen grabs Shifty and pulls him to one side
His face is close to Shifty's ear, his insipid breath hot
Who the fuck is that
Chill out, he's an old mate of mine
Don't just bring any fucking Muppet to the party, at least let me know first, do you know what  mean, give me a fucking heads up
(calm) Yeah
(') (collected) Alright mate
24
Anyway, 've got, erm, 've got a message for you
What
Magnus wants you to call him tonight
What
Magnus never wants me to call him
Glen shrugs
dunno, mate
Shifty watches Glen
Where's the gear
Lenny's got it
As Shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of money to Glen
Seated in the driver's seat sits Lenny, a frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning
His denim jacket giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking corpse
Seated next to him is Loretta
She's pulling out a crack pipe itching to take a hit
Shifty leans through the window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny, slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into his lap
Alright Lenny
Alright mate
You alright Loretta
Alright Shifty
25
56
'  / Rez lays down a prayer mat
He kneels down and begins to pray
57 Glen stands smoking, staring at Chris
Suddenly Glen speaks

Chris can feel Glen's eyes on him
dunno

Chris stays silent
(') 'you used to knock out pills
(dismissive) Yeah, now and again
Glen carries on staring at him
Yeah, yeah,  know where  fucking know you from
you used to go out with Serena Ellis
Yeah, a few years ago
You'd fucking hope so, she's dead you cunt
Glen laughs at his own joke
Chris looks furious
Shifty walks back over
Come
Right you done
(Shifty nods) Good
() 26
(') (he takes a final drag on his fag) Don't go blowing up any fucking tube trains
Glen walks back to the car
Chris throws Shifty a look and storms off, Shifty follows after him
58
' Viewing the action from the dashboard we see Glen enter the rear door
Loretta, puffing away on a crack pipe, passes it to Lenny
What are we waiting for
Give me a fucking break 'm rushing my tits off
Lenny attempts to start the car
(') Where's the keys babe
Let's just go Lenny
'm freaking out
Lenny, having found the keys, starts the car simultaneously tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers
They drive off, frog-hopping the  down the road
Yeah, it's a good job we're not making a fucking scene
59 Chris and Shifty turn a corner into a row of garages
Chris stands there for a moment his fists clenched
Mate, are you alright
Yeah, 'm fine
What's the matter, what did he say
27
Geezer don't worry about, just
don't worry about it, it's cool, 'm alright
60   / Trevor makes his way across muddy terrain to a porta-cabin and let's himself in
We follow him into see Bob Moran, portly, sitting at a desk, another gentleman, in a suit and hard-hat stands before the desk
Bob spots Trevor
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Bob
Bob comes around from his side of the desk
No, Trevor, no
Bob just hear me out
Get out of my office
Bob please 've paid out on all the materials, 've lost money
You should have thought about that before you started bringing drugs onto my site
You owe me money
owe you fuck all

Trevor stands behind them
(') Bob
Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand
Thank's for coming today Trevor, we'll definitely be in touch
Bob's hand hangs there
Trevor looks at him, to the hand
Bob turns away and carries on talking
Trevor stands for a moment then turns and walks away
Trevor's face is awash with emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it together
61 Shifty and Chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a skate park - The camera observing them from behind
Shifty hands Chris a rolled spliff
Shifty doesn't say anything, doesn't want to push Chris
Was that Loretta Martin in that motor
Yeah
used to fancy her big time when we were kids
Yeah,  remember

He pulls out the powder tray but it comes out completely from the machine
He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go
Rez gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail
He looks in the gap, and sees something
30
He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around
He has something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through, watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack
Rez sits back against the machine just staring at it
64 Shifty and Chris just sit
Suddenly Chris notices something
What's that
What
Chris points
That fucking thing
65 Shifty and Chris approach an extreme sports park ride that helps build upper strength
At either end of a raised beam are two handles
What does it fucking do
Chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it
(') Mate, grab the other end
Shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground
(') They're both cracking up laughing, loving it
66
'  /  / On Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods
The sounds of scrubbing and movement echo out
Jasmine, her dressing gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the emptied bathroom like a woman possessed

At 5'5" with long arms book-ended by bony hands and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by
Sleeping cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards
Valerie looks towards Chris
Valerie, this is Chris, he's erm, he's an old friend of mine, we grew up together
He's cool
We go way back
So it's cool, you know
How you doing
He offers a hand that she takes politely
Yeah
Hi
moment of uncomfortable silence
called yesterday but you were out
When

You must have been asleep

He picks up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world
He looks slightly shocked to see this
: Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room
He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair
He moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen
It dawns on Chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed
34
Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall
It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle

Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before Val
Chris watches with intent
He almost can't believe what he's seeing
She opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump
Then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil
At that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass
Valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side
She sits back down, clearly distressed by the music
35
We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips
She gestures with her hand offering Chris some
No, no, 'm fine
thanks though
Look Val we're gonna have to do one
-    - Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave
The thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat
Chris looks slightly unsettled by what he's seen
73                                                                    * ' Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him
They go to walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks
He pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried on walking
Geezer, give me a minute
Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his jacket
Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to unhook the latch
The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n' bass booming out
73A                                                                   * '  / Shifty enters
The  follows
We're introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and 's litter the floor
Shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway - a mattress with no sheets
Shifty carries on down the hallway
Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room
On the  a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down
wiry looking 18 year old, Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images
chavvy-looking bird sits to his left
Shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off
The young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed
Shifty stares him out
36
Alright mate
Alright
Shifty looks about at the room
What's your name
Otis
Where do you get your weed from
It aint
it aint mine, my erm, my mate left it, he left it here could phone him if you want, he'll sort you out
Where d'you get your fucking weed from rude boy
get it from this geezer
Glen Dowdy innit
Shifty smiles
No, you don't
74
'    / Chris stands waiting, he looks uncomfortable
75
'  / No his names Glen, 'm sure it is man, his names Glen innit
' Yeah,  think so
37
From now on you get your weed from me
(') At half the price
Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly confused
76
' Chris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16, pregnant, and with another baby in a pram
He looks saddened by the girl
He turns and walks into the flat
77
'  / 'm gonna sell you your weed half price, and your gonna keep this noise down
(') Yeah
(') (with threat) At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris standing in the doorway
His presence adds menace to the situation
Yeah, alright, yeah
Because if  hear one word of complaint from next door, just one single complaint, 'll come back here and 'll take your , 'll take your stereo, and 'll shove em up your birds arse
He lets the words sink in
The girl looks a little shocked
(') Do you understand me
38
Otis nods
(') Yeah, yeah, it's cool, 'm sorry, man,  didn't know  had it on loud,  would have turned it down, 'm sorry
Silence
Shifty stares Otis out
Otis looks away
Shifty picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis' wall
Call me if you need any more weed
He walks into the hallway, past Chris
(almost disdain) You don't miss a fucking trick
You know it
78
'    / Shifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of the tenement block, Shifty's phone vibrates
:      :
Shifty hits the reject button
Chris follows behind
That was all a bit fucking surreal
What d'you mean
can't believe you just sold crack to Miss Marple and struck a deal with Blazing Squad
Shifty laughs as they carry on descending
(') How old is she
39
About 70
(') She's been doing drugs longer than we've been alive
Yeah, d'you reckon
(') When did you start knocking out
Knocking out what
(lowers his voice) Crack

When do you think

No
(') Have you
Fuck that

40
Do you wanna try it
Chris looks at him, unsure if he's joking
Only if  get a fucking discount

They both laugh

Did you tell Rachel
What
About me
No,  didn't
(') thought it'd be a surprise
Chris looks a little uncomfortable
(') Mate, it's gonna be fine
Who else is gonna be there
dunno, lot of her new mates, don't know many of them
So what's the plan, are you gonna go and see your mum and dad first
Shifty looks at him
No
You should go man, see what they've got to say
thought you worked in recruitment
43
What
When do you become a fucking family liaison
What are you talking about you nutter,  was just saying
'll be stuck in some fucking warehouse

It might not be, mate, it might be some sweet little earner
in the city somewhere, do you know what mean
've got a sweet little earner
Yeah, but you won't be sweating bullets everytime the door bell goes
(') You're not knocking out weed anymore, man
This aint college
you're in deep bruv
that shit'll put you down for life
Only if you get caught, mate
Suddenly from around the corner we see someone come sprinting past
(') Malik
Malik, small, Turkish, stops dead in his tracks and spins round, he carries a large black holdall
44
(  ) Fucking hell Shifty
you alright bruv
didn't even notice you
What's going on
Long story, geezer (Looks at Chris) you alright mate
How you doing
Malik, this is an old mate of mine, Chris
Someone's gotta be
Chris laughs
Where are you going, man why you running
Fucking hell, do you remember  was telling you about Craig
No
Yeah you fucking do, Craig Whittle, the guy who's seeing Desmond Dodge's sister
What, Craig, small Craig
Yeah, yeah
'you remember  told you he had that job at the pinnacles, the, erm, storage warehouse
Yeah, go on
He doesn't
45
Anyway, Craig tells me every Friday, on the fucking dot, a delivery gets made, all this top fucking electrical gear
Shifty offers him a cigarette
(') Cheers mate
yeah every Friday [lights his fag] they make this fucking drop off, but because the lorry can't reverse into the courtyard, something to do with the angle of the gates or something, dunno mate, you'll have to ask Craig, they fucking, cos they can't get in, they leave all these crates sitting on the fucking road
What
are you on your way there now
What
no, no, no,  drummed the place ten minutes ago blood
This fucking
forklift went inside yeah, with this first load, so , fucking,  nipped in, started whacking in the gear, only turns out they've got another forklift
Hold up, hold up
Why are you running
Cunt caught me right in the middle a loading up
:   '
(
) (') Are you sure you don't want anything, 'll do you a proper deal, sort you right out
At that precise moment a plain clothes police car comes heading toward them
The siren blares out
Chris and Shifty, caught between a rock and a hard place, turn and sprint
84 Chris runs, suddenly Shifty overtakes
Chris is fast but Shifty's like a whippet
46
Follow me
Shifty swerves down a side lane, Chris follows
85 Malik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in a shitty garden pond
Fuck
86 Shifty and Chris sprint, the police close behind
This is bollocks
Shifty vaults a brick wall, Chris follows
The drop on the other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor hard
Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention
87 Shifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen
Shifty's knees are near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag whipping off the back
It's not perfect but it's better than running
Shifty starts cracking up laughing
Chris' face looks a little more serious, however
He doesn't find this all quite as funny as Shifty
88                                                                   * Shifty sits in an underpass
Random graffiti tarnishes the walls behind them, their bikes lent against the wall
Chris is stood up, leaning on his knees, breathing hard
Mate, 'm telling you, this is no way to live
Chris sits down next to Shifty
47
(') 'm serious, mate, you need to get away from this shit, come and live with me for a bit
Shifty looks at Chris, and reaches into his pocket pulling out a pack of fags
(') 'm serious, mate
Why not
Shifty doesn't say anything
(') You'd love Manchester, man, it's full of fitness
Shifty stays quiet, and smokes
They sit their for a moment

He stands there for moment, thinking
He walks over to Loretta and pulls back the sheets
He leans over and starts kissing her all over, she tries to ignore him, but he's licking her ear, grinding his crotch into her arse
Glen, 'm not in the mood
He doesn't listen, and pulls down her knickers

Shifty recognises the guy
(under his breath) Oh shit
Trevor, appearing from the gloom, walks directly towards Shifty
Where you been geezer, 've been trying to get hold of you

Empty your pockets Mate what are you doing
Just leave it, Chris
Trevor, think about what you're doing, man
Trevor edges the knife harder into Shifty's neck

Trevor's eyes are bulging, face crimson with rage, his knife nestling at the tip of Shifty's Adams apple
Empty your fucking other pockets

Shifty's dad walks in and holds her tight, Rez holds back, not knowing what to do
119 Five heavy looking bastards walk out of a house and towards a serious looking black range rover
One of them opens the boot and they throw in baseball bats, a crowbar, masking tape
120 Chris sits on a wall the other side of the road, a carrier bag full of beer
He sits, drinking, just staring at the house, the music pumping from within
He watches as people arrive
He looks about
He's anxious, upset, he doesn't want to do this on his own
121
' Trevor unlocks the door and walks into the house, his nose swollen, face sullen, guilty
We follow as he walks toward the front room where we see suit cases placed over the floor as Jasmine busies herself packing
She doesn't look at Trevor, she's too angry with him
What are you doing babe
What does it look like
We've got another three days yet
64
've got two kids to pack for
Silence
(') three including you
Where are they
Where do you think they are, they're in bed
What's wrong with you
Nothing
Jasmine walks past him, still not looking him, and into the kitchen where she takes wet washing from the machine
Babe, what's the matter
She walks back past him to the front room
When did you start using again
What
When did you start using cocaine again
What are you talking about
'm not going through this again Trevor, don't fucking lie to me
What are you going on about
Is that why the card failed
What

' Babe people walk into scaffolding all the time
No Trevor only you walk into scaffolding

'm not off my tits babe
What did  say to you Trevor, said as god is my witness, 'll walk out of that door with my kids and never look back
Jasmine
What did  say
Babe
What did  fucking say
Trevor drops his head
66
(') You promised me you'd stopped, You swore on your baby daughter's life that you were clean, Trevor
You swore on our nine-month old baby daughter's life that you wouldn't touch that
that shit anymore
Trevors starts crying
(') No, don't you cry, don't you dare fucking cry, because to me that's even more repulsive
want you to be a man for Christ's sake
want you to be a fucking man about this, Trevor, for once in your life take control of the  situation
She's at him, screaming, hitting
He just stands there limp, absorbing her blows
(') '  , Jasmine walks away from him
Trevor's just left there, pathetic, alone

They stare at each other for a moment
Rez, 'm sorry, man
Where the fuck have you been
why didn't you phone mum and dad
Rez walks into the kitchen
67
ran out of juice
Why didn't you use a pay phone
Shifty doesn't answer
Rez looks at the open tray on the washing machine
Shifty look him in the eye

Where is it
Where the fuck is it
You bring drugs into my fucking house
the house that  pray in
He pushes Shifty hard in the chest
Rez, Rez, man
looked after you Shifty,  took you under my roof, let you live in my house, and this, this is how you repay me
Rez pushes Shifty again hard
Shifty grabs Rez but Rez punches him around the face, they fall to the floor in a messy clinch, Rez pulling at shifty's face, hitting him
Rez, Rez, Rez
Shifty   manages to wrangle himself free
Rez is up and at him
Get out of my fucking house, get out
Rez, Rez,  need that bag
Get out
Rez, if you don't give it to me 'm a dead man
Rez storms off upstairs
Shifty stands just rubbing his face with his hands muttering under his breath

He can hear Rez rustling about upstairs
Shifty starts ascending the stairs

Get the  out

Rez is pushing Shifty again
Shifty backs away down the steps

One of them rotates a knife in his hand

He stands there for a moment breathing hard, thinking, then heads off with conviction

Jasmine walks outside
What's this
Trevor looks up

He walks past her back into the house and kisses her cheek she flinches slightly, She stands there for a second soaking it in
129 Chris sits on the wall, he downs his beer, straightens himself up, and walks towards the house

They stand there for a moment
Neither one saying anything
You alright
Yeah, 'm alright
You alright
Chris looks down

Chris nods
(') 've got too much shit to deal with
70
(') You don't have to come with me
It's up to you
Yeah, cool, 'll probably just grab my stuff from yours then
Shifty nods with acceptance, but Chris smiles
(') As if 'm not gonna come with you nutter
Shifty shakes is head
Fucking hell, man

thought you were used to it
There's only so much one man can take
They walk off
Chris throws Shifty a light punch
(') Now you start throwing punches
130
' / Quietly Trevor sniffs up a corner of coke
He carefully opens the door to make sure Jasmine's not nearby
He exits and we follow him into the front room where Jasmine sits with the Camcorder
She aims it at Trevor and presses record
Jasmine peers into the Lens

The door is shabby, black bin liners decorate the floor
Shifty knocks
They stand for a moment when suddenly the door creaks open to reveal Loretta peaking through
Loretta, is Glen there
She watches them for a moment then shuts the door
Shifty looks at Chris
They stand for a moment when Glen opens the door
71
Shifty
Alright mate
What
need to talk to you about something
Glen just looks at him
(') Can we do it inside
Glen opens the door
They both walk into the flat
Glen stops shifty and points for him to go into the bedroom

Alright
Chris perches himself on the edge of a dusty old armchair
He looks at Loretta
You alright Loretta
She smiles at him
You alright Chris
He smiles nervously

What Losing all his gear
Who told you that
Magnus did
And what did he say
That you've lost all his gear

Shifty pauses thinking
Yeah well he went mental, saying some other shit about me cutting it up, mixing the coke, he was saying all sorts of
bullshit
Glen stays quiet
Shifty waits for a reaction
(') Why would he be saying that
who's been talking to him
Dunno mate, you're guess is as good as mine
Shifty pulls out his phone
Perhaps you should phone him up now, here, in front of me, tell him it's all bollocks
Glen just looks at Shifty
You can tell him yourself
73
Shifty holds the phone to Glen's face
Go on mate, call him up, tell him that  don't cut up the coke
Glen knocks down Shifty's arm
don't know what the fuck you do Shifty

And then you come to my house and you threaten me
Shifty stays quiet

telling me how you're gonna take him down

Chris looks totally uneasy, the situation is making him uncomfortable

Who told you that

You're just jealous cos you didn't think of it first
You're not that fucking smart

There's a knock at the door
Shifty hesitates, then answers it
Mate, can we go
Don't worry about it, 'm fucking leaving
Shifty goes to walk out with Chris
Glen follows them into the corridor
It's about time you both fucked off
Fuck off Glen
After what happened
Shifty and Chris carry on walking out
75
(') No wonder you left mate

Couldn't show your face after what you did
What did  do exactly
Get the fuck out of my house
What the fuck did  do
Mate, just leave it the geezers a wanker
Don't start shouting mate
Or what

Suddenly, with out hesitation Chris grabs Glen by his tee shirt and slams his forehead into Glens nose
It breaks in a clean crack, blood spurting out
Glen doubles over, holding his face
Chris smashes his fist into the back of Glens head, Glen goes down on his knees
Chris is kicking him
Shifty comes in and pulls him away, laying in a few boots himself
Glen stands up

138 Shifty and Chris cross a field, trudging through the ankle length grass
They reach a hedge
Shifty reaches into the bushes and starts rummaging around
He pulls out a black bin liner containing something heavy
He unwraps one bin liner to reveal another which has been tied with elastic
He undoes another black bin liner until finally he's left with just a leather sports bag
139 Through the front windscreen we see a sign indicating a turnoff for Dudlowe New town
The jeep veers, making the exit just in time
140 Chris and Shifty make their way through the town
Shifty's walking fast, dictating the pace
Where are we going
To mine
We should just go, man, get the fuck out of this shithole, leave now, go to Manchester, tonight, 'm telling you
Chris  can't
'm not leaving

We were all pretty fucked Chris
She told me she'd done pills before
Chris if it wasn't you, she would have got it from someone else mate
Yeah but she didn't did she
Shifty leans forward and opens the leather sports bag
He pulls out a
38 six shot revolver and a hand full of bullets
He starts loading the gun
Chris stands up

Shifty gestures for him to be quiet, and points upstairs to his bother

He reaches down and picks up a large jiffy envelope that's been left leaning against the bin cupboard
Scribed across the front is: 157

Trevor's up on his feet
The banging becomes a crash as something gives way
Three heavyset men in balaclava's charge into the front room
Jasmine screams, dropping the camera on its side yet still giving a viewpoint on events
Three men are on Trevor, he's receiving a serious beating
man grabs Jasmine by the hair and drags her to the middle of the room, she attempts to fight back, feisty as ever
This is bedlam
Suddenly someone rushes in from the left and lays a vicious right hook to Trevor's head
He goes down like a lead weight
Jasmine's crying, fear washing over her
child cries out from upstairs
() Tell that fucking slag to stop crying
Two hooded men drag Jasmine off to another room
She's fighting back clawing at them
