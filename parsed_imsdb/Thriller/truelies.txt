----------------------- 1
,  ,  - The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon
fortress-like  is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake
The property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs
2
- The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars
formal- dress party is in progress
a private reception for a middle- eastern dignitary
Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal detectors by white gloved security staffers
The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming a kind of rampart
There is an opening, to a kind of waterway or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the grounds
There is a steel grating across the opening
The bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter
With the house visible , we   below the parapet wall along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking
down along the dark wall to the grating
to see a glow pulsing under the ice
3
,  - Camera moving toward:    in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch
One bar has already been cut out
Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom
Lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall
Seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled-glass of the ice above
4
- dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large boathouse
There is a faint chipping sound
The ice breaks quietly, and the pieces are slid back
head appears, in a rubber drysuit hood
The  slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly, scanning
revealing: Our hero
Harry floats with just his eyes above the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a footpath nearby
After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins, letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock
He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse
Opening a  , he pulls out a walky talky
Honey, 'm home
5
/
,   - Meet Harry's partner,  "" , an overweight twenty- year-man with a lived in looking face
Gib answers Harry via his headset
Roger that
(he covers the mike and turns) Hey, Fize
Get your butt in here
Harry's inside
Outside,  , an Iranian-American, finishes making yellow snow and hurries back to the van
They are parked on a winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose lights are visible through the trees
Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto nightvision scope
The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps the grounds, locating the boathouse
6
- Concealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit
Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders, cummerbund and a formal shirt
He puts a tiny plug, like a hearing aid, deep in his ear canal
-
Very advanced
Switching to sub-vocal
Gib, you copy
() It's Talkradio
You're on the air
Harry slips into his shoulder harness
holster on one side, containing his
45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for the ear-piece slung on the other
He slips on a formal jacket, concealing the rig
Then a final touch
little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial
Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the shadows, crossing quickly to the main house
He looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back
He enters the main house through a back service entrance
7
- Harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place
The kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really notice
He finger-tastes a dish as he passes
(French/ subtitled) This needs more garlic
He breezes through unchallenged, exiting into the-- 8
- Here the party is in full swing
Harry blends smoothly into the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid- east nobility
They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy bankers to playboy arms dealers
Harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a canape from the passing waiters
He nods to someone as if he knows them
Greets another is quite fluent Arabic
People in his wake look at each other like "Do you know him
"   They shrug, go on with their conversation
Harry moves through the crowd
Scanning
There's Daddy Petrobucks
'  - Through the crowd is sees  , the host of the party and owner of the chateau
He is fat and animated, greeting guests with a flourish
As Harry watches he warmly     * greets a beautiful
They become absorbed in a             * conversation
The woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out
There is a frank moment of returned interest
Then the crowd shifts, cutting off their view of each other
9
- Harry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor
* He slips through doors into the private area of the mansion
* 10
- The doors open and Harry slips into the darkened library
He    * crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace
* 11
-                                            * Harry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic       * prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony        * directly above
He lets himself into--                          * 12
'  -                                      * Khaled's office is ornately furnished
Beautiful antiques glint in the moonlight coming in the French-doors
Harry crosses to an immense desk and boots up the computer there
Bathed in the glow from the screen, he pulls a  ,  about the size of a paperback,  from the back of his cummerbund
He connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the computer
Modem in place
Transmitting
now
He pushes a button and a green light comes on
13
- Gib and Faisil watch as their monitor screen lights with from Khaled's private computer
Affirmatory
We are in
* Fast Faisil is a computer ace
His fingers fly on the keyboard as he types rapid key commands
We see familiar "windows appear"
The words are all in Arabic characters
These are encrypted files, guys
This is going to take me a few minutes
14                                                             * 15

Seeing the coast is clear Harry slips out
But just as he is closing the door, a  rounds the corner ten feet away
Harry turns smoothly
He smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard
(In Arabic/ subtitled) Where's the john around here have to take a major leak
The guard points warily down the corridor
Harry nods and heads that way, back toward the party
16
/  - Harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party
He is sipping champagne and looking bored
He sees two security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the stairs, walkies in their hands
He turns away as they pass him and pretends to study a large fragment of bas-relief
a temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses
He senses someone next to him and turns
It is the
She  * is captivatingly beautiful, and her gaze is piercing
(indicating the bas- relief) Magnificent, isn't it
Yes
Hi, 'm Juno Skinner thought  knew most of Khaled's friends but  don't believe know you
Harry offers his hand to her
Renquist
Harry Renquist
17
- Gib whirls to the screen displaying the mission database
He scans rapidly for-- Skinner
Skinner
Come on
Gib finds the entry he's looking for
Juno's picture and data appear on the screen
Juno Skinner
Art and antiquities dealer, specializing in ancient Persia
18
- Harry turns back to the fragment of frieze
This is Persian, if 'm not mistaken
Very good
It's sixth century Do you like the period
(shameless) adore it
19
/  ( ) - Seen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on Harry's footprints leading to the boathouse
He calls to one of the other guards, who comes running over
20
- Harry, still with Juno, hears Gib in his ear: () Harry, we got a problem
Guards are swarming all over the dock
Harry glances up the stairs
Khaled's   is gesturing to several of his men, and speaking quickly into a walky
Three   come down the stairs, scanning the crowd
Harry turns smoothly away from them and takes Juno's arm
Do you dance, Ms
Skinner
He steers her toward the dance floor
21
- Gib, listening, rolls his eyes
He looks through the night- vision scope
Guards are running around outside the chateau
Harry's stirred up the hornet's nest
Faisil is still jamming at the keyboard
Okay, files are unlocked
'm in
'm down, baby
got my hand up her dress and 'm going for the gold
'm-- Just copy the goddamn files
(into his headset) Harry, don't be stopping to smell the roses, now
You hear me, Harry
22
- Harry whirls Juno aggressively across the dancefloor
She responds deftly
They are well matched
She parries each of his smooth moves with a flourish
It is a contest of wills, and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy
Juno is hot
He bends her back at the waist, then snaps her up
She twirls into the crook of his arm
Their faces are inches apart
Wow
The music ends and she gives him a wry grin
Well
And  thought this was going to be just another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires
() Harry, seconds count, buddy
Ditch the bitch, let's go
Unfortunately, Juno,  have a plane to catch
She slips a card out of a pocket in her otherwise sheer dress
She hands it to him, maintaining eye contact
Serious sparks
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces
'd like that
23
- Gib can't believe this conversation
(to Faisil) Son of a bitch is with her two minutes and she's ready to bear his children (to Harry) What's your exit strategy Twinkle Toes
24
/   - Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides confidently through
He goes down the steps to the broad terrace above the motor court
Behind Harry, a  lowers his walky talky and starts after him
May  see your invitation, sir
Without turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast pocket
* Here's my invitation
* He pushes the button and--                                       * The  second floor office windows blow out in a fiery explosion
Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace before the guard can open fire
25
/
- Gib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away
He starts the van
Aw, shit
Here we go-- 26
- Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees
Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing
The snow explodes around him with bullet hits
pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect unison
He waits
and knocks their heads together in mid- leap with a crack like a baseball bat
The dogs drop to the snow, wobbling around like they're drunk
As Harry sprints on,   lunges out of the bushes ahead, leaping directly for his throat
Harry grabs the dog and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride
Dog Fu
The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch, looking down in amazement
27
/   - Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow bank and sliding downhill
He sprints down the gentle slope toward the highway
Harry looks back as     come out of a guard station beside the main entrance
-, searching through the trees with lights
They have lost Harry
They stop
snowbank behind them  as Harry leaps out
He disables them both with vicious street-fighter moves
Harry looks upslope as-- service gate opens in the perimeter wall and in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some on
rises over the wall in a blast of swirling snow
Its xenon lights rake through the trees, casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow
Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one of the disabled guards
He pops the boots quickly into the bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's rifles slung across his back
The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through the forest
Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols zig-zagging among the trees
Harry slashes expertly downhill
He cuts a distinguished figure in his black tux
Automatic weapons fire rips through the trees from behind him
Harry is going flat-out
The xenon light hits him
7
62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the   * slope into white clouds around him
Harry slashes, turns, weaving among the trees at breakneck speed
snowmobile is closing in, outflanking him
He turns toward it, suddenly
Hits a mogul
Uses the air to slash his skis right across the rider's face
The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the night
28
/
-   - '  takes an icy turn in a hairy slide
Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on
All he can see are lights and gunfire
Harry, what's your twenty need a position, buddy-- Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from the slope above,    , and lands deftly downslope
Uh
right
'll catch you on the next bend
Behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road
Only about half can make the jump
The rest crash horribly
The helicopter thunders overhead
29
- Harry sees the chopper start an attack run
He comes out into the open, going straight downhill like a rocket
The chopper gets suckered in
trying to hit him, getting right down behind him
and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle
---
He rakes a burst across the windshield
The startled pilot swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him
-
The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank
It slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering
Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right across Harry's path
Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles, comes out of it
running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots
He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow
Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper, which still has its engine running
The ski patrol opens fire from upslope
Rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter
Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea
He jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it
It slips over the edge
He leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope
30
/
-   - Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail- rotor to steer
The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is skiing the damn thing down the mountain
The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its        * skids
Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around it
Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees
snowmobile hits a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine
() Harry
Where are you
In the helicopter
31
/
-   - Gib slides the van around a curve
(deadpan, to Faisil) He's in the helicopter
Big is scanning above for the chopper
Then upslope he sees the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees
The chopper hits a jump and launches into the air-- It crashes through trees, still soaring and-- Gib looks up, screaming as-- The chopper drops right toward him-- He hits the brakes and-- It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the skidding van
then slides over the edge and tumbles into a rocky canyon where is
The fireball lights up the night
Gib and Faisil jump out of the van
They look downslope at the burning wreckage
Harry
What
Gib and Faisil spin to look behind them
Harry is lodged in tree-branches hanging over the road
Gib hands his -5K        * machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry, who grabs his     * hand and pulls
Harry tumbles down into the snowbank
He stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in his ski-boots
He is completely unruffled
Let's go
We can still make our flight
As Faisil is getting into the van behind Harry, roar around the bend behind them, fish-tailing on the ice
Faisil
One snowmobile swerves over the embankment
The other pulls up broadside, and the guards duck behind it
Gib floors it and the van roars down the mountain
Faisil is still Ramboing on full-auto
This is
never get to shoot
: 32
- An American Airlines 747 touches down amid puffs of tire smoke
33
- -  pulls to the curb in a neighborhood of modest middle-income tract homes
The street is deserted
It is 4
Gib is at the wheel, dropping Harry off at his house
34
- Harry is emptying his pockets
passport, business cards etc
All documents under his name "Renquist"
He double checks that his pants and jacket pockets and empty
Gib fastidiously puts the items into a plastic zip-lock
Empty
Go
Gib starts handing him items from a briefcase
This should all feel like a tired ceremony between them
Harry Tasker wallet
Harry Tasker passport
Plane ticket stub, hotel receipt, Tasker
Two postcards of Lake Geneva
House keys
Souvenir snowing Swiss village
Gib snows him how is snows when you shake it up and turn it over
What's this for
For Dana, schmuck
Bring your kid something
You know
The dad thing
Got it
Nice touch
Okay, pick me up at eight
The de-brief is at ten hundred
Harry opens the car door
Hey, hey, hey
what are we forgetting
Gib holds up Harry's gold wedding band
Harry puts it on
What a team
See you at eight
Yep
Sleep fast
35
- Harry slips inside
He sets down his suitcase and walks quietly down the hall
He pauses at a door with lurid labels and stickers plastered all over it (Toxic Waste,
, '   '  , etc
) Harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping daughter,
She looks like an angel in the moonlight coming in the window
In fact, she is a typical 14 year old girl, and therefore hardly an angel
But to Harry she is unflawed
36
- Harry, undressed now, slips into bed next to
a lump in the covers which we presume to be a human being
This is , Harry's wife of 15 years
He kisses her on the cheek and she stirs
She rolls toward him, giving him a sleepy hug and a kiss
(a drowsy murmur) Hi, honey
How was the flight
Fine, honey
Stay asleep
Okay
As she drifts off, Harry puts his head on the pillow and stares at the ceiling
: 37
-  () It is snowing
,  reaching to the present Harry just gave her
Hey, thanks dad
never had one of these
They are in her room, which is your basic room from Hell
Pearl Jam posters, and an unbelievable clutter of junk, magazines and cheap jewelry
Harry kisses her on the cheek, to which she submits dutifully
He looks at his watch and heads for the door
You better hurry
You're going to be late for school
Harry hurries out and Dana considers the Swiss village a moment
Really lame
She plonks is straight in the wastebasket
38
//  - Harry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but            * incredibly ugly dog, , who skitters past him going the      * other way
Dana, don't forget to feed Gizmo
* Harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past Helen who is clearly rushing to get ready herself
We get our first good look at Helen
She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an outfit
Her hair is wrapped in a towel
To call her plain would be inaccurate
She could be attractive if she put any effort into it, which doesn't occur to her
'm late
Me too
They talk without looking at each other, the way people who have been together a long time do
How'd it go at the trade show
You make all the other salesmen jealous
Yeah
You should have seen it
We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680
how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount
She is already tuning him out
And it hits us: (barely listening) That's fabulous Harry
Yeah, it was wild
Harry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth
He smiles
The best lies are told with enthusiasm
39
,   - Gib opens the door, knocks a bit, then strolls in like he lives there
He is wearing dark Ray Bans, like he's doing a Roy Orbison impression
Gizmo runs toward him, yapping, but Gib gives him the evil eye
Come any closer 'll kill you
The dog backs up, whining plaintively
Gib throws his jacket over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out a pack of  and sets it on the mantelpiece
He adjusts its position carefully
Hmmmm
40
- Harry  and Helen maneuver around each other expertly
She is doing her make-up
The plumber came yesterday
He said they have to dig under the slab or something and it's going to be six hundred dollars to fix
Harry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in front of the mirror
His mind is elsewhere
He couldn't care less about there domestic problems
Uh huh
Okay
It's not okay
It's extortion
What did you tell him
slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks
Good thinking, honey
Harry kisses her on the cheek and exits
41
- Gib enters and pours two cups of coffee
Dana is drinking orange juice from the bottle at the fridge
Hi, kid
Hey, Gib
What up
She , eating an uncooked pop-tart
Harry comes in a second later and Gib hands him his coffee
Thanks dear
Here, check these out
Gib hands Harry the glasses
Harry studies them, seeing the inside the left lens of the Ray Bans
Harry glances down the hall, making sure no-one is looking, then he puts them on
'  -    -  black and white video image of his own living room
The  camera and transmitter and inside a pack of smokes
Slick little unit, huh
we see Dana enter the living room
She looks around carefuly, then quickly lifts Gib's jacket and slips out his wallet
She palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts the wallet back
Pro moves
Son of a bitch
What
Harry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen
Gib goes after him
42
- Dana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and runs to her boyfriend, , who is waiting for her in the driveway on his idling
Trent is 16, dressed in grunge- rock style, trying to look tough
Harry comes out the front door as Trent revs the motor
Dana
She waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch and they shoot down the driveway
(yelling over the engine) Can't stop, 'm late
Bye, Dad
43
/
' /    - They are driving through
Harry is still shocked by his     * daughter's behavior
Kids
Ten seconds of joy
Thirty years of misery
She knows not to steal
've taught her better than that
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen
Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna
The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment
You're outgunned, amigo
Gib and Harry turn onto Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward Lafayette Square
Capital Hill is behind them
44
-                                         * Harry and Gib come out of an elevator on the 12th floor
* Behind the receptionist is a burnished metal sign which reads    * They cross a open floor of cubicle spaces
* There is the hum of activity everywhere

* * Morning, Mr
Tasker
* * Morning, Charlene
See, kids now are ten years ahead                      * of where we were at the same age
You probably think she's still a virgin-- Don't be ridiculous
She's only -- how old is she
Fourteen, Harry
Right
She's only fourteen
They go into a corridor
* Uh huh
And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm
* say even money that physicist on                       * the bike is boinkin' her
* No way
Not Dana
They stop at a door, like any other along the corridor
It is   * blank
* Okay
Okay
De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt
She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion
Will you just open the door
* Gib touches a plastic card to an unmarked spot just above the    * doorknob
There is the  of a
* Or drugs
45                                                             * 46
- They enter a long corridor, which is featureless except for      * video surveillance cameras
They walk along the silence for a   * moment, then
* Twenty here, fifty there figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it
thought you moved out
Well
moved back in
My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement
Don't change the subject
you owe me two hundred bucks
They approach another door, with a (bulletproof) glass window    * in it
Beyond is a brightly lit room, with a woman sitting at a desk
and nothing else
Gib presses a buzzer
47
- sits at the non-descript desk like a receptionist
but she is a highly trained security specialist
She is also hefty through the shoulders, aggressively unattractive and utterly humorless
She watches them on a monitor screen as they stand outside the door
Harry and Gib appear as living -Ray images
Their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses
Janice puts one hand automatically on the butt of a
45 tucked in a holster riveted beneath her desk
She buzzes Harry and Gib in with the other
Gentlemen, please idenitify yourselves to the scanner
Harry and Gib step up to the combination retinal-thumbprint- voice scanners
Harry presses his thumb against a black-glass plate for laser scan, and looks into the eye-piece of the retinal scanner
Harry Tasker
One zero zero two four
Albert Gibson
Three four nine nine one
Their clearance appears on a monitor on Janice's desk
Thank you
You are cleared
She stands to give them plastic
badges which they hang around their necks
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in
Ten, Mr
Gibson
And you still reach for your piece every time
Yes sir
God
You have no idea how much that turns me on
've never had the courage to say this before but
love you, Janice
Yes, sir
He kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by
She does not react is any discernible way
They pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens automatically
Beyond is a kind of airlock
a
Behind a lexan shield are   armed with MP5s
They nod but do not speak at Harry and Gib pass them
You better watch it
She might file on you for sexual harassment
In her dreams
48
- Gib and Harry pass through the inner door of the sally port into a large austere atrium
as they cross
huge graphic logo covers the floor
Across the center is says
In smaller print, around the perimeter, is the motto: " "
They enter a high-tech office space
It is a maze of glass partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles
There is a hushed quality here
People do not joke
They do not hurry
There are a lot of computer screens displaying information from around the world
It looks like a combination of  mission control and  headquarters
Fast Faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned cubicle
Come on, Fize
We're late for our butt-grinding
Faisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them
49
- dark and severe conference room, with large-screen computer displays at one end
Glowering at one end of the long, polished table, is  , the chief of Omega Sector
Visualize a cross between Colin Powel and
Edgar Hoover
Jesus, Harry
You guys really screwed the pooch last night
Please tell me how  can look at this, that it's not a total pooch- screw
Total is a strong word-- There are degrees of totality
It's a scale really, with "perfect mission" on one end and "total pooch-screw" on the other and we're more about here-- Faisil
You're new on Harry's team, aren't you
Yes
So what makes you think that the slack  cut him in any way translates to you
Sorry, sir
Uh
here's what we got
He hits a button and a photo of Khaled fills a wall-screen
Jamal Khaled
We think he's dirty so we raid his financial files
Check it out
Faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the data for their raid
One hundred million in wire transfers from the                         * --                                        * Which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist                      * activities
Something big is                          * going down -- * And we know that a week ago four                       * warheads were smuggled out                        * of the former Soviet Republic of                       * Kazakhstan

Helen works there as a paralegal
She is going to the break room for coffee with her friend, , a secretary
Allison is black, younger then Helen, and still single

He's a sales rep for Chrissakes
Whenever  can't get to sleep ask him to tell me about his day
Six seconds and 'm out
But he acts like he's curing cancer or something
So  guess you didn't get away                         * for the weekend after all
* Are you kidding
Harry had to go out of town

Yeah
You know Harry
Helen's nerdy boss , comes up behind her, scowling
Helen, have you pulled those files yet

Brad leaves

Eric and  drove up to this                      * little romantic inn, and

You bitch
Girlfriend, you got a man
You                        * just have to take control

* Harry only has two moods: busy
* and asleep
Then you better do something to                        * jumpstart that man's motor

Juno Skinner
(Harry raises an eyebrow) Uh huh
The babe at the party
* It doesn't mean anything
She buys antiquities for Khaled
Nope
The art buys are in a separate ledger
And this is a little above market-                     * rate for the horizontal bop, even                      * for a total biscuit like her
Alright,  want a complete workup on her
Do we know where she is
Uh huh
Right here in river city
You're kidding
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices                        * here

Sounds like a job for a specialist

/  -  (10PM) Harry opens the microwave as his dinner finishes re- heating
He sits down alone at the kitchen table and pulls the Saran-wrap off the plate
Another solo supper two hours late
His motions are so automatic we gather that this is the rule, not the exception
Helen comes in from the living room, holding the suspense novel she is reading
need you to talk to Dana
The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon
'll handle it
Harry picks up his porkchop and goes out the back door
53
- basketball hoop is bolted to the garage and Dana is shooting baskets in the driveway
Moths orbit the outside floodlights
She sinks one, dribbled back to the foul line
Harry comes up behind her and lifts the ball out of her hands as she stands poised to shoot
She turns
Dana, Mr
Hardy called
Why weren't you in class today
He lies
was there
was in the nurse's office, cause  had a headache
You seem fine now
Great
You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr
Hardy over your own daughter
'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady
You never used to lie to me
But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong
Dana studies something really fascinating at the end of a fingernail
Dana, are you listening to me
Yeah, Dad
You know you can always talk to me
Right
Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and 'll understand
Okay, Dad
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin
'm not a pumpkin
Okay
Do look even remotely like a pumpkin
'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either
And you don't understand anything Dad

-  ( ) cruises through a morning fill of bright promise
, Gib is at the wheel in a chauffeur's uniform
He talks to Harry, riding in the back, without turning
It's all set up
ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff
You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist
Okay, reality check
Go
Hi, 'm Harry Renquist
own a-- 56
'  - --corporate art consulting company in San Francisco
have an appointment with Ms
Skinner-- Harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as Juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor
She is dressed sharply and looks as stunning as Harry remembers
Harry
thought  might see you again
just didn't  except you to call so soon
Juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake
Well, what's the point of waiting
agree
There is definitely unholy magnetism here
She indicates for Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of offices
There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters
That's right
They want something
dramatic
spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see
Juno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area
There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates
An overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces
There are massive columns, and statues two stories high
Even the entire facade of a tomb
So what did these
people
say about me exactly
They stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment
Most of the workers are middle-eastern
Let's see
that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words
And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much
Those wimps
It's because  use                       * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike
(yelling in Arabic to two workmen) told you to move those crates an hour ago
Come on guys, let's get going
We realize that   is watching them intently from nearby
He is an intense looking -  in his mid- thirties
You see, a lot of these pieces are from ancient Persia
Unfortunately, ancient Persia is twenty feet under the sand of                          * Iran, Iraq and Syria
Not the most popular places lately
So 've had to become an expert in international diplomacy
Juno stops and looks at Harry
Her smile indicates the possibility of more than just business
Well, do you see anything you like, Mr
Renquist
: 57
- Harry, Gib and Fast Faisil are in a luxury suite at the It is a corner suite, with a spectacular view of the city
Faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an electronic
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east
She could be moving money, guns
Anything
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the                           * ghost numbers
They were checking out the Renquist front
Okay
Let's step up the surveillance on her
Put on two more guys
58
'  - the  we saw watching Harry earlier
He catches up with Juno, who is going through the doors to the office area
His name is
Ms
Skinner
Can  speak to you for a moment please, in your office
His manner is self-effacing
Humble
He doesn't meet her gaze
She nods and they go into the private office
59
'  - comes in behind her and closes the door
The moment they are away from public observation, his manner changes
His humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he approaches her
Without warning he You stupid undisciplined bitch
Her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive
It's a good thing you pay me well
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now
Your phones are almost certainly tapped
And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a-- No
He checked out okay-- Malik slaps her again
That is for interrupting
(He backhands her) And that is for being wrong
We do not tolerate mistakes
Juno bites her lip
What do you want me to do
Find out who this Renquist it
How
Use the gifts that Allah has given you

Tasker
Let me try him in there
Hold please

The display reads /   -- ,

Hi honey
What's going on
* Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that                        * you'll be home at eight

You promise
(laughing) Baby,  said 'd be there
Really
Trust me
(the room phone ) Gotta go, honey
Bye bye
Harry raises an eyebrow as he answers
Hello
Oh, Juno, hi
(pause) Well sure
can be there in twenty minutes
Harry hangs up
Gib, checking his watch, has a look like he's got a bad gas pain
What
It's on the way
She says she's got something for me
Yeah, right
64
'  - guides Harry through the maze of statuary
He points toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves
Harry is left alone in the vast space
Only a few lights are on, rendering the place somewhat Gothic
Harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed
Ahead of him, is the huge facade of a royal tomb
There is a flickering light inside
shadow moves across the wall in the entryway
Hello
He enters the stone doorway of the tomb
as he steps into the inner chamber
There is an oil-lamp burning on a stone sarcophagus, the only light
The room appears empty
Behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed alcove
It is Juno
She looks ethereal in the strange light
Hello, Harry
Harry whips around, startled
Do you like my tomb
The museum                       * financing fell out, so  thought                       * your clients might be interested

Especially in this light
This is the only light they had then,                       * so  like to study it this way
love this place
love all ruins
Is that why you got into this business
Juno turns to him in the flickering half-light
She moves closer
Her eyes seem to glitter
've always been a collector at heart
When  see something want,  have to have it
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants
She is very close to him
Her eyes seem to glitter in the light from the oil lamp
She is unbelievably beautiful
Yes,  do
65
'  - Gib is sitting in the car, in the shadows, up the street
with his earphone in place
Listening
Harry, this is your conscience speaking
66
- Juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall, holding it up so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas-relief figures to life
Stone faces shift and change, stone eyes move
Look at this
People who dies twenty centuries ago
Juno presses her cheek against the cold stone
She runs her fingers slowly across the figures
It is strange and erotic
They breathed and loved and wept, just like us
And now their ideals, their religions, their social orders
are gone like mist
What did any of it matter
She crosses to Harry
only hope they lived well
That they got what they wanted
She puts her hands on him and pulls herself close
It is a hypnotic moment
Getting what you want is the only important thing
She kisses him, very lightly, with infinite sensuality
67
'  - Harry
Listen to the following code word
Helen
----
Now, do you want me to  beep you
68
- Harry breaks the kiss
slowly pulling back
Yes
Yes what
Uh, yes, it is important
Juno is moving in for a more passionate lip-lock when-- Harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at it
The moment is spoiled
Uh, it looks like  have to run
'll call you tomorrow
Your proposal is very interesting
69

He looks at his watch

There is a big cake, and presents piled on the buffet
The food is getting cold

and  are in the front, with Mahmoud driving
In the back, shadowed, we can just make out
Yusif is massively built, with a body like a beer-keg
Mahmoud is skinny and intense

Test two three

Gib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance
Half a block behind them the station wagon does the same
Harry slips on the virtual-image sunglasses and gets out of the car
75
- Harry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette
He coughs slightly
(in his ear) You don't smoke, dickhead
Harry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of cigarettes casually
He turns his hand
The tiny lens in the cigarette pack glints
--inside the left lens of the glasses
The camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away
strolls into the mall
It is an open promenade design, with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers
Harry watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the crowd behind him
() What's the plan
(apparently mumbling to himself) Gonna try to get a closer shot of                      * Beavis & Butthead

There's another guy, still in the car
(on radio) Stay on him
All Gib can see is a silhouette in the car
soft cherry glow, the tip of a cigarette in the dark
No features
77
- Harry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway between shops
In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they track him through the pedestrian traffic

'  - Gib in on the cellular phone
Helen
Hi, it's Gib
Harry remembered something he left at the office
You know Harry
As he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the station wagon
79
'  - She sighs fatalistically
Yeah, Gib
know Harry
Helen hangs up the phone just as Dana strides through the room, putting on a jacket and heading for the front door
Where are you going
Out
If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should  care
'm going to a movie
No you're not
You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake
Mom, wake up
Dad barely knows we exist
We see the hurt in her eyes
She doesn't hate her father
She just misses him
That's not true, honey-- It is true
He doesn't know anything about me
He still thinks 'm like ten years old or something
As long as  just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine
But it's not fine
Nothing's fine
Dana runs out the kitchen by the other door
Helen runs after her
Dana
Come back here
The slamming door is her answer

He signals Mahmoud with his eyes and the two of them close in on the restroom

Ten the bus blocking his view finally pulls away and Gib see that the station wagon is empty
No silhouette
Oh shit
(into his headset) Harry,  lost the third guy
Harry
82
- Harry can't answer because Mahmoud just entered the room behind him
Harry is at one of the urinals, apparently taking a leak
Mahmoud goes to the mirror
Starts combing his hair
He doesn't much notice the pack of Camels sitting on the counter nearby
Harry is whistling
Shaking himself
'  - In the video glasses Harry sees himself and Mahmoud
Yusif comes into the restroom, seemingly ignoring both Harry and Mahmoud, as if heading for the stalls
As he passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat-- Harry spins lightning fast
He knocks away the aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing Yusif's arm in an arm-lock
The shot goes wide, shattering a urinal
Harry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and spins him against the steel stalls
The silenced pistol goes skittering across the floor
Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband
Still holding the bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely see him move
Three
45 slugs  go through Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him
He flops on his butt, slumping against the wall
Yusif, who is easily Harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun arm
They smash against the walls, struggling for the gun
Yusif, locked to Harry, hurls him against the stalls
They hit a locked door, which pops open, banging inward
Yusif drives Harry to the floor
Harry's head is between the shoes of an   sitting on the can, who looks down uncomprehendingly at him
Yusif slams Harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe of the stall
He twists Harry's wrist brutally
He even pounds against Harry's hand with his knee
The old guy winces
That's got to hurt
Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops
Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls
He punches Yusif in the face, driving him back
They grapple, spinning
Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter
Then he elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy floor
Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly against the rim of a urinal
In case you haven't noticed, this is a messy, nasty fight
Survival is like that
Yusif sags into submission
Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs, securing Yusif's wrists

He has one finger jammed in his ear
His gut is doing the rumba as he runs

Harry, you copy
Shit

He turns, thinking it is Gib
It's not
Malik raises a -  92- and opens fire
Harry spins Yusif between him and the machine pistol
Yusif's beer-keg body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting Harry long enough for him to dive into a stall
Malik hoses the room with the Beretta
The metal stalls are riddled with hits
is in the stall with the old guy, who's just sitting there
The walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on the far side
Harry reaches under the stall, retrieving his Glock
goes empty
Harry hears that and pops out, cranking off rounds-- Malik is a blur going out the door, as Harry's shots shatter tiles on the doorframe
Then silence
(to the old guy) Sorry

- , who backs rapidly away from the restroom, reloading
() Malik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance behind a light-standard
The terrorist doesn't hesitate
His Beretta  at 900 rounds per minute
Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about half as wide as he is
Shots hit all around him, shattering window glass behind him
His stomach sticks out from behind the pole
He sucks it in
Now his butt is sticking out on the other side
Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle everything behind him
Just when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck, Malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians
Harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it
Get back to the car
Gib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after Malik
Malik is fast and vicious
He hurls people out of the way, sending shoppers sprawling
Harry is ruthless in his pursuit
They pound through the mall and out onto the street-- 86

car screeches, not stopping in time
Malik goes right over the hood
Harry leaps over the hoods of cars after him
Malik sees Harry coming after him like a juggernaut
He turns and sees a  coming down the street, accelerating from a right-turn
Malik runs at him, clothes- lining him right off the bike
The terrorist picks up the nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps on
He pops the clutch and takes off
Harry pounds after him like a locomotive
He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path into a large

The cop turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet)
Federal Officer in pursuit of suspect
Sorry
Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop can get his gut out of the holster to stop him
roars through the park on the Kawasaki
He looks back, amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse
They scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs
as they rocket through the park
Malik leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees
Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling
Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it
He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the last bit of throttle out of it
They are going flat out, through the trees, in a kinetic blur

The Unit Seven car pulls out as well, up the block

Cars skid around him, out of control
He turns south
Weaving through traffic
Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and gallops among the spun-out cars
He goes right over the hood on one which is blocking his path
The driver ducks as the horse's hoof cracks the windshield

Malik goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty
Gib's car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes barrelling down the street toward him
Gib cranks the wheel the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes
Malik locks up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop
Then the terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping the curb and going straight at the entrance of Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them
The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby
ducks, galloping through the doors after him
93
- Acres of marble and red carpet
Liveries porters
Guests dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women
And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with Harry charging along behind him
Malik guns it across the lounge, knocking over tables
He gets air at the top of  the steps going up to the
Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself careening toward the   at a full gallop
He gathers the animal and  (in glorious  ) over the bassist, who is diving for the carpet
Harry and horse land deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after Malik

Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier
Waiters, trays, dinners, tables
everything seems to be flying at once as people dive out of the way

The door is just closing on one of them
He guns it and slides through the doors
out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of Malik as the doors close
96
- Harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just been boarded by an older couple
He has to practically lie down on the horse to fit through the door
The animal barely fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be-- with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel as it rises, right to the top of the building
Harry looks through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet away
Malik is inside, punching a button
He glances up and sees Harry
There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's car ascends rapidly
Malik's malevolent glare is etched on Harry's retinas
The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's panting, snorting horse
It clomps around the tight elevator
The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall
Can you just press the top floor, please
The man nods mutely and complies
Their elevator takes off, rising after Malik's

They follow the path of destruction, growing more and more amazed
Gib yells to one of the porters
The guy on the horse
The porter points at the elevators

- Harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel
He can look up at an angle and see Malik in the car above him
His thumb hovers over the emergency stop button
If Malik gets out at any floor, Harry will have a moment to react and stop
Malik can look down and see this
He knows Harry's got him
He just keeps going, floor after floor, using the time to think
The older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe
The horse flicks her in the face with his tail

The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one- eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof
Amazingly, he increases speed,     , Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik, on his bike, 60   and      of a       * next to the hotel
Harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away
He wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some running space
Then he turns again, back toward the edge Malik jumped from
He kicks the horse's flanks and yells
The horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt toward the edge
But a horse is not a motorcycle
It is slightly smarter
It slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly
Harry goes right over its head
He flies forward, almost going right off the roof
He slams to the edge, with his legs dangling over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand
His Glock tumbles down into darkness
Harry sees Malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to the roof door of the other building
Getting away
Harry clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard
He walks over to the horse
What the hell were you thinking
We had the guy and you let him get away
He looks into the horse's innocent brown eyes
Pats its neck fondly
What kind of  cop are you

- Helen is asleep at the dining room table next to a half-eaten cake and some melted ice cream
His unopened presents are piled at one end of the table
She raises her head as Harry enters sheepishly
Look,  know you're upset
'm really sorry, honey
raced home as quick-- It's okay, don't bother, Harry
He goes to her and puts his arms around her
He is tender with her
He wishes he can tell her the truth
'm sorry
Thank you for the party
Yeah
It was great
Helen finds a smile for him somewhere
She really does love him, though more and more often lately she finds her heart in pain
Let's go to bed, Harry
There's only one present you have to open tonight
She grins and arches one eyebrow meaningfully
101
/  - Helen walks Harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down
She puts her hand on his chest and pushes, causing him to lie back
Don't move
'll be right back
She turns on the stereo
Kenny  disc she put in there earlier
Soft tenor sax flows around the room
Helen enters the  and shuts the door partway
She opens a cupboard and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier bottle of champagne on ice
Two glasses
Some trashy lingerie
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth
'll just be a second
So what happened tonight at the office
couldn't believe it
go back to get this report  need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead  answer it-- Helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie
-string panties and low-cut bra
She holds up the garter belt, turning it backward and forward, trying to figure out which way it goes
, yawning
Lying with the ease of years of practice
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed
this guy's having a meltdown-- (keeping him talking) What'd you do, honey
Well  pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server
Helen is pulling up the black stockings
She fastens the garters to the tops
Her features are a scowl of concentration
She is very earnest in her preparations
(') and 'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone
talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong
it was unbelievable
really wild
(putting on black pumps) It sounds wild
So now you're a big hero, right
For fixing their system
(faintly) Uh huh
My husband the hero
Red lipstick
Then she puts a little perfume on her wrists
'll be right there, honey
Just a minute
Harry doesn't answer
Helen puts a little perfume down the front of her panties
Just a second
Helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne
Then she slinks around the doorframe, making her entrance
She looks like a living 900 number
Helen stands before the bed, looking down, holding the champagne glasses
: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed, snoring softly
little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth
, all dressed up with no place to go
She gazes down at him, her shoulders slumping
Happy Birthday, Harry
She sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp
: 102
/  - - It is the following morning
Harry and Gib are staked out watching the front of Dana's school
Actually, Harry is staked out, scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars
Gib just keeps looking at his watch
He picks up a cellular phone and pretends to call the office
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet
Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch -- (not listening) Okay
Here she comes
103
- '    - We see Dana come out to the curb and meet Trent, who pulls up on his bike
She gets on behind him, adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he launches out into traffic
104
'  - Harry, who is behind the wheel, pulls out after her
Trent weaves radically through the light traffic, going in between the cars
Look at the way the little punk is driving
He's all over the place
Look-- he hasn't signalled once
Goddammit
That's outrageous
Harry speeds up
Somebody honks as he cuts them off to stay with Trent
105
- as she looks back and sees Harry following her
She is mortified that her father is actually tailing her Oh my God
think that's my dad
Hang on
Trent downshifts and punches it
The nimble little bike screams as it zips between cars
106
'  - (clenching his jaw) So, you wanna play huh
You little-- (rolling his eyes) That's it
Get 'im Harry (he draws a pistol) We'll teach that little puke not to signal
107 , who's actually a really good rider
He zig-zags through the cars, cutting between them at the next light where Gib and Harry get blocked
He cuts a sharp right turn and disappears
108
'  - Harry is stuck in stopped traffic
He pounds the wheel in frustration
(exploding with laughter) Ha
The little prick ditched you
That is so goddamn funny
Son of a bitch
Can we go to the office now, Mr
Superspy
: 109
/
- Harry is sitting at a computer workstation, lit by the monitor screen
Gib and Faisil look on as he clicks through of known terrorists
Harry is very focussed
He stops
He goes back one
Studies the face
110
-     - defiant looking Syrian with a full beard
holds up his hand, blocking out the beard, concentrating on the eyes
That's him
111
- Harry slaps photos down in front of Trilby
Abu Kaleem Malik
(reading from a file) Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-                     * fundamentalist
Linked to                             * numerous car-bombings, that cafe                       * bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year
Major player
* * Now he's formed his own splinter faction called
* Guess he thought the other terrorist groups were too warm and fuzzy for his taste
They call him "The Sand Spider"
* Why
(he shrugs) Probably because it sounds scary
* This is impressive, gentlemen
Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was
We'll get him
Yes
You will
(meaning-- you damn well better) Harry,  still want you in charge, even though your cover is blown
Just keep a low profile
(he slaps a newspaper on the table) generally prefer it when my covert operations don't make the front page
The agents look at the headlines:
Harry and Gib wince
112
'   - Harry and Gib pull to the curb in front of the building
What's going on
Harry gets out of the car and turns back, leaning in the door to talk to Gib
Look, uh
've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana
'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch
You want me to just hang--
Just hang a minute
'll just hang then, shall
113
- Harry enters the office of Helen's firm
He stops at reception
Hello Mr
Tasker
Just a second, 'll  buzz Helen
No
No, 'd like to surprise her
Thanks,  know where her desk is
He smiles and breezes past her before she has a chance to object
114
'  - as he moves through the offices
He passes through a library-like maze of records stacks
Through them he can see Helen at her desk
But as he approaches, still concealed,  puts a call on hold and whips around to Helen
Helen
(grinning conspiratorially) It's your mystery man
Simon
Ohmygod
Helen, normally the image of composure, goes suddenly fluttery and nervous as a high-school girl
She takes the phone, turning away from Allison
Hello, Simon
(pause) It's all right
There's no one around
Helen glimpses Allison with her ears cocked and gives her a scowl and a shooing motion
Allison turns away, grinning
115
-    - , behind the stacks, reacting
He silently mouths "
" 116
'  - You mean right now
(she looks around guiltily) guess so
Okay
'll be right there
(pause) Yes
can't wait
Bye
She hangs up, a little flushed
Then turns to Allison
Can you cover me for an hour
Just an hour
You should tell this stud to take more time
Will you shutup
should never have told you about him
Helen grabs her purse and rushes out, going right past the stack where Harry is standing, dumbfounded
He looks like he was slammed in the stomach with a lead pipe
His whole like is unravelling
117
- Gib sees Harry crossing the street, holding his stomach
He seems dazed
He is not so much walking to the car as wandering in its general direction
He stops, in the street
Gib gets out of the car and rushes to him
He pulls him out of the path of a bus which is  irritably
You look like you got gut-kicked
What's the matter
You sick
Harry leans against the car for support
(barely audible) He-- Helen
Helen-- it's Helen
It's Helen, Gib
Something to do with Helen, is what 'm getting
She's having an affair
Harry's best friend in the world brightens with the news
He slaps him on the back
Congratulations
Welcome to the club
It can't be
Not Helen
Nobody believes it can happen to them
It can't be
Same thing happened to me with wife two
had no idea until came home and the house was empty
mean empty
She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge
What kind of person would think of that
(not listening) still don't believe it
Relax
Helen still loves you
She just wants this guy to bang her
It's nothing serious
You'll get used to it after a -- Harry wheels around on Gib, grabbing him by the lapels, and slams him against the car
We see in Harry's rage, frustration, and hurt confusion a vulnerability we never expected to see
What'dya expect Harry
She's a flesh and blood woman
And you're never there
It was only a matter of time
Harry sags
His friend is right
Gib opens the car door and helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time-- say we concentrate on work
That's how  always got through it whenever my life turned to dogshit
Let's catch some terrorists and then you can beat the crap out of them
You'll feel better
Gib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry
Women
Can't live with 'em
Can't kill 'em
118
/   - Harry and Gib are in the
Banks of tape-decks recording calls, rows of technicians in cubicles processing and collating transcripts
He's giving us a blank check on                        * wiretaps
So 've set 'em up on all of Juno's shipping agents, her clients, and Faisil made up                        * a list of possible contacts that Crimson Jihad might have in this country
Now all we can do is                         * wait --                                                * He notices Harry is not listening
Is this national security stuff boring you
Put a tap on her phone
What're you talking about
We have that
Helen's phone
Her office line and the line at my house
Gib gives Harry a stricken look, and glances around nervously
He pulls him into an empty office
* (a whispered hiss)                                * Okay
have two words to                        * describe that idea
In
Sane
Unauthorized wiretap is a felony, pard
Harry grabs him and rams him up against the wall, his teeth clenched
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day
Don't give me that crap
Just put on the taps
Now
Sure, Harry
'm on it
Harry releases him and turns away
Gib straightens his jacket, looking at his friend like he's completely losing it
119
- That night Harry is actually there on time for dinner
He glances at Dana, who has been eyeing him warily
She looks at her peas
How was school today
Fine
Harry takes a bite of his food, watching her
Silence
Helen glances at him
So
You came by to see me today
She is a too casual, masking her nervousness
was in the area, and  thought you might like to have lunch
They must've just missed me
They said you had to run out
Yeah
It was a rush thing
They needed some documents down at the court house
barely made it
Harry watches her lying to him with some amazement
You can see the jaw muscles clenching
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day
Did is work out okay
Oh, sure
Fine
(she gets up suddenly) 'll get some more gravy
'm done
Dana bolts
She has eaten about four bites
Harry sits at the table, alone
He feels isolated, knowing that everybody is lying to everybody else
He is a man without a center, lost
: 120
/   - Harry comes to a particular set of machines
He reaches past the technician and picks up the hard-copy of the transcripts
walking and leafing through the phone transcripts
Gib watches him through a glass partition, shaking his head slowly
Harry freezes, staring at the page and : Hello
Helen
It's Simon
Is it safe to talk
Yes
Go ahead
121
-   - man in his mid-thirties, sitting in a car  (), speaks into a cellular phone
This is
He is dark haired, and fairly good-looking in an off-beat way
He is unshaven and his clothes look slept in
He glances around in a furtive manner
can't talk long
Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow
must see you
122
'  - , at her office
Yes
suppose so
Where
The same place
One o'clock have to go now
See you tomorrow
Remember,  need you
123
- The last line is played  , reading
Now he is seeing the proof in black and white
He slowly crumples the paper in one hand, his expression dark
124
- Helen is reading in bed
She glances up as Harry comes into the room
Gives  him a quick smile
Too quick
thought we might have lunch tomorrow
can't, honey
promised Allison 'd go shopping with her
Sorry
Harry watches her smoothly lying to him
It's surreal to him
No problem
He surreptitiously picks up Helen's purse from a dresser and     * goes into the hall
* 125                                                             * 126

Harry walks briskly along the sidewalk, jerking the poor dog along twice as fast as his little legs will go
* 127
,  '  - He reaches Gib's car, half a block up, and hands him Helen's     * purse
Gib eyes the dog warily
He growls at it
Gizmo hides  * behind Harry's legs
Look, Harry
know this is rough
felt the same way the first time it happened to-- Harry holds up one finger
His eyes and expression are so intense, Gib just soft of trails off
* Right
* (hefting the purse)                               * So
the usual, right
* locator, telemetry burst                           * transmitter, audio transmitter,                        * power supply

,     - below the dash
Helen's purse appears as a moving blip on a street-map of the city
133

- Okay, she's turning on Seventeenth
Make a left, you should see her
Harry makes the turn
There she is

Harry parks the car a block away and gets out his binoculars
135
'    - '  through the scope
Helen gets out of her car and looks around as she walks to the cafe
It is not a nervous look, but it is clear she is making sure she is not followed
She goes inside
136
- Give me audio
Gib hits a switch and they hear the clamor of the cafe at lunch rush come over a speaker
137
- The restaurant is nothing fancy
little dark
Helen makes her way to a booth in the back
Sitting in the shadows, facing the door, is
She sits down opposite him
He doesn't smile or kiss her in greeting, but glances around the room like he expects a threat to leap out at any moment
Are you sure you weren't followed
kept looking back, like you taught me
didn't see anyone
Okay
It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now
If get a signal
(holds up a cigarette lighter meaningfully) may have to leave suddenly
understand
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours
feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one  can trust
Simon creates an atmosphere of danger
His haggardness give him an air of mystery and desperation
Where were you
On a
uh,                           * mission
Ssshhh
We say Op
Covert                            * operation
And this one got a little rough
Worse than Cairo
* Cairo was a day at the beach next                      * to this
138
- Harry and Gib turn to each other, shocked with the dawning awareness
Guy's a spook
Yeah, but for who
* He could be working her to get to you
Harry waves his hand, silencing Gib
/  /
139
- puts a newspaper on the table, sliding it over to Helen
Did you read the papers yesterday
Yes
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation
See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running                          * shootout, ending at the                                * Marriot
140
- react, realizing that it is the story of their operation gone awry
141
- That was you
You recognized my style
See, you're very good
You're a natural at this
142
- Harry starts to get it
Then is dawns on Gib
The guy's a fake
He's taking credit for our moves
143
- She clearly is hanging on his every word
Tell me what happened
'm sorry,  can't
You can trust me completely
know
But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things
Right, of course
was worried when  didn't hear from you that night
It's strange
knew  was in a woman's thoughts when  was shooting it out with those assassins
144
- to the outrageous fabrication
Unbelievable
145
- is eating it up
Were they trying to kill you
* Three of them
Hardly worth                           * talking about
Two won't bother                       * me again
And you chased one
Something came over me,  just had nail him, no matter what the                       * risk
It was pretty hairy thought he had me, a couple of                         * times
But  really can't take credit
* You can't
* * No
It's the training
It                            * shapes you into a lethal                               * instrument
You react without                         * thinking

This is too much

What is it you want me to do
Not here
'll call you and we'll rendezvous again

For your safety
You'll call me then
Yes
Now go

/  - Simon is cruising in the Corvette with the radio blasting
Thinking he is supercool
157
- Simon pulls into a used car lot, which is a run-down place hodge-podge of makes and models, a few that might aspire to be classics
Simon backs the Vette into an open space on the front line
He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing the   of the car
He sticks it back on the dash
The car doesn't even belong to him
158
- Harry and Gib pull up
They watch as Simon jumps out of the Vette and goes into the sales office
(laughing) He's a goddamn used car salesman
This just gets better
(catching himself) Sorry Harry,  know this is painful
Harry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the street
159
-  ( )                 * , with Simon's hand adjusting the volume
The sound of traffic noise and middle-eastern music blares from the deck
to see Simon on the phone, talking loud, as if over the din of a real place
It's a great little bar, Amanda, you'd love it
Beirut's a great place if you know the city
* Listen, this isn't a secure line
'll tell you all about it when get back tomorrow
if  live
(pause) Scared
Never
Except of you-- During this, the owner of the place,  , has come out of the back room and looked out at the lot
What Doug sees is-- , browsing among the cars
turns from the window and bears down on Simon, who sees him coming and speeds up his rap
-- have to go, baby
guy's coming toward me-- Doug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the cradle
* Simon, look out there
You see that man
Notice how he's looking at the cars
He's called a customer
know it's been a while, but do you remember what you're supposed to do when we have a customer
160
- Simon bounces jauntily up to Harry, talking before he's even reached him
It wants you too
Feel it vibrate
How about a little spin
Simon opens the passenger door and sits Harry inside, then runs around the car
He leaps over the closed door into the driver's seat and starts the car
You gotta jump in
That's rule number one
It takes a little practice, but there's no way around it
161
- Simon swings the car out onto the boulevard, kicking back
See, it's not just the car, it's a total image
An identity you have to go for
This isn't some high-tech sports car
it doesn't even handle that great
But that's not the idea, is it
Simon gives Harry a big grin
Harry returns a knowing chuckle
Ha ha
What're we talking about here
Pussy, right
Absolutely
Simon laughs
Harry laughs
big lusty, male-bonding kind of laugh
Well then this is a vital piece of equipment
Used properly, it can change your life
See, you cruise
No racing
This ain't a Ferrari
You check out the scenery, let the scenery check you out
You got to take it slow
Old cars are like good women
they heat up fast
How do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold
Ask Harry
Keep talking
: 162
- Simon is holding court
Over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his greatest area of expertise
We see Harry laughing, going along with the guy
Pretending to bond
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet
But it's not enough
If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle
And you've got one
It's killer
Look at me-- 'm not that much to look at
No really
can be honest
But got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either
Some are
So what's your angle
Sorry
Trade secret
(grinning) Sure
Set me up and then don't tell me
Simon leans forward, conspiratorially
Okay, just ask yourself
What do women really want
You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years
Stuck in a rut
They need some release
The promise of adventure
hint of danger create that for them
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time couldn't do it
Well, think of it as playing a role
It's fantasy
You have to work on their dreams
Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run
Doesn't matter
like change
You know, constant turnover
As soon as  close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios
Use 'em and lose 'em
Exactly
The trick is, you gotta pick your target
They have to be nice little housewife types
School-teachers
But, 'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower
What about the husbands
Dickless
If they took care of                        * business, 'd be out of business, know what  mean
Those idiots

You working on someone right now
always have a couple on the hook
You know
There's one right now, 've got her panting like a dog
It's great
Unconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter
What does she do
Some kinda legal secretary of something
Married to some boring jerk
Harry takes a corner too fast
The tires squealing
And she could be so hot, if she wanted to be
She's like a dying plant that just needs a little water
When Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging
they laugh together
then when he looks away Harry goes snake- eyed
He could kill Simon with one punch
He's visualizing his wife getting porked by this guy
But with you, she gets to be hot, right
Red hot
Her thighs steam
They laugh together
Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle
He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel
Now for the big question:    '
Sooooo
she's pretty good in bed, then
(yelling suddenly) Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn
164
- Harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty
He cranks the wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a smoking bootlegger-180
It screeches backward, sliding right into its parking space perfectly
Simon is bugeyed
But he is non-plussed for only about two seconds
Then he's back to selling
He scrambles out and goes around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke
See
You and this car were meant for each other
Why fight it
Sure,  have a couple other buyers lined up, but  like your style
Whattya say
Should we start on the paperwork
Let me think about it
Hold it a day for me
Simon grins and winks
Because it's you
165
- Dana is in the living room, watching  when she sees her mother cross through, dressed to go out
Dinner's in the warmer
Tell your father  may be late
Where are you going
Out
Dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles
166
- , checking herself in the hall mirror
She looks at her big dowdy purse
Hating it suddenly
She pulls her pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet for a small handbag, then charges out

- Harry is driving
Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his briefcase and hands them to him
Here's today's transcripts
There's nothing interesting
Nothing from Simon
Keeping one eye on the road, Harry riffles through the sheets
He glances at the top of the last couple of sheets
He scowls
Then
The car dives to the curb, bumping one wheel
Harry gets out and charges around to Gib's side
Gib gets out, his expression blank
Give me the page
What are you talking about
It skips from page nine to eleven
Where's page ten
Aw, it's gotta be a typo-- Harry hammers his fist against the car-window right next to Gib
It explodes inward in a shower of glass
(shrugging) Okay
Here
He fishes a crumples sheet of paper out of his pocket
Harry grabs it from him, straightening it
Jeez, Harry
Seek help
As Harry begins to read, we go into

Helen's purse-blip flashes on the grid map
She's still at my house
* The purse is still at the house

Horns honk as he cuts off people
He is oblivious
He grabs his rover

Rolling
Copy that
Wait a minute
Are you out of your mind
You can't pull agents off a priority surveillance to follow  your wife
It's gross misappropriation of Sector's resources, it's
it's a breach of national security
Harry drives on, ignoring him
Gib grabs his shoulder, shaking him
* You copy, Harry
This is too far
You're losing it big-time
have to stop you
Whatya going to do
Tell
Goddamnit, Harry
This is our butts
So your life is in the toilet
So your wife is banging a used car salesman
Sure it's humiliating
But be a man here-- You tell on me,  tell on you
Whatya talking
'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe
Clean as a -- What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job
(instantly contrite) You know about that
Harry turns to him
His glare could melt metal
Gib gives a fatalistic shrug
Take Franklin, it's quicker
Harry makes the turn, squealing tires
You don't have any pictures though, do ya
Huh
* 173
- Helen pulls  her car under the bridge
She checks her watch
Helen notices that her hand is shaking
She looks around and    * the place seems deserted
She is about to leave when she sees headlights flash briefly in the shadows
red-and-white Vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up next to her
Simon motions for her to get in quickly

' Simon makes a show of checking the mirrors
Now don't be alarmed
but if 'm spotter, it would be best if they don't see you
You should keep your head down until we're out of the city
He pushes her head down onto his lap
She crouches there, with her cheek against his thigh
He's cruising along, loving it
176
'  - Gib is trying to watch the computerized city map on the screen, but Harry keeps cornering so fast he loses his place
() The woman has her head in the guy's lap
Harry is doing a jaw-clenched slow burn
Roger, two
One to Condor, do you have visual
177 thru 183 184
- It is a highway heading away from the city , the Vette appears over the brow of a hill
moment later   rises up behind them,
It follows the Vette
( /) This is Condor
We have the ball, repeat
we have a good lock-up on

The greenish, image-intensified view of the car is like daylight

Simon and Helen get out of the car
My place in the city is too hot right now
So is the penthouse in New York
But this place is secure
He takes her inside
(189)                                                  189 '  -                                    190 Helen feels awkward in the small, junky space
tape deck is playing cool jazz
Simon hands her a glass of cheap wine
He clinks her glass with his
To our assignment
What is it you need me to do
Helen,  want you to be my wife
'm married
(quickly) Just for the operation in Paris
need to be married
They'll be looking for a man traveling alone
We're going to Paris
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit
don't know who
There's no one  can trust
Except you
Can you get away
Just for two days
don't know
have to think
Here
Sit down
Be comfortable
He clears a place for her on the bed, shoving clothes and magazines out of the way
She sits down and he tops off her glass from the wine bottle
191
- The agents have gathered behind a billboard
Harry, Gib and     * the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits
They finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski-       * masks
They don them in perfect unison
Commando precision
Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard, closing in on Simon's trailer
192
- Helen looks up at Simon and nods slowly
Okay
'll do it
Simon shoots over and sits next to her, taking her hand
You are incredibly brave
have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling
've lived like this for years, so 'm used to it
Every day when  get up, think it might be my last
But it makes you appreciate life
And the moment
Because that may be all you have
He moves a little closer
Casting his spell
To pull this cover story off, we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other
The enemy can spot a fake easily
He puts his hand on her knee
She tenses up instantly
You see what  mean
That reaction would give us away in a second
Try to relax
It's just that
it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, -- Relax
There, that's better
Let yourself slip into the role
He puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly into a kiss
This doesn't seem real to Helen
She finds herself not pulling away
He lowers her slowly until they are lying together on the bed
There you go
That's right
He slides his hand up her thigh
The fingers, stroking in little circles, slips under her skirt
And-- She suddenly , pushing on his chest, forcing him up off her
Stop
(he keeps kissing her) Get off me
Simon struggles with her
She gets one knee up under him and levers him up
She pushes him to a standing position
She sits up on the bed, straightening her skirt
He looks forlorn and pathetic
Now he's going to try pleading
If not for me, do it for democracy
193
/
- The back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny shaped-charges
The concussion throws Simon forward on top of her
Five -  swarm in, carrying machine pistols and flashlights
194
- '  - Lit by the beam of the flashlight, he sees Simon on top of Helen, her knees up on either side of his hips
It looks bad
Simon and Helen sit up
stunned
They look like two rabbits in the headlights of a truck
She screams
195
-   - Reacting as all his years of bullshit have suddenly materialized as a nightmarish reality
He is stunned
Blinking, mouth hanging open
196
/
- '  - -- Five demonic figures, backlit by the from a helicopter
Smoke and dust swirling in the rotor- wash
The figures lunge toward them, grabbing them both
Helen struggles fiercely as Gib (disguised) pulls her up
Harry yanks Simon to his feet
197
- Gib comes out first with Helen
She struggles like a wildcat, frankly surprising the hell out of Harry
Simon is brought out, dazed and compliant
Helen whips around, right in the balls
Gib  and doubles over, and Helen runs for it
Harry leaves Simon with the other agents and runs after Helen
She sprints through the trees, Harry pounding after her
He grabs her and gets her in a headlock
She bites the hell out of his arm
Harry yells and lets her go, just as-- Keough runs up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon
Standard operating procedure
Which is why he can't understand why Harry punches him, knocking him down
Harry supports a sagging Helen, gesturing sharply to the other agents and going - to make his point (since he can't talk without her recognizing his voice)
They head for the cars
: 198
/  - An empty room with a single stool under a light, and a large two-way mirror
The door opens and Helen is escorted in by Keough, still wearing his jumpsuit
Helen has a black hood over her head
Keough undoes a pair of handcuffs, freeing her, then leaves quickly
Helen whips the hood off and blinks in the light
She wheels at the sound of the door locking and runs to it
Pulls twice on the handle, without effect
She crosses to the mirror and peers at her reflection, trying to see if anyone is there on the other side
199
- is a dark chamber
We see Helen perfectly, peering in, though she sees nothing
Harry and Gib, in silhouette, sit at a console
Harry speaks into a microphone
Sit down
200
- '  of the mirror we hear Harry's voice shifted by a
It is a cold booming mechanical voice
Harsh and inhuman
() said
(she does) Who do you work for
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath
'm a legal secretary
() Of course
Mrs
Tasker
And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal
Taking dictation
He said he was an American agent
201
- room we can see Harry, Gib and, through the glass, Helen
Their voices sound normal on this side
How long have you been a member of his faction
don't know anything about a faction
just met Simon
or whatever his name is
a couple of weeks ago
barely know him
That's not what it looked like when we found you
Harry scowls at Gib in the dark
Helen flushes, remembering
How did you meet him
: 202
- / We see Helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works, having a cappucino and a croissant
(
) About two weeks ago  was at the mall, having coffee
Simon appears behind her, sort of stalking up to her
He approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat next to her
His manner is furtive
He keeps looking around, as if for hidden assasins
He hands her a briefcase
(speaking very low) Keep this for me
can't afford to be taken with it
National security is at stake
'll contact you if a can
Okay
Oh-- He seems to suddenly spot something   and dashes off the other way
203
- / Helen walks back to her office building, carrying the briefcase
She keeps looking over her shoulder
204
'  - / She has the briefcase on her desk while she works
She keeps glancing at it as she types
Finally she hunches over it and starts picking the locks with a paper clip
, popping open
as she opens the case
She gasps
are the following items:   tiny camera, some loose tapes, some circuit diagrams, some transcripts that look like gibberish which must be , some street maps of Beirut, Rome and Berlin, and a Walther
Helen, eyes wide, closes the case
205
-  / Helen shrugs, finishing up her story
should have gone to the police, suppose
But you didn't
Why not
don't know
guess wanted to see what would happen
What did happen
Three days later, he called me
He told me to meet him at Overlook Park
206
- / Through the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to Georgetown and Embassy Row
Helen is sitting on a park bench when Simon shows up, sitting beside her
She hands him the briefcase
Thank you
You saved my life
What's your name
Helen
You can call me Simon
(he touches her hand) You're very brave to do this
(then notices the locks have been opened) You opened it
just glances inside
207
- , looking right into her eyes
(solemn) Then you know
208
-  / Harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes, picturing the whole thing
Why did you continue to see him
He needed my help
Not because you were attracted to him
No
You weren't attracted to him at all
Well, maybe a little
Is this a common thing for you
Cheating
No
Never
So, it was your first time
wasn't cheating
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker
Harry
What can  say about Harry
He's a sales rep for a computer company
(hard question for him) Would you say he was boring, then
(she sighs, nodding fatalistically) Yeah
suppose he is
So sex with him isn't exactly making your flag wave anymore
Harry cuffs him on the shoulder
Signals with a scowl for him to stay out of it
Gib smirks
Harry's put him through enough shit the last couple of days, it's time for a couple digs
That's none of your goddamn business
What kind of questions are these
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs
Tasker, so  suggest you cooperate
If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us
Helen glowers at the mirror
Her hands are shaking and she hates it that they can probably see she is afraid
My husband is a good man
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right
mean-- Harry covers the mike and whips around on Gib
Let me handle this part
Do you mind
(to Helen) Why did you go to Carlos' hideout
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife
And you agreed
Yes
(amazed) Why
Helen searches herself for the explanation
don't know
guess  needed something
What did you need
needed to feel alive
wanted to do something
outrageous
And
don't know
it felt good to be needed
To be trusted
To be special
In verbalizing it she just feels smaller, more pathetic that she ever did
She hates the unseen voices for making for try to explain her deepest, unvoiced needs
There's so much  wanted to do in this life, and it's like haven't done any of it
And the sand's running out of the hourglass
want to be able to look back and say:  See
did that
It was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and fucking did it
(she glares at the mirror) And  frankly don't give a shit if you understand this or not
Gib looks at Harry, eyebrows raised
Whew
Harry is studying his wife like she's some fantastic new species
This Simon
Did you sleep with him
No
(covering the mike) She's lying
You didn't have sexual relations with him
(acidly) Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time
And  have to get home to my family
You're not going anywhere
Helen loses it
It is fury and fear, tears and rage all at once-- Let me out of her
Right now
Answer the question-- She picks up her stool and charges toward the mirror, swinging it with all her might
It bounces off harmlessly
(she swings again, yelling) didn't sleep with him
(and again--
) You hear me, you chickenshit bastards-- She hits the mirror again
( ) Everyone tries
It's unbreakable
The mirror suddenly stars from side to side with huge cracks
She's about to beat her way through it
209
- Harry and Gib jump back
She could be telling the truth
(to Helen) Wait
Calm down, Mrs
Tasker
There is only one more question
Helen drops the stool
She stands there panting
Her fury spent, she begins to cry
What
Do you still love your husband
(softly) Yes
Louder please
love him
have always loved him and  will always love him
(she wipes at her eyes) Can  go home, please
210
- Harry states at her
He smiles
Now what
(leaning forward to the mike) There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs
Tasker
You must work for us
(whispering to Harry) Oh shit
Harry
what're you doing
(like: isn't it obvious
) 'm giving her an assignment
(to Helen) am offerring you a choice
If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life
If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone
Your like will be destroyed
Oh, gee thanks
Mmmm, let me see-- Yes or no
What do you think
Of course yes
What's involved
You will be contacted with the assignment
My husband can't know about this
No one must know
Especially him
You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing
The security of this nation depends on it
Can you do that
think so
Think carefully
You will be lying to the man you love
The person who trusts you the most
(fearless) can do it
The code name of your contact will be Boris
Your code name will be-- (excited) Natasha
No
Doris
211
- , not liking her wimpy code-name
212
- The unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord
The door slides open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands
She is wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands
She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed off
She watches it drive off into the night
213
- The van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry
The door opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask
Gib follows as Harry guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop
Harry whips off the hood and Simon takes in his surroundings
Yeeaoowww
You son of a bitch
Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos
Wait
You got the wrong guy
My name's Simon
Look, just let me go
There's no need to kill me
haven't seen your-- Harry whips off his ski-mask
-- face
Shit
Shit
Simon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry
Then it dawns
He looks up, brightening hopefully
It's you
Hey, you still interested in that Vette at all
You can drop it now, Carlos
The game is over
Your career as an inter-national terrorist is too well documented
No
sell cars
That's all
Not even foreign cars
Nothing international,  swear
'm no terrorist
Everything  said was a lie
you have to believe me
'm actually a complete coward
If  ever even saw a gun 'd-- Harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes
-- faint
Aahhh
Don't kill me
'm not a spy
'm nothing
'm navel lint
have to lie to women to get laid
And  don't score much
It's pathetic
(he looks down) See, look
would a spy pee himself
Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling
He pulls Simon away from the edge, then gestures with his gun
Beat it
No
Soon as  turn you'll shoot me
Harry starts back to the truck
Simon stays right with him, facing him, terrified to turn away
Like a dog following him
Please don't
You can have the car for free-- Take off, dipshit
Gib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance backward
The two agents get into the van and tear off in a cloud of dust
Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles from nowhere
: 214
/
- as a blip moves across the grid of city streets
Gib drives while Harry watches the screen
We should pick up visual at the next light
The scrambler phone in Harry's briefcase rings
He picks it up
Morning, boss
215
- Spencer Trilby stands glowering as he talks to Harry
Harry, this report on last night's operation is the thinnest piece of crap 've ever seen from you
'm sure you won't mind giving me a little more detail on why all these assets were deployed
216
/
- Absolutely
But can it wait
'm on a critical surveillance right now
Harry spots something up ahead
He snaps his fingers and points, then whips a pair of gyro-stabilized binoculars to his eyes
'   :  Trent, on the Yamaha with Dana on the back, rides through the intersection up ahead
Dana bops to the sound coming over her walkman headphones as Trent zips between cars
Gib makes the turn, pulling in behind them at a distance
Harry
Is there anything you want to tell me
(innocently) No
Not that  can think of
ominously on Spencer Trilby
Harry
You know we never fire anybody
Click
Harry hangs up the phone slowly
We're dead, right
So
where'd you put the transmitter
In her Walkman
It's the one thing  knew she'd be taking
217
- Harry walks toward the closed warehouse doors, past Trent's parked Yamaha
We hear  from inside
218
- , we see what it is that Dana has been doing when she skips school
garage band of teenagers, mostly older than her, are playing loudly
Dana has the microphone, belting out a punchy cover of the old Cream classic "Sunshine of Your Love"
The guitar parts have been industrial- ized, and it actually sounds pretty hip
Harry watches from the shadows, standing behind a pillar not far from the stage
Watching his daughter gyrating in the spotlight
His reaction is hard to read
219
-    - - - as Harry's hand throws the switch
220
-  - The stage is plunged into darkness and the music stops abruptly
Before the band members can react, they hear the big metal doors rolling and sunlight blazes in
Dana stares into the glare, seeing an ominous silhouette standing there
The shadowy figure walks toward them
You
Come with me
The figure comes straight toward Dana
To her horror is turns out to be her dad
Her heart stops
Oh my Gooooood
221
- Harry appears through the doors, marching Dana by the arm
He walks her over to some industrial junk nearby, overgrown with weeds, and sits her down for a talk
She is sullen, still mortified from getting dragged out in front of her friends
There are going to be some changes Dana
You're going to start following some rules
And 'm going to be there to see that you do
Yeah, right
You're going to stay in school
Do you understand
Why
So  can wind up like you
What's the point
You think Harry's going to really rain on her parade
But he doesn't
He becomes very tender
He pushes the hair back from her face
Did  tell you about the time we first met
She looks up at him, puzzled
You were quite young at the time
All wet and still attached to your mom by a cord
You opened your eyes and looked right at me
And  knew then  would always love you with all my heart
Dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness
This is not just some chump that she has to put up with
This is her father
He is a part of her
No matter what happens they are in this thing together
Tears start to run down her cheeks
Somewhere along the way  got lost, honey
forgot about what was really important
'm sorry pump--  mean-- She grabs his in a fierce hug
Harry closes his eyes, letting the moment purify him
Dana, regarding this singing-- She pulls back, suddenly wary
Oh shit
(grinning) You were pretty good
222
/
- Dana sits wedged into the front seat between Gib and Harry
Father and daughter are singing raucously loud, with the windows down
/ 've been waiting so long To be where 'm going In the sunshine of your looooove They crack up after the long sustain
They are both suffused with a glow of rediscovery
Harry pulls the car to the curb in front of Dana's school
Dad, how come you know the words
Honey that song came out in 1968, when  was exactly your age
Unbelievable
Trent told me he wrote it
He's history
223
- The image of a family dinner
Helen is avoiding Harry's eyes
Harry looks over at Dana and she gives him a tiny smile
Then she rises from her half-finished dinner and heads out of the kitchen
'm done
Where are you off to young lady
(pointing toward her room) have a book report
Helen watches her go
That's strange
So last night was pretty exciting, huh
(alarmed) What
(then smoothly--) Oh, the flat tire
Yeah, thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there
Harry smiles, reaching for more chicken
The phone
Helen controls the urge to run to it
Hello
Doris
Oh
Yes
224
- ,   , uses the   to disguise his voice
Listen carefully
Go to the Hotel Marquis in one hour
Pick up an envelope marked Doris at the front desk
And dress sexy
225
- as she reacts to that
What
Get going
() (thinking for a second, then--) Uh
well, okay then
You sound terrible
'll run out right now
Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy
Sure, no problem
Bye
Harry smirks, listening to her lie
She's good
The smirk drops as she turns
Allison is sick in bed
have to go over there, honey
Sure, hon
She walks unhurriedly out of the room
Behind her back, Harry is grinning
The second Helen is out of his sight line, she runs up the stairs
Harry waits a moment then picks up the phone
226
/   -- Gib is in a corner of the electronics lab, in an area dedicated to
The phone in his briefcase rings
Gib answers
You've reached a new low with this one
can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis
Why not
You think  can afford a suite like that on my salary
Is Jean-Claude done yet
* Gib looks over at a    nearby
In it a    * , - is doing voice recording from a hand-  * written page
Not quite

Very slowly

- big luxury hotel downtown, with an opulent lobby
Helen enters, looking different than we have ever seen her
She has been commanded to be sexy, and she is
Her black slinky dress is cut at mid-thigh, showing some good legs we haven't been aware of
She's pulled her hair back and added pearls
Now she looks elegant and hot
Playing the role
230
-   - She goes to the front desk and signals the with her eyes
He comes over to her
Do you have an envelope for Doris
The man nods
Saying nothing, he reaches under the counter and hands her the envelope
She opens it as she walks across the lobby
In contains a room key, a small bugging device, and a phone number
231
- as Helen finishes dialing the number
She scans the lobby as the phone rings-- Listen
You are a prostitute named Michelle
Go to the room
man will be there
He is a suspected arms dealer
Do  have to
you know--
No
He has particular tastes
He likes to watch
You will say his regular girl, Carla, is sick
If he likes you, he will tell you what to do
You must plant the bug near the telephone, by the bed, before you leave
If you do not accomplish your mission, the deal is off
232
/   - Helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward the suite
She stops by a mirror and checks her look
Decides she is too uptown
She pulls the neckline of her dress down so it shows more shoulder, then hitches up the hem
Ditches the pearls
Puts on some red lipstick
Now she doesn't look hot and elegant
just hot
She practices a slinky walk, getting into the role
Suddenly she remembers her wedding ring
She pulls on it
It probably hasn't been off in years
She licks her finger and     * twists it off
Yoww
She puts it on her right hand and turns   * the modest diamond palm-side in
Out of site
Then,     * reading the number off the key, she goes to the room and unlocks the door
233
- Helen comes in hesitantly
The lights are off
The suite is large and richly furnished, with a breathtaking view of the city
It is the room Harry was using, posing as Renquist -  comes from the next room
In here
She goes into the bedroom
There is a dark figure sitting in a chair, just a silhouette
Step into the light
It is a corner room
The drapes on one side are closed, shadowing the man, but open on the other just enough to let in a slash of moonlight
She steps forward into it
on the figure
We can just make out that it is Harry, though Helen cannot
to show his hand, out of sight behind the chair-arm, as he manipulates the pause button on the  tape deck
'm Michelle
Carla's sick
She thought you might like me, so -- Harry goes
Silencing her gently
He silently clicks off the  button
The  recorder plays
Charles Boyer, deep and hypnotic, speaks from Harry's outline
Harry lipsynchs
() Let me do the talking
You are                        * very pretty
You may start by                         * unzipping your dress
button
She starts to yank the zipper down
* () No no
Do it slowly
Very slowly
Helen turns her back to him, and draws the zipper down           * languorously, revealing her creamy back
She is not wearing a   * bra
* () Now slip the dress down
* slowly
Helen is starting to get into the ritual
She lets the dress    * slip off her shoulders
It slides down her body to the floor
* She steps out of it, still in high heels
* () Now slide the nylons off one by one
(puzzled) 'm not wearing any
Harry winces
He starts the next line immediately
() That's good
Now the panties
* The ritual continues as she strips slowly (this will be tastefully done)
She conceals the bugging device in her hand as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone
Helen is still concentrating on her mission
() Now turn, cheri, in the moonlight
Let your body flow like water
She turns
Her skin is beautiful in the silvery light
() Now dance for me
Go on
Helen has no idea what to do, but she improvises quite well
The scrutiny of the shadowed man, who is fully clothed, and her raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic combination
() Let your hands be a lover's hands on your own skin as you move
Yes, that's it
Harry's eyes as he studies her
His game, meant to give her a dangerous fantasy, is actually turning him on mightily
He is amazed to see her playing the role, getting into it
This is not the Helen is thought he knew for sixteen years
() Now, lie on the bed and close your eyes
She does
Harry rises and goes to her, bringing the tape deck
() Keep them closed
Do not open them
He sits on the bed, next to her, but without touching her
He strokes her hair, lovingly
Then runs his fingertips over her eyes, down her cheeks
To her it feels delicate and delicious
Part of her is enjoying this a lot
But Helen is torn between wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so far is enough to cause her to abort her mission
thought you only liked to watch
Harry goes
It's all he can do
He bends over her and brings his lips slowly down to her
He touches them to hers so slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her
Then he takes her in a passionate kiss
And she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and Harry flies off onto the floor, groaning and semiconscious
Helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes, starting to dress rapidly
She still doesn't recognize Harry, who is face down
He groans and starts to rise
She kicks him in the ribs and finishes putting her dress on
She sticks the bug under the night table and grabs her shoes
Mission accomplished, motherfuckers
Harry grabs her ankle
She raises one shoe to kosh him again, and sees who it is
Freezeframe
Total shock
She can't even form the question
Harry--
234
- The door lock is shattered by tremendous force and burst into the room
We may recognize them as workers from Juno's shop
They are wielding pistols and are clearly part of Malik's terrorist brigade
Harry is still groggy, and he doesn't want to start anything with Helen there, and risk her getting shot
He acquiesces as they pull him to his feet
He's got nothing to do with this
It's me you want, right
(to lead ) Let the hooker go
She's not important
Harry, be quiet
Let me handle this
Shutup, both of you
During this exchange, the thugs have handcuffed Harry's hands behind his back
The leader gestures to one of the men to bring Helen along
Helen and Harry are dragged roughly out of the room with pistol-muzzles stuck in their ribs
235
- The door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs
Listen, you don't need him, he's nothing
He's a sales rep for a computer company, really-- The thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up
That was unnecessary
236
-                                       * stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen   * through the basement labyrinth
* What were you doing there
You wouldn't believe me
pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helen's ear
Talk again,  kill you
They are hustled across a loading dock to a   waiting   * with the door open
fourth terrorist slides the van door      * shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel
The van    * takes off
:              * 237                                                             * 238
- The rental van pulls up to a -3  warming up outside a private hanger
The van doors open and the hostages are brought out
Harry sees a long black  pulling up behind the van
The driver, an enormous man names , hurries to open the passenger door
slender pair of ankles emerge, followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly beautiful but now quite sinister
To Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed to kill, approaching them
(with a wry smile) Hello, Harry
Juno
wish  could say it's a pleasure to see you again
You know her
Juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the prisoners toward the plane
Who's your little friend
'm Helen Tasker
Harry's my husband
And you are
(to Harry) So now it's Tasker
Not Renquist
239
-3  - They enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane
Helen has never seen anything like this
Look, Harry's not part of this
He's just a sales rep
No, my dear, he is a federal agent
He killed two of my colleagues the other night
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years-- Look, Juno, this is just some whacko hooker  met in the bar
and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats and strap them in
Harry, what's the matter with you
Tell them the truth
We're married, we have a daughter-- (looking at Helen contemptuously) don't know what this crazy bitch is on
You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Then where did  get this
Helen grabs the locket, dangling on a chain around her neck, and opens it to show Juno
-- Harry and Helen together, smiling
Harry roles his eyes
Great, Helen
walks up carrying a tray
Juno smiles graciously at Helen
Something before take-off
The hostess whips a   off the tray and zaps Helen in the shoulder
Oooowww
That hurt
You biii-- She slumps
Juno looks at Harry
She was telling the truth, wasn't she Harry
She really doesn't know
Interesting
Juno nods and the hostess zaps Harry
He slides into unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to
240
- The -3 lifts into the night sky, turning south
241
- small  is tied up to a half-crumbling pier
Next to the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building, two stories high
There are floodlights on the dock but beyond is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms
It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island in the Caribbean
There is a lot of activity
Three -  are parked by the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles
About thirty men, clearly    are busy at various activities
Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles
is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp- covered object about 15 feet high from the ship
rusting gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse
Malik looks up as an   thunders toward them over the black Caribbean water
The helicopter lands and Juno steps down from the front door
The sliding door is opened and Akbar and the others pull a groggy Harry and Helen out of the aircraft
They are covered by hoods
Malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off
Harry takes in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of Malik
Lethal energy flows between them
Who is this woman
His wife
(seeing the possibilities) His wife
Good
Bring them
242
- Malik leads the entourage into the warehouse, where brilliant floodlights illuminate-- , lined up in the middle of the space
The tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded, revealing a
The figures are cracked and obscured by centuries, but they are unmistakably warriors mounted on horseback
The legs and arms are missing on some, but the massive heads and necks remain
Incredible, aren't they
Warrior figures from the Persian Empire of Darius the First, around 500 call them "The Four Horsemen"
She approaches the nearest figure, caressing its flank
man with a jackhammer steps up to her
They're absolutely priceless
She shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer
He blasts right into the body of one of the Horseman, destroying it
Stone fragments fall away, revealing a cavity cut with great precision inside the figure
Inside is a
Four terrorists pull it out and set it on the ground
It is six feet long and coffin- like
Malik steps up to it, his eyes glistening
hush has fallen over the group
Open it
The latches are released and the lid lifted
Inside is machined metal object, roughly conical, about five feet long
Malik signals to Harry to step closer and look
Do you know what this is
Can you give me a clue
It could be a water heater for all  know
Malik grabs Helen, jerking her roughly forward
He whips out a knife and inserts the point under Helen's jaw, forcing her head back and drawing blood
Do you know why you have been brought here
-no
So that this man can verify to the world that Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power
How can Harry do that
He's a salesman for chrissakes
If we were wrong about him
then the last thing you see will be your blood spraying in his face
Harry steps forward, his face grim
This is a Soviet -Six, from an -22N launch vehicle
The warhead contains 14
5 kilos of enriched uranium, with a plutonium trigger
The nominal yield is 10 kilotons
(in Arabic, subtitled)                            * Release her and 'll cooperate
Malik lowers the knife from her jaw
He turns away from her like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to remove the other weapons
Jackhammers tear into the stone figures
Helen is just staring at Harry, her mouth open
He turns to her, not knowing what to say
He shrugs sheepishly
What can  say
'm a spy
She just looks at him for a long time
She moves closer, staring and staring, letting it sink in
Then she hauls off and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him down
You bastard
You lying son of a bitch
Terrorists grabs her and restrain her
She starts to cry
'm sorry, honey
Don't call me honey
You don't ever get to call me honey again
You understand
You pig
Juno looks at them both and laughs
She offers Helen a tissue
Here you go, dear
, Akbar is going through the contents of Helen's handbag and Harry's wallet
He rips open the bottom stitching and pulls out the geo-positioning transmitter
Abu
Look at this
* Malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor
Helen looks at the crushed transmitter
She stares at Harry with dawning realization
You bugged me
Juno cracks up at this
243
- The jet has become a mobile tactical-command center, with Gib,   * Faisil, and several other agents working out of portable         * equipment cases
Faisil looks up from a computer screen         * suddenly
* We've lost the signal
Gib, who has been pacing the aisile whirls to the screen
* Son of a bitch
Where
* It's an island in the Keys, out                        * past Marathon
* Gib goes up to the cockpit
They are on approach and the lights of Miami fill the front window
Miami , we are on final
Call our  contact, tell him want those choppers flight-ready the second we land
244
-    - of the terrorists' handycam
Harry is speaking directly into the camera, finishing up his message
and  can verify that they have the arming box and all                            * equipment necessary to detonate the four warheads
This is absolutely the real thing, gentlemen
The camera swings off Harry to Malik, standing before the rest of the Jihad warriors, who are assembled behind the four bombs
You have killed our women and                          * children, bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and dare to call us terrorists-- Over the image of Malik, a - warning begins to flash
, as Malik speaks into the camera, which is head by one of his men
The  is sweating, wondering if he should interrupt
He gulps nervously as Malik drones on
-- But now the Oppressed have                          * been given a mighty sword, to                          * strike back at their enemies
* Unless the  pulls all military forces out of the Persian Gulf area, immediately and forever, Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major  city each week until these demands are met
warning flashing faster
First one weapon will be detonated on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of Crimson Jihad's power and our willingness to be humanitarian
However, if there demands are not-- In a burst of static the image
The cameraman nervously lowers the camera, ashen faced
Malik's eyes are black with murder
Battery, Abu
Get another one, you moron
245
- filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse)
few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no glass in the windows
Harry and Helen are brought in by two Juno follows then into the bleak room
Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs
enters the room carrying a small suitcase
He has skull- like features
He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view of the contents:  medical instruments, needle-probes, drills, Dremel tools with saw blades
This is Samir
See if you can guess his specialty
Oral hygiene
Not exactly
(scared) What's going on, Harry
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions
See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for
Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years
So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist
(holding up a syringe) This will help
Samir injects Harry in the arm with the syringe
You know, you should swab that with alcohol
might get an infection
* 'll return when this has taken                        * effect
Then we'll talk
* * 'm looking forward to it
* Samir exits
* * Why are you helping these raving psychotics
Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics, and 'm getting a lot of money
She kneels down in front of Harry, stroking his leg
You think  care about their                           * cause
Or yours
Not at all
* See, America is on top now
* but so was Rome, once
All                         * civilizations crumble
One nation succeeding over another
What does it mean in the long run
The only important thing is to live well
And
living                          * well takes money
* You're damaged goods, lady
Harry's words are beginning to be slightly slurred
The drugs are taking effect
(indicating Helen) Did you tell her about us, Harry
There is no us, you psychotic bitch
Sure
Say that now
Juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately
She breaks, looking at Helen to savor the effect
Helen is trembling with rage
Thanks for everything, Harry
It was good while it lasted
Juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his belt
Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees
She pushes Helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the grenade then pulls the pin
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine
Something you obviously have a hard time doing
Hold that thought
Juno leaves
Harry looks dopily at Helen
There was nothing
swear
Helen doesn't believe him, and why should she
She looks up     * from staring at the grenade, to see that Harry's head has slumped forward
What did he give you
(groggy) Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent
It makes you tell the truth
Yes
Is it working yet
Ask me a question  would normally lie to
Are we going to die
Yup
* * 'd say it's working
* They'll either torture us to death, shoot us in the head, or leave us until the bomb goes off
* Okay, okay
get it
How long                       * have you been a spy, Harry
17 years
My God
Have you had to
have sex with other women in the line of duty
don't take those assignments
What about Juno
She's really a fox, isn't she
Did you pork her Harry
No
(pause) But  wanted to
(crying) Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry
Looks that way
246
- as he pokes through Harry and Helen's stuff on the table
He picks up Helen's wallet and opens it
- a picture of Harry, Helen and Dana
Malik stares at it a moment
Then motions to one of his men
267
- Samir lifts Harry's head and sees that he is pretty shitfaced
Is there anything you would like to tell me before we start
Yes
'm going to kill you pretty soon
(calmly preparing his instruments) see
How exactly
Well,  thought 'd break your neck, then use you as a human shield, then kill the guard with that knife there on your table and take his gun
Samir approaches Harry with a long steel needle probe
(humoring Harry) And what makes you think you can do all that
Because  picked the lock on these handcuffs
He holds them up to show Samir
Then he explodes out of the chair-- Breaks the torturer's neck-- Spins him between himself and the guard-- Who then hesitates to fire-- Giving Harry the split second he needs to grab the knife from the table and throw it into the guard's eye, killing him instantly
Helen is flat blown away
Wow
It only took a few seconds for Harry to reverse the situation
Her Harry
He picks up the guard's 9mm pistol and staggers over to her
Don't move
He kneels down in front of her
Gently he slips his hands between her thighs, getting a grip on the grenade, then sliding his fingers slowly over the spoon to hold it securely
He stops moving, suddenly
She realizes with a sudden jolt of terror that he has frozen
What is it
(staring transfixed) God, you have great legs
Harry
snap out of it
She sees how shitfaced he is
He holds the grenade up, gripped safely so the spoon can't fly off
Go it, baby
248
- Harry and Helen emerge from the building, creeping through the shadows
She stops him for a second
Gets very close to him, whispering, crouched in the shadows
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again
What
Do you still love me
Yes
As much as you used to
No
(she deflates) Much more
She looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth
* (grinning)                                        * It wore off
At that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block building
They found the bodies
Come on-- 249
- Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of the mangrove swamp
, running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees
The trunks explode     * with bullet hits as they run through the darkness
* As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from  * the shadows and grabs one from behind
He wrests his rifle      * away and swings it at the other, knocking his  down
The      * first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner
Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two- hand neck-breaker--
Two more run around the corner of a building
Harry stomps his  * foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log
It    * flips into the air and he catches it in firing position
* and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts
Helen comes   * out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement
His shirt is ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle   * expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal
* married Rambo
* He grabs her and kisses her passionately
Let's go
250 thru                                                             * 253 254
- on the activity below the four horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the floorspace
rental truck is being loaded with conventional weapons, including machine guns and several - One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit cut in the concrete floor
Malik and most of the terrorists are gathered around it
,
on the catwalk, watches intently from the railing
So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on him
Harry catches the guard's -10 machine pistol before it can hit the floor
He and Helen crouch behind a steel pillar, watching the proceedings below
Helen keeps glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment before by her husband
It is all surreal
,  is shouting in his native language
He pulls a chain from around his neck and holds up a
Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's arming computer
Harry is listening intently, translating for Helen
In ninety minutes a pillar of                          * holy fire will rise at this place                      * as a sign to out enemies
* (Malik theatrically turns the arming key) It is done
Malik jumps out of the pit
He signals and terrorists pour concrete into the pit, covering the bomb
He begins ranting again
Now no man can stop us
We are set on our course
No force can stop us
(as libbing) we're cool, we're badass, blah blah
255
-   - Malik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans
The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns in the air
Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all over the inside of the metal building
Malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work at double time
They are loading warheads Two and Three onto trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside
256
-   - If we're on an island, why are they using trucks
We must be in the Florida Keys
* the Overseas Highway                             * connects the islands to the mainland
* So there's no border, no customs
* They can just drive anywhere they                      * want
there's nothing to                       * stop them
Just us
What are you going to do
(shrugs, like: what do you think
) Go down there and kill everybody, guess
He hands her the -10
She holds it clumsily
Oh shit
Wait here
If you have to use this, use it
Don't choke
Okay
She nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the floor below
257
-   - , reaching the floor
He slips behind some packing crates
Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard as he can, down to the other end of the building
He uses the distraction to move forward
But it goes wrong almost right away
comes around a corner behind him, shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him, with guns raised
(to Helen) 258
-  - fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one
But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the gun It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off
--
The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10 cartwheels and hits further down
Another terrorist is splattered
It spins and hits another step-- She has inadvertently saved her husband
Harry looks up from behind cover-- to see all seven dead
Now it's his turn to be amazed
He signals to her to run
get off the exposed catwalk
She makes it through the door to the outside stairs as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her
259
-   - with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry
Harry snatches up a jack-hammer and ---- Drives it into the guy's chest
Then he-- Grabs an  from one of the fallen terrorists and opens fire
Malik shouts to the drivers of the trucks to get going
The other terrorists return fire at Harry-- Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door-- 260
- --landing outside
He takes cover behind an aircraft Not a good place
He is pinned down by automatic weapons fire
He looks around for Helen, who is-- 261
-    - 50 yards away
She is unarmed and unable to help
262
-     - cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the nozzle of the hose
He opens the flow and--  stream of - blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his  right across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach
Harry, lit demonically by the inferno, paints the whole area, setting vehicles afire, and scattering the terrorists
263
- Through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand Malik a  rocket
Malik snaps it to his shoulder, preparing to fire
264
- Harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as-- fires
The rocket shoots toward the truck and-- Harry leaps toward the dark water as--
Behind him the gas truck
265
-    - , , dives down
An instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across the surface above him
Harry kicks hard, trying to swim beyond the inferno above him so he can surface
266
- , watching the burning wreckage of the gas truck
Oh my God
Harry
Its muzzle taps the back of her head
She gasps and turns to see-- , holding the weapon expertly
My condolences to the window
* Juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet
Helen        * Juno has a slash across her cheek
Blood trickles down
* She grabs Helen's hand and viciously turns it, seeing the        * wedding ring turned inward, the diamond on the palm-side
Her   * face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helen's face,   * preparing to kill her
* And Malik's hand grabs her wrist, stopping her
* * Not now
We may need a hostage
* Juno grabs her and twists her around, pushing her toward the     * limo nearby
* Let's go, Suzy Homemaker
267
- Harry is still swimming
He reaches the edge of the fire and surfaces, gasping for breath
Treading water he scans the dock
268
- '  - Amid the fire and smoke, he sees Juno walking Helen at gun point toward a
269
- , approaching the car
Malik passes, jumping  * into the Aerospatiale with his few remaining men
The fourth    * bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed
The      * copter pulls pitch, fanning the flames of the inferno below as   * it arcs away
, the 300 pound terrorist/chauffeur opens the door and      * Juno gets into the limo with Helen
Akbar scrunches into the front seat and starts the car

- There is just enough light to see some geography
The island is very tiny
Running right over it and to the horizon in both directions is the
The terrorists' trucks rumble up an on-ramp past a sign that says  - 110
The limo is the last member of the convoy
The Aerospatiale passes overhead, hugging the deck, headed for Miami at 150 knots
271
/  - It looks like the aftermath of a battle
burning wreckage, black smoke, bodies
Not a living soul around
The smoke swirls as two big  206  settle on the middle of the dock
jumps out of the nearest with an -15, scanning the wreckage
Several of his men, and a couple of  agents, spread out
Gib breaks into a grin as he sees-- , materializing out of the swirling smoke
Dripping wet, clothes ripped and bloody
But okay
thought this look like your work
Let's go
'll brief you in the air
You're welcome
272
206 - Gib and Harry are working out of brief-case mobile com-units
Several Omega agents with headsets are reading maps, giving commands, coordinating the evacuation, mobilizing their own forces
The energy is controlled but very high, everybody talking at once
This is the day they all have trained for
It is impressive to watch
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert
Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert
And  need a patch of the White House
That's right-- (overlapping) the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius
Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately-- Gib whips around to Harry, lowering his headset mike
can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes
They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica
(checking his watch) Get 'em
'll brief them on the way in
273
- on the two causeways is almost non-existent this early in the morning
The three rental trucks, followed by the limo about a mile back, are almost the only vehicles
274
- Juno has a 9mm pistol aimed at Helen
She opens the sunroof, letting in the morning air and light
Then pours herself a Scotch from the bar
Like one
(eyes like steel) Fuck you
275
206  - are both talking a mile a minute, coordinating the evacuation of the highway and the surrounding area
well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers
Just the basics
get away from windows, don't look at it
yeah-- Here they come
Gib looks out the window in time to see-- hunch-winged
jets pass them at 600 knots
(to the pilots) Roger, Mike Three Five, you are cleared to engage
Be advised, your targets have Stingers and light machine guns
276
- The pilot, like all jet pilots, seems icy calm
Copy that, Bright Boy command
(to his wingman) Tally ho
277
- The terrorists see the Harriers approaching on a low attack run, and scramble to get out their Stingers
The Harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the trucks below
The 20mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of the causeway into plumes of spray
278
-   - One of the Bomb trucks is hit
It explodes and flies off the    * bridge into the water
The terrorists on one of the other trucks fire a Stinger missile
279
-   - It arrows up, blowing one wing off the lead Harrier
The pilot ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes
280
206  - Harry sees the battle far ahead
the exploding jet
(to the pilots) Recommend you use your Mavericks                       * to take out the bridge
* () They won't set off those nukes will they
Negative, Mike Three Five
That's a negative
(low, to Gib) Probably not
281
/  - The two remaining Harriers make an attack run, launching four    * Maverick missiles at the bridge
* 282
- The missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and    * -
whole section of the concrete span        * collapses into the water
283
-  - The first truck is consumed in the blast
The last truck        * slides to the edge of the gap and stops
* 284
/
- Juno is trying to see what's going on ahead
All they can see is smoke and explosions
Akbar is speaking heatedly (in Arabic) into a walky talky and getting no answer
Helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward, grabbing the gun
Juno fires wildly as they struggle for control of the weapon
The sound is deafening in the tiny space
The second shot catches Akbar behind the ear, and he slumps forward
His foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal and the car surges faster
285
/   - The third Harrier fires its 2
75 Rockets and blows the           * remaining truck into tinfoil
Battle over
Two bombs down
286
206  - The columns of smoke from the battle are still a couple miles ahead of the copter
Good shooting, Mike Three Five
need you to stay on station
(to the copter pilot)                             * Okay
You see that limo
287
/
-  -                                   * tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one guardrail to the other, throwing sheets of sparks where it hits
In is funneling along the causeway, unslowed, like an out- of-control-train
288
- , Helen knocks Juno's hands against the edge of the open sunroof and the pistol goes flying out
You
bitch
Helen is raging, grabbing Juno's head and pounding it against anything hard she can find inside the car
Suddenly she stops, looking out the front window
Juno turns too, off her look, to see--
The causeway is blown away about a quarter mile ahead
Shit
Juno climbs through the window into the front seat, tugging on the dead driver
The heavyset Akbar is like a bag of cement
Helen look up through the sunroof and sees-- 289
- 206 , descending rapidly
Harry is climbing out onto the skids
He hooks on arm and leg over the skid and hangs down as low as he can
stands up in the opening and waves her arms
290
/
/  - Gib is yelling at the  pilot, who's not thrilled with this idea
Get lower, goddamnit
Right now
Harry strains downward with one hand
Helen reaches up toward him
The car screeches along the guard-rail, slamming against it, throwing her from side to side in the sunroof
Their fingers touch, then separate
She looks-- the limo is almost on the precipice
291
- , Juno is desperately pulling on the inert driver
He slumps over on her, pinning her
She looks over the dash as the shattered edge of the causeway rushes toward them-- 292
- '  grabs Helen's
He pulls her out of the car just as the limo clears the edge
She is jerked through the sunroof, screaming
The car falls away, arcing gracefully to the ocean below
It hits with an enormous explosion of water
293
/
206  - up onto the skid with him, getting her stable
She is gasping, holding on for dear life
She looks down at the ocean, the burning wreckage on the bridge, the whole unbelievable panorama
Then she looks at Harry and-- Grins
She's alive
And so is he
And not only that, this is the biggest rush of her life
Harry grins back
Surprised and pleased that she is more of a soul-mate than he ever knew
: 294
- , landing in full-hover on the causeway
The shriek of the jet engine is enormous
It bounces down onto its wheels like a big inscect
The other remaining Harrier is already down, behind it
295
206 - past burning wreckage to Harry's Bell 206 just settling on the highway
the other  Bell 206 is landing with the Harrier pilot who ejected hanging in a sling
Harry jumps out of the open door, followed by Helen and Gib
* Harry looks at his watch
* Any minute now
(with a megaphone/ to everybody) It's show time
Don't look at                         * the flash
Do not look at the flash
* (to Helen)                                        * We're safe here
* 296
- Helen and Harry move away from the agents
They are safe and together
They look at each other, and there is nothing to say
Harry removes her wedding band from the wrong hand and     * slips it back onto its rightful finger
* He leans forward to kiss her
She reaches for him
Their lips  * meet
297
-    - And they are locked together in that position when the sky lights up behind them
Talk about fireworks
Harry covers her  * eyes and they stay in the kiss
* They are in no danger, but the effect is stunning
The classic  * mushroom cloud appears at the horizon
Helen watches, awed, the most glorious and terrifying sight of our age
* That was some kiss
* The two young Harrier pilots stand nearby, watching the mushroom disperse
Gib is with the other Omega agents, his finger pressed in his ear, listening to his headset
He waves to Harry to come to him
Harry detaches from Helen and walks over to him
Helen watches him go
back to work
She glances over at the two Harrier pilots
(to the pilots) That's my husband
goes into the huddle with Gib and the others
Malik's copter landed twenty minutes ago in Miami
He's on the top of a high-rise downtown
's on the scene, and  got the cops sealing off the area
* He renezvous'd there with about                        * a dozen more faction members
* They're barricaded on the                              * twentieth floor
(he gets very serious)                            * Harry, they have a hostage
It's                      * Dana
* * My Dana
They must have grabbed her during the night
we didn't know
Sorry, Harry, -- 298
- But Harry is already moving
He sprints toward the nearest Harrier, witch is idling nearby
Gib runs after him
Harry
We'll get her out
We                         * have a man inside already
* Harry
Aw, shit
here we go
Harry walks up to the young pilot
need to borrow this thing for a few minutes
He pushes past the pilot before the guy can react
Excuse me
sir
* * Force Comm cleared you to give us                      * total cooperation, right
* * Yessir, but
* * That's coming right from the                           * President, Captain
* * Yessir
Uh
sir
You're                      * going to have to sign for the                          * aircraft
* * 'll sign for it
You got a pen
* (one of the agents                                * pulls out a pen)                                 * Here, he'll sign for it
* Harry is in the cockpit by now
Gib climbs up
* 'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these
If  break it they can take it out of my pay
299
- Harry doesn't have a -suit or a helmet of anything
He just has his walky on his belt
, Harry looks around for the lever which vectors the thrust
Finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees (vertical)
He bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle up to
(to pilot) It'll be fine
He's got hundreds of hours in Harriers
Joint-ops, cross-training and all that
Harry can fly anything
The big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble-bee
He's a little rusty
It's like riding a bicycle
you never forget
Uh
'd seek shelter
It drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way
At about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar
It lifts unsteadily straight into the sky
It turns around 180
He's got it
Sorry
Harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust-nozzles turn, accelerating the plane forward
300
- Gib is standing, watching Harry go
He never believes this guy
Harry's voice comes over the walky
Tell Helen what's going on
Tell her  love her
And ask the pilot where the button for the 20mm cannon is-- never mind found it
The plane disappears toward Miami
301
-  - , circling the building
It is an unfinished building in the high rise district
The Aerospatiale sits on the roof, its rotor turning slowly
The street below is jammed with cars
Honking horns echo up the glass canyons
302
- as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter two blocks away
303
- the terrorists have barricaded themselves on the twentieth floor
There are 12 , all with automatic weapons
Occasionally one of them will fire a burst down a stairwell with an -47
Miami-Dade  team members are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance
304
-   21ST  - Malik is sequestered with the bomb
It sits on the floor, still in its shipping case
Dana stands nearby, looking scares
She is not ties up
Where can she go
She watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key
He has a  set up on some crates, and we see that his video- tapes demands are running on
Harry's face fills the screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat
He is identified at the bottom of the screen as  , Dana stares at her father's face on the national news
It's like a bad dream
She has been crying but she is fairly composed now
have to go to the bathroom
The terrorists ignore her
terrified and his , under guard by  , are hastily setting up to shoot Malik
Tape is rolling
This is a communique from Crimson Jihad
You have heard from your own expert
You have seen the Holy fire with your own eyes
Do not force us to destroy this city
And do not try to use force against us
can trigger this bomb instantly
All  have to do is turn that key
(he points fiercely at the bomb) and five million of your people will die
The reporter glances down, nervously
What key
(pointing like the guy's blind) That key right there
Malik looks down
The key is gone
(to his men) Someone has stolen the key
He turns, looking around wildly
Malik then sees Dana running for the stairwell to the roof
He pulls a pistol and shoots at her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door
He runs after her
305
/  - , Malik bursts through the stairwell door
His have followed him
Malik stops suddenly when he sees-- Dana standing at the edge of the roof
She is holding the by its chain
Dangling it over the edge
He signals to his men not to fire
(terrified, but thinking) You shoot me, this'll fall
Malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally
She backs up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof
Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest
Don't come any closer
'll drop it
swear to God
If you drop it,  will have no reason not to kill you
He advances, calling her bluff
She backs away from him along the edge
Come on, child
Give me the key
(smiling) Don't you want to live
give you my word
No way you whacko
She reaches the corner of the building
Her back touches something
it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting building supplies
Careful to keep the key dangling over open space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off Malik
She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly
Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her
He knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun
It is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom
Dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better
It is windy and the boom is swinging
306
20TH  - The Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar and look toward the window
307
- ,     ,
It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet outside
The terrorists raise their -47s to fire just as Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon
308
/
- 20TH  - Glass explodes into glittering mist, and terrorists explodes into bloody spray as Harry pivots the plane and the cannon sweeps the floor clear from side to side
The Crimson Jihad is vaporized
309
-   - Malik hears the thunder of the jet and the firing, but from where he is he can't see what's going on
He focuses on the key
He must have that key
310
-   - Malik's    run to the helicopter, gesticulating to the pilot to get ready to take off
The pilot revs the turbine and the rotor whirls faster
The two men jump in, picking up -60 machine guns
311
-   - out the crane boom
Dana slips as she backs up, toppling off the boom
She is hanging now by her hands over a 20 story drop
Malik is almost to her
He needs a hand free to grab her
He sets his gun down on the girder
He grabs for her wrist
312
-   - Malik, Dana, the street far below
With an unbelievable roar the Harrier sweeps in beneath Dana, 313
/   - Harry has the canopy up
Malik sees Harry, ten feet below
His eyes narrow with an all-consuming rage
He glances at the pistol on the beam
Back at the girl, the key in her teeth-- So close
Harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under Dana
(shouting) Let go baby
've got you
Daddy's got you
314
/  - Malik lunges for her wrist
She screams and lets go-- Dana drops and hits the windshield of the hovering jet-- Harry grabs her with his left hand, right hand still on the stick-- He holds her until she can get a grip
She is lying across the nose of the plane
Harry starts to bank away and-- 315
- Malik shrieks in rage
He grabs his 9mm pistol and leaps off the crane-- 316
- Onto the back of the plane
He starts crawling toward the cockpit
Dana screams and Harry looks back, but just then-- 317
- The Aerospatiale swings around the building right in front of them-- The door-gunner
318
- Harry banks hard, taking the hits under the wing
He pivots and slides sideways around the building, playing tag with the copter
He can't do anything radical enough to dislodge Malik without tossing off his own daughter
319
- The helicopter appears around the corner, guns blazing in the doors
Harry pivots the plane and
The helicopter is riddled
It tilts and plummets, auto-rotating out of control
320
-    - As the copter hits the ground and explodes
Fortunately the police had created a cleared perimeter
321
- dips and slews, half out of control
Malik is taking aim with the pistol, right at Harry's head
Harry grabs his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his strength and he-- Jinks the stick hard, just as-- Malik opens fire, but-- The plane tilts wildly and Malik topples, screaming-- He slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge-- Only to catch himself on the only available hand-hold-- The last Sidewinder missile
322
/  - Harry and Malik lock eyes for one long second
Then Harry hits the
The Sidewinder drops away and ignites
Carrying Malik out over Miami Beach
It explodes a mile out to sea
323
-  - into the cockpit, settling her on his lap
Don't touch the stick, baby
She stares at her father in amazement
He banks away from the building, accelerating the jet
He grins at her
Raises one eyebrow
Woggles the plane's wings
Hi, pumpkin
324
- Dinner at home, and everybody's there
We come in on the end of some story that everybody thinks is hysterical
you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce
He looked like such a dope
told the guy--- (snorts, it's too funny) told the guy, this isn't even my order
Dana is laughing too, a part of it
They are happy
They are a family
Dana gets up, her meal half-eaten as usual
'm done
She heads for the front door
seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow
( busted) Dad
You just think you know everything, don't you
Dana trudges off to her room to do her homework
The phone rings
Helen answers
Boris and Doris
(calmly, signalling Harry with her eyes) Go ahead
325
- It is a black tie affair
Very glitzy
over the guests, sipping champagne and dancing
It is an embassy crowd, very international
work their way through the crowd
He is in tux, hair slicked back, looking rakish
She is elegant in a low-cut gown and diamond choker
Harry scoops two glasses of champagne off a passing tray and hands her one
326
- , hunches in a dark van someplace nearby
He speaks into his headset mike
So, what's the scoop, team
You see your contact yet
327
- smile and nod as if they know people
Speaking very low, Helen answer Gib via - transceiver
Not yet
But we'll find him
Dance
He whirls her across the floor and the as they dance
