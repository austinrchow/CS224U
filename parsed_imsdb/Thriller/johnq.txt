She steps on the gas
She's in the wrong lane and can't get over
There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard

And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs
She cuts the wheel hard, but too late
The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end

The  cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction

John
bursts onto the porch to find a tow truck parked in front of his house
are winching a hook and cable to a ten year old Chevy
Hey, what the hell are you doing
#1 What does it look like
Aw, come on
That's my car

That's not what the bank says
The truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in

Sorry, Reverend
No time for saving souls today
Big game
Have you been saying your prayers like we talked about
Does praying for a job count
Work on him, will you, Denise
He's hopeless
No one's hopeless
Good luck
The Pastor waves as John grabs Denise by the hand and they run to the truck and hop in

Cars, vans, pick-ups, "dualies" take off, tires spinning, everybody whooping and hollering

In the bleachers, John, Denise, Jimmy Palumbo, and his wife, , cheer on the home team
The wives are really loud

The Dodger pitcher stretches, fires a fastball
The batter takes the pitch
Ball four

The pitcher smokes one down the middle
Mike swings
Nothing but air
That's okay, Mikey
Put the bat on the ball
The pitcher burns one on the outside corner
Strike two
Hey, ump, you're blind
hate this pitcher
How old is he, anyway
He's supposed to be twelve
Twelve, my ass
Look at him
His beard just grew an inch between pitches
Don't let him rattle you, Mikey
Wait for your pitch
The catcher flashes fingers
The pitcher nods and fires
Mike hits a sharp ground ball between first and second
The second baseman moves over but doesn't have the angle
The first baseman charges the ball, scoops it on the run, then underhands it to the Dodger pitcher, who gallops off the mound towards first
Mike's foot hits the bag at exactly the same time the ball plops in the pitcher's outstretched glove
No way
He was out
Tie goes to the runner, son
As the Dodger pitcher argues with the umpire, the Oriole player on third base darts towards home
The Dodger pitcher wheels around and fires
Too late, the runner scores
Saaaaaffee
Seeing an opening, Mike races from first to second, arms pumping, breathing hard
The Dodger shortstop sees Mike, races to the base and calls for the throw
Second base
The Dodger catcher throws off his mask and fires the ball
, slowing, suddenly clutching his chest, gulping for air, ten feet from the base
The ball lands in the shortstop's glove
Mike wobbles, doubles over and falls face first into the dirt
The Dodger shortstop stands over Mike
He can't decide if he should tag him
Players, spectators look on dazed, shocked

Room 6
- Maguire helps
lower Mike onto an examination table, and immediately several emergency technicians start applying the resuscitation equipment
Their movements are swift and precise
blood pressure cuff is wrapped around Mike's arm, an oxymeter to the tip of his finger, and sensors are stuck all over his chest
The

He was running
Next thing we know he keels over
Anything like this ever happen before
Never
No, ma'am
Never
Pulse is seventy-eight percent
Let's get him on some oxygen
Maguire reaches for the Oxygen tank, lays the mask over Mike's nose, turns the screw
As Mike inhales the hissing air, Klein turns Mike on his side, probes his lung and lower back areas
He's going to be alright, isn't he
The lungs are wet and his liver feels enlarged

Maguire moves to the counter, finds an
needle, fills it with Digoxin
What's the matter with him
Just then, another
charges in
Klein "eyes" the nurse who immediately picks up on the look
Mr
and Mrs
Archibald, would you come with me
What
He's in good hands
Please, there's a few procedures we need to go over
What kind of procedures
The
gently takes
's elbow
pushes her hand away
We're going to be admitting your son, sir
You'll need to fill out the proper forms
For godsakes, can't the forms wait
John and Denise watch helplessly as Maguire stabs an
needle into Mike's vein
Please, Mr
and Mrs
Archibald
It's possible your son may need a transfusion
We'll need to test you both for blood types
The
edges them out as , the divider curtain is pulled shut
- and Denise are escorted by the
to the admitting desk
Arms bent, fists clenched, they're pressing sterilized gauze pads to their inner elbow joints
First name, Mr
Archibald
John
The admitting nurse's fingers glide over the computer keyboard, inputting all vital info
Middle initial
Quincy
And the name of your insurance company
(
) John
spins and sees Jimmy and Gina rushing through the
doors
Where is he, is he okay
don't know
They're running tests
We're waiting to find out
What can we do
Gina throws her arms around Denise, consoling her
Your card, Mr
Archibald
Huh
Your insurance card
'll need to make a copy for our files
pulls out his wallet, fumbles for his card, hands it to the admitting nurse
- and Denise walk past rows of quiet, glassed-in rooms full of patients and life-support machines
They enter Mike's room to find , a twenty-four year old nurse, hooking Mike up to the high monitor above the bed
Mike is lying supine, awake but groggy, hooked up to a heart monitor,  drips, hideous plastic tubes up his nose, down his throat, on full inotropic support
Denise leans over, kisses Mike
Hi, sweetheart
Hey, slugger, how are you doing
Mike smiles weakly, struggles to speak, points to the tubes
can't
talk
Relax, buddy
Get some rest
Mike closes his eyes
He's really out of it
(') love you, kid
Denise reacts to all the flashing numbers on the monitors
What's all this
This is so we can monitor Mike's vitals
Respiratory rate
Pulse oximetry
Heart rate
And this one is blood pressure
Diastolic and systolic
Reggie points to a bank of monitors
In the middle is a flashing number 88
(') We'd like this top number to stay above ninety, but between eighty-five and ninety is acceptable for now
Anything less than eighty is dangerous
If his blood pressure drops, we're going to have to do something
We can't have him going below seventy again
What would that mean
Seventy and below, he's in heart failure
Reggie exits
and Denise watch the blood pressure monitor, holding steady at 88
Plink
Suddenly, the number drops a notch to 87

- Eight members Hope Memorial Hospital's administrative staff are seated at a long conference table
Among them are
, mid-40's,  , Hope Memorial Hospital's Administrative Supervisor, and Dr
Marjorie Klein
The father works part-time
Mother's a cashier in a supermarket
how's the family's insurance
She shakes her head - "we've got a problem
" Payne sees
and Denise enter and she is immediately on her feet
Ah, Mr
and Mrs
Archibald
Rebecca Payne, hospital director
This is Doctor Turner, head of our cardiology department
How's our boy doing
Please sit down
John and Denise sit, and the lights are dimmed
Dr
Turner approaches an illuminated display of -rays
He uses a pointer to clarify
This -ray is that of a normal, nine year old heart
This one is your son's
John
and Denise stare nervously at the fleshy fist-sized organs on the translucent glass
(') There are septal defects here, here, and here, which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema, and malignant ventricular ectopy
As you can see, Mike's heart is approximately three times normal size
He points to Mike's heart, huge in comparison
'm sorry
don't understand
Could you pout that in layman's terms
Of course
Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs
Sort of like a sponge getting wet
Mike's heart is trying, but 'm afraid it's working too hard
So what's he need
An operation
Turner gathers himself, takes off his glasses
'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr
and Mrs
Archibald
Your son's heart is useless
He is going to need a transplant
The room goes silent
He's nine
Wait a second
There are other options
What options
To do nothing
Medicate him
Keep him as comfortable as possible
You need to start thinking about quality of life now
don't understand
We were just with him
He seemed fine
He's going to seem fine
But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up
know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left
You might want to make it a happy time
Say goodbye
Oh my God
And transplantation is a high risk operation
You could lose your son on the table
You may not want to take that chance
What do you think, Dr
Turner
This isn't my decision
know that
'm asking for your opinion
Without surgery, how long does he have
Not long
Months
Weeks
Days
This is too much for Denise
She breaks into tears
John puts his arms around her, steadies her, gathers his thoughts
What would you do if it was your son
Mr
Archibald
Not you
Him
'd do the transplant
Absolutely
looks at Denise, who nods
Okay
Let's do it
The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list
Once he does, his chances are very good
Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand
With -positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away
It's not that simple
There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr
Archibald
The cost of transplant surgery is expensive
In most cases, prohibitively so
've got major medical
Don't worry, 'm covered
Actually, we've already checked with your carrier
There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude
There must be some kind of mistake
My son is covered
've got full medical
He's covered
What about you, Mrs
Archibald
Do you have coverage
No
've only been working at the market a short time
You need to be there two years before you get benefits
Payne flips through the Archibald family file
see that you don't own your own home
No investments, stocks, bonds
And you have a little over one thousand in savings
Did you hear what  said
'm telling you, 'm insured
That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that
In the meantime, 'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account
How much does a transplant cost
Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum
What are you saying
If  don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son
We have treated him
We continue to treat him
Now  understand how upset you are, sir
But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly
If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice
But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients
We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list
What kind of down payment
Thirty percent
Seventy-five thousand
Seventy-five thousand dollars to put my kid's name on a list
Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money
Yes, it takes money to provide health service
It's expensive for you and for us
My job is to keep this program alive
For everyone
Now, 'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list
- -
- and Denise move down the hallway towards the elevators
(
) Mr
and Mrs
Archibald
They turn
You don't want to treat my kid
Fine
'll take him over to County Memorial
Trust me
You don't want to do that
don't, huh
Watch me
It's a county hospital
They have to treat him
No they don't
Transplantation is always considered an elective procedure
This hospital's politics are particularly infuriating, but you're in the right place
Believe me
You want Dr
Turner
His bedside manner is terrible, but he's one of the foremost surgeons in the country
What do you want us to do
You heard Payne
We're a cash account
know it's outrageous, but don't give up
Talk to your insurance company
Check with our Human Resources Department for medical assistance, State Children's Services, Medicaid
Just don't take no for an answer
-    - John sits in a cubicle across from his employer's insurance representative
You coverage has changed, Mr
Archibald
Changed
We've recently switched carriers from a  to an
It's a less expensive policy, but unfortunately it has some restrictions
What kind of restrictions
This is how it works
Non-management, part-time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage
But 'm not part-time
'm a full-time employee
It's just slow right now
Sure
But your coverage is based on house worked
Like  said, you only qualify for second tier, and that has a maximum payout limit of twenty-thousand dollars
Wait a minute
've been paying for my coverage for years
You take it out of my paycheck every week
And that's why we're going to cover you for the full twenty
Let me get this straight
You drop me from full-time to part-time, switch carriers, and now you're telling me 'm not fully covered even though  have a policy that says  am
Doesn't seem right, does it
No, sir
It doesn't
My son is very sick
If 'm not covered, 've got a serious problem
understand that, but there's nothing  can do
You might want to try State Services
Either that, or you can file an appeal
Yeah
The insurance rep pushes a stack of papers towards
Here are the forms
It'll take about seven working days
- and Denise at a window counter, talking to a  , who only knows what's on the computer screen in front of her
Says here you already have medical insurance
Not enough
What little we have is already used up
understand that
But then you don't qualify
We only give assistance to patients without coverage
Are you on Welfare
No
You should be on Welfare
Welfare
We both have jobs
Oh, that's too bad
Sorry,  can't help you
Try
- county worker flips through
's paperwork
It says here your son's condition is congenital
Yeah
Not congenitive
So what
What's the difference
Big difference
It means it's a pre existing condition, one your son was born with
birth defect
Obviously, it pre-dates your coverage
Otherwise we could help
That's impossible
He's had clean check ups every year
don't know what to tell you
It's right here in the report
Have you tried Medicaid
- Another state run facility
Another employee
Another excuse
No
No, what
You don't qualify
Don't qualify
've got a kid who's dying and 'm broke
If  don't qualify, who does
Lower your voice, sir
mean, what do you guys do, anyway
Why does this service even exist

An appeal is for an already existing claim

You'll have to resubmit
But that could take up to thirty days
don't have thirty days
know that
And, frankly, 'm tired of getting the runaround
need my son's name on that list
Mr
Archibald, your hospital bill is in excess of thirty thousand dollars
So far, we haven't received any kind of payment
We have bent over backward to help you
Oh, is that right
Yes, sir, that is right
But there is a limit to this hospital's generosity
Once and for all, you are not covered by insurance
We will need to guarantee payment
You want money
Alright, 'll get you your money

Thanks for seeing us
So, what can  do you for
My son, Mike, went into heart failure playing in his little league game
have full insurance through my work, but now they're saying they don't have to pay
Why not
Lots of reasons
He don't even understand half of them
What about the hospital
Hope Memorial Hospital
Yeah, Hope Memorial
Don't they have to cover it
Right, right
That's what  thought
No
The hospital says  have to pay cash
Otherwise the only thing  can do is bring Mike home and watch him die
Jesus
Yeah
Lampley is already working on the story in his head, putting all the pieces in the right place
Bureaucracy of the medical establishment, American family caught in the middle
Right
Big guy versus little guy
We were thinking you could do one of them special interest pieces, you know
Send donations, write your congressman
That kind of thing
Anything would help
What they've done to your son is outrageous, and  want to help
But 've got to run it by my producers

He is the  , and he is performing last rites
The boy's distraught parents hang on to each other for comfort
The chaplain kisses the crucifix, touches it to the boy's forehead, and begins to pray
John and Denise exchange a look
The chaplain whispers incantations and he makes the sign of the cross over the dying child
Plink
John and Denise turn
The monitor now reads 84
- John and Denise are refused for a loan
&  - Tight on a diamond ring through a lapidary's eyeglass
There are two gold wedding rings on the counter
The jeweler nods his head, and John takes the cash
'   - Mike, oxygen tubes in his nostrils, is fast asleep, the monitors chirping quietly
Denise sits by Mike's bed, hands clasped and head bowed, praying hard
John
walks in, catches the anxiety on her face, before seeing the cause
The monitor now reads 80
- John selling the truck
prospective buyer inspects as
waits
He'll take it
takes the money, drops the keys in the buyer's hand, and watches his truck drive away
From inside the house, the phone rings
hurries inside to get it
- It's empty
Furniture, appliances, everything's gone
Just a few boxes
John picks up the ringing phone
Hey, sweetheart
How's Mike
They're releasing him
What
Dr
Turner just left
They're sending Mike home in the morning
What are you talking about
They can't just send him home
gave them money yesterday
It doesn't matter
They're releasing him
But  spoke to the hospital
took care of
Yeah, you always take care of it
But it's never enough, is it
You need to do something, John
Do you hear me
Do something
- '  - John stands in Mike's bedroom, looking at his son's things
Each thing with a memory
The pictures
The toys
The body builder posters
He picks up a photo of John, Denise, and a seven-year old Mike clowning around
Better days
's face, thinking, thinking
- steps off a city bus carrying a gym bag
Windbreaker buttoned, baseball cap pulled down tight, he moves with purpose toward the hospital
- The broken, battered and bloodied sit on chairs waiting to be seen
wails in the arms of his Hispanic mother,
, 28, hugely pregnant, sits next to her husband, , a contractor, dressed in paint-stained coveralls
, 23, a blood-soaked towel wrapped around his hand
, 30's, black jeans, shades, and a huge hangover, sits with his arm around his girlfriend, , a platinum bombshell
She's hurting
Her face is cut, her eyes swollen
, a young, sensitive nurse sits behind the admitting desk
What's going on
Are we going to get seen or what
The doctor will be with you shortly, sir
Shortly
Shortly we could all be dead
We've been waiting damn near an hour
The electric doors slide open and
enters and looks around before moving quickly through and disappearing into the main hospital entrance
-  - moves through the corridors intently, a man on a mission
Dr
Turner escorts a wheelchair to the hospital exit
In a wheelchair is a middle-aged man, dressed in designer casuals, a Rolex wrapped around his wrist
His name is  , and he is a transplant patient
One of the lucky recipients
His elegantly dressed  walks alongside
You're doing great, Carroll
You've already gained back five pounds
think you're the only patient  have who actually eats the food here
' Thanks for everything, doctor
approaches the group
His face reveals nothing
Hello, John
This is Mr
Archibald
His son's a patient of mine
' Well, you're certainly in good hands
forces a smile
The Shelbys say goodbye before leaving
Denise said you're letting Mike go home
Mr
Archibald, 'm a physician
don't make policy decisions
That's handled by the board of trustees
You're head of Cardiac Surgery, Doctor
You're telling me a person in your position makes a recommendation, no one's going to listen
make recommendations all the time
The final decision rests with the board
Not me
wags a Hope Memorial brochure at Turner
You and your staff did over three hundred operations last year
It's right here on page 4 of the hospital brochure
Nice color pictures, happy faces
Three hundred plus surgeries at a quarter million a pop
That's seventy five million dollars your department took in
Couldn't you do just one on good faith
Please take your hands off me
'm not asking for charity, Doc
'll pay
don't know how, but  swear to God, if it takes me the rest of my life,  will
You have my word as a man
'm sorry
tried to help
But it's out of my hands
Something in
snaps
Heart pounding, he pushes Turner through a pair of heavy metal doors and into the Emergency Room
- shoves Turner inside, pulls out a Baretta
9mm, points it at Turner's head
'm not asking anymore, Doctor
'm telling
Now  want a new heart for my kid
You understand
drops the gym bag on the floor, unzips it, pulls out a length of heavy chain
Quickly, he wraps the chain around the power bar, threads a lock and clamps it shut
Turner marches over to a phone and picks it up
sticks the weapon in his face
(') Don't even think about it
Turner hangs up the phone
Hey, what are you doing
sees the stocky  , trains the gun on him
Hands over your head
Do it
The security guard nervously raises his hands above his head
This part wasn't covered in his training manual
(') Give me your gun
, uh, don't have a gun
reacts awkwardly, wasn't expecting this response
Okay
Then sit down
And stay down
The guard obediently drops into a chair
Mr
Archibald,  understand how upset you are, but this is not the right way to handle it
tried your way, Doc
It didn't work
Now we're going to try it my way
In one of the treatment rooms, Dr
Marjorie Klein and Leo Maguire attend to a man in motorcycle leathers with a bloodied head wound
They watch
lock the ambulance entrance
Mr
Archibald
What are you doing
took your advice, Doctor
'm not taking no for an answer
Several patients and medical personnel see the gun and bolt out the front door
With Turner still in tow,
hurries to the  entrance, pulls more chains from his gym bag and secures both doors
Turning back, he sees Lester at the admitting desk arguing with Debby Utley
clipboard with medical information forms sits in front of him
(') What's going on here
Lester removes the blood soaked towel
The tips of three fingers have been severed from his right hand
They want me to sign
The pen
The hand
It's not going to work
Mr
Archibald, these people have nothing to do with this
You have got to let them go
They need treatment
This is a hospital, isn't it
You're a doctor
Treat them
points to Lester
(') Start with him
Turner stands frozen
(') What's the matter, Doc
You want to see his insurance card first
stands on a table addressing the room
madman with a gun
(') This hospital is under new management, ladies and gentlemen
From now on, free care for everyone
Various reactions from the people in the room
Far out
points to the security guard
You
Come with me
leads the security guard to the elevators
(') Kill the power
don't have a key for that
You've got the keys to the city
Now do it
Decision time
Finally the guard inserts an Allen wrench into the lock and kills the power
takes a crowbar from his bag and jimmies the elevator control box, busting fuses and yanking wires
The elevator looks sick
It's not going anywhere
looks around and sees a snake-eye security camera bolted to the ceiling
-   - skinny, pimple-faced  with a big chrome badge sits in front of a dozen closed circuit monitors
On one, a man in a baseball cap is now bashing the camera with a crowbar
Ssss
blizzard of white snow crackles on the monitor
Confused, the pimply faced kid picks up the phone
Uh
This is the security desk at Hope Memorial Hospital
think you guys better get down here
We may have a situation
- paces next to the windows, sizing up the room
Nearby, the Hispanic baby wails
Everybody does exactly what  say and nobody gets hurt
He looks around the room, everybody battered, bloodied, and bruised
(') more hurt
-  8 - , a superbright techie-geek, pokes his head into an office where Tuck Lampley is having a meeting with his
This just came in over the police radio
Someone is holding Hope Memorial hostage
Realizing, Lampley stares at the  executives
Hope Memorial Hospital
Isn't that
Lampley is already up and on the move
Is it a good enough story for you now, George
Do you think it's that guy with the kid, boss
What do you think
- Maguire leads Lester back to the treatment area
Lester hands him a baggie filled with three-severed fingertips
Don't lose my fingers, man
Had them fingers my whole life
(under breath; to Julie) We were here before that guy
You'll get your turn
Nobody's going anywhere for a while
glances at the admitting desk and sees the chair move
He lifts his weapon and moves towards it
He jumps around the corner of the desk to find Debby Utley underneath, scared to death
(') 'm going to have to ask you to join the others, Miss
The sound of a screaming baby is cutting through the room like nails on a blackboard
approaches Rosa, who clutches her child defensively
(') What's the problem
Rosa shakes her head
She doesn't speak much English
Yo no se que pasa
El llora por toda la noche
Yo pienso que tiene dolor en su oreja
Si
En su oido
Porque lo toca
Mira
The baby's tiny fingers reach for his ear
singles out Debby Utley
(') This kid's got an ear infection
You
With
's finger pointed at her, Debby falls apart, bursting into tears
can't
Why not
don't know anything
It's my first
gives her a look
"Oh, Jesus
" got it
Give him this
Maguire hands a bottle of gooey pink Amoxycillin to Debby
Unbelievable
This place is a joke
Good think 'm not cut
'd bleed to death in this joint
Am  right, my man
Mitch tries to engage
with a wink and a big flashy smile
ignores him
(') Excuse me
Hey, brother
Mitch
They crying baby
The tension
It's all getting to
(') My girlfriend's in a lot of pain here
How much longer before she sees a doctor
Mitch gets up and tries to approach
Sit down
That's cool
You and me ain't got no problems
You know what 'm saying
But do me a favor, huh
Baby's pretty banged up, and we've been waiting for hours
told you once already
Sit tight
That's what we've been doing
shoots Mitch a look before moving to Miriam and Steve
When is the baby due
Any minute
Oh, boy
rubs his head
What else
The sound of the automatic doors banging against the chain is heard
What's that
-   - red & white ambulance is parked outside
are pushing against the locked doors, pounding on the glass
runs from the treatment area, sees a body laying on a stretcher
#1 Open up
Got a gunshot victim here
Lost a lot of blood
Take him to another hospital
#2 He won't make it
Come on
We're losing him
Open the door
(to Maguire) You recognize these guys
Yeah, they're here all the time
Paramedics #2 and #3 are wearing blue jackets, blue pants, cordovan, cushion-soled shoes
Paramedic #1 wears the same blue jacket and pants, but his shoes are black, with leather soles
That one's a cop
was here when you brought in your son
Remember me
shot straight with you then
'm shooting straight with you now
'm telling you, these guys are cool
studies Maguire's eyes, measures his honesty, and then unchains the door and opens it, pointing the weapon
The paramedics see
's gun and their hands go up
You, open your coat
#1 What
You heard me
Take the coat off
Cop
Paramedic #1 takes off his coat
There's nothing underneath
He's not police
(') Alright, then
Leave the stretcher
Go
Beat it
The paramedics back away and take off
Maguire rolls the stretcher inside, and
re-locks the doors
(name's ) gave them all the money in the register
They shot me anyway
peels back a corner of the blanket, looks for weapons, recoils at the sight of the man's blood
Maguire moves in, squeezes the man's wrist, takes his pulse
We need to prep this man for immediate surgery
He's in boo-koo trouble
Doctor
No, no
This is out of my department
'm a heart surgeon
'm not an emergency room physician
You are now
Come on, Doctor
It's like riding a bike
Pretend you're getting paid
Turner and
lock eyes
(') Do it
Seventy-five milligrams Demerol  Lidocaine, local
Two percent
Turner takes the man's pulse as they roll the stretcher towards the trauma room
watches the anesthesia cup placed over the man's nose and he goes down for the count
Mitch fires a look at the stocky security guard
When  get out of here, 'm suing this hospital and your security company
Unseen by Mitch,
has moved behind him
What makes you so sure you're getting out of here at all
Mitch sits back down
leans against a wall, takes a breath
Suddenly, he hears the woop-woop of police sirens
He looks out the window and sees police cars storming the front of the hospital
The cavalry has arrived
(') Here we go
- The summer sun beats down as cop cars careen into the parking lot
Behind them, an unmarked Crown Victoria plows slowly through a growing crowd
bails out before the car stops, smoothing out the wrinkles in his rumpled suit
He reacts with surprise when he sees veteran, on-the-spot news reporter, Tuck Lampley, already on the scene with his camera crew
What are you doing here, Lampley
Shouldn't you be out exposing tragic miscarriages or justice or something
Yeah, well, screw you, too
Grimes pushes past, but Lampley dogs him
(') There's a rumor floating around, Frank
Some guy's holding the hospital hostage
Needs an operation for his kid
Any truth to it
You know more than  do
You're full of shit
Hey, then we're even
never believe a word you guys say either
This is big, isn't it, Frank
can feel it
Come on, what do you got
Zip
Nothing
Read my lips
just got here
But  promise, as soon as  know anything, you'll be the last to know
Hey, Grimes
You're a real horse's ass
You know that
Yeah, well
Grimes chuckles as he moves past the police barricade, sizing up his territory
He runs into swat team   , already on the scene
Moody's accompanied by the pimply faced security guard who phoned it in
This guy's in for the long haul, Lieutenant
He locked down the , barricaded himself inside, killed the power on the elevators
We could bust down the door, but the sonofabitch might start killing everybody
Any other way in
'm working on it
How many hostages
Security guard here said there could be anywhere from ten to twenty
Any security cameras
The guy took out the one in the , sir
But the hospital has two covert pinpoints hidden inside the treatment facility
Pinpoint cameras
don't understand
The hospital's own private security
Every hospital has them, in case a mental patient goes crazy or an employee starts stealing pharmaceuticals
They're hidden in the walls throughout the hospital
There's two inside the  area
Can we get them
We're setting up a video tap right now
Should be up and running in a few minutes
Grimes looks at the pimply-faced kid
Are you in charge of security
No, sir
That'd be Wally Pitoniak
He's at home
It's his day off
Not anymore it ain't
Get him down here
(to Moody) need to make contact with this guy
Can you get me a secure line
Lieutenant
One of our guys is on the inside
He's got a walkie-talk
You might want to give this a shot
The kid hands Grimes his walkie-talkie
Alright, but put a clamp on all phone lines to the Emergency Room
If he picks up the phone,  want him talking to me
Got it
Grimes looks around, sees more news vans arriving
And keep the media on a need to know basis
Until  say so, the press doesn't need to know nothing
Now who's in charge of this hospital
Rebecca Payne, sir
She's off today, too
Jesus Christ
Does anyone work at this hospital
It's Saturday
So what
People get sick on Saturday, don't they
- watches the police build-up outside
Rosa is holding her baby, who is quieter now, not crying
How old is he
Cuantos anos
Ocho meses
Eight month
nods
Memories
Eight months
Great age
Dr
Klein approaches
with Miriam
'll need to do an internal examination on this woman
Go
sees Steve, the woman's husband, picking at his fingernails, anxious
(') Why'd you come to an
Why not go right to Maternity
Miriam went into labor early
Her water broke, we called our doctor, got the service
Excuse me, but  think my fiancee broke her arm
Could somebody take a look at her, please
moves over to Julie, regards her black eye, her swollen face
(') She's fine, ain't she
All that and twenty-two years old
Little slice of heaven
Must be doing something right, am  right
looks at Mitch
Is this guy for real
(to Julie) What's your story
Car accident
What does it look like
was talking to her
drunk ran a red light and slammed into us
It was an accident
muffled voice suddenly squawks on the security guard's walkie-talkie
(
) Hello
Hello
Anyone there
grabs the guard's walkie-talkie, presses
Yeah
-   - The police have cordoned off a section of the parking lot and transformed it into a command post
Police personnel invade the area
Tables, phones, and monitors are being set up
This is Lieutenant Frank Grimes of the Chicago Police Department
Are you the man in charge
That's right
Who am  speaking to
pauses
(') Come on, my friend
We're going to be doing a lot of talking today
You don't have to give me your real name, but 've got to call you something
Call me John
Alright, John
Again, my name is Lieutenant Grimes
But  want you to call me Frank
Can you do that
Sure, Frank
'm the hostage negotiator
've been a cop for thirty-five years and this is all  do
don't play games
And  don't fool around
So if  say something, you can take it to the bank
Now, let's get down to it
Is anybody hurt
It's an Emergency Room, Frank
Everybody's hurt
Frank smiles
This guy's a comedian
(') They're fine
Good
As long as it stays that way, we can keep talking
Grimes walks along the perimeter of the police barricade
crowd of lookie-loos is starting to gather
(') Murphy's Law, John
You picked the hottest day of the year
It's a hundred degrees out here
And 'm allergic to the heat
So let's wrap this up as quickly as possible
Now, what exactly is it you want
Find Rebecca Payne, Hope Memorial's Administrative Supervisor
Tell her  want my kid's name on the donor list
Kid
Boy or girl
Boy
How old
You know, 've got two boys
Two girls and two boys
Don't handle me, Frank
don't want to be handled
It insults my intelligence
If  don't get what  want, you're going to have a lot of dead bodies on your hands
You only need to remember two things
My kid and the donor list
You got that
Take it easy, John
The idea's not to get too excited
Mike's name goes on that list or there's going to be a blood bath in here
Alright
hear you loud and clear
Rebecca Payne, right
'm writing it down
Lot of cops out here, John
Are you sure you want to go through with this
'm sure
Alright
Sit tight
You're in a tough spot, John
lot of trouble
But if you work with me, if you're reasonable, we'll figure a way out of this
We have to have a little faith in one another
Why
Why
Because that's what faith's all about
Believing when you don't want to believe
Besides, what else are you going to do
Just tell Payne
Donor list
She'll understand
-   - The line goes dead
Alright, what the hell is a donor list
- paces the floor
It's slower now
Everyone just sitting around, waiting to see what will happen
Debby has pulled herself together for the time being
She calls out to John
Mr
Would you really do it
What
What you said about the bloodbath
Would you really shoot us
'll do what  have to do to help my kid
Aw, bullshit
He can't shoot us all
There's only eight bullets in that weapon
First one's got your name on it, Mitch
Mitch mumbles and kicks his feet up, sparking a cigarette
keeps pacing back and forth, and Steve is still picking them fingernails
(') First child
Yes, sir
You know how it is, kind of nervous
nods, understands
What are you hoping for
Boy or girl
Miriam wants a baby girl
Doesn't matter to me, as long as the baby's healthy
Steve stops short
Realizing his faux pas
(') 'm sorry
didn't meant -- shakes it off: "Not to worry
" John notices Julie, her arm now in a sling, not broken
Who was driving
(off Julie's look) The car
was
What's that got to do with it
How come she got all banged up and you didn't
What do you call this
Mitch pulls back his hair, shows off his wounds
Surface scratches on his arms and around his neck and face
Somebody get this man a band-aid
Shut up, smart ass
It hurts
His airbag went off
Mine didn't
What kind of car do you drive there, hot shot
Mercedes 500
Benz, huh
Sixteen valve
One point six liter
It does about a hundred and eighty in reverse
Wow
Pretty snazzy
What year
1986
It's a classic
The other hostages study
Where is he going with this
Yeah, well, 've got news for you, Mitch
Mercedes didn't install passenger airbags until 1988
long uncomfortable silence ensues as the group looks at Mitch, realizing the obvious
Busted
was drunk
Alright
Tears stream down Julie's proud face, for the first time, Mitch is speechless
He looks like a car that won't start
Finally, he gets up and walks away
Well, well, well
My man, Mitch
Mister girlfriend beater
What do you got to say now, bitch
Maguire and Turner enter
Maguire's got a big smile on his face
How's Stawitzky
He's going to make it
How's it feel, Doc
Saving a life
Feels pretty good, doesn't it
'   - Monitor
Plink
Mike's blood pressure drops from 75 to 74
Mike is resting, eyes closed
Denise stands vigilantly by Mike's bedside
Reggie enters
Carrying an armload of medicine
He replaces the  bag and starts to administer the meds
One after the other, Reggie injects them into the  line, and Mike stirs
What's that
Lasix
It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up
But it's potassium sparing, so he needs this one to supplement
And those
Dopamine
For his blood pressure
Dig for his heart
Primacor
Gosh, it seems like so much
Yeah, it's a lot
This is antibiotic
What for
It's prophylactic
Just in case
These two,  don't really know what they're for
Pain, maybe
Pain
don't know, Mrs
Archibald
just do what they tell me
Mike groans
He feels queasy and his mouth is bone dry
don't feel good
This is going to make you feel yucky for a few minutes, buddy
But 'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on
How does that sound
Mike forces a smile, dips his head slightly
"Sounds good
" Reggie leaves the room
Something catches Denise's eye
Down the Pediatric , she sees the hospital chaplain again
There is a commotion
The parents are crying
And a sheet is pulled over her face of the now dead child
The chaplain tries to console the devastated mother, who screams as her child is wheeled out of the room
Mom
Is Dad coming
Yeah
He's coming
Where is he
Denise steals a final look at the parents overcome with grief
don't know, sweetheart
don't know
-   - Mitch is snooping around one of the treatment rooms, always careful to keep an eye on
He nearly jumps out of his skin when he sees the security guard standing next to him
What are you up to
Never mind me
You're worthless
You know that
Some security guard
You should have zapped the bastard
With what
Besides, 'm not putting my neck on the line
Not for eight-fifty an hour
Mitch reaches, pulls a cas cart closer
He carefully slides open a drawer, steals a sharp-edged scalpel, slips it into his pocket
Next he spots a spray top cannister marked Ethychloride
(') What the hell are you doing
Looking out for number one
You want to stay alive
Sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here
Wake up, fat boy
The cops are coming in shooting
They don't give a shit about his kid
And as soon as he realizes that, we're history
Yeah
He finds out you got a scalpel, you're the one that's history, asshole
Really
He doesn't look so bad to me
Listen
No, listen to me, you stupid rent-a-cop
'm not a slob
've got a life, and it means something to me
'm not dying in this shithole
- The vending machines have been jimmied open and a huge pile of candy bars and soda cans sit on the waiting room table
Everybody is chowing down
The thing  don't understand is why no one caught it before
Mike had check ups every year since the day he was born
Why didn't his doctors pick it up
Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur
Yeah, he was
About a week after he was born
But his doctor said that was normal
That it happens all the time
He might not have been tested thoroughly enough
Why not
You got an , right
There's your answer
's pay their doctors not to test
Their way of keeping costs down
Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them
The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser
Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the  sends the doc a big, fat bonus check
looks at Turner
Is that true
Possible
Not likely, but possible
Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along
And he could have been treated years ago
Who knows
Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks
You see,here's the problem
Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead
That's how they make money
And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead
They want you sick
That's the way they make money
It's all about getting paid, man
And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war
It's a game
And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve
Because then no one gets paid
But what about that thing you guys take
That promise
What do they call it
The Hippocratic oath
More like the hipp-crit-cial Oath to me
How's that go, Doc
" solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical
" 'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth
The shit happens all the time
Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath
Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing
Hospitals can't turn people away
Yeah
thought there were laws about that
There are laws
But there are also ways around the laws
All we have to do is stabilize them
After that, we're off the hook
Turner is getting hot
That's not how it works
That's exactly how it works
Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door
Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc
Finally, Turner explodes
Shut up
Enough already
've heard all the bitching and moaning  can stand
Sure, the system sucks
There's red tape and there's worse
There's tough luck
And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days
But some of us got into medicine to do something about it
break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam
'm in it up to my elbows
've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around
And when  say  do my best,  mean it
So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under
And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine
'm the bad guy
But who's holding the fucking gun
Turner gets up and walks into the treatment room
Wow
What's his problem
've got to be honest, if my kid was dying and  couldn't get help,  don't know what 'd do
Me, neither
But 'd do something
glances quickly at the clock
He picks up the phone, clicking the button, trying to get a dial tone
-   - black  phone starts ringing and the policemen freeze
Where's Grimes
runs over and calls out to the lieutenant
Sir
Grimes waves him off and cues his portable
This is Frank Grimes
, confused
But
The line is clipped, John
You pick up the phone, you get me
(then) Can  help you with something
Where are we at with that list
'm working on it, John
But  need some time
Time  don't have, Lieutenant
want to talk about the hostages
What about them
What's going on in there
How are they
Same as they were before, Frank
We're all just kind of waiting on you
At the command post, Moody is now waving his arms
Grimes moves over and looks at the monitors
The videotape is up
The images are wide and grainy
Giving him his first look at the hostages
,
moves into frame
Moody taps the screen and Grimes nods
That's our guy
want you to let some of them go
What for
do for you
You do for me
Show some good faith
We've got a lot of nervous people out here, John
Make everybody breathe a lot easier if we saw some happy faces
Good faith only takes you so far
You see,  believe in the merit system
And so far, you haven't earned any points
- navy blue unmarked Crown Victoria pulls up and out steps Rebecca Payne and
They are quickly ushered over to the monitors where they see
's face on the screens
That's him
His name is John Archibald
His son's on the fifth floor, Pediatric
- Marjorie Klein moves over with a very hysterical Miriam in tow
Excuse me
holds up a finger telling her to wait
(') need to talk to you
Now
(into phone) Can you hold on a minute, Frank
This woman's six centimeters dilated and the baby is breech
can't do anything for her here
She needs to be moved to Maternity immediately
rubs his eyes and lets out a breath
He's under a lot of stress
- Grimes has his hand over the receiver as he barks out orders to Moody
Put people on the door
Nobody talks to the wife but me
Grimes sticks out his free hand to Monroe, who shakes it
(') Good to see you, Gus
How are you
Hot
What's going on
You're looking at it
(
) Are you there, Frank
Yeah, 'm here
(
) changed my mind
am going to let some of the hostages go
Great, John
That's the right thing
(
) But when  do, the clock starts
You have one hour to get back to me with some good news
Monroe is glued to the monitors
His wheels are already spinning
Grimes covers the receiver to speak to him
Isn't it a little early for you to be here, Gus
Who called in the heavy artillery
(
) mean it, Frank
If my boy's not on the list in an hour,  promise you someone's going to die
This is bad, Frank
Lot of people watching this one
Big embarrassment if it doesn't go away real quiet like
Well, give me some time
'm working on it
(
) Frank
got it, John
'm hearing you
One hour
They look on Monroe's face tells Grimes that something is wrong
(') Gus
There's no time on this one, Frank
This one's just got to go away
- puts down the walkie-talkie and points at Miriam and Rosa
You and you
Come with me
Maguire, give me a hand
Mr
Archibald
Please let my husband go with me
Honey, for godsakes, just do as the man says
Get out of here
'm not leaving you here alone
Shit, 'll go
Shut your face
What kind of man are you
Screw you, Tyrone
Steve leaps from his seat and goes after Mitch, bristling with the racial slur
moves in fast, trying to separate them
But instead of going for Steve, Mitch goes for broke and rushes
The Ethylchloride is out and Mitch sprays it into
's eyes, temporarily blinding him
John tries to get his bearings but Mitch is already swinging the scalpel
As
blocks the knife, his arm is sliced and starts to gush
Mitch goes for the kill, but
grabs his arm and they wrestle to the ground, the scalpel and John's gun clattering to the floor
The element of surprise gone, Mitch is now getting the worst of it
is getting in some heavy blows and no one is stepping in to stop it
Mitch sees the gun across the floor next to Julie
(') Julie, baby, get the gun
Julie gets up
(') Shoot him, honey
Shoot him
But instead of grabbing the weapon, she picks up the Ethylchloride, sprays it directly in Mitch's eyes from superclose range and doesn't stop
Mitch's hands fly to his eyes and he screams
gets up and recovers his weapon, sticking it in his waistband
Julie stands over Mitch, who is still writhing in pain
(') You stupid bitch
Julie rears back, and with her go-go boot, she kicks Mitch square in the groin
That's for beating the shit out of me
She kicks him again
(') That's for being an asshole
Once more for good measure
(') And that's for calling me a bitch
Damn
The hostages look at Julie with newfound respect
takes the security guard's handcuffs, drags Mitch across the floor, and manacles him to the radiator
Everybody's a tough guy
Grimes voice crackles over the walkie-talkie
(
) Where are those hostages, John
moves to the door, unlocks the chain, points to Rosa and Miriam
Let's go
Both of you
Rosa launches into a rapid-fire monologue of thanks
She speaks quickly, saying the word "Dios" over and over
What's she saying
She said she'll pray for his boy
Miriam kisses Steve, holds him tight
Everything's going to be okay
The baby is going to be just fine
puts a hand on Steve's shoulder
Get out of here
Go
Steve is stunned
Can't get to his feet
(') Vasta
Vasta
Let's go
- The front door opens and Steve, Miriam, Rosa and the baby are released
We see Channel 8 reporter Tuck Lampley doing a live "stand up
" The gunman has just freed several hostages who will immediately be debriefed by members of the crisis team
Will the man known as John
get a heart for his little boy
Time will tell
Where this leads next is anyone's guess
Live from Hope Memorial Hospital, this is Tuck Lampley
The hostages are hustled through the police barricade by a team of kevlar riot police
The media rush the hostages, shouting out questions and frantically trying to stick their microphones close enough
#1 Is it true an ambulance dropped off a gunshot victim after the gunman took over the
Yes
He unlocked the door and let him in
If he didn't, the man would have died
John
very good man
#2 The gunman
Si
Good man, el senor
But Tuck Lampley's attention is on the police command post where dozens of blue uniforms crowd around a small bank of monitors
Suddenly, it hits him
They've got a camera in there
don't believe it
They're watching a video feed
Freddy
squints through the glasses
How do you know
Well, they're looking at something, Freddy
And  need to know what it is
Can you steal it
No problem, boss
If they got it,  can get it
- , Chief of Hospital Security, has arrived
He and Sergeant Moody are standing over an unrolled building plan that has been stretched across the command table like a battle map
Monroe and Grimes have Rebecca Payne on the defensive
You mean all of this could have been avoided if you had just put the kid's name on a list
Don't you dare try to blame this on me
You think Mr
Archibald is the only one with a sick child
Try the  ward
There's a whole floor full of them
People get sick
They die
That's the way it goes
'm faced with tough decisions every day
The fact is there's a man threatening to kill innocent people because you refused treatment for his son
The fact is there are fifty million people in this country without medical insurance, sir
And there's one of me in every hospital
That's not my fault
It's just the way the country's set up
You want to change it
Write your congressman
Moody looks over from his map
Excuse me, but why don't we just tell him his son's on the list
Doesn't that make sense
mean, how's he going to know
That's not a bad idea
You want me to put his name on the list, fine, but it's a mistake
You give in to this man, there's going to be guns in every hospital in America
don't personally care if you put the kid on it or not
That's your conscience
But give us a hand, will you honey
Work with us
Tell him his kid's going to be alright
Do you think you can do that
Pitoniak has indicated a spot on the schematic by circling it with a red pen
Sir
Sir, take a look at this
Monroe moves over
What is it
Pitoniak points to the map, marking a red "" through the circle
It's a phone
So
Moody points to one of the monitors
, a view of the nurse's station and beyond
And in the foreground, big and clear as day, is the  '
It's that phone
- More waiting
So, what now
What's the plan
Mitch
No
want to know
Every day you read about this kind of shit
And now we're in the middle of it
How is it going to end, John
This country, man
swear to God
You can't go anywhere anymore without getting robbed, mugged, or murdered
Kids killing classmates, drive bys
won't even go into a post office anymore
Shut up, Mitch
He's right
You know how easy it was to get this gun
One gun show
Five minutes
That's right
You're just a punk with a gun
understand your kid is sick, but what makes him better than me
've got a life, too
Yeah, but you've got insurance
So, what, you're going to shoot me
Because that's what you're telling the cops
If poor little Mikey doesn't get the very first heart available, all of us die
No,  don't want to cheat anyone
just want my kid to have a fair shot
So what's the plan, Stan
mean, exactly
How long are you going to hold us hostage
Until your son gets a new heart
don't know
Think, Einstein
Use your head
Correct me if 'm wrong, Doctor, but hearts don't come just like that
It takes months, years sometimes
know
Then what's your move
'm not letting my kid die
'm out of options, alright
have no more ideas
This is it
The end of the road
'm looking for an act of God
'm looking for a miracle
-  - The white  speeds along the highway, tries to pass the semi in front of her, and smashes into the embankment
It's the same accident as before, only this time, it's regular speed
- Frank Grimes stands outside Mike's room, just watching him through the glass
Mike's blood pressure has fallen to 68
He is asleep, each breath magnified by the hollow, mechanized wheeze of the ventilator pump
Denise sits by his side, praying hard, tears rolling down her cheeks
Payne arrives, and the two stand there a moment
Watching the scene, Grimes is visibly moved
Even Payne and her super bitch attitude are a little humbled
No matter how many times  see it, this is the part  always hate
Do you have any children, Miss Payne
No
No  don't
They move to the doorway and tap lightly on the door
Mrs
Archibald
Denise's wet face turns to see the cause of the intrusion
(') Could we have a word with you
- Denise, Grimes, and Payne by the elevators
This is my fault
When the hospital told me they were releasing Mikey,  was furious
yelled at John to do something, anything
never thought
understand
Is he a violent man, Mrs
Archibald
No
Heavens, no
He's gentle
He's sweet
He wouldn't hurt a fly
That's not what he's saying
He's talking about killing people
Has he spent any time in the military
Hey, what is this
get what's going on here
You want me to tell you something you can use to hurt my husband
He's in a lot of trouble, Ma'am
We're going to need you to talk to him
Let's get something straight, Mister
You can't use me to make a case against John
support my husband
Whatever he does
'm on his side
Not yours
Mrs
Archibald
You, don't talk to me
'd tell you what  think of you but 'm a Christian woman
Now you people leave me alone
have a sick child to look after
've decided to put Mike's name on the organ recipient list, Mrs
Archibald
The hospital will pay for everything
Denise looks at Payne, not daring to believe
Really
Payne nods
This is too much for Denise
She throws her arms around Payne, sobbing tears of joy
(') Oh, thank you
Thank you so much
Payne pats Denise on the back, awkwardly trying to comfort her
-  - Grimes and Payne move quickly through the corridors
You're good
Excuse me
With the Archibald woman back there
Quite a performance
The sincere look, the comforting embrace
For a minute,  almost believed you cared
Payne's eyes flash with anger
She looks like she wants to say something, but she just turns and walks away
- restless crowd encircles the hospital, cordoned off by police blockades, uniformed cops forming a human wall around people
rescue vehicles rumble onto the scene, sirens blaring
police bus drives slowly into the parking lot
team, dressed in flak jackets and riot gear, pours out
An armada of soft drink, hot dog and ice cream vendors smell gold, and stake out their claims
It's Saturday afternoon, and the circus is in town
- and the hostages watch Tuck Lampley on an overhead
Jimmy Palumbo is being interviewed
,
sees the massive police build-up, swallows
He looks at the clock
5:05
Ten minutes and counting
-  - red and white medical helicopter descends from the sky
The accident scene is now secured by the flashing lights of police and medical teams
The screeching sound of cutting metal is heard as the rescuers use the jaws of life
As we see the car more closely now, we notice that the woman's arm rests out the open window
On her wrist is a silver donor bracelet
- Grimes returns to find the post empty
Nobody there except a few policemen and Sergeant Moody, who is doing a check on his walkie
What's going on
Where is everybody
Moody indicates the map and the monitor
We're sending in one of ours through the ventilation ducts
He indicates the red nurses' phone
(') If we can get the target to that phone, it's a clear shot
Is that right
Yes, Lieutenant
That is right
On who's orders
- Police Chief Gus Monroe, Wally Pitoniak, and a  Team are in strategy session
They surround a sniper decked out in  regalia
green video mini-monitor is being checked and fastened to the front of the sniper's vest
In the distance, Grimes bursts into the parking garage
Gus
Not one word
don't want to hear one goddamn word out of you, Frank
'm not going to say anything
'm just going to go get you your red nose
What did you say to me
Are you calling me a clown
Monroe goes after Grimes and has to be restrained
(') swear to God, 'll kill you
Boys
Boys
You going to do this behind my back, you sonofabitch
Check the time, Frank
Look at your watch, Frank
The guy said at a quarter after he was going to start killing everybody, and we don't have any reason not to believe him
So goddamn stupid
Yeah
What's your great idea
There are no great ideas
Right
Exactly
But right now 've got a shot at this guy
don't even know what we're talking about
You know the score
You always take the clear shot
The wife has agreed to speak to him
Let her talk him down
That's exactly what we're going to do
What
You use the man's wife to set him up
Whatever works
Let me paint a picture for you
And  hope it's clear
What we've got is a lose/lose
If this guy starts whacking out the hostages, it's bad, right
But if we give in to this asshole, it's also bad
Bad for who
It's an election year
Do you want me to spell it out for you
, ,
However it goes down, this guy's not going to make it
So, you kill him
That's a
bonanza
There's not going to be a slaughter in there
Not on my watch
You're out, Frank
Out
Out
No hard feelings
But you're officially relieved of duty
'll handle it from here
You
It's not my first trip around the dance floor, you know
Grimes laughs out loud
Yeah
Hey,  don't like it any better than you do, but 'm under a lot of pressure here
Everyone is wetting their pants on this one
Believe me, my ass is swinging in the breeze
Monroe turns and walks away
Grimes calls out after him
What about the hostages
They better keep their heads down
- paces back and forth looking at the clock
His level of irritation is growing exponentially
Where the hell are these guys
Mitch is now contrite and trying to reconcile with his battered girlfriend
Julie
Leave me alone
'm sorry
'm a lousy drunk, okay
get out of control
don't mean to, but  do and  lose my mind
But that doesn't mean  don't love you
And 'll change
swear to God,  will
It's you and me, baby
All the girls in the club, they don't mean shit to me
It's only you
'll get down on my knees if you want me to
Look, 'm on my knees in front of everyone
'll even forget you kicked me in the nuts
Come on
No, Mitch
This is always how it goes
You treat me like shit, then come crawling back to me like Prince Charming
Not this time
It's over
She takes off a big diamond from her finger and drops it on the floor
It bounces and disappears under a table
Aw, come on
Don't do that
That ring cost me twenty grand
Poor little rich boy
Used to getting everything he wants
Buying his way in and out of everything
Lester bends over and tries inconspicuously to look for the ring
The security guard gets on his hands and knees
Even Debby sneaks a peek
Do you mind
Stay away from the ring, please
Hey, she don't want it
yeah
Finders keepers, man
The hostages laugh and Mitch goes crazy
Hey, what's so funny
Does everybody think this is a joke
You all should be thinking about your own lives, hoping that phone rings with some good news
Because in about five minutes, the road is going to get a lot narrower
- Monroe moves outside and joins the other  team personnel at the video tap
Grimes follows to plead his case
But he's not a wacko, Gus
Married with a family, no history of mental illness
No radical political views
He doesn't fit the profile
Don't matter
You know as well as  do that anybody can fit the profile at any time
He's got a gun and he's got hostages
That's a profile
How long have we been doing this
You've got to trust me on this one
Gus,  like the guy
Well  don't
don't like nut jobs who point guns at innocent people
It pisses me off
He's not a nut job
Maybe you're right
Maybe he's bluffing
Maybe he's just a nice guy with a problem
Maybe he's misunderstood and needs to blow off a little steam
Hey, it's possible
But  can't depend on that, Frank
This asshole has raised the stakes real high
And  need to match it, just in case he's not bluffing
Now, we've got five minutes before he starts throwing bodies out the door
've got a chance to end this right now and 'm taking it
'm telling you, you're making a mistake
Yeah, well
We try harder
want to be on the record
Monroe hands Grimes a set of headphones
You can be on whatever you want
Now  got you a chair
Put these on and have a seat
Gus
Will you stop already
Jesus, Frank
You're so emotional
On one of the monitors   the  room and hostages
On the other, the red nurses' phone
The images are black and white and grainy
(into walkie-talkie) This is Moody
Let's go
- Pitoniak climbs along the narrow catwalk until he reaches the area that houses the air-conditioning unit
We hear the thunderous sound of an enormous compressor
Pitoniak reaches for the  on/off switch
- paces
Everyone keeps looking at the clock
5:12
Three minutes to go
Some first day, huh
little more stressful than  thought it would be
cracks a smile
Just then, a loud rattle echoes through the , pipes clanging
What was that
Air conditioning unit just shut off
Yeah
Why
The power automatically shuts down when the thermostat hits a certain temperature
Something doesn't feel right
- An armed  pops his head up and slithers along the plated aluminum floor of an  duct, a remote mini-monitor in the palm of his hand
- Snipers lock and load assault rifles, and Tuck Lampley's crew frantically unspools fiber optic cable line to a hospital outsource, cutting and splicing it back to the news van
Where's my picture
Coming
We just need to unscramble the police encryptment
We're almost there
Well, hurry up
've got a contact in cardiology
The cops are setting up a phone call with this guy and his wife
This is going to be unbelievable
- The sniper continues to crawl through the duct toward a light emanating from a louvered grill
- Moody looks at his watch, synchronizes
Monroe does
(into walkie-talkie) Are you with a wife
Good
Let's patch it through
- 5:14
All eyes on the clock
Hostages tired, hot, emotionally spent
Suddenly, a phone clangs
looks around, surprised
He sees a desk phone, picks it up
Dead
He moves to another phone
Nothing
But the mysterious phone continues to ring
Where's the phone
Which phone is it
- News monitors cackle with white snow
No picture
Freddy
works the equipment
Lampley pokes his head in
Come on, goddammit
They're putting the call through
Suddenly, an audio hook-up
The phone clanging like an alarm bell
Oh, yeah
We got sound
Good
Good
But where's the video
Come on
need picture
-   - moves from phone to phone with no luck
The phone keeps ringing
Finally he moves into the corridor, spotting a red phone at the nurses' station
- Surreal, distorted focus, like a funhouse mirror
Suddenly,
races into frame and snatches the phone
This better be good, Frank
-   - (
) John
Denise
(
) Hi, baby
We're on the list
What
(
) Payne was just here
Mike's name is on the list
You did it
- The hostages are glued to the , watching covering from the outside about what's happening on the inside
Okay
Great
We're on the list
Wow
How's Mikey doing
(
) Not so good, baby
He looks like he's going away
- Cops are glued to the monitor
Grimes looks on, disgusted
'   - They've done everything they can but he keeps getting worse and worse
Oh my God, our poor baby
Denise cracks
Tears come and there's no stopping them
- The sniper pops off the grill, revealing the acoustic tile of the ceiling below
He raises the microphone to his mouth
Two zero to base camp
'm in position one
(
) Go
-   - John rests his head and closes his eyes as he listens to his wife falling apart
(
) You know, sometimes  think he's an angel
real angel, sent down to keep us company for a while
It's going to be alright, sweetheart
(
) Are you praying for him
Are you praying for our boy
Yeah, baby
'm praying
(
) Oh my God, what are we going to do
don't know
(
) Maybe we should let him go
Maybe it's meant to be and we should accept it
No
Don't say it
(
) don't know what else to think
The priest keeps coming
He wants to give him last rites
Denise, don't you lose faith now
Not you
You can't give up
Mikey's going to make it
swear on my life, he's going to make it
You've got to believe
(
) Okay, baby
'll believe
Is he awake
Can  talk to him
- On the monitors, the blizzard of white snow morphs into a clear picture of
on the phone
Mike's tired voice suddenly comes over the audio
(
) Dad
- Lampley is giving the thumbs up
They have picture
Are we good
Beautiful baby
You're a genius
Lampley puts on his most sincere look as the Channel 8 news team goes live
(') This is Tuck Lampley at Hope Memorial Hospital, where we are bringing you exclusive live coverage of a phone call between the father and the son he is fighting so desperately to save
Leaning against the wall
Father and son's 911 static scratched voices crackling
Mike
How you doing, buddy
You hanging in there
(
) Uh-huh
How are you
Me
'm fine
Don't worry about me
- The sniper crawls from the louvered grill, moving along two metal support rails
He takes a crouching position over the acoustic tile
'   - Mike is propped up in bed, now breathing with some difficulty
He's so weak, Denise has to hold the phone
How come you're not here, Dad
Where are you
(
) Oh, 'm kind of tied up right now
can't get away
Quick, jagged : American families
People in bars
appliance stores
Even the hostages in the
Awestruck at what they're witnessing
'   - Mom says  need a new heart
(
) That's right, champ
What's wrong with my heart
(
) Not a thing, buddy
Not a thing
We just have to put a new one in so you can be stronger, okay
Okay
- The sniper lifts a ceiling tile, exposing the treatment room below
There, across the room, is
talking on the phone
'   - Mike stops to catch his breath
He's really on his last legs
He just lays there a second before asking the big one
Hey, Dad
(
) Yeah, Mike
Am  going to die
Denise's hand flies to her mouth
- He pushes the barrel of his weapon through the opening in the ceiling and puts his eye to the scope
Through the scope,
's tormented face racks into focus, but he moves behind a partition
The shot is not clear
No, Mikey, you're not going to die
(
) How do you know
Hey, what good would the world be without you
Without you, there is no world
- Lampley stands by the news van watching the drama unfold on the monitor before him
He's a little choked up
Oh my God
This is the greatest thing 've ever seen
This is my white Bronco
-   - Hey, Mike
(
) Yeah, Dad
- moves out from behind the partition and into the open
He's a sitting duck now
- The sniper cues his mic
On your call
- The hostages are glued to the  set
Maguire, Julie, Debby, Marjorie Klein hang on
's every word
You know how much  love you, don't you
How proud  am of you
(
) Yeah
- Monroe nods at Moody
It's time
(into walkie-talkie) Take the shot
-   - From across the room and through the ceiling, a small red light snaps on
to see what it is
Yeah, well,  wanted to tell you that
Just in case  forgot
- is in the crosshairs
Dead center
The red laser dot square in the middle of his back
Give me a Chris Cormeir, will you
Yah
(
) Oh, yeah
Chris Cormeir
He's great
- The hostages attention has been so focused on the screen, none of them have realized that for John to be on , there has to be a camera inside the
Suddenly, it hits Lester
What the hell
Oh, shit
- As the sniper squeezes -- -   - Get some rest, buddy
Okay
(
) Okay
love you, Dad
Yeah
love you, too
As
hangs up the receiver, the sniper pulls the trigger
Hey, John
You're on the , you know that
John turns as the bullet explodes from the chamber, muzzle flashing
bullet blows through
's shoulder, knocking him backwards against the wall
- The echoing gunshot rumbles through the air like a thunderclap
Monroe, Moody, Grimes and Payne react as the hostages scatter
He's down
We got him
He's down
Grimes pulls off his cans
Your kids are lucky, Gus
Their father's coming home tonight

Lampley
America
All tuned into the -- -   - Sheer pandemonium
Hostages run for cover
The phone receiver swings back and forth, and a bloody
is slumped against the wall
- Lampley continues his live coverage as horrified crowds move around him
All we know at this point is that an attempt has been made on the gunman's life
Repeat
John
has been shot
-   - sits, his shirt soaked in blood
Among all the madness, something funny happens
- The sniper loses his balance and his leg crashes through the acoustic tile ceiling
He is momentarily stuck
-   - blinks
The wound, the hysteria, the events of the day, and now a leg sticking through the ceiling
It's all very surreal
He gets up, moves to the leg, and pulls
And the ceiling comes crashing down
Stunned, Monroe, Moody, Grimes and Payne grimly watch
subduing the sniper on the video tape monitors
Their faces are in stark contrast with the chaos that surrounds them
He's not down
This is very bad, Gus
runs up with a cell phone and hands it to Monroe
Not now
It's the Mayor, sir
And you better kill that video feed
The media's pirated the signal and the whole thing just went out live over national
As Monroe takes the phone and Moody starts barking out orders, the feed is disconnected, and the monitors go blank
-  - The beautiful woman's body is loaded onto the medivac
The helicopter lifts off and disappears into the darkening sky

Arthur Friedlander

Amy Podgorsky
Status 2
And a new entry, Mike Archibald, Age 9, 85 pounds
It's official
He's on the list
Status 1
- The sniper now sits restrained to a chair, his hands and feet bound by adhesive tape
The other hostages are somber, knowing that they are caught smack in the middle of this mess
sits stripped to the waist as Maguire removes the bullet from his shoulder, his wheel spinning, spinning
It's over
Mikey's not going to make it
But the list
What list
They're shooting at me
They're not going to help my kid
It's time to change plans
What about an El-vad
No
What's an El-vad
left Ventricular Assist Device
It's basically a pump inserted into the chest cavity, wired to the heart to keep it stimulated
All this time there's been a way to save his life and you never said anything
It's not a solution
It's only a band aid
Mike's immune system may be too weak
Will it give him time
Not long
It's only a temporary measure
My kid's down to hours and minutes, Doc
Things don't get more temporary than that
- The police are unceremoniously disconnecting Channel 8's pirated signal, hassling Lampley's crew, and telling them they are all going to be arrested
You're going to bust me
Get real
You just shot an innocent man on primetime
roar from the crowd indicates something big is happening
is coming outside
He's got the sniper in tow, using him as a human shield
The crowd behind the barricade is huge now, holding up signs like "Have a Heart," "Save Mike," and "John

As he comes forward, police and  teams train their rifles on him

Grimes
Behind the barricade, Frank Grimes stands with Monroe and Moody
Alright
Alright, what
Let's go out there
See what he wants
But  thought you said  was out
stepped in shit, Frank
Is that what you want to hear, goddammit
Now quit breaking my stones
need you to save my ass on this one
Frank Grimes smiles before grabbing a megaphone from one of the uniforms and stepping out from behind the barricade with Monroe and Moody
Hold your fire
looks around at the hundreds of weapons all pointing right at him
They're everywhere he turns
He sees Grimes approaches
Look what  found
The crowd cheers support for their new hero
John
Who are these guys
Who the hell are you
Oh,  know who you are, the guys who tried to take me out
indicates his bleeding shoulder
(') Almost
This is Sergeant Moody and Police Chief Monroe
What are we doing, John
You were going to call me back
gave you your hostages and you were supposed to call me back
But no, you want me dead
don't want you dead
No, you want to kill me
You want to kill me so bad you can taste it
Nobody wants to kill you
Nobody wants to kill me
(indicates the sniper) Who is this
The crowd voices their displeasure in a chorus of "boos
" That wasn't my call
-- , ,  bullshit
You tried to kill me
You tried to kill me while  was talking to my boy
The crowd erupts
They're getting rowdy now
The cops are getting jumpy, their rifles trained, their trigger fingers ready
John, listen to me
Lieutenant Grimes had nothing to do with that
It was my call
Don't lie to me
don't need to be bullshitted by some lying flunky cops
What are we, friends all of a sudden
All of a sudden, we owe you something
You pulled the gun
You're the one that took the hospital
What did you think would happen
You want truth Here's some truth
This is going to end up bad for you
There's only two ways out of here
Jail or dead
hears the words and they sink in
He knows they're right
(') Look around you
Look at all of it
It's crazy
You don't want to do this
just want my life back
understand
It's hard to be a man these days
Hard to know what the right thing is
Put the gun down, John
It's all over
You got everything you asked for
Mike is on the list
Status one
don't believe you
give you my word
Forgive me for being skeptical, Frank, but your word is shit
The crowd goes crazy, cheering and shouting out their encouragement
The faces are those of outrage and passion
Some even with tears streaming down their faces
looks out the overwhelming display of support
Hey, what are you doing
Stay with me, John
You think these people give a shit about you
They don't
You're just the cause of the moment
Believe me, in a couple of days, they'll be outraged about something else
Nobody cares, John
That's the real truth
Nobody cares
Only you
It's only you and me out here, and all these guns pointed at you
So, what do you want to do
It's your call
want my son
What
Bring me my son
want my son inside with me
Can't do it
There's an operation that could save his life
'm going to need some equipment but 've got two surgeons inside that are ready to go
You listen to me, you sonofabitch
You give this up right now, turn yourself in
And your son will have any and every means of assistance
If not, if you keep this up, this is going to be very bad for you
Are you threatening me, Chief
Take your best shot
Oh,  forgot, you already did
No, we'll do this my way
You give me my boy, they do the surgery and then  give up
Nobody gets hurt and everyone goes home
Monroe studies
and considers
What do you think, Frank
say give it to him
He's not going to hurt his boy
Monroe takes his time making his decision
Sir, the object is to get hostages out, not to let more in
The boy is not a hostage
He's the man's son
Do it
-  - Mike's hospital bed flies down the hallway
Running alongside we see Denise, Payne and nurses holding medical equipment
Mom, where are we going
To see your father
- The front doors burst open and Mike's bed is rolled onto the sidewalk
run alongside like secret service agents, protecting Mike, pushing a path through the crowd
Coming through
Let's go
Move it back, folks
The mob swarms around the speeding bed, trying to get a look at Mike, who considers the circus atmosphere surrounding him
As the bed hits the police barricade, the cops take over
Let me through
'm his mother
But she is held back as Mike is ushered through
- Mike's bed is rolled slowly to a stop outside the  doors
The sniper is released and
stands guard as Mike is rolled in by Turner and Maguire, before locking the door behind them
Dad, where have you been
Just waiting for you, buddy
Mike looks up to see Dr
Turner walking alongside
He looks up at him and smiles
Mike is wheeled into a Trauma room where the monitors quickly come to life
'   - looks at Mike as the medical team assess his condition, just watching helplessly as the life drains out of his body
How are you feeling, slugger
'm okay
Tired
Beep
Beep
The monitors whisper faintly, irregularly, Turner steps in front of
Out
What
need some time to examine Mike and  don't need you getting in the way
It's crowded enough in here
'll stay in the corner
'm serious, John
Let me do my job
Turner ushers him out the door and closes it behind him
John looks up to find the hostages staring at him
Uncomfortable, he moves into a recovery room
-   - , alone, notices the simple wooden cross hanging over the door
He stares at it a long time before kneeling, his arms resting on the bed
Bless me, father
For  have sinned
It's been a long time, so forgive me if 'm a little rusty
know you do things your own way
But 'm finding it hard to understand why you would want Mike to be so sick
'   - Turner administers the meds and Mike's eyes glaze and roll back in his head
With all the drugs coursing through his system, Mike is really out of it now
But as Dr
Turner diligently attends to Mike, the boy considers him, the bright
lights casting a halo around the doctor's head
Are you God
(caught off-guard) Yeah, kid
Yeah,  am
Turner continues working, and as he turns his back to the boy, he hears the question that floors him
Where you been
-   - keep waiting for you to step in and help him
But you never do
And  don't understand
don't understand and  don't forgive
So, help me, Father
Because 'm trying
'm really trying
Dr
Turner appears at the doorway and sees John on his knees
John
looks up and Dr
Turner soberly shakes his head
The news isn't good
-   - Dr
Turner and John look through the glass at Mike resting peacefully
Mike's blood pressure has dropped into the mid-forties
His atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens
It's thirty-five
If  put that  into him, his heart will never be able to handle the extra strain
But
Not buts, John
Without a new heart, he's not going to make it
is devastated
It takes a few moments to sink in
Take mine
Turner doesn't get it
What
You heard me
Take my heart and put it in Mike
John, buddy, you're talking a little nutsy cukoo, here
You can't be serious
You think 'm just going to stand here and watch my son die
You bet 'm serious
Dead serious
Wow
Oh my God
Lester tries to comprehend the nihilistic existentialism of it all
But that means you'll die, man
calmly finishes Lester's thought
And my sone will live
John, you can't do this
It's the only way
No, you don't understand
You physically can't do it
Why not
kill myself
You cut me open and take my heart
It's perfect
The boy crazy
Nutsy cuckoo, 'm telling you
We just can't remove your heart and put it into Mike's body
There's too many unknowns
Matching a donor and receiver is extremely complicated
There's several critical tests that have to be taken
Like what
Cross matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements
If both blood tissues aren't compatible, there's a very high likelihood of rejection
Come on, Doc
know all about compatibility
We've been tested up the wazoo
Mike and  are both -Positive
Our tissues are a match
And his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit
You know damn well we're compatible
No, we don't
You're an adult
Mike is strong, but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for Mike
'll take that chance
It's better than letting him die
Out of the question
Too risky
'm telling you, he'll make it
Can't do it, John
You're telling me that if 'm laying dead on the floor, you wouldn't take my heart and put it in my kid to save his life
You'd let two people die instead of one because of a technicality
think what John's trying to do is right
Me, too
think it's very brave
Yeah, it's all very noble and brave
But what do you think Mike would want
Or your wife
Mike is too young to know what's good for him
'm his father
It's my job to protect him, and Denise would do the same thing if she was in my place
Are you saying Mike's life is more important than yours
Or that it's okay that Mike grows up without a father
You can have more children, John
What happened to Mike is bad, man
It's the worst
It ain't fair, but you can't kill yourself
Sometimes you've just got to let go and let God take care of it
You've got to accept it
Accept what
That Mike's going to die
No
don't accept it
reject it out of hand
John moves over to Dr
Turner to plea his case
(') know you only think of Mike as a patient, but he's a great kid
Really
He's like magic, you know
He loves bodybuilding
You believe that
And he's funny
You'd like him, Doc
You'd really like him, if you knew him
do like him
Please
You've got to help him
'm begging you
If you ever do anything outside the rules, do this
Take a chance, please
'd like to
really would
But what you're asking crosses the line
It's completely unethical
've crossed the line
No, you've crossed the line
The whole system has crossed the line
paces around the room, his hand on his weapon, his mood very dark and threatening
(') don't think you understand
'm not letting him die
Haven't you figured that out by now
don't care what  have to do
So, what, you're going to kill me if  don't operate
No
'm going to kill myself
puts the gun to his temple
(') And we'll just see what happens
Aw, man, this is messed up
We all know how this works, people
In order for Mike to live, someone has to die
'm the father
It might as well be me
and Turner's eyes meet
Turner doesn't speak for a long moment
Alright
Alright, what
'll do it
If that's what you want
Wait a minute
Are you serious
The room goes quiet
Once he's dead
Why not
Dr
Klein moves to Dr
Turner
You're the finest surgeon 've ever known
You can't just throw your entire career for this man
Yeah, you're not God
It's not up to you to decide who lives and dies
Aw, come on, Mitch
We're all going to die
Not for nothing, Doctor
But if you do this, you're finished
So, what are they going to do
Sue me
Disbar me
Evict me from the country club
Raymond, you're under a lot of stress
You're not yourself
Yeah, well, what is myself
Because right now,  really don't know
Let's see -- He takes his Patek Phillipe watch off and throws it at the wall, smashing it
(') run six miles a day, drive around in my little black Porsche and date girls thirty years younger than me
Is the picture clear now
like twelve hundred dollar shoes and 've always got a great tan
And here's the best part
Everybody kisses my ass and acts as if that's the way doctors are supposed to be, that's the reward
Reward for what
What  am is a plumber
connect valves to tubes and tubes to valves
That's what  do
But back in that room with your son,  got a very short glimpse of my soul
And let me tell you, it's been long lost
But
This is still a hospital
There's a sick kid in there and 'm his doctor
And if there's a heart available, 'll be damned if 'm going to let it go to waste
The room is stunned
-  - medivac chopper swoops down, lands on the big white cross on the helipad tarmac
The doors fly open
medical team quickly disembarks, lifts out a stretcher with a beautiful woman's body and runs across the roof into the hospital
-   - The stretcher is rushed into the
and the body is placed on the surgical table
is waiting, ready
They take the body, prep for organ harvesting
-  - In another room, an   is notified of the beautiful woman's arrival
She's here
He gets up and is on the move, securing his wireless headset and dialing

- The TVs are now off
looks out the window at the evergrowing police build-up
There's an upbeat bound in his step, a sense of relief with the finality of the decision he's made
Come on, guys
Let's hurry it up
They could bust in here any minute
This was your plan all along, wasn't it
Last resort
You think  wanted it to turn out like this
pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolds it
(') This is my will
'm leaving my heart to my son
He holds up a pen
(') need two witnesses
Don't everybody jump at once
ain't signing your death warrant
No way
Come on, people
The sooner we get this done, the sooner we all go home
'll sign
Me, too
They do
(') You know something, man
You're alright
Sure am
Only one thing can stop me now
What's that
Mitch here being -positive
No, sir
Type-
Swear to God
For a moment the mood is light
looks around the room at Maguire, Debby, Mitch, Julie, Lester, and the security guard
Debby can't stop crying again
Hey, you
Yeah
Do yourself a favor
Start doing the right thing, huh
Life's too short
You had a good woman there
You're too smart to be so dumb
looks around the room before he leaves
(') Alright, people
See you in the funny papers
-    - The daisy wheel buzzes, pounding letters onto the print page
Mike Archibald, Hope Memorial Hospital, age 9, 85 pounds
Blood type: -positive
man sitting alone in front of the computer
He rips the copy from the printer, lays it into the fax machine and dials
piercing beep
The paper gets sucked away
- fax machine chirps in the quiet
Reggie picks up the fax, and as he reads, a look of disbelief
Oh, my sweet Jesus
Paper in hand, he sprints out of the ward and down the corridor
'   - John enters to find Dr
Klein checking Mike's vitals
The heart monitor reads 30
Can  have a word with him
Dr
Klein exits and
moves to Mike and gently wakes him up
Hi, Dad
You find me a heart
Yeah, kid
We got you one
Look like you've got a guardian angel
Mike smiles and tries to go back to sleep
(') Try to stay awake for a minute, will you
just need to tell you a few things
want you always to listen to your mother
Because she's your best friend and family is important
He's all over the place, searching for the right words
(') And girls
You're too young for them now, but when the time comes, treat them like princesses because that's what they are
And if you say you'll do something, do it, because your world should be your bond
And if you have a chance to make money, go for it, even if it means selling out once in a while
Don't be a knucklehead like your father
Everything's so much easier with money
He's stumbling, trying to cram a lifetime of advice into five minutes
(') Don't smoke
And try to be kind
But if someone chooses you, be a man and stand up for yourself
And don't get caught up in the bad things, there's too many great things out there
just sits there, the tears running down his face, not knowing what to say
(') Mike
Mike's eyes open
Yeah, Dad
See you later, buddy
Mike closes his eyes before opening and closing his little hand
Bye bye
-  - Reggie races through the hospital, weaving in and out of ambulatory and pedestrian traffic
In his hand, the all important fax
'   - Maguire, Klein and Turner speak in hushed tones as
reenters
When they see him, they immediately go quiet
's eyes are glassy, a look of finality on his face
Let's do it
Maguire gathers fresh, clean towels and makes a pack for the back of
's head
sits on the exam table, takes the Baretta and pops the clip
He then takes a single bullet from his pocket, feeds the clip and chambers the round
Wait a minute
This gun was empty the whole time
Aw, 'm all talk
would never hurt any of you
Only person  ever considered killing was me
- Reggie flies out the main entrance and into the crowd, pushing through the sea of humanity until he reaches Payne, Grimes and Monroe
Miss Payne
You're not going to believe this
We've got a match
Are you sure
Payne studies the fax
-positive
Michael William Archibald
The only status one in the whole country
The heart is ours
It's official
The heart is on the way
Well, 'll be damned
You really put the kid on the list
may be a lot of things, Lieutenant, but  am not a liar
'   - readies himself before laying back on the roll of towels
John
Stop
changed my mind
won't do this
regards Turner with positive affection
You're a good man, Doc
know you'll do the right thing
lifts the gun to his head
- Reggie, Grimes, Payne and Monroe run over to Denise
Mrs
Archibald
have some very, very good news
'   - The moment has come
Everyone's face wears the intensity of it
John holds the gun up, his hand trembling
Nothing happens
Sorry
Safety's on
- Denise reads the fax
Is this for real
You bet
The Lear Jet just landed at 'Hare
The helicopter will be here in fifteen minutes
Grimes offers his walkie-talkie to Denise
You want to do the honors
(into walkie-talkie) John
It's me, baby
Are you there
'   - (
) John, honey
Pick up
hears Denise's voice squawking over the walkie-talkie
He shuts it off
Takes a deep breath
Flips the safety off and puts the gun to his head for the final time
- Denise keeps triggering the walkie-talkie
John
John
Oh, no
Desperate, she grabs the list and starts running towards the  entrance
'   - 's Moves closer to the temple til it touches
- Denise breaks through the police barricade
'   - as John's finger pulls it tighter
-
- The sound is revealed
Not a bullet
It's Denise slapping the list up against the glass windows of the
John
It's a miracle
They found a heart
It's a miracle
- The crowd points and stares as a white medivac helicopter descends from the sky, lights flashing and lands on the roof
Tuck Lampley, hand over his ear, shouting above the noise to bring us more exclusive coverage
The heart is here
Repeat
The heart for little Mike Archibald has arrived
What an unbelievable ending to this incredible, tumultuous day
roar from the crowd is heard as the entrance to the  is unlocked and the front door opens
Mitch and Debby are the first to emerge
(') Oh my goodness, here we go
The first of the hostages are being released
Yes, they're coming out
There's one, two
They appear to be unharmed
But certainly exhausted from what must've been an excruciating ordeal
Julie and the security guard are next
And are quickly ushered away to support vehicles
(') More, now
And there he is
John
is coming out
, in baseball hat and windbreaker, emerges from the hospital
(') The suspect's hands are up
He appears to be surrendering
The police are all around him now
Pointing their weapons and shouting commands
puts his hands behind his head, turns around, kneels and then lays face down on the pavement
(') And they've got him
The police have subdued him
The handcuffs are on, and it's over
It's all over
The crowd voices their disapproval with the rough way
is being apprehended
They cheer their support as he is escorted to a police car
(') If pictures speak a thousand words, well, 'd say these images speak volumes
And now as the bloody stand off comes to an end, we remind you that Channel 8 was here first and has brought you live, moment-to-moment, all-day coverage of "Crisis at Hope Memorial
' Frank Grimes takes in the whole scene
But as he glances at the suspect, a funny look comes across his face
Wait a sec - -  - Mike's gurney flies through the hospital corridors
Running alongside are Turner, Klein, Maguire and Denise
As well as teams of   and a man in green surgical scrubs
As they pass a police checkpoint, we notice the identity of the man in the green scrubs
It's
- As
is pushed into the car, Grimes sees his real identity
It's Lester, dressed in
's windbreaker, collar up, baseball cap pulled way down over his eyes
Grimes shakes his head
Top notch policework
Incredulous, he turns and takes the long walk to the hospital
-   - Dr
Turner and the team work with quiet precision as Mike lays on the operating table, his chest wide open
Behind the partition glass,
and Denise hold on to each other for support as they look on
figure in a rumpled suit settles in next to them and watches
It's Grimes
It's time, John
turns, knows it's over
Can you give me a second, Frank
just need to see this thing through
Sure
Put these on for me, will you
Grimes hands
a pair of handcuffs
John puts them on and the three watch the surgery
The replacement heart is taken out of its container and placed into Mike's chest
But then, something suddenly is wrong
Mike's vital signs start giving out
The gauges dropping at once
It's bad
#1 Blood pressure seventy over thirty-two
#2 Acute respiratory distress
#1 He's fibrillating
don't have a pulse
John and Denise look on, helpless
Dr
Turner barks out commands as the team scrambles to remedy the critical situation
He's going
No
Come on, goddammit
'm not losing this boy
Nut now the long familiar tone of the  is heard
Various news related programming
"Crossfire," "Face The Nation," ,   and "Larry King Live
" Clips dissolve one into the other
#1 #1 cannot let this man free
It sends the wrong message
#2 agree
Although he's paid a heavy price, he took matters into his own hands
#2 #3 Maybe it's the wake up call this country needs
#3 #4 socialized medicine in England has worked
#5 Sure, to a point
Except when it's their life on the line, the Dutch, the English and everyone else go to their private doctors or come to America because we have the best technology
That is if they can afford it
#4 #6 think the decision we see today will tell us a lot about this country
#5 #7 The long awaited verdict is expected today in the trial of John Quincy Archibald, where the jury has been deliberating
- : gavel pounding down
The black-robed  silences the crowd
The courtroom is standing room only
Packed with cops,  cameras, reporters, etc
We see Denise next to a grim-faced Jimmy and Gina Palumbo
As the jury flies into the jury box, the people take their seats
The bailiff hands the verdict card to the judge who reads it before addressing the
Has the jury reached a verdict
The foreman stands, faces the judge
We have, Your Honor
The defendant will please rise

His attorney, a

Standing next to Denise, we   - he looks healthy and rosy-cheeked
He grabs his mother's hand with anticipation

The courtroom explodes in cheers
In the crowd, we see familiar faces: Debby, Dr

Behind them, Maguire

Not guilty
The crowd again roars its approval
Steve and Miriam watch from the gallery, holding a baby girl
Even Rebecca Payne cracks a smile
(') On the final count, False Imprisonment, we find the defendant, guilty
The crowd erupts in protest
The media rush out to file their stories
No
Quiet
Sentencing will be one week from today
stares straight ahead and takes a breath
After a moment, the public defender leads him over to the rail, where he is greeted by Jimmy, Gina, Denise and Mike
He's going to do some time
But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year
And with time served, John will be home very soon
leans over to talk to his son
You alright
Mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears
(') It's okay, slugger
'll be home soon
If you need anything, ask your mother
And Jimmy and Gina will be around
Don't worry
If anybody messes with us, 'll take care of it
embraces his boy and moves over to Denise
year, huh
could have lost you forever
guess  can live with that
hand taps him on the shoulder
looks up
Sees Grimes
Time to go, John
John
'm proud of you
smiles and Grimes starts to lead him away
Give 'em hell, Johnny
Don't worry about nothing
Bye, Dad
Not goodbye
Remember
See you later
- An enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps
They cheer their support as
emerges
Grimes steers
out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in
's face
They ask ridiculous questions about justice, health care, and politics
, uncomfortable with all the attention, has no comment
He pushes past politely, head down, his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice
Hey, John
Good luck, man
recognizes the voice, turns and sees
Both smile to each other as
is pushed further through when -- John
Do you feel like your country has let you down
(quietly) No
It's a wonderful country
'm sorry
couldn't hear you
Could you repeat that
Grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera
He said, "America is the greatest goddamn country in the world
" Now excuse us,  have to take this man to jail
They push past the barricades and into the street
John
John
Look at all this
You're a celebrity, John
Yeah
Check with me in a couple of days
They move to the street and Grimes opens the car door
climbs inside
He looks up to see the , in all its glory, cameras flashing, microphones pointed at
(') This is ridiculous
don't even know these people
What can  tell you
You're their hero
'm not hero, Frank
'm just a regular guy
Yeah, right
Grimes slams the door
The "cherry" light spins, the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people
- On the street,
sees Mike wave to him from the sidewalk, trying to get John's attention
Mike is saying something
turns to look closer and finally he gets it:
- Mike's lips say "Thank you
" - John winks at his boy
-  Mike makes a muscle
- John smiles, and the car picks up speed
- The cop car pulls away
Away from the courtroom
The circus
