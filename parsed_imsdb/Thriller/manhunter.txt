href <b>// --> </b> Manhunter " " Screenplay By Michael Mann July 20, 1984 , ,  -  +  - The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men imposed in front of it
The beach is white sand -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington
His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white sleeves says City, not Florida Keys
-- late thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio- let shorts, belongs
Graham smokes
Crawford drinks from a glass of iced tea
Then: should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work
You don't want to talk about it here
don't want to talk about it anywhere
(beat) If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase
Molly and Kevin will be back soon
How much do you know
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times
' (beat) Confessions
Eighty-six so far
All cranks
He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces
(beat) None of them knew that; What else did you keep out of the papers
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe
The prints are all smooth gloves
He's on a full moon cycle
Both times
His blood is  Positive
Somebody hurt him
Typed him from semen
He's a secretor
Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham
2
Graham flips his cigarette into the surf
Will
you saw this in the papers
The second one was all over
Did you ever think about givin' me a call
No
Why not
The Bureau already has the best lab
Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago
And  got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors
You don't need me
wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack
Last two like this we had, you caught
That was three years ago
And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing
That's not entirely true, Will
It's the way you think
think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way  think
(beat) came down here to get away from all that
You look all right now
am all right
Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket
He keeps them face down
They draw at Will
Crawford knows this
3
If you can't look anymore, understand
As long as they're dead
These are all dead, Will
If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them
Two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond
second family behind a birthday cake at a table
They're all smiling
: looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds
Then he puts them down and looks along the beach
' :  + -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand
-- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands watching the two men, her hand on her hip
Waves careen around her ankles
Her body language openly states hostility
It's towards Crawford
(
) Let's talk after dinner
Stay and eat
(
) ' come back later
got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect Molly starts walking forward
On it
: '  -  +  - are doing dishes
Graham wipes while Molly washes
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here
What did he want
4
He asked how you are
And you said
said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone
'm a forensic specialist, Molly
You've seen my diploma
(sarcastic) got a diploma and everything
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma
(heat) You are open and easy now
It took you a lot of work to get to that
We have it good, don't we
All the things that happened to you before make you know that
There is a soft pleading in her voice
What the hell can  do
(after a pause) What you've already decided
You're not really asking
If  were
(facing him) Stay here with me
Me
Me
Me
And Kevin
(heat) That's selfish, huh
(touches the side of her face) don't care
(beat> He'll never see me or know my name
If we find him, the police will have to take him down
Not me, 'm just looking at evidence
5
As he puts an arm around Molly
: -  - is working in the sand
Behind him Graham is stapling chicken wire to two foot-high fence posts
Will it keep them out
Yeah
How many turtle eggs you think are in here
In this hatchery
Forty to fifty
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh
Yeah, but not now
These will all make it
guaranteed
: -  +  - On the porch swing
Beyond them at the water's edge Graham nothing to each other    the fence
Crawford and Molly say or a while
Then, finally: Whatever  say, you'll take him away, won't you
have to
You're his friend, Jack
Why can't you leave him alone
Because it's his bad luck to be special
He thinks you want him to look at evidence
6
Nobody's better with evidence
But he has the other thing, too
He doesn't like that part of it
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it
There is a pause between them
Molly lights a cigarette
Crawford leans forward, resting his thick, pale, forearms on his knees
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you
No
(beat) don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'
' try to keep him as far away from it as  can
: -  - Small poplars line the curb
It rained
The sidewalks are wet
They are drying in splotches
The street is deserted
The front walk vertically bisects the
An Atlanta Police department car pulls to the curb and stops
The door opens, lighting the interior and Will Graham starts out the passenger side
(distant) Thanks for the lift
'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr
Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone
That's right
There's a  setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both families once half-inch
7
(getting out) Thanks
Graham exits the car and walks  us
We   as he moves through   and see the Leeds family house with all of the Atlanta Police department "crime scene" postings Graham doesn't enter the front door
Be walks around the side
: ,  -  - Three big sliding glass doors
The center one has been re- placed with plywood
It's dark
flashlight's beam starts playing through the bushes in the side yard
, then the light appears and blasts  the
It lights lots of dishes in the sink
The dark kitchen looks like anybody's kitchen
The house feels occupied
The Leed's possessions have been undisturbed
: We hear the lock click and the door slide open as Graham enters
It's like he's a burglar
' walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going
thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly
Graham's feet pass our of frame
,   - is empty
The carpet is dark
We hear Graham's footsteps up the stairs
Then his feet enter the frame and a flash- light beam hits the carpet
It dwells on a couple of dark stains
Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master bedroom
The bedroom is dark
We see nothing
- Graham's hand enters
He hits the light switch
screams at us from the walls
: doesn't visibly react
8
- moves into the room
The bloodstains are extensive
Half the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock
The mirrors are smashed
Taped outlines on the mattress indi- cate where the bodies had been found
Graham opens the file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports
- standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom
The crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic
Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference
intruder entered through kitchen sliding door
Probably a glass cutter
Why didn't he care that he left  saliva on the glass
it was hot out that night
inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him
(beat) The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs
Leeds
He shot Mrs
Leeds as she was rising
Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation
increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates
she lived at least five minutes after she was shot
All her other injuries were post-mortem
(beat> Then he went toward the children's room
(beat) Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray
;
With his throat cut, Mr
Leeds still tried to fight
Because the intruder was moving to the children's room
(beat) in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed
Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot
() 9
(') (beat) Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr
Leed's chest, believed to be post-mortem
What did the killer do with them after they were dead
And before he put the boys back in their beds
: -   - is dark
We see nothing
Light comes on
Graham enters
He rests his hands on the sides of the sink
He turns on the water
He pops two pills, cups his hands under the faucet and drinks
He looks at himself in the mirror
Be is breathing normally
Over his shoulder he sees
:
' still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub
Graham is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom
He doesn't let it unnerve him
: ' ;   -  - The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and sits on the gritty shingles
We're looking for a distressed reaction
There is none
Graham is clamped down
Beyond him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant
More brilliant than they ought to be
The Delta Aquirid meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image
He takes out his tape recorder again
There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch
There's a doghouse in the back yard
Where's the dog
Graham
: ,  -  - Graham riding up with two half-drunk  with big "Hi" badges
One Conventioneer is looking over at the lobby below
10
good-looking woman in a floral dress walks underneath them
Graham is leaning against the glass
#1 like to rip me off a piece of that
#2 Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds
The other cracks up
snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2
#2 sips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare
He smiles: #1 What the fuck are you lookin' at
Graham looks away
The elevator stops
The door opens
Conventioneer #1 drags Conventioneer #2
#l (being pulled out of elevator) What are you, a faggot
Both Conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall
Conventioneer #1 wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist Graham looks away
: -  :   - We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home movie
Mr
Leeds and Mrs
Leeds are behind the table while the youngest boy is in the center
His brother sits next to him
The birthday cake has eleven candles on it
All are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth- day to you
" Mrs
Leeds has her arms crossed underneath her breasts
She's a young mother, sensual and warm
She's smiling
The camera must be on a tripod because Mr
Leeds runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his wife's cheek
He has thinning hair
He's a big man
He looks like a nice guy
He darts out of the frame back to the camera
They finish singing
The youngest Leeds boy blows out the candles
Mr
Leeds holds up for the camera a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon
" big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope
11
The camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to follow the ribbon
The image suddenly ours out
Video noise
has hit the stop button
He picks up a measured field sketch of the master bedroom
The bloodstains are represented in outline
Three are along the left wall
The arterial splashes from Mr
Leeds are on the right wall
Mr
and Mrs
Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat- tress
(into the tape recorder) When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs
Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs
Leeds
What did he do in the interval
Struggling with Mr
Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute
What else
(beat) Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr
Leed's arterial spray
What did killer do after they were dead
Graham can't go any further
He is frustrated
He picks up the phone and dials
He waits
Then: (into phone) Molly
(
) (asleep) Huh
(beat) Will
Is that you
It's me
'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart
Go back to sleep
(beat) love you
(
) Mmmmh
love you, too, Will
Good night
Will hangs up the phone
He reaches over and punches "Play" on the
12
:   - backs up, starts to play and we see the image of Mrs
Leeds again in the home movie: they follow the yellow rib- bon down the stairs to a bicycle
It's indoors
It's rain- ing outside
The eleven-year-old Leeds boy is ecstatic
Mrs
Leeds smiles
(into tape recorder) You moved the kids after you killed them, didn't you
Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs
Leeds on their bed
Did you tie Mr
Leeds sitting up in bed
That's the postmortem ligature on his chest
Did you make them your audience
Did you open their eyes
There is something you can't afford for me to know about
Isn't there
Mrs
Leeds was lovely, wasn't she
It was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn't it
(beat) There was talcum powder on her leg
There was no talcum powder in the bathroom
(beat) The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her
You took off your glove to touch her
' , ---
You touched her with your bare hands
And then you put the gloves back an
And you wiped her down
While your gloves were off
(shouts) : ' snakes out and hits the "Stop" button on the
is picked up and we    to his face
Graham punches numbers into the phone
He waits
He clamps dawn again
He is cold, calm
Jack, this is Graham
Is Price still in Latent Prints
13
(
) He's working on the single print index
What time is it
Get him to Atlanta
(
) You said the guy down here is good
He is good
Bur not as good as Price
(
) What do you want to do
Mrs
Leeds' fingernails and toenails
think he took off his gloves, Jack
(heat) And dust all the corneas of all their eyes
: -   , +  - down the corridor
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time
They dusted everything
The report didn't mention nails and eyes
Why do you think he took his gloves off
Mrs
Leeds was a good-looking woman
'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you
(sudden distaste) 'Intimate
" Yes
'Intimate
' They had privacy
(beat) Everybody else was dead
14
Springfield looks at Graham
Springfield needs answers, not voodoo
Then they enter the squad room
Twenty detectives sit at desks
Graham and Crawford move to the back of the class
All right
House to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks
&  has loaned us two clerks to help cross-matching airline reservations between Birmingham last month and between Atlanta now
(beat) Dr
Princi
, Chief Medical Examiner for Fulton County, walks to the front and stands under a drawing of teeth
He hold's up a dental cast
This is what the subject's teeth look like
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed them from the impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here and off the Jacobi woman last month in Birmingham
(beat) As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors -- the teeth here and here
The teeth look like teeth from a small bear
Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before
Can you add anything
Graham doesn't like talking in public
He stutters and starts to say something
Can't hear you
Can you come up to the front
Graham walks to the front of the room
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse
He only bit women so far, right
That's all we know about
() 15
(') (beat) Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center
suck mark
These don't
So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior
(beat) You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds
know that's pretty thin
(beat) He bites a lot
What's average
Sex murder: three
He likes to bite
Six bad ones in Mrs
Leeds
Eight in Mrs
Jacobi
(beat) that's all  have
Graham sits down
All right
Vice and Narcotics, take the - cowboys and the leather bars
Marcus and Whitman heads up at the funeral
The rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet
Let's go
They start to rise
Springfield remembers
One more thing: 've heard officers referring to the killer as the 'Tooth Fairy
(on laughter) Yeah, yeah, but  don't want to hear that in public or internal memoranda
That's it
Detectives file out
Crawford and Graham remain
Springfield crosses to them and they wait for all the other detectives to leave
(to Crawford) We don't have shit, and we know it
Dr
Princi joins them
16
(to Graham) The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr
Lecter three years ago
(beat) He killed nine people, didn't he
Nine that we know of
Two didn't die
What happened to them
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore
The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter
Psychologists call him a sociopath
They don't know what else to call him
What would you call him
Graham doesn't answer
To yourself
call him a monster
understand he cut you pretty good
(cold right turn> What about the dog
It's at the vet's
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen
icepick or an awl
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it
No
17
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog
(alert) cat
We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat
Neighbors are watching for it
Why don't you get Birmingham
a methane probe out of
and have them cover the backyard
maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it
Crawford starts to move
The
Springfield answers
Yeah
(waits) Lemme put you on the speaker phone
(
) Who am  talking to
Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here
(
) got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm
Springfield reacts
(
) Came off the oldest kid's left eye
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound
Can you make an identification off it
(
) Don't know
The palm came off the nail of Mrs
Leeds' left big toe
want to work these up in my own darkroom
'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon
Hangs up
18
thought Graham was ridiculous
Now his expression is very changed
senses Springfield's staring at him
Graham's face is blank
He leaves
Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches Graham all the way to the door
: -  s  - coming down the stairs
News media are all over Springfield, the Commissioner, the Mayor's
Officer in the b
g
No- body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who separates himself from the pack and darts up to them
He is He starts chasing behind them
Will Graham
Remember me
Freddie Lounds
covered the Lecter case for the Tattler
did the paperback
: walking down the stairs
His face is locked like a steel trap
He's repressing something powerful
(running on, behind them) When did they call you in, Will
What have you got
Graham won't answer him
They are on the sidewalk by now
Lounds, give it a rest
Come on, Graham
Talk to me
Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now
Crawford tries to block Lounds
Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham: How does this guy compare with Lecter
How does he do them
Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to turn him around
19
Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down
The impact  the  Lounds is scared to death
The violence totally surprises us
Graham's face is inches from Lounds
(very low) Keep the fuck away from me
Crawford is pulling on Graham
He can't budge him
Graham lets go
: down the sidewalk and Lounds who slides off the car hood and lands on all fours
(over his shoulder to Lounds) Get the hell away from here, Lounds
: ,  -  +  - Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee
Crawford is looking at him
Finally: snuck in the hospital while was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures
The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls
know
Graham looks away
Then he lights another cigarette
(back to business) Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders
Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification
Jimmie may in the Finder program
if he's ever been printed and in his Index
20
Say we've arrested a good suspect
You walk in and see him
What is there about him that doesn't surprise you
don't know, Jack
He's got no face for me
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right
(pause) We'll get him one way or the other
What's one way
We find an event that connects both families
Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times
Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever
(beat) If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him
We're running it through the computers now
So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families
Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental
It's a haystack
(beat) What's the other
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time
No other possibilities
You think 'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room
' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about
() 21
(') (beat) The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky
He won't stop
Why
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack
See
You do know something about him
(long stare at Crawford; then) 'm going to see Lecter
Crawford's cup of coffee stops in front of his mouth: For Christ's sake, why
(matter-of-fact) To recover the mind set
: -  - In the middle of packing
Then the
(
) Hello, hotshot
Hey, baby
Where are you
(
) At the store
You doin' some good
None you'd notice
'm lonely
(,
) Me, too
And very erotic
Tell me about yourself
(
) Which part
That or the day-to-day
22
(laughs) Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff
(beat) How's Kevin
(
) Kevin's fine
He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in
The dogs dug them up
Tell me what you're doing
Eating junk food
(beat) They don't have a lock on anything, Molly
There's not enough information
Or  haven't done enough with it
(
) Will you be in Atlanta for a while
'm not buggin' you about coming home,  just wondered
don't know
'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon
(
) To do what
have to see somebody
There is a silence
Graham does not want to tell her that he is going to see Lecter
Molly stays cool, she doesn't pursue it
(
) 'm thinking about painting the kitchen
What color do you like, Will
Are you there
(coming back) Yeah
Ah
yellow, let's paint it yellow
(
) Yellow's a bad color for me
' look green at breakfast
Blue, then
(
) Blue is cold
23
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for all  care
(beat) Look, 'm sorry
When  come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and
Molly interrupts: (
) Will,  don't know why 'm talking about this stuff
(beat) called to tell you:  love you and  miss you
And you are doing the right thing
It's costing you, too
And  know that
And 'm here
' be here whenever you come home
Or ' meet you anywhere
Anytime
That's what called to say
Graham holds the phone close to him
As if it were a part of Molly herself
Molly, dear Molly
Go to bed now, baby
(
) love you
: slowly hangs up the phone
He sits, round-shouldered, on the bed
All over the room are clothes out of drawers and closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half- packed
: - Dr
Bloom called me yesterday, Mr
Graham
Or should  call you Dr
Graham
(
) 'm not a doctor
(beat) need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible
24
Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair
He appears repressed, clamped down
Dr
Chilton is a sincere Chief of Staff, but not gifted
Dr
Lecter will stay in his room
That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints
One wall of his room is a double barrier
will have a chair put just outside
might have to show him some material that could stimulate him
As long as it's on soft paper
You may(Pause) find this curious
He pulls an  tape from a drawer and points to the spiky lines
Here Lecter's resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram
Complained of chest pains
Pulse seventy-two
Here he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him
Here he's subdued by the attendant and Lecter's shoulder is dislocated
Do you notice the strange thing
(pause) His pulse never got over eighty- five
Even when he tore into her face
Dr
Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a
response
There is nothing to read in Graham's face
It is a blank
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr
Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr
Graham
Can you tell me anything about him
No
25
When you saw Dr
Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies
And did that help you identify him
looks at Graham
Dr
Chilton has seen a lot of hostility
Right now he's seeing some more
(stands) want to see Lecktor now
Uh
sure
-  - We hear three locks opening
The door opens
Graham enters
An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again
As Graham is walking towards us, we and
It makes the b
g
disorienting as we get closer to Graham's face
The   as Graham sits in a single chair
We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at
Now: ' : 6x10 cage
In the center of the bars separating Graham from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet
The occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him
In the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer
In the cell -- laying on his bunk -- is
He appears to be asleep
His back is to Graham
He has not stirred
Then: That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago
keep getting it for Christmas
: ' turns to us
His small eyes drill into Graham's brain
Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham is the patient
Did you get my card
got it
Thank you
26
' struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his emotional reactions
And how is Officer Stuart
The one who was the first to see my basement
Stuart is fine
Emotional problems,  hear
He was a very promising young officer
Do you ever have any problems, Will
No
Of course, you don't
(pause) 'm glad you came
My callers are all professional
Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere
Second-raters, the lot
Dr
Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry
And
Very interesting, even to a layman
Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his head
Then: layman
, layman
Interesting term
So many experts on government grants
And you say you're a 'layman
' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will
Do you know how you did it' You've read the transcript
It's all there
No it's not
Do you know how you Did it Will
27
It's in the transcript
What does it matter now
(smiles) It doesn't matter to me, Will
want you to help me, Dr
Lecktor
Yes,  thought so
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham
Yes
You read about it, 'm sure
In the papers
don't rear out the articles
(laughs) wouldn't want them to think  was dwelling on anything morbid
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you
thought you would have some ideas
Why should  tell you
There are things you don't have
Research materials
could speak to the Chief of Staff
Chilton
Gruesome, isn't he
He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle
(laugh;) He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test
Hah
Sat there waiting for -13 to come up
It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground
was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation
laughed in his face
(beat) Never mind, it's boring
28
You'll get to see the file on this case
And there's another reason
Pray tell
thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person 'm looking for
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me
No
knew that 'm nor smarter than you are
Then how did you catch me, Will
You had disadvantages
What disadvantage
You're insane
You're very tan, Will
Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to Lecktor
Your hands are rough
They don't look like a cop s hands anymore
That shaving lotion is something a child would select
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it
Another silence
Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling into Graham's head, trying to find out things
Trying to find a way to hurt Graham
He's very threatening
Then relaxes: Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity
29
don't think 'll persuade you
You'll do it or you won't
Dr
Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best
(interrupts) Do you have the file with you Yes
Pictures
Yes
let me have them,, and  might consider it
No
Do you dream much, Will
Good-bye, Dr
Lecktor
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet
Graham gets up and starts to walk away
let me have the file
Then 'll tell you what  think
Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant
Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding tray
Lecktor pulls it through
sits in the chair
He wants a cigarette
He doesn't take one
He waits
And he watches
What he sees: 30
' : Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour- nals, -shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with- no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light
Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal
The shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes
It is a high resolution, highly brilliant sec of images
It feels like a hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the mind of Graham
It is interrupted when: (
) There is a very shy boy, Will
snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor
What were the yards like
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it
Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will
It appears quite black
If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing
That's interesting
It's not 'interesting'
You thought of it before
Yes
'd considered it
You came here to look at me, Will
To get the old scent again, didn't you
want your opinion
31
don't have one right now
When you do have one 'd like to hear it
May  keep the file
haven't decided yet
'll study it, Will
When you get more files, 'd like to see them, too
You can call me
When have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone
Would you like to give me your home number
Threat
No
Do you know how you caught me, Will
Goodbye, Dr
Lecktor
You can leave messages for me at the number on the file
Graham bangs on the door
Locks are starting to be unlocked
Graham can't wait to get out of here
He wants the locks to get unlocked faster
Do you know how you caught me
The door is now open
Graham fights down the impulse to run through
As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears is : (
) The reason you caught me, Will, is: we're just alike
You want the scent
Smell yourself
The   shut on Lecktor
: 32
: ,  -  - walks down the corridor
He's very stiff
He's walking towards the outside door
The door is a rectangle of white light that sends daggers of brilliance across the highly polished institution's floor
Graham walks for the light
: -  - The   open and Graham comes out into daylight and air
The air is tactile to him
He can almost feel the motes of dust and light that swim freely
He breathes
' : is dappled with pointillist points of color: a spectral breakup
As it returns to a normal green
: breathes
He stands in front of the sign on the building: "
" He leans against the railing and breathes clean air
The image is flattened in a
We hear a
It and -

Be puts the camera to his eye again and hits the button
The   knocks off three shots
: :,  -      - The quadrants display 4 home movies at six times normal speed: an old couple, 2 men, a baby and a family
The fam- ily quadrant slows to normal
We  in on it
We will come to know these people as the
An 11-year-old boy, a I4-year-old girl, Mr
Sherman and Mrs
Sherman

" Mrs
Sherman has brown hair
She wears a bikini
She has a nice body
She's sensuous and tan in her thirties
She dives into the pool
The next shot: water
Out of the water surfaces Mrs
Sherman
She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair
33
couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the image
Mrs
Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool and shoves down to hoist herself out
Her breasts are glis- tening
Her teeth are white
She smiles at the camera
Whoever controls the console puts Mrs
Sherman in reverse
It runs forward again
Mrs
Sherman's glistening body coming our of the water
: Beyond is the screen
The man at the console is He has a weightlifter's body
We don't see his face
Black goggles with red lenses are on the console
He puts them on and watches Mrs
Sherman
: -  - It slams open
Dollarhyde enters and walks through the dim green light past the developers in his black goggles with red lenses
Thousands of feet of negative move through the tank on rollers
Dollarhyde walks past the baths
We him to the door

Dollarhyde enters
As he reaches the next door
: -  - enters and we   him past film snaking across pul- leys and rollers through the drying cabinets
As Dollarhyde passes the dryers

newspaper's under his arm
As he waits to pay, approaches
She, too, wears goggles, but on a lanyard around her neck
She's petite, fragile
Dollarhyde towers over her
Mr
Dollarhyde
- looks up
34
His face bears the scars of a -plast procedure to fix a harelip and cleft palate
Immediately, in characteristic gesture, he curls his right hand under his nose to hide his -plast scars
Yes, Eileen
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of the number three developer
But he caught it
And
On the densitometer it came out within tolerances
Thank you, Eileen
Graciously Dollarhyde lets her go first and then he crosses to an empty table
He opens his newspaper
' where the fabric stretches between his shoulder blades and past his cheap haircut's line at the nape of his neck into his left shoulder to reveal he's reading the National Tattler
It's about Will Graham with a Freddie Lounds byline
The only words we catch are: " Manhunter Consults Fiend Who Tried To Kill Him, by Freddie Lounds
" We also catch: "The Tooth Fairy - Psychopathic Slayer of Entire Families in Birmingham and Atlanta
" : takes off the black goggles with red lenses
His eyes are white violet
He turns the page
' It's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor
It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary colostomy bag
black square is imposed over his genitals
The caption reads: "Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover- ing from Near-Fatal Slashing By Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecktor
" 35
: in newsprint, the one Lounds took at the Chesapeake hospi- tal
The half-tone dots comorising the image are visible
Dollarhyde's massive finger slides across the image, brush- ing it sensitively
It works its way to Graham's face and the finger stops and blots it out
: , '  -  - receives a telephone
The attendant who brought it waits
Thank you so much
'll call you when 'm finished
Attendant hesitates
Then he leaves
Lecktor is allowed to call his attorney in privacy
picks up the phone and punches in his number
Can  have the number of Dr
Sidney Bloom, University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry, please
(beat) Thank you
(dials again) Dr
Sidney Bloom, please
(
) He's not in today, bur 'll connect you with his office
What's his secretary's name again
(
) Linda King
Just a moment
The   four times
(
) Linda King's desk
Hi, Linda
(
) Linda doesn't come in nights
36
Maybe you can help me
This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company
Dr
Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone
Linda never sent me the address and phone number
(
) She'll be in, in the morning
have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes
'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me
There is a pause
Lecktor is waiting
(
) She doesn't have a Rolodex
(smiling) ' bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone
(
) Yeah
Well, zip that little Pointer right on down to the letter
(
) Okay
We're looking for Graham
The man the book is supposed to go to is a Ms
Will Graham
(
) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, Now 'll bet it has his home address there, too (
) (beat) 3680 DeSote Highway
Marathon, Florida
37
Thank you very much
the phone as Lecktor hangs up
: L1011,   -  - Squeezed into a narrow seat
He sits on the aisle
Next to him is a seven-year-old girl, at the window her mother
He opens and reads a Telex in yellow envelope: "
,
" Clears the trays
contorts his body to pull his briefcase from under the seat in front
He extracts the Leeds and Jacobi files
From each he takes a snapshot of a happy family picture and paperclips them to the front of the files
He stands them on the dinner tray and stares at them
' : the Jacobi family
As we get  and Mrs
Jacobi in a bikini, her face abstracts into pointillist dots of color
: -   - moves down to us
approaches in   raising a bag of shrimp and a six- pack of Dos Equis
- guiding the engine down, wears faded violet shorts and no shirt
We see a huge circular scar ending in a hook on his abdomen as the engine lands
38
(reverb, distant) Block her off, Mitch
Graham waves to Molly
: On the dock
The hot sun turns the water a brilliant aqua and silver
Graham's tan body in the violet shorts on the silver wood
Molly reaches in the bag for another shrimp
Graham looks at her
as she rips the head off the shrimp
The warm mouth, Her shiny teeth look like a Pepsodent commercial
Viscera trail
As the shrimp is ripped apart we see: ' In horror
And
, we hear  coming from a differ- ent place as we
: L1011 -  - snaps awake
The child next to Graham is screaming
People stare
The mother is shouting at him
Graham is confused, stunned
He doesn't know what's wrong
He looks around
The Stewardess is handling things on his tray in front of him
The file has spilled open
Crime photos of the Leeds and Jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost separated head of Mr
Jacobi glaring at a weird angle -- the pornography of it all -- are spilled across Graham's tray and in his lap
mumbles apologies, scrambles to collect crime photos
The mother wants her seat changed
39
Graham is excruciatingly embarrassed, clumsily shoving them back into their files
: ,   -    - We   the knob
it starts to turn
Slowly
Sud- denly: door  open revealing real estate agent and Graham, It was last Thursday
This couple from Duluth
had them down to the short strokes talking mortgages --  mean, that man could have written a check for the whole goddamn place
'm figuring: Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch, you gonna unload this turkey
(beat) Then the squad car rolls up
They ask a coupla questions
The good officers give them the whole fuckin' guided tour
Who was laying where
Where all the blood sprayed
terrific
(beat) Off they go in their Sedan DeVille the hell out of here
Have any single men asked to look at it
Haven't asked me
(beat) Took four coats of interior latex, five in places
(pause) You can drop that key in the mailbox
You don't have to come back by, do you
Uh-uh
Geehan leaves
The door closes with a
- In the empty white living room
Graham walks
Bare floors and dead air
His footsteps echo in the empty house
: 40
-  - An image from Bill Owens' "Suburbia
"  family house
No different than any other family house around
But it is somehow sinister in its vacancy
It ought to be littered with bicycles and wagons: the signs and symbols of suburban normalcy
to reveal the back of Graham staring at the house from across the street
: -  - In a different position staring at the rear of the house from a neighbor's bushes
We don't know why Graham is staring at the Jacobi house from different vantage points
: - ' : 3/4 Graham looking at the house from the third vantage point
And turned earth where the cat was found
: starts backing up and we   him
He looks over his shoulder at us and keeps walking backwards
Trees enter the frame on the left and right
He stumbles through underbrush into a dry streambed
He backs up a slope on the other side and finds himself in some trees
There are three
Graham looks around
now obscure the Jacobi house
Something glints right
At the base of one elm tree
ring tab from a soft drink can is half-buried in leaves
Graham's fingers move leaves aside
41
looks slowly up the tree trunk
Wedged into the first strong limb, it's from the instep of a boot
hangs his coat on the branch of a neighboring tree and climbs the far side of the elm
His head and his cheek raise through limbs
His eye is six inches away when he finds a soft drink can wedged between limb and trunk
love it
Sweet Jesus, yes come on, can
He photographs its placement with the camera on his belt, bracketing exposures
Then he tears a small branch and uses it to put the can in an evidence bag
Graham climbs higher until his foot is level to where he saw the mud
He looks to his left
Something he sees stops him cold
is carved in the wood
photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by a cutting tool
Then he looks
' : perfect view
high in the tree, leans back against the trunk
Re seems frozen
Then: (mumbling to himself) after you killed the cat and threw it into the yard, my man, you climbed up hero and waited
You used a cutting tool on these branches so you could see
() 42
(') You watched the children and passed the time whittling and dreaming
(beat) When night came, you saw them passing their bright windows and you watched the shades go down, and you saw the lights go out one by one
And after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you
(shouts) ' ,
(beat) That's why you like houses with big yards, the easier to see them : -  + Geehan showing some new candidates around the house
It's a and they look interested
They don't build houses this way anymore: solid lath and plaster construction
None of your drywall stuff and aluminum studs here
No sirree Bob
like it, hon
Let's go to your office and see if we can work out some terms
Great
You goin' love this house
Geehan's got a sale
He's at the front door
He opens it
: -  - The door is opened by Geehan and his big smile, shepherding his customers-to-be out the front door
The smile falls off Geehan's face
The young buyers look quizzically

, , + with flashers going are converging onto the scene
Will Graham is at the nearest police car talking on a cellular phone
'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints
(fast beat) need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving
Then  need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch need to know what kind of cutting tool he used
: ,   -  - On phone to Graham
Is it weird
(
) The mark
Yes
If the Documents section can't do it
'll send it up to Langley

) Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds
As another line on Crawford's phone rings, we   to his secretary, 's area
(fading up)                      (fading down) Special Agent Crawford's       No
The killer's not in office
the Single Print Index
He must never have been printed
Sarah
We don't hear what's said to her
44
No, Mr
Graham is not in the office, bur let me
(beat) Wait, 'll be glad to
(beat) Yes, he'll be in the office later, but let me
She holds the receiver as though it had died in her hand and crosses into Crawford's office
(to Graham) bur if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on
What
He asked for Will
He said he might call back tonight
tried to hold him
'm sorry
He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors
"' (to Graham) Will
Get right back here
He just called
-  - Who did he ask for
(
) You
: -  + - It's now sunset out the window
Both men are tense
On Crawford's desk are two new telephones and a tape recorder
Also in the room are Sarah and
, a forensic psychologist
Food wrappings and Styrofoam coffee cups litter his desk
Bloom only ate half his pastrami on rye: Anybody want the rest of the cholesterol special
Thanks, no
so how do  play him, Sidney
45
Compliment him
Tell him most people don't have the intellectual capacity to understand what has happened, that sort of thing
(beat) If he's paranoid, play into his grievance
Let him air it
(beat) If he's picked you as an adversary and wants to gloat, give him what he's after
little at a time
very little
If it's all electronic switching we'll need a minute for the trace
Graham turns to the window
Crawford taps a pencil on his desk
They wait, : -  - Crawford's feet are on his desk
Sarah yawns
Graham leans against the other wall
Stony silence
They react
more
(into phone) Special Agent Crawford's office
(beat) Bill, call back on twenty-four four
We need to keep this line clear
She hangs up
Crawford takes Bill's call on the other line
The rest exhale tension and go back to waiting
: '  -  - Runs water
stares at it
He puts his hands under and runs cold water on his upturned wrists
: 46
'  -  - Looking through reports
He picks up a pencil and starts to correct a line when:
Where the hell's Graham
He went to the men's room
For Christ's sake get him
An assistant runs out
Sarah's anxious
: -  - Running
He slips on the polished floor, recovers himself He darts through Crawford's door
: '  - tries to catch his breath as Sarah snaps up the phone
Special Agent Crawford's office
(she nods; it's him) Could you hold on a second, 'll see if  can find him
Sarah punches hold
Crawford is counting seconds
He raises his thumb
Graham grabs the phone
(calm) This is Will Graham
Can  help you
(
) No
can help you
don't understand
(
) Atlanta and Birmingham
47
scribbles on a piece of paper
(
) Do you know something about that
(
) Why do you think  called
(
) get a lot of calls
Most of them are from people who say they know things
Crawford holds up the piece of paper
It says: "Chicago phone booth
Police scrambling
" Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on
Do you
(
) You tell me what you know about him
'll tell you whether you're right or not
Let's get straight who we've talking about
(beat) Are you the man 'm interested in
(
) don't think 'll tell you
He's right-handed
(
) Most people are
He's misunderstood
(
) Cut the general crap
Graham stares at Crawford
Crawford makes a circular motion with his hand: string him on
He's very strong physically
(
) That's true
48
He's white and six feet tall
You haven't told me anything yet
(
) Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs
Leeds and 'll tell you if you're right or not
don't want to do that, (
) Goodbye
Graham and us hear a telephone booth door slam open
We hear a receiver fall with a
He hear faint voices
The receiver bangs as it's swung on the cord
Everyone in the outer office hears it on the speaker phone
They also hear: 2ND  (
,) Freeze
Don't even twitch
Now lock your fingers behind your head and back our of the booth slowly
Spread 'em
Graham drops the phone
Tension floods out of him
In the outer office people are cheering, His eyes almost start to tear in relief as he turns his back and looks out the window
' ecstatic
2ND  (
) Who am  speaking to
Graham grabs the phone
Will Graham,
2ND  (
) This is Sergeant Stanley Riddle, Chicago Police Department
Will you tell me what the hell's goin' on You tell me
You have a man in custody
49
(
) Damn right
(beat) Freddie Lounds
Graham's face
It locks in rage
(
) Can you hear me
(beat) Are you preferring charges against him or you want him to just run along
(hollers) Yeah
'm preferring charges
Obstruction of justice
You lock that asshole up
You hold him for the
Attorney
You
: ,   -   - grabs for the phone
Will, listen
: ,
'  - - There is a  on his door
Come in
Dr
Chilton
Yes
When we were cleaning out Dr
Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book
We got him out of there and dug around
Dr
Chilton reacts
(fast) Do you have it
50
Yeah
It's right here
Guard pulls three sheers of toiler paper with writing on them out of his pocket
We   it
is already dialling a number
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again
Has anyone else handled it except you
No
: '  - Sarah answers the phone
Special Agent Crawford's office
In the b
g
all hell is breaking loose
Crawford and Graham are both hollering into the phone at Freddie Lounds
Speak up, please
can hardly hear you
(
) (shouting) said  need to speak to Special Agent Crawford or Mr
Graham
Right away
(holding one ear closed) 'm sorry
Special Agent Crawford and Graham are tied up tight now
Can  get them to call you back
(
) (going nuts) This is Dr
Chilton
At the Chesapeake Hospital
Will you please call them this is very, very urgent
(beat) 'll hold on
51
Sarah puts Chilton on "Hold
"  her  the room
She starts to say something
Crawford holds up a hand
(hollering) How'd you know 'broken mirrors
' Bribe a cop
(beat) Tell it to the
Attorney, Lounds
(seeing Sarah) What is it
It's a Dr
Chilton, sir
He says it's urgent
Graham punches the phone and takes the call
Crawford's yelling at Lounds
It's Will Graham
(
) Well, it's about goddamn time have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and
Where did you get it
Graham waves Crawford to the other phone
(
) From Hannibal Lecktor's cell
It was hidden in a book
(to Lounds) Run along to the police station, Freddie
We'll talk to you when we get around to it
Crawford punches into Dr
Chilton's call
: -
- (
) Can you read it to me
52
It's written on toilet tissue
(reads ) 'My dear Dr
Lecktor,  wanted to tell you 'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me
know that you alone can understand what 'm becoming
(reads ) ' know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what  am becoming
Just as the source of light is burning
(beat) Mr
Graham, there's a hole torn and punched our, then it says
(reads) ' have a complete collection of your press notices
f think of them as unfair
As unfair as mine
The "Tooth Fairy
" What could be more inappropriate
Investigator Graham interests me
Very purposeful locking
hope we can correspond
(beat) There's another piece missing here
' read the bottom part
(reads ) 'After  hear back from you, might send you something wet
Signed: Avid Fan
(to Graham) It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom
punches the other line
Sarah, order a chopper
want the next thing smoking and  don't care whose
Ours
Or the Marines
Then call Documents
Tell them to scramble a team
want everybody moving in five minutes
(punches into Dr
Chilton's line) Dr
Chilton, please do not handle the note
have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up
53
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell
don't want him to know we found it
(beat) Where's Lector now
(
) In a holding cell
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious
(
) Three, four hours
Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall
Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something, (
) Yes
We can manage all that
(hits another line) Brian
We have a note coming in on the fly
Possibly from the Tooth Fairy
Number one priority
, It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents
Graham and  will be walking it through
: ,     - - is bent over a microscope
She's under it
Behind her a male assistant brushes a child's bib overalls with a metal spatula
He is collecting whatever debris comes off the clothing onto a white paper sheet
lifts something with tweezers
She leans away from the micro- scope
One hair, Graham
Maybe a thirty- second of an inch
couple of blue grains
'll work it up
What else have you got
54
Hair from Lecktor's comb
Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use
This is hair from the cleaning man
: -   - winces at the sight of the paper
He slips it under the helium cadmium laser
bombards the toilet paper with light
Growing smudges appear on the paper
(
) Perspiration stains, nothing else
(beat) How many guys handled this without gloves
(
) The cleanup man and Lecktor
(
) The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers
But the others
(beat) could fume it, Will, but couldn't guarantee the iodine stains would fade our in the time you've got to get it back
(
) Ninhydran
Boosted with heat
(
) No
We couldn't wash it after can't get a print off this, Will
There isn't one
(
) Dammit
: -   - is underlit by his translucent light box
The note is on it
55
(without looking up) How long do  have
Twenty minutes max
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out
(beat) At the top it says: ' hope we can correspond
' And then the hole begins
(beat) It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away
(
) He doesn't have anything to cut with
moves under a rostrum camera setup
There are lights mounted on a 360-degree rim even with the base of the rostrum Bowman hits a switch
The top lights go out
The side lights are very oblique
: Under the oblique light the tooth impressions stand out
We hear a   as they are photographed
(
) Now we can mash it a little
pane of glass descends on the note and flattens the jagged edges of the hole
: are tattered and smeared with vermillion ink
Bowman's fingers hit it
The room is darkened, except for a dull glow from the infrared source
56
(chants under his breath) You're so sly, but so am
Bowman switches to a closed-circuit  camera
The image focuses as Bowman focuses the lens
Then: The ink smear is gone
Fragments of writing appear
(
) Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't
(
) That could be the tip of a 't
Here and here
And here
(
) At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r
,  + at the monitor lit by the infrared glow
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler
The stuff about me and Lector
don't know any other paper that carried it
there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler
Personal ads
As they run out of the room: : -   - Everyone we've seen is assembled: Graham, Crawford, Beverly Katz, Jimmie Price and Bowman
57
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now
When do they go to press
In thirty-five minutes
Christ
After we find Lecktor's response, we substitute our own
Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor's message
Here's what he'll find, Bill
(reads ) 'Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements
Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central
Left luggage 72683
It's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout
He shows: we take him
(beat) Anything from Chicago
Not yet
Let's get to the physical
There was no print
'm here for kicks
One whisker
Scale counts and core size match Hannibal Lecktor's
So does color
The color's different than the Tooth Fairy's taken in Birmingham and Atlanta
Three blue grains and some dark flecks went to Brian's end
58
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine
Must be from the cleaning man
There are several particles of dried blood
Not enough to type
Bowman
It's Snow White toilet paper
National distribution
Bowman sets up his photographs on an easel

This is your boy
(beat) He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out
In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions
We can make out: 'six-six-six'
(beat) didn't spot it until  had this high-contrast print
advised Chicago as soon as  saw it
Issue the toilet paper tear as a
The phone
Graham punches the speaker
(
) This is Chester here
Who am talking to
Will Graham, Jack Crawford
(
) We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it
It's being Telexed to you right now
Read it
(
) (reads) 'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me
' 59
That's it
Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me
(
) 'You're very beautiful
Christ
(
) ' offer one hundred prayers for your safety
Find help in john 6:22, 8:16 9:1;Luke l:7, 3:1; Galatians 6:11
15:2; Acts 3:3; Revelations 18:i; Jonah 6:8
(beat) It's signed: 'Bless you, 6:6:6' Bowman is already running through the onion-skinned pages of a Bible he took from a shelf
Nobody talks to him
(checks watch) twenty-eight minutes
(low to Sarah) Cryptography at Langley
They got shot a Telex
They're on if now
Everybody exhibits disciplined surface calm
The tension is screaming underneath
furiously looking through pages of the Bible, suddenly stops
(to Graham) No
(beat) The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code
It's a book code
(beat) And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him
Book code
60
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number
The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter
But what book
Not the Bible
No
Galatians 15:2
Galatians has only six chapters
The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters
Lecktor wasn't using a Bible
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out
Right
(beat) What about sweating Lecktor
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student
(beat) He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip
it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books
Where
Library of Congress
Bowman's our the door
61
Twenty-five minutes
We won't make it in time
(looks at watch) We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after
Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper
Yes
And 'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says
And if we pull it, we lose a week
We only have two to the next full moon
It's your call, Will
What do we do
Graham has to decide
Long pause
Then he looks up: Run it
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write
We will feel sick for a very long time
: -  - The floor is in focus
In the b
g

We don't know why we are  on the empty floor
Then, a stack of "Tattlers" hits the floor

Sheets are twisted between his legs

His arms are widespread
The phone
Will Graham doesn't hear it
It keeps
on Graham
Finally, he stirs, then fights his way up out of sleep
: sits up
His hand snakes out and grabs the phone to make it stop ringing
Who is it
(
) Will, Bowman just broke the code
It was a James Beard cook book
You need to know what it says right now
What'd it say
(
) 'll tell you in a second
Now listen to me: everything is okay, 'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when  tell you
Tell me now
(
) It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida
Save yourself
Kill them all
(beat) It's your home address, Will
The bastard gave him your home address
Get me a plane

) Wait, Will
Get me a plane

Kevin enters
Mom
Kevin looks over her shoulder out the window as if he's scared of something
What time is it
Mom, someone's outside
There's noises
starts and sits up
-  & are empty
Dark shadows play against darkened walls
we hear crashing wave
Moonlight makes trees whipped in the wind throw dappled shadows across the corridor
Molly enters the frame in
We   her in a -   behind the back of her head
She feels vulnerable
The dappled leaves whip across her face in a sudden gust
Molly's head snaps around

Beyond is the ocean with moonlight on the surf
Nothing
moves into the kitchen
streetlight hits part of the kitchen with a dim phosphorescent green
(
) Mom
(whispers) Go into your room and lock the door
(
) Mom
64
Go ahead
He catches Molly's eye: ' : silhouette shape moves past the window
The angle of the streetlight plays its shadow on the wall against Molly
: frozen
She hears the outer screen door being opened
& The shape is at the door
Molly takes a couple of steps, and can't go any further
breathless, opens the door
Fast
reveals Florida State
Are you all right, ma'am
(fast breathing) Yes
Why
(beat) What's going on : -  +  - As Molly comes out of the house, we   and a very     revealing: Four state trooper cars parked on Graham's property
On the road are two roadblocks 100 yards apart on either side of Graham's house
All their flashers are going
Molly looks around in confusion
We see her turn to the sea, a coast guard launch pulls to 100 yards off the beach
Its searchlight plays on the water's edge then across the property
Molly look; at all the policemen
: 65
-    - advances on us, its engine screaming
Its front wheel brakes to a stop right before
opens
Running down the stairs and across the tarmac is Will Graham in shirtsleeves with a Car-15 assault rifle with collapsible stock
His eyes scan the perimeter
moving fast, follow Graham
Their eyes sweep the terminal area
One carries an Uzi submachine gun, the other two, handguns
hussle Molly and Kevin between them from their cars towards Graham
Two carry suitcases
+  + inside the protective barrier of men
: Graham moves Molly and Kevin up into the Gulf Stream men follow
The troopers back off
The flashers on their cars are still turning
with the Gulf Stream as it taxis to the head of the runway
It pauses a moment, then blasts down the runway and up into the morning sun
: ,  -  - Then it opens
Molly and Kevin, followed by Graham
Unmarked  cars are parked on the front lawn
Molly enters the foyer, looks around and stops
Holiday Inn decor
Who decorated this place, Richard Nixon
Molly takes a deep breath
Then lets it out
She's tired
Graham takes her hand
66
sorry, Molly
'm sorry this happened to you
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us
(touches his face) And if  survive the wallpaper we'll be okay
(Graham has to smile) He's after you now, isn't he
She didn't check to see that Kevin is our of earshot
Graham does
It's a precaution
(to Kevin) Why don't you run down to the bay
They got a swimming float
'll hang around in here
'll just be in the kitchen, Mom
(to Molly) What is he
Afraid to leave you alone with me now
' (beat) He read the Tattler piece, didn't he
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution
Be asked me if  knew
said yes
wanted to talk to him
He said he wanted to bring it up to you
Face to face
Good for him
(beat) Thanks a lot, Freddie
(to Kevin) Kevin
We're going grocery shopping
: -  +  - push a basket collecting stuff from the shelves
Other families are shopping The place is medium-crowded
Mind- dulling  comes from the ceiling
67
Is there anything  need to know to see about Mom
No
You're very well-protected
No one can find our where you are
Barry's mom had this newspaper
It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital
Is it true
Yes
figured 'd ask you
was in the psychiatric wing
It bothers you,  finding out  was in there
doesn't it
told my dad before he died, 'd take care of Mom
And 'll do it
(beat) This guy wants to kill you
We don't know that
Are you gonna kill him
No
It's just my job to find him
(beat) was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs
How did it happen
Hobbs was insane
He was attacking college girls and he killed them
How
With a knife
() 68
(') (beat) found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls
The kind of shred a pipe threader makes
was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers
It took a long time
In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs
saw it and it was
, peculiar
(beat) was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment
was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me
She was dying
(beat) sent the officer with me to call a  team
But  could hear kids in there and screaming
couldn't wait
You went in the apartment
Yes
Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind
He was cutting her
shot him
We get the feeling Graham is leaving out lots of pieces and gives Kevin only the bare bones of what he needs to know
kept thinking there must be some way  could have handled it better
It kept replaying in my mind
Later  got depressed
doctor friend of mine, Dr
Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital
After a while  got some distance on it and was okay
Did the girl die
No
She got all right
after a while
And Hobbs died
69
(nods) yes
Kevin pauses, then asks with 11-year-old innocence: Killing somebody feels that bad
: turns and stares at Kevin: Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in the world
Kevin thinks about this for a long time
He nods
He feels he understands Graham and is closer to him for it: What kind of coffee do you like
Huh
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you
Kevin reaches for the coffee and puts it in the basket
Mom likes that, too
:  + walk down the aisle
Graham puts his hand over Kevin's shoulder
They look like father and son
As they disappear around a corner
: ,  -  :  + - Beyond is Chesapeake Bay and the nightlights of Baltimore reflecting across it
The swimming float bobs in the distance
One yellow light is on it
:  +
The grass looks cold in the moonlight
Holly wears a heavy cardigan
70
Behind them -- with yellow lights -- the house looks like a motel
It's hard to have anything, isn't it
Rare to get it, hard to keep it
This is a damn slippery planet
When she said this she was staring out to sea
Now she turns to look at Graham and puts a hand on his arm
He still stares out to sea: Slick as hell
Then Graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own
You remember when we first met
And were together alone in that room
And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to
And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and  asked you what was wrong
remember
Do you remember what you said
Yes
said this is too good to live
Molly stares into his eyes
Time is luck, Will
(heat ) know the value of our days
They stare into each other
There's a pause
They rise
She puts her arm around Graham's waist
They start towards the house
Let's go to bed
'll rub your back
: -  +  - need to talk to you about Will Graham
71
What about him
need to ask you questions of a psychological nature
Remember when you asked for a study on him,  refused
Same goes for now
That was Peterson upstairs
It was you who did the asking
He doesn't think you run mind games on him
wouldn't presume to try
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you
You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him
Why's that
Do you think he's psychic
He's an eideteker
He has almost total recall
But  don't think he's psychic
What he has it empathy and projection  He can assume your point of view and mine
, and some other points of view that scare and sicken him
Why aren't you ever alone with him
Because 'm professionally concerned about him
And he'd pick up on that
He's fast
He hates being prodded and poked
(beat) So do
(beat) What do you want
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs
Could he kill again if he had to save his life
Or would he hesitate
72
'll tell you the events
The psychology's none of your business
Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat
Graham shot him with his
38 six times
Hobbs still didn't go down
He had to wade in
That's when it happened
No
It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital
She saved her carotid artery
, but lost three fingers and her larynx
She was connected up to a voice box
When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy
' (beat) That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown
What's the bottom line
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself
(beat) What are you planning, Jack
Could he handle a direct contact
don't recommend it
(
) You don't recommend what, Sidney
Crawford is surprised at Graham's entry
Bloom isn't
Crawford has a proposition don't think it's a good idea
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me
So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out
Give him a clean shot
() 73
(') (beat) That's what you were thinking, isn't it
Crawford's embarrassed
Bloom said Graham was fast
'll use Lounds
Now Bloom's surprised
Sidney, he doesn't read the "Sunday Times literary supplement
He reads Lounds in the "Tattler
" (beat) And  want this over with
Fast
: -  +  - Graham leans against a table, his back to a window
believe he's socially maladjusted
Laughed at by his contemporaries
How does he rate compared to Dr, Hannibal Lecktor
He's not as intelligent
to reveal Bloom, Crawford, a photographer and assistant
Graham motions for Lounds to turn off his tape recorder
(to Bloom) What have we missed
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict
fear of being gay
He objects to the word 'fairy
' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead
believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds
Graham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again
74
The killer has sexually molested all his male victims
He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex
(beat) Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life
(added afterthought) And probably had sexual relations with his mother
Crawford stifles a laugh
How long will you stay in Washington
Until we've taken out the Tooth Fairy
Graham gestures for Lounds to turn off the tape recorder
All right
Let's shoot the pictures
(to Crawford) want shots with me and Graham together
Graham reacts
'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You want this to look real, don't you
'   :  + Lounds lays Graham's arm over his own shoulder and mugs :or the camera
Behind him is the flood-lit Capitol dome and the sign of a motel across the street
Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus
He has to be able to read it, but it can't look too obvious
Lounds barks orders to the still photographer and splits
The photographer starts breaking down his gear
Crawford takes Graham aside

You told me what

His hands shoot into the air: () Yo, boss
Plastic and cash in the right pocket

Walking away, Graham rips off his jacket: and the Kevlar vest
Coming off the expectation of contact, Graham is explosive
The Runner looks at Graham as if he's crazy: Spurgen and two cops are running in
Arrest dat sucker
Crawford catches up to Graham: You okay
Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest across the parking lot
He almost killed the man
Meanwhile, Spurgen is with the Runner
It was a mistake
Sorry we
'Sorry' yo' mama
Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham
Spurgen stops him

He shakes his head and locks away from her, wondering about himself: Molly
(pause) love you
And 'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile
They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate
Molly's eyes are moist
She gets up and leaves
Graham sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around his mug of coffee
Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the mug to take a sip
Then he sits alone in the kitchen

Bloom
Sidney:  don't understand him
We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience
To witness the act
We know he thinks the act is making him into something different
His 'becoming' but  don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming
(beat) The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors
That's what's missing for me
why the mirrors
(
) The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them
don't have an answer for you
(beat) Listen to me, my friend: leave this
90
And do what
Read about the next family in the morning paper
In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause can't take my family home
(beat) This ends when  make it over
(
) How are Molly and the boy
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana
(beat) Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney
Answer me that
Sidney Bloom has no answer
: ,   -  - Outside is gray
Rain stripes the glass
Sheets of rain whip across the silver planes and yellow utility vehicles
: Graham's hand enters and flattens against his half-reflection on the cool glass
He hears: (
) (ansaphone recording ) 'Hello
This is Valerie Leeds
'm sorry  can't come to the phone right now
'm sorry, too
Excuse me
Graham turns
The  looks at him strangely
Coffee
She leaves
Graham sits
He stares at his handprint and says : 91
It's just  and me now, sport
And 'd better hurry up and find you
(beat) Because 'm losing all this
: -  - Entering
It is almost totally dark
In the green dullness we make our the forms of a  and Dollarhyde
Ms
McClain, 'm Francis Dollarhyde
came about the low light level infrared film stock
() Put your back against the doer
Come forward three steps until you feel the tile an your feet and there will be a stool just to your left
We see Dollarhyde's form follow instructions and sit
Can you give me an idea of the conditions
Shooting at maybe eight feet can't use any lights
What's being photographed
The activities of nocturnal animals
When do you need it
In eight days
Let me stick this in the black hole
We see some movements
Then the light comes on
' hand is curled under his nose, hiding his -plast scars
Then he reacts to something
His face lights up in an uncharacteristically open smile
92
He brazenly looks the woman up and down
We don't understand why he can do this
McCLAIN is blind
Her white cane is propped in the corner
She's thirty with a handsome prairie face
The 1000  Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness
keep the samples straight by touch code
(beat) It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series
Think it'll do
It'll do fine
, young manager of the department enters, checks watch
Reba, dear, 've got to fly
(beat) Mr
Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be too much trouble could you help her home
can 'help' myself home, Ralph
Dandridge leaves
Dollarhyde stares after him
He doesn't Like him
Then: ' take you
(standing close) No, thanks
manage very well
(beat) ' order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000  tomorrow
Reba walks our of the dark room
: ' ,  -    - We pass Reba on the sidewalk
She is walking briskly with her cane and tapping in front of her
She's very confident
93
Ride with me
Thanks, but 'll take the bus do it all the time
Dandridge is a condescending prick
Ride with me
It would be because want you to
Reba stops
She likes Dollarhyde's directness
He gets our and comes around to help her in
He starts to take her arm
It's better if  rake your arm
: '  -  - We hear footsteps come up
Reba's key is in the lock
As the door is starting to open: Come on in
(beat) How about a gin and tonic
Tonic will be fine
In the kitchen
' ,  - enters
She momentarily forgets, retraces her steps and turns on the light
She opens the refrigerator
During the next pieces of dialogue, we will see Reba being ex- tremely competent making the drinks
How did you come to Gateway
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract
Reba takes a l0-inch chef's knife and deftly cuts the lime, guiding it with her thumb
You worked out well
94
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech
At the Riker Institute for the Blind trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children
reacts to "speech therapy
" Characteristically -- his attention goes to: in Reba's hand
Its extremely sharp cutting edge glints in the light
Another slice of lime falls
'll probably go back to it someday
Uh-huh
Silence
Reba hands him his drink
If you don't want to talk
okay
Bur  hope you will
because like what you say
Dollarhyde is stunned, at both her perception and frankness
May  touch your face
(as Dollarhyde reacts) want to know if you're smiling or frowning
want to know if should just shut up or not
There's a smile on her face
Now her hand moves up towards Dollarhyde's mouth with the -plast scars where his harelip and cleft palate were fixed
' Dollarhyde's fist grabs it
turns her hand in the light
95
Take my word for it that 'm
smiling
There is no smile on Dollarhyde's face
If 've offended you,  didn't mean to
He still has her hand in his grasp
have to go now
He lets go of her hand
: -   - sits among piles of Leeds family possessions
He opens a child's toy
It's large, pink plastic and heart-shaped
It's a Mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic clouds, strange handles and doors with eyes in them, : half and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates motes of dust in the air
Graham merely sits and stares into all of the debris of this dead family
to see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray of all the furniture, all the possessions and papers, all the bits and pieces of matter, that are accumulated in a life by two adults and three children
Everything from washing machines to tricycles to sleds
They litter the vast floor space
While we , we hear: :1(
) What's he doin'
Been in there all day
:2 (
) Just sits and stares at the stuff
The  now includes two    at the door
They watch Graham, As we  and they fall into
: -   '  - Her cane taps the white tile floor
It's antiseptic and sinister
We worry about where he's taking her
96
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is
It's a surprise
Her head arcs back as she senses: Francis
We're at the zoo
: -
- In two days we're going to cap his tooth
Can you smell him
(aglow) Yes
Are you apprehensive
Your protective and muscular gentleman over there is watching us like a cat
No, no
want to
Dollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment
All right, put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right
'll be right here beside you
We see Reba start to reach out
Then we see what she is about to touch
- Reba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm
' The fur springs between her fingers
97
' Reba's hand enters down its foreleg
Warfield -- with two hands -- lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand
Reba's hand feels the roughness of the pads
She presses and the claw slides cut
Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy supple muscles of his shoulder
' Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands feel the width of his head
' The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms
' Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest
Slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs
Reba's ecstatic
We hear what she hears: the
It fills us and Reba with its bright thunder
: '  - - Blake's painting
It's a large reproduction
It's a pre- psychological evocation of violent sexual impulses
It has come right after the image of Reba and the tiger
we hear
: -  + Hands are Reba's
We  them up to the wall as they search for and find a towel
we hear the hum of a film  starring
We see the sightless Reba reflected in the mirror
Feeling her way, she starts out
: - It's dark brown with wing-armed 50's-futuristic furniture Sryrosphere casts scars and constellations throughout the room
full-sized mural from  of the Mars surface is on one wall
98
We - objects: a recliner lounger, two film projectors, a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow arms, a Magnavox console  set and a sofa with Dollarhyde and Reba on it
They're watching a movie
: : The film projector hums
We don't see what movie Dollarhyde is watching
(beat) That was nice of you to think of that
made you a gin and tonic
It's by the side of the sofa
Dollarhyde looks at Reba
Then he looks at the film
The two of them are like a tableau of suburban -watching
They're like a married couple sitting on the sofa
Except: + The movie is Mrs
Jacobi looking up, And Mrs
Leeds looking up
And Mrs
Sherman's legs scissoring in the water
Then her breasts swelling and shining above her suit as she pushes herself our of the pool
Dollarhyde's blase, watching his horror show
He looks at Reba
unknowing, is suffused with a calm equanimity
Her breasts rise and fall with her breathing
The flickering light from the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes of her face
: ' The smooth skin and down-like hairs undulate from the bearing of her living heart
is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and doesn't see: 99
' moves along the back of the sofa to Dollarhyde
moves towards Dollarhyde's face
, and kisses Dollarhyde on the mouth
Dollarhyde's eyes freeze open
He is stunned
Reba's left hand opens Dollarhyde's shirt and slides down his' chest towards his pants
(soft whisper) Take me upstairs
: '  - DOLIl1HWDE' - head on the satin comforter
His eyes are wide open
His reaction to this event is immobility and shock
(
) Let me get them off
it's torn
don't care
Come on
My God, man
Yes
Reba's hand with her long, gentle fingers caressing the side of Dollarhyde's face
We will hear Reba's voice and see little of her
We will see Dollarhyde's face and the expressions on it: wonder and amazement
(
) You're so sweet,
(heat ) let me come up to you and take it
(beat) Yes
Her hand moves down from his face down his neck and rests on his chest
It rests on the face of what is tattooed there: the Great Red Dragon
(
) (soft) Your heart is loud
(beat) Feel all of me 100
Dollarhyde knows what he feels: he is pole-axed
He doesn't know what he thinks
-  - is asleep
She holds Dollarhyde in the near dark
His hand caresses her forehead and brushes light brown hair from her face
wide awake, eases her away
Then he puts his ear to her breast and listens to her heart beating
Dollarhyde is re- lieved
Then Dollarhyde touches her gently, softly in wonder and amazement
Then Dollarhyde leaves
Dollarhyde re-enters  and puts a glass of water next to her
He covers her
He lays down again next to her
Reba stirs half awake, murmurs dreamily
Dollarhyde supports the back of her head and offers her some water
:  + Dollarhyde's arm moves under her pillow
She snuggles closer to him
Dollarhyde's eyes are moist
Reba's hand moves up his stomach and rests on his chest
It rests above his heart
It rests on the face of the crimson dragon
When she is asleep again, Dollarhyde takes her hand off the great tattoo and puts it on his face
Dollarhyde -- cloven in two, accepted by a living Reba -- will not sleep for a very long time
: -  - It is morning
He snaps awake
he is horror-struck: Reba's pillow is empty
She's nor there
Dollarhyde races our of the room
: ,  -  - slams open
Dollarhyde stops in the door frame
(
) Is that you
101
Yes, are you okay
(
) 'm fine
In her cotton dress
The prairie wind blows her hair and presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard
nears her, towers above her
He touches her face
Reba folds into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest
His heart is going fast
He doesn't believe this fine thing is happen- ing to him and that she's okay
Good morning
(kisses his cheek) If you show me where things are, 'll make us some coffee
No
Don't go back into the house
(to Reba's quizzical reaction) it's too nice outside
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch
Why don't you come, too
have work to do at the plant
'll get my purse
'll get it
(leaving) Stay right here
You lock very good in the sun
: -  - He's heavy-set and sullen
Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls in
102
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba
'm fine, Francis
Dollarhyde gets out
Fill it up and check the oil, please
Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room
After placing the nozzle in the gas tank the  bangs open the hood, draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout into the can and sticks the spout into the engine
As he starts to move around the van he sees something in the interior and stops
smile dawns on his face
We don't know what he sees
He starts wiping the windshield
He wipes and wipes the same spot
' dress is just above her knees
She sits on the high seat
Her legs are crossed
Her white cane lays between the seats
From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can look up her dress
He bends down a little to see better
' Nothing
Then Dollarhyde
He crumples a paper rowel and throws it in the basket
Dollarhyde crosses around the backside of the van
' Dollarhyde appears
As he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing
unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same spot in front of Reba
is coming around the van
Fast
You sonofabitch
103
(cocky) You don't like it
You know what you can do about it
Attendant starts away
Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him into and through a display of
The Attendant bounces once and slams into the station wall
and roll away
Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it
' through the windshield
She's trying to find the handle to roll down the window
is white
There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has never seen before, anywhere
pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine
He advances on the frozen Attendant
He looks at the sharp end of the spout
is wide-eyed
Dollarhyde's big hand  and flattens the man into the wall, compressing his thorax
ought to jam this in your chest, and drain your heart
The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk
Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face
He hesitates
Then he throws money at the Attendant and leaves
: -  - With Crawford on the phone
(
) You got the message Lecktor called
arranged for him to have a phone
have to call him in a few minutes
104
(
) From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning
What's it narrow down to
(
) Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, Sr
Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit
(laughs ) That's narrow
(
) When are you coming back
When 'm done
Graham hangs up the phone
He looks out the window at the rain
He dials again
It's Will Graham
Is Molly there, Mr
Swenson
(
0
) Well, how you doin', Mr
Graham
You sure are in the center of a storm
Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too,  bet
(beat) On the news they said he was a white man
He isn't really, is he
Sure he is
Blond
(fuck him:) Probably Scandinavian, too
(
) You going back down to Florida after
Yes
Is Molly there
105
(
) My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day
Been out riding
Must be the good air
You oughta see that little booger eat
'11 bet he's gained ten pounds
(beat) Molly's out in the motor home
know
'Out in the good air
' (
) What's that
Tell her  called
Graham hangs up
He dials again
This is Will Graham
Dr
Chilton arranged for me to talk with Dr
Lecktor
(
) 'll put you through
: '  -   - picks up the phone and takes Graham's call
wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr
Lounds
admired it enormously
What a cunning boy you are
Will
What do you want
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital
My attorney should have brought that our in court
'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches
If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it
106
want to help you, Will
You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself
We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us
Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else
Why fight it
Fight what
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr
Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good
(ironic) And why shouldn't it feel good
It must feel good to God
God does it all the time
Graham laughs
Then he starts to listen closely
There is something here for him: don't believe in God
You should, Will
God's terrific
(beat) He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night
Just as they were grovelling to Him and singing a hymn
Don't you think that felt good
(beat) He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders
Why does it feel good
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful
Will Graham thinks about this
(fading) God's a champ
He got a hundred and sixty Philippines in one plane crash two months ago
Remember the big earthquake in Italy last spring
107
Lecktor's voice fades as Will Graham hangs us on him
Graham sits on the crumpled bed and stares out the window at the rain
: -  - stands in the kitchen
His raincoat and rainhat drip water onto the floor
The house no longer is a crime scene
It's been cleaned up
It is absolutely naked
Shades are drawn
Slashes of light hit the floor
Graham stands there
Then he walks forward
- ' (
) enter
The glass cutter
lick the suction cup
The piece of glass take out is mine
House is mine
(beat) walk up these stairs
pass childrens' toys
The children mean nothing to me
The toys appear on the stairs as Graham's feet continue moving up the stairs to the second-floor landing
' : (
) am soundless
move to the door
step into the room
: It opens
Graham enters
The room is white
We don't see the bed
Graham stands there in profile
Beyond Graham the wall starts to discolor
Pieces of plaster start to fall
The room starts to disintegrate around Graham
We will see what Graham sees in his mind
see you there
breathe in the perfume of this room
am in the inner sanctum of a life
You will accept me
Take me into you
' : The ceiling and walls decomposing
Nothing falls on the bed
Mr
Charles Leeds sleeps with his arm under Mrs
Leeds' pillow
108
Mrs
Leeds is on her side
Slowly she starts to rise
She sees the figure in front of her and her mouth opens to scream
silent shot shoves her back to the headboard
Red blood starts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound
We In   Mr
Leeds starts to rise
Something massive and silver flashes through the
He Is gone
Mirrors explode
Mrs
Leeds was looking at her hand covered with blood
Now Mrs
Leeds looks up at us
Her face turns into a smile
Her eyes are silver
silver light emanates from her mouth
She smiles at us
She wants us
She really wants us
Her hand gestures us closer
As we we hear: (
) You will be better than anything
anything  have ever known
As see me in your eyes
, as  see me accepted there
Reflected there in mirrors
(beat) And you, you are the fuel for my changing
as this event becomes one more step towards what  am becoming that is different than what have ever been before
(beat) As  see me, accepted by you, in the silver mirrors of your eyes
In the silver mirrors of her eyes, Graham sees reflected there: himself
- It is empty
The bare floorboards, a dynamic perspective of lines, go nowhere
Graham's scream reverberates in the empty house
: ,  - It is pitch-black
In the green safe light we make our the rollers and pulleys carrying film through the vats of D76 developer and fixer
It is mechanized
There is no one to maintain it
Distantly on the floor in a far corner we perceive the shape of a man and reddish glow
The towards the shape on the floor
As we get closer we realize it's Dollarhyde
Something is wrong with him
(
) '
109
No
(
) ' ' No
By now we're close to his body curled up on the floor in the sanctuary of the developing room
The red glow emanates from beneath Dollarhyde's shirt
(
) ' ' Shut up
Stop
Stop it
He stands
(
) want her
want her alive
'm going to keep her He starts throwing bottles of chemicals across the room
They form a moire pattern of colors on walls
Some splash on him and make his shirt smoke
Dollarhyde's unsteady hand takes it off the wall
Be pours sweat
If the acid that makes his shirt smoke burns him, he doesn't acknowledge it
He punches four numbers
Reba
(
) Francis
Where are you
The developing room
(beat) need to
see you
110
(
) want to see you, too, Francis
Should  come over
(into phone) No
Reba
(
) (phone filter) Are you okay
(into phone; getting control) 'll see you later
All right
(
) (phone filter) You'll come by
(into phone) Yes
: '  -    '  - He sits under the tree with the lights out
He is waiting
Watching
He looks at his watch
Then he hears a car approach and looks up
' : pulls into Reba's drive
- ' Excited
He starts to get out
Now he stops
' :  + exit the Oldsmobile
He helps Reba out of the car
She makes her own way up the sidewalk to her door
Reba opens her door with a key
She turns towards Dandridge
There's something on your face
He brushes at a speck of dust on Reba's cheek
111
- stares
Events are threatening Dollarhyde's fragile stabil- ity
We don't want this to be happening, we don't want Dandridge to touch her
' :  + We see what Dollarhyde imagines: Dandridge's fingers caress the soft skin of Reba's face
Reba's expression and mouth are open and warm to him
- ' Blank
' :  + Reba smiles
Her lips part
His finger brushes between her lips
His hand goes to her breast
'  - ' hand clutches the dash
His fingers pop through the vinyl, gouging deep furrows
We hear hyperventilating
'  -  + Normal reality
There was no, there is no seduction
No contact
What was it
Pollen
Thanks for the ride
See you tomorrow
Reba walks into her apartment 112
walks back to his car
We are   Dandridge walk- ing past the hedges
An arm shoots out and turns Dandridge
Dollarhyde's hand clutches the whole of Dandridge's lower face from underneath his jaw
He starts crushing Dandridge's face
soft  are from Dollarhyde's nine millimeter
He shot Dandridge three times in the heart
: '  -  - Moving in the dark
The
She has unbuttoned her blouse
Now she goes back to answer the door
Who is it
(
) It's me
Who
(
) Me
Francis
She opens the door and smiles
(
) It's not Francis
(beat) No
Francis is gone
Francis is gone forever
As he steps towards her
: It's full and very large as it dawns over black water that seems to ripple and be drawn to it
to reveal we are: -  +   - Next to the window we see the Jacobi family in fishing scene on a monitor
They are on a pier into a small lake with poles and bobbers
The kids turn back and wave  us
113
(
) What's important
The scene changes to a birthday party
The Jacobis are sitting around a dining table
They are singing
+ He changes them into beings that accept him
And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors
didn't understand the mirrors before
(beat) It's very important
'Changes
' It's a word
Killing them
(beat) His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time
(beat) And he would record it somehow
So he can see himself received over and over again
, film, Polaroid, stills, what
How do  know
Graham is intent on the tape
Then: He's very careful, very
designed when he chooses, (beat ) If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him
There's no connection between the families
There has to be
114
(exasperated) There is none
We've run it through the computer a dozen times
Graham's beyond frustration
(suddenly calm) He's a very shy boy
What
Something Lecktor said
Let's admit we struck out this month
The Gulf Stream's standing by
The basic lab stuff is on it
You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes
We get the call, we roll
The scene'll be very fresh
It's not over yet
It's a foregone conclusion
For Christ's sake, it's eleven
The full moon is tonight
Graham doesn't answer
He's totally concentrated on the film
: Donald Jacobi, big birthday card to the camera
It says: "Happy Birthday - Follow the ribbon
" Camera follows Donald Jacobi following the ribbon into the basement and the flood- lights reveal a ten-speed bicycle
Will
(explodes ) You wanna watch this or what
Crawford stares at him
Then he works his way through a report with a penlight
115
: We are outside in the rain
Donald Jacobi brings the bicycle out
The camera pans past: the padlock on the basement door
Graham's hand flashes   and slams on the freeze button
That's why the boltcutter
What's that
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way
When he was watching from the woods
Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered
He had to
Graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy report on Donald Jacobi
Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth
Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door
(beat) But you can't see either family's door from the street
He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore
He freezes the Jacobi tape and loads and plays the Leeds tape : (intently on the screen ) From the alley he couldn't have seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door
() 116
(') There's a lattice porch back there, but he was ready with his glasscutter
(beat) So he was either casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough or
: The Leeds' gray Scottie perks up his ears and runs in the glass kitchen door
The camera pans off the dog to Valerie Leeds coming in the door: behind her the door is vulnerable with its big glass pane
Her kids follow her through the door
It's getting late and
(explodes) Don't talk to me
Crawford's surprised
: Watching
Then he grabs the phone and punches numbers
It's Graham
The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom
(
) Yeah
You know what time it is
Have one of the guards down there call me
(
) If the guy's not asleep
Do it
He hangs up on Metcalfe
Graham's hand freezes the Leeds' rape and plays the Jacobi tape
The Jacobis' cat moves, jumps on the table
117
(to himself) You knew that was the Jacobis' cat
The Jacobi boy pushes the bicycle out of the basement door with the padlock
(to himself) You brought a boltcutter
'cause you thought there was a padlock
Next Mrs
3acobi -- warm, smiling -- watches Donald ride the bike
Now Graham plays the Leeds' tape, too
The dog runs to camera
(to himself) And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar
But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man
His tail wagging, his tongue out; he's a friendly dog
Mrs
Leeds enters and pets him
(to himself) See the woman
Crawford is staring at Graham strangely
This is why Crawford drafted him
But Crawford doesn't look like he wants to be alone in the same room with Graham anymore
The bloom on the woman
You can almost feel her
You can see her again and again
Anytime you want
(beat) The doggy doesn't have a collar
But you know the Leeds' dog, don't you
(beat) And you know the Jacobi cat
And the padlock on the door and you know you need a boltcutter and every other goddamn thing 'cause
(shouts) '
(beat) Haven't you, my man
The
Crawford answers
His attention is riveted on Graham
It's the guard in the storeroom
118
(to Crawford) We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in
(beat) They're in the far corner of the room under the windows
(into phone) There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows
Crawford is very quiet
He found them
Graham pushes aside the videotape sleeve and picks up the Leeds' home-movie can
(reads label) What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St
Louis, Missouri
(into phone) Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it
Crawford hears
Then he deflates
(to Graham) No
It's Bob's Photo Store in
Have him peel the top label back
(into phone) See if there's another label underneath
Crawford hears, Graham's watching him
It does, doesn't it
119
(punches another number) want a chopper on the roof in three minutes
To Meigs Field
(bear ) At Meigs have them warn up and flight-prep the Gulf Stream
Graham's already out the door
Crawford races after him
: ' ,  -  - has been placed on the kitchen table
It is chrome and pale yellow Formica
Her face is bruised and swollen from where Dollarhyde hit her
She feels, around on the bed
She's very frightened
She's trying to control herself
You're scaring me with this
There's no answer
We don't know if there's anyone else in the room
(searching)
Am  alone in this room
Are you here
(shrill) Why are you doing this
(
) (even) Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta
Do you know what 'm talking about
Reba shakes her head
(
) (in a low voice) Two groups of people were changed
Leeds
And Jacobi
The police think they were murdered
(beat) Do you know what they call the being that visited these people
You can say
The Tooth
In a flash Dollarhyde grips her mouth, shutting off the sound
120
(
) (low) Think carefully and answer correctly
His arm exits
It's Dragon
Dragon
Red Dragon
(
) Francis did a thing for you today so  couldn't have you
And he was wrong
(beat) (beat) Give me your hand
Reba's hand is gripped by Dollarhyde's
He brings her fingers up to his face
For the first time in this scene we are seeing Dollarhyde's face
The fanged dentures are in his mouth
Dollarhyde makes Reba's hand feel his teeth
, we hear Reba start whimpering and try to pull away
Dollarhyde holds her hand there
Now you know how the Dragon kills
: -  - finishes patching together cables
Try it
(into radio phone) This is Jack Crawford,
Who am  speaking to

Meanwhile Graham has grabbed the second radio phone
(into phone) Start feeding me names
: -
- on telephone
Two  men are at his desk
Uniformed patrolmen carrying assault rifles and body armor run through in the background
(
) Run these names to your  for a driver's license check
Man we're after is blond, caucasian, twenty to forty, six feet tall, 180-225 pounds
(beat) First name
Fisk punches Graham into the speaker phone

) Alvaro

(into phone) Next
: -   -   - The Gulf Stream approaches and races past us at its cruising speed of 585 mph
As it leaves the frame, the image we're left with is the moon
It looms large and white 30 degrees above the horizon and rising into a starry sky, : -   - displays the license with picture and driving record of Dillon, Lincoln
He's a black man

The lines compose hair, forehead, eyes
coming at us line by line is: Francis Dollarhyde

Fisk) Route three, Chester, Missouri
Where is that
(
) From the airport you're closer
We'll meet at the Hock Road off ramp, Highway 94
(to Graham) Fogel has four more names
He knows two: both dark hair
Third's a woman
Fourth's a handicapped parking permit
(re Dollarhyde) This is our boy
: -   - Hits the runway
Tires smoke
Its   in reverse thrust
It taxis away from the terminal to a security area
Two St
Louis  squad cars are waiting
opens
Graham's out followed by Crawford
They run across the tarmac to the squad cars
Squad cars race out of the airport
: '  -  - through shadows and highlights in the moonlight
we pass the sink and countertop and refrigerator and blue-enamelled broom closet
On the other side of it is Reba
She Is breathing heavily
124
She stands there, squeezing into the corner, trying to make herself disappear
Then she senses and freezes as a rabbit who is hunted and at a certain point, freezes
stands four feet from her, just staring
Then he walks from the room
'   - puts "" by Iron Butterfly from 1967 on the stereo
It  through the house
He is expressionless
Deep in his psychotic episode, his affect is flattened
- as a reflection in the medicine cabinet - enters
His fist smashes
His image  with the mirrored glass
' forearm destroys the glass shower door
He rips the metal frame from the walls
He snaps the mitred framework
The aluminum frame members have sharp 45 degree points
He takes them and the shards of mirror and leaves for the kitchen
Throughout his face has been expressionless
: 94 -    - streaks   down the almost deserted highway
: -  - in the back seat
He is distant
His attitude contrasts to the frantic 110 mph race down the highway and the two uniformed officers and Crawford
Their anxiety is visible
Next to them Graham seems zoned-our
Meet point's up ahead
Go on to the house
Lt
Fisk said
125
Go on to the house
He obeys Graham and floors it
Graham puts his black plastic briefcase on his lap and extracts the
44 Charter Arms Bulldog
He starts to load 6 matte-black, blunt-nosed Glaser Safety Slugs
He fumbles them in the swaying car
The bullets fall to the floor
Glaser Safety Slugs roll on the rubber matting
Graham's fingers enter and pick them up
We  the rounds as they slip into the cylinder
is staring at Graham's blankness
Will
(sharp ) What
You're not going to need that
Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St
Louis  Swat team is going to take him
Not us
That's it up ahead
: ' The house is set back a half mile from the road
Access to the drive is blocked by a locked cattle gate
(
) Cut across the field
(beat) Kill your lights
+  -    - The first drives off the highway through a shallow ditch and starts across the soybean field
The second car takes the ditch at the wrong angle and
its windshield stars
126
+
1 moving across the furrowed rows
The car starts to slow
We don't know why they are slowing down
spray the gumbo mud out of the furrows
The forward momentum of the car slows until it completely stops
The tires spin and dig in
spills out and starts running for the house and the orchard a quarter mile away
Crawford follows
: -  + running towards the house through the trees
Branches slap at them
Ahead, the orchard will parallel the house
They can get to within 25 yards using the trees as cover
(into radio) Get the roadblocks set on Route Three
There's an access road to the back of the house
That ought to be a second team's approach
Will Graham and  are in an orchard due west of the house
How far away's the back-up
Three minutes
Graham gestures Crawford to a position with a front 3/4 view of the house
'll cover the back
Stay in the trees
As we  with Graham through the trees towards the back, beyond him we see the side yard and the side windows moving past
The windows are large
At the back -- like a ramp -- are two storm cellar doors
127
: in the dark shadows of the trees
He seems to float: through the branches and slows and settles quietly
Then the ex- pression on Will Graham's face starts to change
' : Shadows
light comes on
Then the figure of Reba is swung out of a corner past the window
(resigned whisper into radio) There's somebody in the house, Jack
(
) (radio filter) Wait for the back-up
Will
(whispers in radio) It's happening again, Jack
: '  -  +  - On the right we see Dollarhyde's right arm with the aluminum shafts
Beyond them,    we see Graham has stepped out from the tree line
He stands on the grass
He looks helpless
His gun hangs idly at his side
: It's his worst nightmare
About what he's seeing: (low) stop it
'  -  +   007 : We and Graham see Dollarhyde's arm arc back for an uppercutting thrust into Reba
Dollarhyde's left hand clutching her dress, raises her two feet up the wall
And now Graham starts running forward
And his face is distorted and he's shouting: (roars) Dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see: 128
+ -- his arms across his face and his body angled sideways --  through the glass
catching Graham's momentum -- throws him across the room
off the fridge which opens and spills and hits the floor as
and grabs his 9mm from the kitchen table
' is lacerated from the glass
He sees his own blood on the floor
He struggles to rise
The first thing up is the big bore of the
44
It  as if it had its own mind
' left shoulder
bleeding, brings the
44 down from the recoil of the first shot
Now, up on one knee, he   more rounds into Dollarhyde
: Graham stands and walks to Dollarhyde
Reba is collapsed in the corner
Dollarhyde it more exploded from within than shot
Graham starts to raise the gun
: -   : As we   and see arriving squad car flashers play on the walls and Crawford runs through the foreground, we see Graham point the gun down to Dollarhyde's head
As we're pulling away comes the final  +  and
: 129
-      - We will only see the rear of Will Graham sitting alone on the side of the bed in the alienating motel room
His head is bandaged
(into phone) Hello
: ,  -  - was out in the garden
Mama came out and told me when she saw it on Why didn't you call me
Mama was probably asleep
Will
Are you okay
Not too bad
'll be here a few days longer
(beat) want to see you
want to see you, too
Today's Wednesday
By Friday ought to
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and
Come home with me
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days
What's this Mama shit
It's what Kevin called her when he was little
130
What's the problem, Molly
(pause) came up here after Kevin's father died
(beat) They were very supportive and helped me adjust
got myself together
've gotten myself together now, too
Small difference: 'm not dead, yet
Will
(no response) You could come up here
They don't want me up there
Every time they look at me  remind them
If they thought about it, they'd want you
Bur all they really want's the boy
And they'll take you
But they don't want to see me
That's not true
Okay
They're full of shit and they make me sick
Then no one says anything
Maybe we should give it some time
Yeah
That's great
little time
(beat tell you what, buckaroo
(beat) See you around
Graham slams down the phone
Still half-immersed in a psychotic landscape of the mind, Graham's psyche resonates with echoes of Dollarhyde
Now he gets up and walks out of the room leaving the door open
Outside is only the deserted parking lot
: 131
(, ) - '    - It's raining The  moves slowly down a residential street looking for an address
He squints
Twenty-three twenty-six
- Twenty- three twenty-eight
Here you go
(pulls up to curb ) Want me to wait
(
) Yes
: -   - It's open plan
The dining area and kitchen are raised
The Sherman family are engaged in 7:00  suburban family chaos:   is trying to watch the news
He hollers up the stairs for his daughter to turn down her stereo
His 11-year-old son, , at the dining room table is supposed to be doing homework
Instead he rolls up balls of paper and does jump shots from his chair into the wastepaper can, (to son) Cut out the basketball and go back to the algebra, George Sherman goes back to  news
The
Thirteen-year-old   comes down the stairs
'll get it
Tina opens it
screams
runs to the door
In a  , we see there is a sho- gun resting inside the door jamb
It's within reach or Sherman's hand
We see why Tina Sherman screamed: 132
' is pulled down slightly on the left side, making his left eye moon-shaped
There is a half-healed wound and butter- fly bandage where Dollarhyde stabbed him
He is standing in a black raincoat with a black hat
What do you want
Are you George Sherman
Yes
Who are you
My name's Will Graham
(suddenly realizing who he is) Oh, Jesus
Come in
(to wife) Honey
His wife starts to come forward
No, that's okay
(pause) How are you
There's a searching look on Graham's face
Totally strange
We're fine
Fine
We're all well
We're okay
(beat) That man, Crawford, called and
told me
(beat) how 'bout a drink
Coffee or something
No, 'm okay
just wanted to
(beat) stop by and
can't thank you enough,
, Graham shakes his head
He doesn't want to be thanked
No one knows what to say
Graham looks at them: 133
standing in awkward places
They ate nothing special
They are normal human beings living their lives
To Graham they are very special: they are alive
just wanted to stop by and
see you
guess
That's all
Graham stands there as if engraving each one in his memory
Then he nods
Then he leaves
closes the door
There's an awkward look on his face
He didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham
: -   :  - -- in the  of the  -- walks down the sidewalk away from us towards the waiting cab
The rain pelts his black hat and black raincoat
'Before he reaches the cab
: (, )-  - sitting with his back to us
Beyond him the sun reflects off the crashing surf and burns out everything except the silhouetted image of Graham
the fenced-in area of beach he and Kevin built at the opening of the film
baby tortoise crawls over sand mountains and is swept away by surf into the life-supporting sea
: drinks a beer
He senses a presence and starts to turn
:    + turns towards us
Molly
Her coat is under her arm
She drops it and her flight Sag in the sand and continues walking to Graham
134
stands as she comes near him
The aqua highlights of the water eat into their figures as they look at each other
Molly touches the wounded side of his face
Then: Let's forget who said what to whom
You got a deal
Graham takes Molly's hand
' Molly and Graham walk to the water's edge and look out to sea
The highlights burn out sections of the two people
So how'd we do
Graham looks at her
He touches the side of her cheek and her hair
She pushes against his hand with her face to make closer contact
We did okay
(beat) Most of them made it
:  + Graham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm across Molly's shoulder
Molly's arm moves around Graham's waist
They look out to sea
In front of them, the surf kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant atoms
