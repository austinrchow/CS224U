"Alien", early draft, by Dan 'Bannon (project formerly titled Story by Dan 'Bannon & Ronald Shusett Screenplay by Dan 'Bannon 1976 En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the starship  intercepts a transmission in an alien language originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet
Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate
Their search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open -- it is dead and abandoned
Inside they find, among other strange things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers
Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a vanished civilization
Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts
Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries- old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and cannot be removed
An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing something inside him
Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not kill it on the ship
Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship, and they blast off from the Hell-planet
However, before they can seal themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been growing in him, deposited there by the parasite
and now it is loose on the ship
series of ghastly adventures follow
They trap it in an air shaft and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's bizarre life cycle
Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien

Electronic machinery chuckles softly to itself
Abruptly we hear a  , and the machinery begins to awaken
Circuits close, lights blink on
, revealing more and more of the machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal: - stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with instrumentation
The lights are dim and the air is frigid
Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal , looking for all the world like meat lockers
With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the freezers pop open
Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up
Oh
God
am  cold
Is that you, Roby
feel like shit
Yeah, it's you all right
Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering
(groans) Ohh
must be alive,  feel dead
You look dead
The vampires rise from their graves
This draws a few woozy chuckles
(shakes his fist in the air triumphantly) We made it

It's over, Hunter
(yawning) Boy, that's terrific
(looking around with a grin) Well, how does it feel to be rich men
Cold
This draws a
Okay
Everybody topside
Let's get our pants on and get to our posts
The men begin to swing out of the freezers
Somebody get the cat
Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer
- This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation
There are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by viewscreens, all blank for the moment
There are seats for four men
Each chair faces a console and is surrounded by a dazzling array of technology
, , , and  are entering and finding their seats
'm going to buy a cattle ranch
(putting down the cat) Cattle ranch
'm not kidding
You can get one if you have the credit
Look just like real cows, too
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand
Right
Fire up all systems
They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles
The control room starts to come to life
All around the room, colored lights flicker and chase each other across glowing screens
The room fills with the hum and chatter of machinery
Sandy, you want to give us some vision
Feast your eyes
Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches
The strip of viewscreens flickers into life
On each screen, we see

Melkonis hits buttons
On the screens the images all begin to pan

Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth
Remain at your posts and stand by
That is all
Chaz, 've got something here on my security alert

Why am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise
Computer, this is Captain Standard
What conditions are you talking about

The men exchange glances
have recorded the transmission
Play it for us, please
Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static

The men all stare at each other in amazement
Computer, what language was that
Unknown
Unknown
What do you mean
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man
There is a pause, then
(silencing them) Just hold it hold it (glares around the room) Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission
Yes
There are two points of salient interest
Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin
Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate
Oh my God
Well, it's finally happened
First contact
Sandy, can you home in on that beam
What's the frequency
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission

Melkonis punches buttons

Broussard punches buttons
One of the viewscreens flickers, and a small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen
(') That's it
Let me straighten it out
He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in the center
Can you get it a little closer
That's what 'm going to do

, we're morally obligated to investigate
Right
don't know
Seems to me we came on this trip to make some credit, not to go off on some kind of side trip
(excited) Forget the credit; what we have here is a chance to be the first men to contact a nonhuman intelligence If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped
Hell, we're equipped -- Hell, no
We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock
It might be dangerous
What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities
and let them deal with it
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back
Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin
There are no commercial lanes out here
Face it, we're out of range
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe
This is an opportunity which may never come again
Look -- You're overruled, Martin
Gentlemen -- let's go
- The men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination
Dell,  want greater magnification
More surface detail
want to see what this place looks like
'll see what  can do
He jabs his controls
The image on the screen ; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze
It's out of focus
No -- that's atmosphere

My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size
Just a second

Put ship in atmospheric mode

- Dell, set a course and bring us in on that beam
- The 's engines cough into life, and send it drifting toward the distant dot that is the planetoid

We've still got pressure
There is a  from the communicator
Then: (over, filtered) Martin, this is Jay
The intakes are clogged with dust
We overheated and burned out a whole cell

How long to fix

(over, filtered) Hard to say
Well, get started
(over, filtered) Right
Talk to you
Let's take a look outside
Turn the screens back on
Melkonis hits buttons
The screens flicker, but remain black
Can't see a blessed thing
-  - Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute darkness around it
-  - Kick on the floods
-  - ring of  on the ship come to life, pouring blinding light out into the night
They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and clouds of blowing dust
The wind shrieks
-  - Not much help
Standard stares at the dark screens
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness
How long till dawn
(consults his instruments) Well
this rock rotates every two hours
The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes
Good
Maybe we'll be able to see something then
Or something will be able to see us
They all look at him
: -  -  (  ) The floodlights on the  fight a losing battle against the darkness and the storm
,
: Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the
The silhouette of the  becomes visible, like some strange insect crouching motionless on the barren plain
The floods shut off
Dense clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and reducing the sunlight to a dull orange
-  - - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange dust
The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, and Melkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffee and staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure
Just settle down
Sandy, you get any response yet
(pulls off his earphones) Sorry
Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds
've tried every frequency on the spectrum
Are we just going to sit around and wait for an invitation
Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his console and speaks into the mike
(into mike) Hello, Faust
(over, filtered) Yeah
How's it coming on the engines
- Faust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speaking into a wall intercom
never saw anything as fine as this dust
these cells are all pitted on a microscopic level
have to polish these things smooth again, so it's going to take a while
Okay
-  - Yeah, okay
(puts down the mike) Sandy
how far are we from the source of the transmission
Source of transmission is to the northeast
about 300 meters
Close
Close enough to walk to
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric

and some trace elements
Nontoxic

Dry as a bone
Any microorganisms
Not a one
It's dead
Anything else
Yeah, rock particles
Dust
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for
Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source
No problem
volunteer for the exploration party
heard you
You want to break out the side arms
-    - Standard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock
They all wear gloves, boots, jackets, and pistols
Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut, sealing them into the lock
They all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks
(adjusting the radio on his mask) 'm sending
Do you hear me
Receiving
Receiving
All right
Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless  say otherwise
Martin, do you read me
-  - Read you, Chaz
-    - Open the outer door
Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open
streams into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in
We hear the mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it hits the ground
Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others
-  - The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet
Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock
The men huddle together, looking around
The wind screams and tugs at their clothes
Nothing can be seen
Which way, Sandy
Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder
(pointing) That way
You lead
Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the others
Okay, Martin
We're on our way
-  - Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge
He is huddled over his console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a screen
Okay, Chaz,  hear you
've got you on my board
(over, filtered) Good
'm getting you clear too
Let's just keep the line open
-  - The three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and shrieking wind
With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements, they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean
Melkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction finder
(') Can't see more than three meters in any direction out here
We're walking blind, on instruments
They wade on, following Melkonis
Abruptly he halts
(') What's wrong
My signal's fading
He studies the direction finder
-  - Roby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios
(') (over, filtered) It's the dust, it's interfering
His concentration is so great that he does (') (over, filtered) Hold it, 've got it again
It's over that way
Standing   , Hunter speaks
What's happening
Startled out of his wits, Roby  and whirls around to face Hunter
(startled silly) Hell
Hunter stares at Roby, whose momentary terror dissolves into embarrassed anger
-  - The three men push their way through the storm
Melkonis stops again, studies the direction finder
It's close, real close
How far
We should be almost on top of it just can't quite
Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points
The others stare in the direction he is pointing
-  -- Through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out some kind of
As we watch, the dust clears slightly, It is clearly of non-human manufacture
They are struck dumb by the sight of the craft
Finally, Standard finds his voice
Martin, uh, we've found it
(sharply -- over, filtered) Found what
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft
We're going to approach it
They start toward the alien ship
-  - (') (over, filtered) There are no signs of life
No lights
no movement
Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration
(') (over, filtered) We're, uh, approaching the base
-     - strangely shaped  yawns open at the base of the ship
Dust and sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance
With great caution, the men approach the entrance and group around it
(') Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris
Looks like a derelict
Martin, we're going in
'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on
-   - The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness, spewing dust
In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless shapes
Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the doorway
They switch on flashlight-like devices called "", and step in
Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct machinery
Air lock
Who knows
Let's try and find the control room
As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls, ceiling, and machinery are   ,
Look at these holes
This place looks like Swiss cheese
Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling
This hole goes up several decks -- looks like somebody was firing a military disintegrator in here
They all peer up the hole into darkness
Climbing gear
Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it
He aims it up into the hole and fires
The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire
There is a dull , and the wire dangles
'll go first
No, you'll follow me
Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and presses a button
With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the hole, using his feet for leverage where he can
Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit
- This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the hole
Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a beam through the hanging dust
Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own light
At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole
The beams are clearly visible as columns of light in the floating dust
They reveal heavy, odd shapes
Broussard stumbles over something
He shines his light down on it
It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings
Broussard stands it upright
It has a round opening in the top, and is empty
Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock
Their lights have illuminated something unspeakably grotesque:    , They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it ,
Holy Christ
Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton is seated
He moves his light closer and peers at the panel
Look at this
They approach
(') Something has been scratched here
into the veneer
See
Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a sharp instrument, is a small triangle: Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room
As the beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on
Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol
, Standard knocks his hand down
Keep away from that gun
Standard shoulders himself in front of the others
Then, slowly, he begins to move toward the far side of the room
They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it
There is a machine
On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves
(') Just machinery
But functioning
Melkonis looks down at his direction finder
That's where the transmission is coming from
He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a hum, the   fills their earphones
recording
damned automatic recording
-  - As we watch, the sunlight turns the color of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its wake
The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly combatting the darkness and the storm
- - The entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching holographic pictures projected onto a screen
These are photos taken by their "datasticks" (flashlight/cameras)
Standard is commenting on the changing slides
This is the control room
Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery
(') Some details of the control room
The  appears on the screen
The men react with mutters
(') This is the skeleton
another view of the skeleton
the transmitting device
The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears
(') This is a closeup of the triangle we found scrawled on the console in front of the skeleton
Standard changes the slide
The screen goes white
(') And that's it
He turns off the projector and brings the lights up
Phenomenal
Staggering
We've got to go back and take a lot more pictures, holograph everything And bring back as much physical evidence as possible, too
The rest of the skeleton
Some of the machinery
Written records, if there are any
Roby is slumped in his chair
He has said nothing
Martin
agree
This is the single most important discovery in history
But
What killed it
Hell, that thing's been dead for years
Maybe hundreds of years
The whole planet's dead
The way  figure it, they landed here for repairs or something, then they couldn't take off again
Maybe the dust ruined their engines
They set up an
beacon, but nobody came
So they died
He died
What
Not they he They all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod (') There was only one skeleton
There is a moment of silence
Jay
how's it coming on the repairs
Well
'm going to have to blow the engines out
And when will you be ready to do that
Oh -- 'm not near ready yet
Then why the hell are you sitting around here
Right
The men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in thought, staring at the skull
Melkonis lingers in the room with him
And there sits man's first contact with intelligent life in the universe
-  - , its spotlights cutting into the gloom
- room throbbing with power, enormous pulsing engines capable of releasing unimaginable energies
Faust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the engines, with spotlights on it
He is wearing goggles and thin gloves
You ready up there
-  - Broussard and Melkonis are seated at their consoles, conversing with Faust while they watch their instruments
Sure, we're ready
- Okay
'm going to start the extraction procedure now
He pauses to wipe his brow
- - Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the photographic slides on the screen
He is clicking slowly through them
He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it
The alien's misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him
He picks it up, holds it up to the screen for comparison, and studies it
Standard appears in the doorway
Alas, poor Yorick
Roby , puts down the skull
Standard sits at the table
(') (nodding at the screen) Find anything we missed
(shrugs) don't even know what 'm looking for
Still worried
Oh well
you know me
've always respected your opinion, Martin
If something worries you, it worries me
Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the What would you say that was supposed to mean
Well
it's obviously intentional
some kind of attempt at communication
maybe it's a symbol that means something to them
But why draw it on the wall
Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily
He rises and goes to the coffee machine
(') (picking a hair out of the coffeepot) This ship is full of cat hair
Tell you what, Martin
As soon as the engine's fixed -- The communicator interrupts Standard
He leans across and presses the button
(') This is Chaz
(over, filtered) Chaz, this is Dell
Can you come topside for a minute
What's up
(over, filtered) Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down
It's as clear as a bell outside
There's something  think you ought to see
'm on my way
He and Roby head for the door
-  - Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive
What is it
Take a look
-  - The dust no longer blows
The day is crisp, clear, and silent
-  - was scanning the horizon to see what  could pick up
Look there, on that screen
What is it,  can't -- Broussard enlarges the image
The screen now shows a    on the horizon
They all stare at the image for a long moment
The silhouette of the in the alien ship
Standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille
This is Chaz
All hands topside
Now
-  -  - It shows the  on the horizon to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the room
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there
That creature sure must have considered it important
using his last strength to draw it
Maybe they built it
As what
marker for buried instrumentation
Or a mass grave
Maybe the rest of the crew is in there -- in some kind of suspended animation, waiting to be rescued
It wasn't necessarily built by them
On the screens, a puff of  blows in front of the pyramid
Here comes the dust again
-  - ,    , completely obscuring the

Everyone looks around the room, but no one volunteers
(') Then the sooner we get moving, the better
-  - , dust blowing in front of it
It is a crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless, tapering toward the top
Standard, Broussard, and Melkonis, wearing the protective suits, approach the pyramid
As they draw near, it becomes clear that the pyramid is roughly 50 feet tall
We can't make out any details or features yet
but it's definitely too regular for a natural formation
-  - Roby and Hunter are present
They are listening to Standard's (') (over, filtered) There's one thing  can say for sure though
Standard's voice is
Now what's wrong
've completely lost their signal
Can you get them back
'm trying
-    - The three men come to the base of the massive structure
Dust and sand have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the base
This looks ancient
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast
They walk around the base
There's no entrance
Maybe the entrance is buried
Could be under our feet
Maybe there is no entrance; the thing may be solid
-  - Well, there ought to be some way we can get through to them -- The
Faust's voice is heard
(over, filtered) Sorry to interrupt, but 'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay
Yeah, okay
Go ahead
,   , drowning out all other sounds, as the engines are tested
light on Roby's panel is
We can see that it is the Irritably, Roby throws the switch
(') Yes
have a temporary sequence on the monitor -- Hold it,  can't hear a damn thing
He puts an earphone to his ear and switches the computer's voice over
(') Go ahead
There is a  while Roby listens to the computer
His eyes widen
(') You mean
you've translated it
Another  as he listens to the earphone
(') Well come on, come on
What does it say
Another
Roby's face changes; he looks
His mouth works
Abruptly,    ,
(looking over at Roby) What
What was that
The computer just translated the goddamn message
It's not an
It was a warning
-    - Maybe we can get in by the top
You want to try
Sure
Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the top of the pyramid
It catches
He clips himself to the wire
(') You guys just wait down here till say it's okay to come up
Broussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side of the pyramid
showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust blowing, the wind shrieking
-    - The peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair
Broussard arrives at the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones
There's a hole at the top
-    - Can we come up
(over, filtered) No, it's too small, only room enough for one person
Can you see anything in the hole
-    - Broussard leans over and looks into the hole
He sees only blackness
Freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on the "flashlight" function, and shines it down into the hole
can see
partway down
It just goes down like a stovepipe
Smooth walls
can't see the bottom -- light won't reach
-  - Faust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face
Yes
What is it
Jay, we've got a problem
was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability
(quickly) Why, what's wrong
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming
What do you mean
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases
'll just read it to you the way  got it: (reads from a strip of paper) " " (looks up at the others) And that's all it could translate
-    - Hanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from his belt
(over, filtered) Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here
No,  want to go in
-    - Standard and Melkonis exchange a glance
Okay, Dell, but just for a preliminary look-around
Don't unhook yourself from your cable
And be out in less than ten minutes
-    - Right
Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole
He unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end of it to his chest unit
He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole
He is now hanging by the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole
(') Okay, 'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and 'm starting down
(over, filtered) Take care
Broussard activates the climbing unit and lowers himself down into the hole
-  - Bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel, Broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the depths
The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in darkness
It's noticeably warmer in here
Warm air rising from below
He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops, pushing off each time with his feet
He stops to catch his breath
His breathing rasps loudly in his helmet
little sunlight filters down from above
Looking up, he can see the mouth of the hole, a glowing spot of light
Standard's voice comes over his earphones
(over, filtered) Are you okay in there
(gasping for breath) Yeah, 'm okay
Haven't hit bottom yet
Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust
(over, filtered) What was that Dell,  lost you, do you read me
Yeah, but this is hard work
Can't talk now
He kicks off and continues down, taking longer and longer hops as he gains confidence
Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the light on his instruments
(') 'm way below ground level
-    - What'd he say
couldn't make it out -- too much interference
-  - Roby and Hunter
'm getting nowhere
The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission
think we should go after them
No
What do you mean, no
We're not going anywhere
But they don't know about the translation
They could be in danger right now
We can't spare the personnel
We've got minimum takeoff capability right now
That's why Chaz left us on board
Why, you chickenshit bastard -- Just can that crap
'm in command here till Chaz returns
And nobody's leaving this ship
-  - Broussard resumes his downward climb
, The tunnel has reached its end
Below him is an unfathomable, cavernous space
(huffing and puffing) Tunnel's gone -- cave or something below me -- feels like the tropics in here; air is warm and humid
(consults his instruments) high oxygen content, no dust, it's completely breathable -- Puffing with exertion, he releases his purchase on the stone walls and begins to lower himself on power
Now he is dangling free in darkness, spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds
Finally, his feet hit bottom
He grunts in surprise and almost loses his balance
-  - Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above
Around is solid darkness
He flashes his datastick around
The beam reveals that he is in a stone room
are carved into the walls
They have a primitive, religious appearance
Row after row of pictograms stretch from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language
Huge religious symbols dominate one wall
Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus
It's unbelievable
It's like some kind of tomb
some primitive religion
Hey, is anybody there
Do you read me
Standard
Annoyed, Broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them hanging around his neck
He takes a deep breath of the wet air
-    - Standard and Melkonis are standing around nervously
If we don't hear from him soon, think we better go in after him
Sun will be down in a minute
-  - Face bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is dominated by a large, broad pedestal
On the pedestal are , --
He walks around the urns, studying them
They all have sealed lids
He shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it
He lifts his mask radio to his lips
don't know if you can hear me, but the place is full of large bottles or jars, just like the one we found on the other ship -- except these are all sealed
Also they're soft to the touch
He peers more closely at the leathery object
(') Another funny thing --  just put my hand on it, and now there are these raised areas appearing where my fingertips were
-    - , throwing the landscape into gloom
Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights
Let's go
He attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up
-  - Broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the wall
They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters
He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he turns back to the "urn" he was examining -- He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn
"  There lies the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole
He picks it up and studies it
It appears more organic than artificial; the inside surface is spongy and irregular
Then he turns the light to the now-open "urn
" He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, ,  , - ,
With a  , he launches himself backward, tearing at the thing with his hands
-    - The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top, lights bobbing in the darkness
(puffing with exertion) Here's his line
We can haul him out of there if we have to
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it
The line could get tangled in something
But what can we do
He's out of radio contact
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes
Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole
(making up his mind) No,  told him to be out in ten minutes
It's been much longer
Let's get him out of there
Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the tunnel
He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which Broussard's line dangles
(') The line's slack
Christ, do you think the idiot unhooked himself
He switches on the winch motor
With a whine, it begins to reel the line in
After a moment, the line     -- and the motor slows down, laboring under the added weight
(') There, it caught
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something
No, it's coming
Can you see anything
Standard shines his light down into the hole
No,  can't see far enough
The line's moving, though
For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid, saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls
Then Standard shines his light back down in
(') can see him
Here he comes
The winch begins to
(') Get ready to grab him
Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the wire
Standard reaches for him -- then
(') Look out There's something on his face Melkonis attempts to come to his aid
What is it Don't touch him, watch it In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally regain their balance
They shine their lights on Broussard
He appears to be completely unconscious -- ,
Oh God, oh God no
Help me -- 'm going to try to get it off
With his gloved hands, Standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to pull it from Broussard's head
(') It won't come -- it's stuck
What is it
How the hell should  know
Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there
The two men grapple with Broussard's limp body, lifting him from the hole
-  - Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent
There is a long moment while nothing is said, then: 've got 'em
They're back on my screens
(leaps to his feet) How many
Three blips
They're coming this way
Roby grabs a microphone
(into mike) Hey, can you guys hear me
(over, filtered) Yeah, we hear you
We're coming back
Thank Christ
We lost you
Listen, there's been a new development -- (over, filtered) Can't talk now; Broussard's injured
We'll need some help getting him into the ship
Roby collapses into a chair, suddenly limp with apprehension
He's feared something like this all along, and now it has begun to happen
(to himself) Oh no
(into intercom) Jay, this is Cleave
Meet me at the main air lock
Hunter dashes from the room
Roby remains where he is, seated at his console
He is stunned, his mind racing
-     - Hunter comes racing down the steps and hurries up to the inner lock door
He presses the wall intercom
(into intercom) Martin, 'm by the inner lock door
'll wait here for you to let them in
-  - (strangely quiet) Right
-     - Faust comes running up, covered with grime
What the hell's going on
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow
Hurt
How
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck
(a beat) knew we shouldn't of come down here
-  - Roby is seated alone in the room, listening to the transmission from Standard and Melkonis
(over, filtered) Martin, are you there
Roby leans forward and speaks into the microphone
Here, Chaz
(over, filtered) We're coming up now, open the outer lock door
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard
(over, filtered) It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him
Let us in
Roby does not reply
(') (over, filtered) You hear me, Martin
Open the outer door
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected
(over, filtered) We can't leave him out here, open the door
(urgently) Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine
If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left
(over, filtered) Martin, this is an order
Open the door
Hating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch
-     - goes on, on a console on the wall
The whine of a large servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic
Outer door's open
After a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another The outer door has closed again
The red light goes off
The inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through, carrying the sagging body of Broussard
cloud of choking dust follows them out of the lock
(pulling off his mask) You men stay clear, there's a parasite on him
Hunter and Faust
Oh -- God -- oh -- Is it alive
don't know but don't touch it
Give us a hand here, let's get him up to the Autodoc
Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden
- One of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the medical room, carrying Broussard
Revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with machinery
The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed, which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall
Help me, come on, let's get him up here
They slide the man onto the bunk
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him
It wouldn't come
Standard yanks off his gloves
(') Medical gloves
They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull them on
Gingerly, they approach Broussard
Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing on Broussard's face
He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to pull it free
(') It's really on there tight
Here, let me try
Faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip of one of the tentacles
Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his weight
(grabbing Faust's hands) Stop it, you're tearing his face
trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too
Let's let the machine work on him
Efficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a couple of switches on the wall
The machine lights up, and Broussard is sucked into the slot in the wall
He is visible inside
The machine immediately sprays a cloud of disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light
bank of video monitors pops on, revealing -ray images of different parts of his body
Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter
Standard turns and looks at him
For a long moment, the two men regard each other, then The others are shocked
Hey now, what is this
Ask him
(slowly puts his hand to his cheek) understand why you did that
Good
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there
Yeah
well, maybe he should have mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here
Maybe you deserve to get slapped
(embarrassed) Excuse me, 've got work to do
Faust exits
keep my mouth pretty much shut, but  don't like hitting
(to Standard) guess  had it coming
Let's call it settled
After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery
(') (slowly) Would somebody fill me in
He went into the pyramid alone
We lost radio contact with him
When we pulled him out, it was on his face
It won't come off, not without injuring him
Where did it come from
He's the only one that knows that
How does he breathe
They study the monitors
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated
Yeah, but how
His nose and mouth are blocked
Let's look inside his head
Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of -ray image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face
In -ray, the creature is a maze of complicated biology
But the shocking thing is that, in -ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open, and         , , ending near his stomach
Look at that
What is it --  can't tell anything -- It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat
(turning sick) Oh
God
Hunter bends over and
think that's how it's getting oxygen to him
It doesn't make any sense
It paralyzes him
puts him into a coma
then keeps him alive
We can't expect to understand a life form like this
We're out of our back yard
Things are different here
Well, can't we kill it
mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it
At least right now it's keeping him alive
How about cutting it off
We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face
You're right
we can't stand here and do nothing
Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head
Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves
Finally, he presses a switch and Broussard slides back out of the booth
(') (muffled in his mask) Somebody give me a scalpel
Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall, and carefully passes it to Standard
Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it
Then he flicks a little button with his thumb
The scalpel begins to hum
Standard advances on the parasite
The others draw back nervously
Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and holds it inconspicuously at his side
Standard bends over the parasite
Carefully, he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the back of Broussard's head
Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue
Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound
(') (muffled) 've made an incision
it's not reacting
but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound
The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to Broussard's head
Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of smoke curls up from the stain
(') (muffled) Hold it, this stuff's smoking
The others  nervously
By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below
The metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle, and more smoke rises
The men start to
God, that smoke's poisonous
(pointing) It's eating a hole in the floor
Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside, coughing their lungs out
Standard, who is masked, remains
Frantically, he attempts to put a bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves
They begin to smoke
Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves
Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask
- That stuff's eating right through the metal
It's going to eat through the decks and right out through the hull
By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs
- Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to the level below
There
Look
droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling
It oozes down and drips to the floor
It bubbles on the floor
Jesus, what can we put under it
Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below
- Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at the ceiling
(pointing) There
Should be coming through about there
Careful, don't get under it
- Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid sizzles
Christ, that stinks
Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the floor
Seems to have stopped penetrating
Hunter comes charging up the steps
What's happening up here
think it's fizzled out
Hunter approaches and looks
Roby straightens up, starts to put the pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by the end
never saw anything like that in my life
except molecular acid
But this thing uses it for blood Hell of a defense mechanism
You don't dare kill it
Standard comes up the stairs
It's stopped
Yes, thank heaven
We're just plain lucky
That could have gone right through the hull -- taken weeks to patch it
Reminded me of when  was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans
My God, what about Broussard
They turn and run up the stairs
- They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen)
Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face
Did it get on him
Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head
No, thank God
just missed him
Is it still dripping
(examining it) It appears to have healed itself
It makes me sick to see him like that
Isn't there some way we can get it off him
don't see how
But let's do what we can for him
Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the diagnostic coffin
He presses more buttons, and the displays light up again, showing different parts of Broussard's body
(') think we'd better get some intravenous feeding started
God knows what that thing is leaching out of him
Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade Broussard's body, sliding needles into him
(studying the screens) Look there, what's that stain on his lungs
The -ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's chest
In the center, the stain is completely opaque
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort
it blocks the -rays
That tube must be depositing it in him
Could be some kind of venom, or poison
This is horrible
Hey
what about the film
What film
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he
We can see what happened to him
- - Again we are watching slides in the darkened room
This time Standard, Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb
The camera reveals the "urns
"  The climax of the sequence of stills comes when       ""    -- and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to show a series of meaningless blurs
Then the reel ends
That must have been when he got it
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship
except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there
(clicks back through the slides to a picture of one of the "urns") At first  thought they were jars too, or artifacts anyway
But they're not
They're eggs, or spore casings
Let's go back to the heiroglyphics
-- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb
personally can't make any sense out of it
Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing different angles on the glyphs
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits
That sounds a little fanciful
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation
What common objects
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard
(rising) 'll do it
The rest of you continue
(rising) 'll come with you
- Standard and Hunter come down the passageway
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo
What do you mean
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid
They're from different cultures and different races
That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did
The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid
It's dead
Maybe it wasn't always dead
They arrive at the infirmary
- The door slides open, and they step into the room
Hunter activates the bed, and it slides out of the wall
,
It's gone
They rush to Broussard's prone form Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing Now we're in for it
The door was closed
It must still be in here
They immediately grow very tense
Hunter starts edging toward the door
Standard grabs his arm
(') No, don't open the door
We don't want it escaping
(very nervous) Well, what the hell good can we do in here
We can't grab it -- it might jump on us -- Maybe we can catch it
Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid
(') As long as we're careful not to damage it
Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly around the room
There are very few places to hide
He bends down and peers under the bunk
As he is down on his hands and knees, ,
He rises, and (leaping back) Shit
But the thing is not moving
It lies motionless on the floor, its tentacles curled up
Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey
Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and takes a long probe from the wall
He prods the thing; it does not respond
(') think it's dead
With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite into the tray
Then he quickly closes the lid
- Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a stainless steel table, with a bright light on it
It is belly-side up
Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him
Is that its mouth
More likely that organ -- the tube- like thing -- fits up in there
With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy aperture
Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ
Ugh
Suddenly, it starts to
Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme something to grab it with
It begins to
Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes the thing in the tongs
It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor
(') Christ
Let's get it out of here
Carrying the thing, he heads for the door
- The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing in the tongs
It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor
- They come running up to the airlock
Roby stabs the button and the inner door slides open
By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is already on the intercom: (shouts into intercom) For Chrissake, open the main lock
-   - Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the thick surface door rumbles open
Orange sunlight billows in, followed by the inevitable dust
Standard    , tongs and all
-    - The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust, smouldering and fuming
-   - The outer door rolls shut
(slumping against the wall) My God, it's lethal even when it's dead
Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in the floor
Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor
There, he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination
- (over intercom, filtered) Yes
How's Broussard
(over, filtered) He's running a fever
Still unconscious
(over, filtered) Yes
Can you do anything for him
(over, filtered) The machine will bring his temperature down
His vital functions are strong
Good
He switches off the intercom
(') (suddenly exhausted) need some coffee
He turns and walks away
- - The cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats; Standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting
feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long
(stroking the cat) About four hours
(staring into his coffee cup) 'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin
We never should have landed here
Look, 'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything
The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible
can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship -- We do know that
Yeah
They never made it off the planet
The parasites won
This brings a
Where did the parasites come from
They seem native to the planet
It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity
It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile
No
It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites
If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers
Too primitive
It's a pre- technological construction
That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb
God knows how long they've been here
think we better take another look at those heiroglyphs
Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in
He is covered with dirt and grime
Hey, guess what
What
The engines are fixed
-  - The 's engines cough and then with a , cutting through the tulgy dust
The ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimited power
-  - They are all at their posts
Switch on tractor beams
There is a hair-tingling   which permeates the whole ship, and it begins to float, like a cork in water
(') Lock tractor beams
The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself
(') Retract landing struts
-  - The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force
The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship
-  - Take us up
(into intercom) Up one kilometer, Jay
-  - The  begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light
-  - Switch on lifter quads
,
- "" - The hovering  begins to accelerate through the choking atmosphere
-  - Engage artificial gravity
Roby throws a switch, and the ship
Engaged
Let's take her into an escape orbit
The men get busy with switches
'm altering our vector now; should give us an easy escape velocity -- & (in concert) What was that
In answer,
(over, filtered) This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all
The pitch of the engines changes, deepens
-  - The  swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds
Visibility is zero
- Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning to fill with dust
He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to suck up some of the dust
-  - On the screens, nothing but clouds
Then, The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim, set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments
Periodically they mutter technical instructions to each other
-  - Abruptly the ship - , trailing a wake of dust behind it
-  - They all
(pounds his panel) We made it
Damn, we made it
You bet we made it
Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive
With great pleasure
Roby begins to punch buttons
feel like an escapee from Hell
: -     - The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the universe all around
There is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching the ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red
This is redshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity
-  - They are unstrapping
That's the part that always makes me feel like 'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed
Quit complaining; we're in space
They rise and head out of the room
- As they walk along
think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is
It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him
They enter the infirmary
- As they enter the room, in  --
(hoarsely) Mouth's so dry
can  have some water
Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water
Broussard gulps it down in a swallow
(') More
Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard, who greedily consumes the entire thing
Then he sags, panting, on the bunk
(softly) How do you feel, Dell
(weakly) Wretched
What happened to me
Don't you remember
Don't remember nothing
Can't hardly remember my name
Are you in pain
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years
Melkonis laughs at this remark
Broussard smiles faintly at him
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back
God 'm hungry
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember
don't know
Do you remember the pyramid
No
Just some horrible dreams about smothering
Where are we
We're going home
We're in hyperspace
We're going into the freezers now
'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers
(laughs) think that's a pretty reasonable request
- - The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions greedily
The cat eats from a dish on the table
Boy do  feel a lot better
It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt
Any bets on the top bid
(chewing) Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet
They all
'm going to write a book about this expedition
'm going to call it "The Snark Log
" (stiffly) The commander normally has first publication rights
Maybe we could write it together
First thing 'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs
Oh it's okay
've had better cag than this, but 've had worse too, if you know what  mean
kind of like it
You like this shit
It grows on you
You know what they make this stuff out of
(annoyed) Yes,  know what they make it out of, so what
It's food now
You're eating it
didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all
Do we have to talk about this kind of crap at the dinner table
Suddenly, unexpectedly,
What's wrong
(his voice straining) don't know
'm getting these The others stare at him in alarm
Another  is torn from his lips
He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles whitening
Breathe deeply
(screaming) What Dell -- what Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is trembling violently from head to foot
(incoherent shriek) OhmygooaaAA '
' , '
Everybody  and leaps back from the table
The cat spits and bolts
The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground
When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped
Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest, spouting blood
The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime
Oh, no
Oh, no
What was that
What the Christ was that
It was growing in him the whole time and he didn't even know it
Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse
That thing used him for an incubator
-  - hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped body tumbles silently out
as Broussard drifts into eternity
- The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers
But we can't kill it
If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space
Shit
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship
(sighs) Well,  kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation
and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting
We've got about a week left, right
And then we run out of food and oxygen
The water will still recycle
We won't need it then
All right, so that's what we've got
week
It's plenty of time
But if we haven't caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway
They enter the bridge
- So does anybody have any suggestions
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship
That would kill it
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen
We're going to have to flush it out
How
Room by room, corridor by corridor
No one likes this thought
And what do we do when we find it
We'll have to trap it somehow
If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting
It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong
We have to avoid injuring it
What we really need is some electric animal prods
think  could cobble something together
long metal rod with a battery in it
Give it a hell of a shock
Good
Get on it
But first, 'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets
Let's get down to the locker and change
They start for the exit
- The  continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace
- Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone
He is garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot policeman, including clear plastic helmet
He reaches a corner and turns
But this new passageway has a different gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical wall
He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside- down
He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down them
-    - Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space
He also wears the protective suit
Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome
It is dark and eerie here, under the stars of interstellar space
few glowing panels provide the only illumination
thought 'd find you here
was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink
"  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship
That's the one about the albatross, right
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust
We are utterly, absolutely alone
Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances
Halfway across Creation
We came out there, we'll go back long time by the clock, but a short time to us
Time and space have no meaning out here
We're living in Einsteinian equation
can see you're putting your spare time to good use
(leans forward and taps him on the knee) Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall
've seen it happen
(smiles at him) We're the new pioneers, Chaz
We even have our own special diseases
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear
- The whole crew has assembled
Faust is unfolding several yards of shimmering metallic netting
Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles
These have portable generators in them
They're insulated down to here -- just be careful not to touch the end
He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal object
blue spark leaps
Might even incinerate the damn thing
(sharply) hope not
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive
How do we locate the creature
With these
He picks up a small portable unit
(') Tracking device
You set it to search for a moving object
It hasn't got much range, but when you get within a certain distance, it starts beeping
Standard takes the device and studies it
These will be very useful
At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands
All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship
Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock
Clear
Even simple
Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues: For starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe
Faust takes the device and turns it on
He scans it around the room
It's clear
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust
Hunter and  will make up the second team
They start doling out the equipment
(') We'll all carry communicators
We want to keep in constant touch
- Melkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it, carrying the tracking device
He continually scans it from side to side
Nothing yet
nothing
we can move pretty fast as long as there's nothing on the tracker
- Standard and Hunter move silently along
Standard is forced to serve a double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well
- Roby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when: Hold it
Faust's tracker is , and a small light flashes
(') 've got something
Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around
Where's it coming from
(peers closely at tracker and frowns) Machine's screwed up,  can't tell
Needle's spinning all over the dial
Is it malfunctioning
Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes
No, just confused
It's coming from below us
They all look down at their feet
- Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship
The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the ceiling
The effect is ugly and confining
They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading the net across the corridor
Okay
(looking at tracker and nodding down the passageway) That way
They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw metal flooring
It is extremely dark
What happened to the lights
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em
They switch on the helmet lights
,  : (') Hold it
They all stop quickly, almost stumbling
(') (whispering) It's within 4 meters
Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand
Faust, prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal
He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker
The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall
Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door
He raises the prod, grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod inside
- , ,  ,
Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but: (very annoyed) Oh, hold it
They open the net and release the creature
Hissing and spitting, it scampers away
We're making fools of ourselves
Roby's
(into communicator) Yes
(over, filtered) We've got it up here
It's trapped
Get up here fast
Where are you
(over, filtered) Food-storage room
We're coming
They dash for the stairs
- Roby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive at: - Standard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics
We saw it inside and slammed the door on it
It's in there now
On the other side of the door,    can be heard
What's it doing, having a seizure
It started crashing around right after we locked it in
Now what
guess we open the door and net it
hate to open that door
Again the thing can be heard
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs
and tentacles
Well we better do something
Maybe we don't have to
It's trapped in there
We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth
(snaps) Don't be an idiot
know what we can do
We can pump poison gas into the room and kill it
Through those ventilator slots there
He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door
Hey, wait a minute
That's all our food supplies in there
We can't pump poison gas all over them
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep
Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all
You win
Somebody gimme a hand, 'll get the stuff
-     - they are fastening a large funnel- shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door
This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large metal tank with pressure gauges
Get those masks on
They pull on gas masks
This stuff's deadly --  hope we know what we're doing
Go ahead, Jay
Faust turns on the machine
It begins to throb as it pumps the gas through the hose and into the room
Immediately,      , Then the sounds stop altogether
(') Shut it off
Faust shuts off the pump
Now what
What do you think
Now we go in
Standard steps to the door and opens it
thick cloud of gas billows out
- The room is thick with the poison gas
The men look like insects in their gasmasks
The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered all over the floor
Looks like he helped himself
Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised
Then Hunter points
God damn it
They all look where he is pointing
In the wall, (') It escaped
They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it
Where does that go
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure
Then let's go and do it
They head for the door
Have we got any food at all left in the ship
They slam the door shut and seal it
- The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of ventilator shafts
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice
The food storage room on one end -- -- And the cooling unit on the other
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out
Poison gas
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit
It'll flood the whole ship
The only other thing  can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out
Are you crazy The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him
How about a flamethrower
That wouldn't poison the air
So one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along -- While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net
Sounds like a rough one
Got a better idea
Hunter shrugs
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft
Let's be democratic
He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console
On one of them, he draws a large
Then he wads each piece of paper into a tiny little ball
He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table like dice
(') Martin, take one
Roby picks one up and unfolds it
It is blank
Melkonis picks up another and opens it
Again blank
Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up
They are both blank
They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his
(') Open it up, Cleave
- Hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower
Faust is helping him
Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device
Well, uh
good luck
hope you won't need me, but if you do, 'm here
(grimly) Right
Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just large enough to crawl through
- It is completely dark in the shaft
Hunter reaches up and turns on his helmet light
Then he switches on his radio
Hey, do you guys read me down there
- Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net
We hear the hum of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles
Large airshafts run off in different directions
Yeah, we're getting into position
- Okay, 'm starting now
He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel
He turns a corner
After a couple more tight turns,
Hunter twitches
He raises his flamethrower and It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly heats up
Smoke drifts back into his face
He begins to sweat
- Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall
(pointing) There
That's where it's got to come out
He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the opening
(') That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing
Right now let's keep it closed
Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it
The screen shows a section of the ship's schematic
've got Hunter
and something else as well, in front of him
Are they close
They're on the next level up
Let's get moving with this net
They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening
- Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees
Up ahead, he can see that the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn
He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his flamethrower
Then he starts crawling down, head first
When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized
Then the tracker starts
Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering
He hears a   up ahead, and claws scrambling on metal
Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal flaming burst toward the sound
- Melkonis is staring at his screen
They're getting pretty close now
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door
Okay
Okay
(to Roby) And you and  will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it
(tensely) Uh-huh
- Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the flamethrower
(whispers) Hey, you guys
- (into communicator) Yes
- (whispering) don't think this shaft goes on too much farther
anyway it's getting pretty hot in here
- (into communicator) Okay, our screens show you as being near to the opening
We'll open it up, then we'll cue you and you can start blasting
That'll drive it right out
You don't have to go any farther
- Good
He readies the flamethrower
- Okay, get ready
He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch the small creature when it darts out
Melkonis picks up his electric prod
(') Open the vent, Sandy
Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch
The metal gate drops down, opening up the shaft
- , ,   , -      -
Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in one claw and            , '    , ' -
Standard and Roby are left standing in shock
After a moment, Hunter climbs out of the shaft
What happened
Where is it
They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the creature just leaped into
It is another shaft, going down into darkness
(awed) How did it get so big By eating our food supplies
Where's Melkonis
- Faust is still waiting
(into his communicator) Hey, are you guys still there
What's going on
(over, filtered) Meet us on the bridge
Be careful -- it's huge now
Right
Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks the door behind him
- Standard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him
It was horrible -- horrible
Like a chicken
- Standard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs
Faust follows shortly
They all look blank, stunned
What happened
Where's Sandy
Dead
Dead
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm
We were completely unprepared
It's still in the ship
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there
(throws a switch; circuitry lights up) At least it can't get up here now
Two down, four to go
(angrily) What's that supposed to mean
Nothing
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock
Thing is, 'm about out of fuel
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge
(rises) 'll go get it
No,  don't want us separated
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section
Don't count on it
We sure need this flamethrower
All right
but do not go below decks
Right
(heads for the door) And be right back
Faust exits
think it's time we took a hard look at those heiroglyphs
Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics appear on some of the screens
(') Can you make out any pattern in all that
(baffled) Well
yes
there's a pattern
but it's meaningless to me
know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms
Recognizable
In that
In symbolic form
very stylized
but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with
Well
suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard
Is that what you mean
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker
So the next step should be -- -- The big one
And there it is
Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle
This is all the same creature
We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle
Then that tomb
must have been some kind of fertility temple
where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals
And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases
Only four forms are shown
After that the pattern repeats
Which presumably means
More spores coming
- Faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt halt when he notices that a He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is Faust hesitates and peers into the lock
- The creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a bloody thigh bone
It does not see Faust
- Stealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall intercom and speaks into it
(whispering) It's in the lock -- blow the main lock
- Standard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures
The call from Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence
(into intercom) What
- (whispering) It's in the main air lock
Blow the lock
- Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind and runs to his console -- and
- With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close
The creature hears it and
- The creature comes flying out of the lock and    - ,
, crushing him to a thickness of about three inches
On the wall, a green light goes on: "  " - Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches by Faust's squashed body,
,
-  - In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock door
This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into the vacuum under pressure
- ,      as the ship's air is sucked out toward the lock
,     : " " After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control room
- Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways, as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along by the air current
-  - huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it
- Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall
As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance, Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running again
- Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock
Here, the wind is really terrific -- his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound is a
Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor
As the hatch closes,   ,
Done in, he collapses to the floor
Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath
Because of the thinness of the air,          -- , ,
Roby is gasping loudly, but we can barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater
- Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water
They are sweating heavily and their noses bleed
They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks
Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall
The others follow him
- The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring
We see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks
Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them
, as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully
Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up
How much oxygen did we lose
Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges
We've got six hours left
(groans) Oh my God
Does anybody know what happened
saw it
Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door
His body held it open
Can we get to him
No,  had to seal off a whole section
We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door
- Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the vacuum
His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood
- The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs
The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear
(picking up the cat) Poor kitty; puss puss puss
At least we're rid of the damn monster
It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship
No such luck
saw it running down one of the corridors
(groans) Oh no
We can't fight this thing
There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men
don't buy that
There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers
How It's time for drastic remedies
It was time for that a couple days ago
That kind of remark is pointless
Now come on --  want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild
We can't kill it on board
It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body
've got an idea, but you're not going to like it
Let's hear it
Okay
First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines
That'll blow the ship up
Right
but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core
In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship
Blow the ship up
And the creature with it
We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed
And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold
That's the only reason we came out here
We'd have to abandon them all
We'd be broke
Our lives are more important
Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat
No, it won't work and  just realized why
There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat
Only one of us could survive
Yeah
forgot
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow
They think
(') If we could just get the creature into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up
Good
That's good
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space
think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat
We can use the flamethrower
It's not going to work
You can't say that;  think it's a good plan
The flamethrower needs more fuel
Right
We've got a lot to accomplish
Let's get moving
-  & The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship
lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around
Each container is well packed and labelled
Which explosive should we use
'd suggest the -13 sticks
They're portable, and they can be radio detonated
Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like broomhandles, with tiny printing on them
Meanwhile,
He touches one of them
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it
Here, carry these
Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles
(grabbing at him) Hey watch it (grinning) It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it
They begin to carry the explosives up the steps
- The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when Hunter's tracker suddenly
Hold it
They all stop
The tracker
Hunter puts down his stuff and points the tracker around
(') (nodding up some steps) Up there
They all look at each other
Standard puts down his bundle and picks up the flamethrower
So what do we do
Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now
Now
If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space
Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps
- Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps
Suddenly, a    is heard
He freezes
Then he continues up
-    - The view of interstellar space is spectacular
As Standard comes up the steps, the   is heard again
Standard looks around
Then he sees it -- ' It is tangled in some rigging, and the movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass periodically
(shouts) You can come up
It's safe
The others come up the steps
(spying the corpse) Oh -- Jesus -- Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose
Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back
(horrified) Should we go outside and bring him in
No
the risk is too great
Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing
Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome
Broussard remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes
- The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way
This passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat
The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the equipment
They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat
- The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat
It is an extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and beams-are exposed
single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount of floor space
It is an escape-craft, nothing more
(pointing) Along the base of the walls there
They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly
This should do it
should hope so
And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it
It will be
(surveys the craft uneasily) What we really need is some red meat in here for bait
Well, if we had some, 'd eat it
'm starting to get hungry
By this time, they are exiting
- Well
now we have to herd that thing up here
(nervously) Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as
as
(searches for a word) Isn't "bait" the word you used
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too
if the others are injured
Who gets the privilege
:
Three hands pick them up
He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see it
It has a big  on it
-
Hunter is showing Roby a small device like a transistor radio
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all
Is it armed
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off
Thanks for the thought
(puts detonator in his breast pocket) All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and -- Kablooey
Hunter's face twitches nervously at this
Come on; we haven't much time, air is a factor
They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower, Hunter the tracker
Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to familiarize himself
Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat door a couple of times
It slams open and shut quite rapidly
He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "
" Then '  comes from the communicator: (over, filtered) We've got something on the tracker
got to be it, it's too big for the cat
This is a   ,     , (over, filtered) It's coming from down there
Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings, breathing, etc
- Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at the tracker
It must have stopped moving
'm not getting anything
Let me go first; you stay behind me
Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor
Then ,
Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter
It holds him off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him
Standard doesn't know what to do
The flamethrower
can't, the acid will pour out
At that moment the creature      , Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires -- Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of flame, held out at arm's length by the monster
- Roby is listening to all this on the communicator
He can hear the shrieks and crashing noises
Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static
Hello
Standard
Hunter
He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his expression that he expects none
He drops his face into his hands
When he lifts his head again, he has managed to summon a certain amount of resolve
- Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other hand
He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor
He picks it up, substituting it for the pistol
Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps into the maintenance level
- Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that the source of the signal is directly under his feet
Looking down, he sees that he is standing on a square metal plate
Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate, revealing a black opening with a ladder going down
Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder
- Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal ladder to the floor
,   , ,   , ,
Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it
It appears to be woven from some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating
Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon
As he gets close enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps violently
(a feeble whisper) Kill me
(sickened) What did it do to you
(moves his head slightly) Look
Roby turns his light where Standard indicates
Another cocoon dangles from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different
It is smaller and darker, with a harder shell
In fact, it looks almost (') (whispering) That was Melkonis
it ate Hunter
(looking around for a tool) 'll get you out of there
No
don't
But  can save you -- get you to the Autodoc
No good
it's eaten too much of me
(in horror) What can  do
Kill me
Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look at him
, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and sprays a molten blast
When the entire room is in flames, he turns and scrambles back up the ladder
- Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up
At length, he regains control of himself
-   - The  appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters rolling past in the infinite distance
- Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a little oxygen tank on it
Kitty go bye-bye
He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen
There is a faint hiss of pressurized air
Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in front
It
He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge
-  & Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal cannisters
(reading from labels) What'll it be, Kitty
Here -- how about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of it
This'll buy us an island on some nice planet
Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries back up the steps
- Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine room, containing the massive stardrive engines
He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the engines
Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one by one
Attention
The cooling units for the stardrive engines are not functioning
Engines will overload in 4 minutes, 50 seconds
Attention
Finally Roby closes the last switch
Shaking with nervousness, he hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the engine room
- Roby hurries on, listening to the siren
Attention
Engines will overheat and main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30 seconds
- Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed
Hands full, he starts to enter the connecting passageway
- , It  and starts toward him
- Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws the switch
The hatch door  , locking the thing in the lifeboat
Attention
Engines will overload in 4 minutes
Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "" button
The thing can be heard fumbling around in the passageway
Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room
- Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the ship as he sprints for the engine room
Attention
Engines will overload in 3 minutes, 30 seconds
- The door crashes open and Roby comes running in
The room is full of smoke and the engines are whining dangerously
It is extremely hot in the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat
He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit switches
Still
Attention
Engines will overload in 3 minutes
Roby pushes a button and speaks into it
Computer
've turned all the cooling units back on
What's wrong
The reaction has proceeded too far
The core has begun to melt
Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds
look of terror comes onto Roby's face
He turns and runs from the engine room
- Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down: Attention
Engines will overload in 2 minutes
- Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where the lifeboat is berthed
He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward the passageway
It is then he realizes that
Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him
Then he advances on the passageway
- Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands
He is goaded on by the siren and the computer: Attention
Engines will explode in 90 seconds
He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his head into the lifeboat
- -- as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is - Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway
There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat
Attention
Engines will explode in 60 seconds
- He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and does a dive over the back of the control chair
He is no sooner in the seat than he hits the "" button
-    - The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, "
" - Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship
- The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of the
The scene is strangely serene for such deadly circumstances
- Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the catbox
The cat is
Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches his head down over it
- The  drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind, until it is barely a point of light
- The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling everything inside
Then all is quiet
Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of the lifeboat
He stares out through the porthole
His face is bathed in orange light
- What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past
- Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of his ship and friends
,        -- The cat
Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of the boat
It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm
It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby
His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on the floor right next to the monster
Next he glances around for any place to hide
His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit, with the door standing open
He begins to edge toward the locker
The creature rises
He freezes
It throws down the arm
With that, Roby dives for the open locker door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut
- There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face right up to the glass, peering in at Roby
The locker is so small that Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's
The sight is disgusting
It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity
Then the     distracts it
- The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits
It bends down and peers inside
The
It picks up the catbox in its tentacles
- Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the glass, startling the hell out of Roby
Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the catbox
Roby looks around
He spies the spacesuit
Quickly, he begins to pull it on
- The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see if there is anything inside
The cat
- Roby is halfway into the pressure suit
- The creature throws the catbox down
It clangs, and bounces
The thing picks it up again and hammers it against the wall
Then it jams it into a crevice in the wall
With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the crevice
The cat has gone beyond hysterics
- Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the oxygen
With a hiss, the suit fills itself
In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip
Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point
Again he raps on the glass
- The creature turns
It faces the locker, peers at him
- Try a little of this, you fucking bastard
- The creature rises, but just in time to catch The yellow acid begins to flow from the wound
Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a switch --
In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into space -- and the bleeding creature along with it
Roby grabs a steel strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him -  - Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing clinging to his leg
He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't let go
- Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and yanks it
The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but '
It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back
-  - The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming, the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch
- Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal
Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled: " " -  - The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the creature is wriggling
, ,
- Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing
- The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a writhing, smoking, foaming mass
As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats -- then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all directions
The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling into infinity
: -  - The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair
He seems calm and composed, almost cheerful
The cat purrs in his lap
(dictating) So it looks like 'll make it back to the Colonies on schedule after all
should be to the frontier in another 250 years or so, and then with a little luck the network will pick me up
'm not as rich as  was a couple days ago -- but 'm not exactly broke either
Incidentally,  did manage to salvage one souvenir out of this whole mess
He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls out the
(') Poor Yorick here should go at least partway toward proving 'm not a crank
wish it was him we'd met in the first place -- things might have turned out different
He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it
(') This is Martin Roby, executive officer, last survivor of the commercial vessel , signing off
Come on, cat, let's go to sleep
Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder
Then he rises and, carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open
He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against his chest
With one hand, he presses a switch, and -    , watching sentinel over the slumbering Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie
- The lifeboat --  2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth, 250 years from now
As  2 drifts past camera, we suddenly see that &
