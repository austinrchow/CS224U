John Carpenter's Escape From New York written by John Carpenter and Nick Castle transcript by Anjela
Conner ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- 1988 -- The Crime Rate in the United States Rises Four Hundred Percent
In 1988, the crime rate in the United States rises four hundred percent
-- Line-graphic of New York,   highlighted
The once-great city of New York becomes the one maximum-security prison for the entire country
--   lights up
The word "Prison" is added
fifty-foot containment wall is erected along the New Jersey shoreline, across the Harlem river, and down along the Brooklyn shoreline
It completely surrounds Manhattan Island
-- The containment wall is added to the line graphic with the tag "Containment Wall"
All bridges and waterways are mined
-- Dots symbolizing the bridges and waterways blink on and off
The United States Police Force, like an army, is encamped around the island
-- Arrows symbolizing the police force are added
-- Statue of Liberty Island Security Control
There are no guards inside the prison: only prisoners and the worlds they have made
-- Outline drawing of New York
The rules are simple
Once you go in, you don't come out
-- Outline drawing of the Statue of Liberty and the shoreline are added
-- 1997 -- 1997 --
Jeep pulls up outside the base
It comes to a stop and the driver pulls out a walkie-talkie
This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17
have an escape in progress
An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall
-- --  "New York Maximum Security Penitentiary Manhattan Island" --
-- Two guards watch for the escapees in question
-- helicopter flies over the bay towards Manhattan Island
-- The two escapees paddle, trying to get across the bay
-- The search light -- The two escapees continue paddling
'
You have 10 seconds
Turn around
Start back to the island
-- The pilot targets the boat on a computer screen in front of him
-- Two shots are fired directly in front of the escapees as a warning
They ignore them and continue paddling away from the island
-- -- ' The pilot
-- The boat
-- Following the helicopter as it returns to the base
-- Rehme walks back to the main base, pulling out his walkie-talkie on the way
Gotham 4, confirm the kill
Circled the base
Over
Security, this is Rehme
We have confirmation from Gotham 4
We have a kill in midharbor
South of the battery
Two in the water dead
Two confirmed
Very well
-- Rehme walks into a building labeled "    and picks up a phone
Air traffic, this is Rehme
-- The helicopter lands
In the background, a     comes up
-- ""  gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by three guards into the base
He looks like the essence of cool
His hair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the line, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on
He's wearing a black spandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair of camouflage pants with lots of pockets
His jacket is a brown leather jacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of handcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight metal bar between them
He's not resisting anything, but the police are not taking any chances
-- Plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main floor
Attention
You are now entering the debarkation area
No talking
No smoking
The next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours
You now have the option to terminate and be cremated on the premises
If you elect this option, notify the duty sergeant in your processing area
-- -- "No talking
No smoking
Follow the line
" He is not impressed
, '
Guards, guards, more guards
Who cares
As Snake rounds the corner: Hold it
Snake stops, turns, directs an impertinent glance at the speaker
He's still not impressed by any of this
------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Rehme waits as a limo pulls up
Out steps
We've got a small jet in trouble, over restricted air space
Where is it
Seven miles out and closing
The two of them walk
-- Hauk and Rehme walk down the stairs
They turn   and walk into the
Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission screens, wearing headsets and working
Following Hauk and Rehme into the room: -- We've been on the board for the last twenty minutes
We haven't been able to reach them
There was a transmission ten minutes ago
He identified as "David 14
"  Then all of a sudden he was cut off
Hauk and Rehme stand behind a
David 14, acknowledge
David 14, we are sending Air Rescue
Squawk 7700, contact on 121
5
(to Hauk and Rehme) There's still no reply
(to his headset) Bayonne
have a mayday in restricted space
New York,  have it
Hauk pulls Rehme aside
Who is it
don't know
You have the code
There's no David 14 on the computer
Unlisted
Unregistered code
We telexed Washington
Still waiting for a reply
think 've got him, sir
Hauk and Rehme walk back over to the controller
He patches a voice- over through
It's too late, assholes
All your imperialist weapons and lies can't save him now
We're going down
We're going to crash
David 14, acknowledge
The code's coming in, sir
Hauk and Rehme dash over to the codeman
He shows them a display
"Aircraft Identified
Code: David14
Decode:
" "Air Force One" blinks as Hauk and Rehme look at each other in shock
-- The plane is flying over New York
-- The  has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own
Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went
She pulls out a slip of  and proceeds to read
We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country have struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick
-- secret service  taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel continues
What better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison
The agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers
(to 2ND ) Unlock the pod
2ND  immediately runs off
She's bolted the door
Can't you shoot off the lock
No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin
How about lifting the door off of the hinges
No, sir
-- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to it
Get me to the pod
The President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the plane
-- The pod opens
An expert attaches a locating device to the President's wrist
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from the pod
'm activating it now
on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod
He pushes a few buttons
God save me and watch over you all
-- guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York
-- Rehme and Hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane
Computer simulation tracking Air Force One
-- The plane goes down
-- -- As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the building
It's the pod
It's down
It's the escape pod
40 degrees, 50 yards from impact
'm going in
-- Helicopters prepare for, and execute, launch, and fly into New York guard watches them
-- Rehme watches monitors as Hauk talks
1--Larry
Over the battery
We're moving down
Direct sight ahead
-- The helicopters land
swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs back
He follows with a second swarm
The first swarm assumes a defensive position near the pod
Hauk examines the pod
It's definitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames
An odd  from nowhere
walks out of the darkness
He nods his head to Hauk
You touch me
he dies
If you're not in the air in thirty seconds
he dies
You come back in
he dies
Weirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the President's middle finger, complete with ring
Twenty seconds
'm ready to talk
Nineteen
Eighteen
What do you want
Seventeen
Sixteen
Let's go
Let's go
Weirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the helicopters and hauls ass out of New York
-- Rehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone
Hauk is in the foreground, looking pensive
Yes, he's right here, Mr
Vice President
Hauk picks up a phone
This is Bob Hauk
We can't
If we move in with choppers, they'll kill him
We're lucky if he's not dead already
They don't want anything yet
By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too late
Tell him we have to go with your plan now
Hauk waves him off
We can't wait until tomorrow
If we have to move in and take the island, it's a last resort
It's 8:45
want permission to try a rescue
Thank you
'  -- Hauk calmly arms a
45 pistol
He looks up from his desk
All right
He's dangerous, sir
(with quiet confidence) know
'll be
'
We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure
It's Snake Plissken all right, live and in the flesh
The guards leave
Snake walks into Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk
He raises his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," but he doesn't actually say anything
Hauk shakes his head
'm not a fool, Plissken
(coooooool) Call me Snake
Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file
Plissken
American Lieutenant
Special Forces Unit, Black Flight
Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia
Youngest man to be decorated by the President
You robbed the federal reserve depository
Life sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary
'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, War Hero
Snake could not care less
He reaches forward with his still-cuffed right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand, strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette
He lets out a calm breath and says: Who are you
Hauk
Police Commissioner
Bob Hauk
Special Forces Unit
Texas Thunder
We heard of you, too, Plissken
Why are we talking
have a deal for you
You'll receive full pardon for every criminal act committed in the United States
Hauk shows Snake the pardon
Snake's eye lights up
This is something he wants
He's interested now, and can't hide it
(pressing his advantage) There was an accident about an hour ago
small jet went down inside New York City
The President was on board
(re-establishing control over the conversation) President of what
That's not funny, Plissken
(beat)  You go in, find the President and bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man
We sense amusement from Snake
This is not the first time the government has asked him for a favor
But he's not a soldier or a "War Hero" anymore
He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon
He's holding the cards now, and he knows it
Twenty-four hours, huh
'm making you an offer
Bullshit
Straight just like  said
'll think about it
No time
Give me an answer
Snake turns away
Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined to be in the driver's seat
Get a new president
We're still at war, Plissken
We need him alive
don't give a fuck about your war
or your president
Is that your answer
'm thinking about it
Think hard
Snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette
Next question: Why me
You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad
You know how to get in quiet
You're all 've got
guess  go in one way or the other
Doesn't mean shit to me
Give me the paper
When you come out
Before
told you  wasn't a fool, Plissken
Call me Snake
-- Rehme talks as we   a table full of weapons
We see two guns, a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a Uzi, throwing stars, and more
Snake surveys them with a cool expression
Some of them have cars
They took old junkers that were left behind and converted them to steam
We think they may also have a gasoline source in there, and power
Greenhouses, rigged up generators
Some areas have streetlights
The crazies
Live in the subways
Complete control of the underground
They're night raiders
Snake's not into this
He'll figure it out when he gets there
He picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it
Tracer
Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes
You push it, we can track you on radar
Just like Leningrad
But they added something safety catch
Snake pushes the safety catch
Simple enough
And yes, there's the button
This is familiar
He smiles
-- Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now
He walks down the hall to the medical room with Hauk
Rehme has disappeared
Where am  landing
Top of the world trade center
Only place you can land
They won't see it, and you can take off from a free fall
On the roof there's a service elevator
It's still operational
We use it to infiltrate the prison
There's a power box
It'll activate the elevator down to fifty
From there on down you walk
Snake shrugs on his jacket
He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his authority, and it's not working very well
You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist
It sends out a sig pulse
Use this
He hands Snake a homing device
Homing device
Shows directions and distance
-- Snake and Hauk walk into the room
They're met by a young medic
Strong antitoxin
Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours
Snake braces himself against a table
The medic is holding an injection-type tech gizmo
Take off the jacket
'll be
Let's go, Plissken
Snake shrugs off his jacket, disoriented by the place
He's nervous
His hackles are up
don't like needles
Hauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand
He activates it and the time blinks on
It's counting down as we speak
Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds
We talked about twenty-four
In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over
China and the Soviet Union will go back home
The president was on his way to the summit when his plane went down
Snake snorts
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist
The tape recording inside has to reach Hartford in 22 hours
What's on it
You know anything about nuclear fusion
Snake turns away
No
Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise
It's about the survival of the human race, Plissken
Something you don't give a shit about
Hauk steps aside
The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides
'm going to inject you
It'll sting for a second or two
He raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them
Snake jumps a little; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things
That's it, Plissken
Snake gets off the table
The medic turns around
Tell him
Tell me what
Hauk thinks he's got him this time
Snake doesn't like that
That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and flying off to Canada
Hauk shakes his head
Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the medic
What did you do to me, asshole
My idea, Plissken
Something we've been fooling around with
Two microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries
They're already starting to dissolve
In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve
Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge
Not a large explosive
About the size of a pinhead
Just big enough to -- (he gestures) open up both your arteries
'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen seconds -- Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat
They're protected by the cores
Fifteen minutes before the last hour is up we can neutralize the charge with -rays
Snake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch
22:57:38
37
36
This is his life he's watching tick away
We'll burn out the charges  you have the President
What if 'm a little late
No more Hartford Summit
And no more Snake Plissken
When  get back 'm going to kill you
The Gullfire's waiting
-- Snake pulls up in a Jeep
He walks up to the tiny plane called the Gullfire
Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane and does his job
He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and closes the overhead window
-- Snake turns on his monitors
'm ready
21 hours
Suppose he's dead, Hauk
If  come back without him, you'll burn these things out
--- Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to come up
Get them both back, Plissken
-- Snake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about it
Remember, once inside you're on your own
Oh, you mean  can't count on you
No
Good
-- larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is essentially a big hang glider
-- Hauk checks Snake's life clock, "Master Life Clock"
20:17:43
42
41
-- Snake's watch reads 20:17:40
39
38
37
36
35
He starts controlling the plane
He flips the tracer open and hits the button, testing it
-- The master life clock shows the test confirmation
Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds
Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief
-- Snake takes the plane in
-- Snake looks over his monitors
He sees New York coming up
-- Hauk waits at his microphone
Are you picking up the target blip
-- Right on course
-- The plane aims for the World Trade Center
-- It's been a while
The plane is aiming right at a building
How's your altitude
Snake calmly angles the plane up
-- Plissken
Plissken
Plissken, what are you doing
-- Playing with myself
'm going in
Snake targets the World Trade Center
He checks his instruments
-- The plane comes down
It hits hard
Snake puts on the brakes, adds a grappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge
-- Plissken
Plissken
-- Snake walks over to the elevator
He uses the power box to get the elevator started
He looks around, and the doors open
He gets in the elevator
The doors close
-- Snake's voice comes through the radio
'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor
Just like Leningrad, Hauk
Is the glider intact
-- Snake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti- covered building
Yeah, but taking off is for shit
'll work it out
You'll have to use the east stairwell
It'll take you a little while to get to ground level
Snake checks his life clock
19:22:44
43
42
Call me when you get outside
Snake puts his walkie-talkie away as someone runs past
He doesn't notice
He walks on
------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Snake walks along with his tracer
He goes through alleys and streets
He draws his gun as he walks by a group of people
He's armed and ready to fight
-- The plane is still burning
Smoke is coming from everywhere
The plane is severed in the middle
The crash is very impressive
Snake walks and notices a few people go by
He pulls out his walkie-talkie
'm at the plane
Nobody else made it, Hauk
Something beeps
His tracer
Wait a minute
He looks at his tracer
small red dot lights up in the southeast corner
've got his pulse
Right up ahead, moving northwest
He puts away his walkie-talkie and checks his life clock
18:50:18

: Images
Snake holding the tracer
He gets closer and comes up to a building, formerly a theater
He walks in
-- The pulse keeps getting stronger
Snake walks in
He holds his gun at the ready
There's a truly horrible musical going on
-- This is hell
This is hate
(etc
) Snake looks around
No sign of the president, but there is a enjoying the show
Time to move on
He enters against his better judgment, but he's just passing through, so that's
-- Snake keeps moving, but there's a noise
He turns around, aiming his gun
Cabbie holds up his hands
Hey
You're Snake Plissken, ain't you
What do you want
Nothin'
Snake lowers his gun
thought you were dead
Snake moves on
Hey
You don't want to walk around down there, Snake
-- The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer
Snake walks past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl
He doesn't take much notice
He keeps going
He sees a  sitting by a fire
Hi, Chief
Nice night
Nice boots
Niiiiice boots
Hey
guy tries to sneak up behind Snake
Snake knocks him out and points his gun at the bum
Easy now, chief
'm walking
'm walking
The bum walks away
Snake keeps going
man beats up another man at a sink
The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer
Snake kicks the beater and knocks him out
Mr
President
The man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles
He's a
'm the President
Sure, 'm the President
If  knew where  got this thing -- (indicates the tracer) 'd be the President
Where did you get it
woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle
Snake slams the tracer against the sink
-- The President's life signs all fail
Oh my god
It
It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself
-- Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie
Hauk
-- 'm right here, Plissken
don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's  the President
-- Snake holds the walkie-talkie up to the drunk
(to the tune of Joy to the World) Hail to the chief
La la la la la la
All right, get your machine ready
'm coming out
-- 18 hours, Plissken
-- Listen to me, Hauk
The President is , you got that
Somebody's had him for dinner
-- Plissken, if you get back in that glider 'll shoot you down
You climb out, 'll burn you off the wall
You understand that, Plissken
-- Snake stares at his walkie-talkie
little human compassion
-- Snake walks on
He's in an area with streetlights
He keeps going
-- Snake stares at the pod
No clues
He looks around
Nothing
As he comes back up, he sets up a chair and sits down heavily
He touches his neck
It's like he can feel the cores dissolving
crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers
Snake doesn't know what he's doing, but he doesn't like it
Especially not when the manhole covers start to rise up
He runs off
-- Snake finds the restaurant, and runs inside
No one follows
-- Snake backs into a corner
The floor is weak and starts to go out from under him once
He gets into the shadows
There's someone there
' You a cop
Snake levels his gun at her
No
' You've got a gun
You got a smoke
Snake tosses her his cigarettes
She lights one
Keep your hand over it
' It's all right if we're quiet
They won't hear us
(reacting to the cigarette) Hey, this is a real one
You just get in
What's going on out there
' Crazies
It's the end of the month
They're out of food
Do you live here
' Skulls
You kidding
'm with the Turks now
just got caught in the street after dark and now 'm stuck here all night
plane crashed seven hours ago
Did you see it
' No
Shit
' You're a cop
'm an asshole
' Hey, wait a minute
know who you are
Yeah
But  heard you were dead
am
' Wow, Snake Plissken
All right
What you doing in here with a gun, Snake
Looking for somebody
' Who
The President
' Come on
He really here
Somewhere
' When you find him, are you gonna take him out
Mm-hm
' Take me out with you, Snake
Why
' can think of lots of reasons why
She makes a move to kiss him, but there's a noise
They split up, but she gets sucked through the floor
Snake tries to save her, but it's too late
He gets the hell out of there
-- ,
-- ,
-- Snake runs through the building, breaks a window, and climbs up a fire escape to get to a new floor
He breaks a window to get in, then pulls a cabinet in front of the window
He shoots through the cabinet, causing some crazy to scream
He busts down a door, shoots open part of a wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a telephone pole
He then climbs up a wall
On the way he drops his walkie-talkie
He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up
Where you goin', buddy
Snake points his gun at Cabbie
He looks behind him, then gets in the cab
-- Snake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from "American Bandstand
" Bad neighborhood, Snake
You don't want to be walking from the Bowery to 42nd street at night
've been driving a cab here for 30 years and 'm telling you, you don't walk around here at night
Yes, sir
They'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat
Usually 'm not down around here myself, but  wanted to catch that show
Cabbie lights a rag stuffed down the neck of a bottle which is full of gasoline
This stuff is like gold around here, you know
-- Cabbie throws the bottle into the alley, where it explodes
-- Hey, Snake, when'd you get in
didn't even know they caught you
(laughs) Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab
Wait'll  tell Eddie
Hey, hang on, Snake
-- Cabbie makes a sharp turn
-- Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake
Looking for somebody
Well, why didn't you ask me
Hell,  know everybody in this town
Yes, sir
've been driving this cab for thirty years, this very same cab
Snake points his gun at Cabbie
'm  ask you
Now where's the President
The Duke's got him
Everyone knows the Duke's got him
You don't have to put a gun to my head
'll tell you
Who's the Duke
The
The Duke of New York
-Number-1
The big man, that's who
want to meet this Duke
You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy
Nobody wants to meet the Duke
You meet him once and then you're dead
Snake points the gun more insistently
Tough
'  -- Cabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building
hate to leave her on the street
Usually  don't leave her alone at all
But you're a special case, Snake
He and Snake walk up to the door
Cabbie knocks on the door with his shoe
It's , Snake
It's a better neighborhood
You can relax
Relax
Snake checks his life clock
17:40:46
45
44
Relax, my ass
Thanks
Boy, they got a great place here
Like a fortress
They
From the inside, someone answers
Who is it
It's me
Who's me
Cabbie
What do you want
Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important -- No way, Cabbie -- No, it's Snake
Snake Plissken
Maggie opens the door
She stands there and surveys the pair
' Plissken
He wants to see Brain
Why
want to meet the Duke
Snake and Maggie exchange a glance
She leads them in
' -- Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake
It used to be a public library
Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest
Mr
Fabulous
Duke loves him
(gesturing at Maggie) Who's that
That's Maggie
Brain's squeeze
The Duke gave him to Brain just to keep him happy
see what  mean
Snake can tell that Maggie's more than just Brain's squeeze; she's his bodyguard, too
She looks like she'd be willing to kill to protect Brain
Heard you were dead
'  -- Brain
Brain
brought somebody to see you
Snake looks at Brain
He knows this guy
Harold Helman
Brain puts down his book and stands up
Snake
"Harold"
Where you been, Harold
It's been a long time
You never told me you knew Snake Plissken, Brain
Isn't that great
Hey, Brain,  could use some gas if you can spare some
No one pays attention
Snake advances on Brain
Brain sits down
'm glad you remember me
Yeah
man should remember his past
Kansas City, four years ago
You ran out on me
You left me sitting there
You were late
We were buddies, Harold
You, me, and Fresno Bob
You know what they did to Bob
His face changes
He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and points his gun
Maggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake
You want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby
(to Brain) Where's the President
Swear to god, Snake,  don't know -- Don't fuck with me
Why do you want to know
want him
Working for the man now, huh
Then 'll just beat it out of your squeeze -- Mm-hm
Maggie doesn't know  where he is and unless you know where he is you'll never find him
Snake takes his gun away
He contemplates Brain
Listen, 'll take you out of here
Yeah
Jet glider just a couple of blocks down the street
And all you gotta do is get me to him
Everyone realizes the importance of this
No kidding
On the level
Will you take me, too
We've got to deal somewhere else
No glider
We've got the President
And the Duke's taking everybody out of here
Never happen
See,  know something you and the Duke don't know
We've only got so long before Mr
President don't mean a whole lot
You're lying
Maybe he's not
know him
Look at his face, he's lying
Right, Harold
'm lying
So  might as well have some fun and keep looking by myself
He cocks his gun and points it at Brain again
Brain -- Talk to him, baby -- Brain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him -- (panicking) Brain, you've got to tell him
(panicking) Brain, you've got to tell him -- (panicked) Tell him, tell him, tell him -- Snake lowers the gun
You always were smart, Harold
Just one thing right now
Don't call me "Harold
" -- Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out
So you work for this Duke, huh
Yeah
Make gas for him
Figure out things for him
Like what
(showing off) Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but  know where they're planted
We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across
before they shot the poor bastard
We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade
What a sight, Snake
The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and the President right out front
Oh, that would have been so fine
(ironically) Yeah, it would have been
Yeah, but we're going with Snake now
The three of them cross into the street
Cabbie panics
That's the Duke
know the sound of his engines
Don't cross the Duke -- everybody knows that
We get one glimpse of the Duke's car
Then we realize that Cabbie is gone and his cab is racing away
Cabbie, you slime
The Duke's car heads right for us
No, Brain
The two of them run off
After a while, Snake follows
The three of them hide
The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended over the headlights
It's in a caravan of three, leading the way fourth car comes up later
The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of a car with Weirdo in the back
The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at his side
The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy jacket, bluejeans, and boots
He looks
He sends Weirdo to knock on the door
He's looking for you, Brain
What does he want
He wants my diagram of the bridge
When he finds out 'm with you he's going to want my life
Shit, Plissken,  knew  shouldn't have listened to you -- We've got to get to the President , while he's busy
Forget it, he's on the other side of town and we got no wheels
The deal is off -- Just calm down
-- lone man sits, looking bored
Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him out, and gets him out of the car
He briefly considers shooting the guy on the hood of the car
Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks around
Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get Brain and Maggie
He knocks the other guy out of the car
(panicked) think they saw us
Turn left, turn left here
-- Brain, this is Broadway
know,  know, the Duke'll take Seventh Avenue, Broadway is five minutes -- No
Yes
Just keep driving
What's wrong with Broadway
-- (to the car) Come on sweetheart
People start throwing bricks
Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes it to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold a purse)
Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who gets on the car
bystander grabs Brain
Maggie
Maggie protects him
She shoots the people grabbing at him
Snake angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away
He glares at Brain
Everyone seems visibly shaken
Hold on
Snake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars
He takes off, the car a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on Broadway
-- Brain points to the cars as Snake watches
He'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire
Snake looks around
The Duke's caravan passes
There are more cars than there were before
It's all right
He's got to go in the front way
It'll take him five minutes
If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your own
When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking
They drive off
Snake gets to the trains
No one notices
Maggie and Brain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car
Hi, guys
Hi
how's it going
Cooled off a little, huh
What do you want, Brain
Duke told us to wait inside
He's on his way here now
He didn't say nothing to us about it
Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you
That's why he's the Duke
The camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad cars
He hasn't found the President yet
But he doesn't have time to wonder if Brain double-crossed him
Why don't we wait outside here for him
Why don't we wait inside for him
'Cause  got orders, that's why
What are your specific orders, by the way
Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside
How's the President holding up, by the way
Any political discussion you've had with him
'   -- Two guards sit with the President, talking
The first guard is by the President
The second is looking out the window
That Brain is a real pain in the ass
He's always sniffing around like a dog
He comes up with the gas
The second guard looks out the window
Snake grabs him by the neck, and breaks it
The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and that tips off the guard
What are you looking at
He turns and Snake throws a star at him
It lodges right in his brain, but not fast enough
Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow
Snake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him
The president still has the briefcase
This is it, this is the big time
Snake keeps calm
Are you from the outside
Stop shaking
can't
Who are you
Hauk sent me
We've got to move fast
Move fast
You're goddamned right 'll move fast
Quiet
Snake limps away, President in the lead
-- Snake and the President keep moving
Suddenly, Snake gets jumped
Ten guys surround him and the President, and though Snake fights well, it's not well enough
Brain comes out with Maggie
They got him
Now watch him
The Duke steps out from the car, followed by Weirdo
Friend of yours, Brain
He had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing  could do
(not believing it for a second) Uh-huh
Weirdo points accusingly as he and Duke walk away
Maggie
Duke walks up to Snake
Snake isn't giving in even though he's pretty sure he's beat
Who are you
Snake doesn't answer
Duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right leg and pulls on it
Snake writhes in agony
said who are you
Snake Plissken, Duke
The Man sent him in here
Something's going down we need him
Duke recognizes the name
He is impressed
He lets go of the arrow
Snake hates him more than ever
Snaaaaaake Plissken
've heard of you
He raises a crowbar over his head and smacks Snake with it, knocking him out
heard you were dead
-- helicopter flies over the city
-- The pilot looks at a grid-view of New York
4 This is surveillance 4 to security control
Nothing on the infrared body scan
Nothing in the searchlight
There aren't any fires on the street
Nobody moving down here
-- Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President wait
5 Surveillance 5
security control
negative on infrared body scan
no movement in the searchlight
nothing strange going on down there
They look at the Master Life Clock
12:27:39
38
Where's Plissken
-- Plissken lies unconscious on a bed, crossbow pointed at his head
Three guards are at the ready
-- We've got to go in now
We hold
You're countermanding my orders, Hauk
This is my prison, 'll give the orders
override all that
Just try
-- Unbelievable smog
Helicopters fly
still negative on the scan
4 This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control
Nothing on the infrared body scan
Negative on the sweep
-- Hauk stands on the wall, listening
10 Surveillance 10
Still negative on the scan
5 Surveillance 5 still negative
4 This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control
Nothing on the infrared body scan
Negative
-- Snake begins to come to
We hear gunshots and cheering
The guards go to announce Snake's consciousness
-- Brain and Maggie move to the center of the gunshots and cheering -- The Duke sits firing with Plissken's gun at the President, whose briefcase is still chained to his arm
-- Snake sits up
There are  of crossbows aimed at him
Don't move, Snake
Snake turns to face him
He stands up
We see for the first time exactly why he's called "Snake" Plissken
There's a snake tattooed on his stomach
The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a good idea of where it leads and what it becomes
Ah ha
Snake's life clock is gone
He has no idea how much time he's got
Shit
-- want that diagram, Brain
Oh
It's at my place, Duke
Duke, that Plissken said something about a time limit
What time limit
(gesturing at President) On him
That's a lot of crap
(to the President) What did  teach you
(weakly) You
You are
the Duke of New
New York
You're
-Number-One
can't hear you
' --
(to Brain) Get me the diagram
Duke
Don't kill Plissken
We need him
The Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance
Get moving, Brain
Brain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh
The Duke fires at the President's briefcase
Papers and a tape fall out
Weirdo looks down and kicks the tape away
He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then puts it in his pocket
Guards come and unstrap the President
The Duke has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had
Which is not saying much
-- Helicopters fly above ground
group stands with a car, gesturing wildly
-- People out below in the park
Can you see them
-- Surveillance 2 to Security Control
We're getting that readout, mostly in the infrared
Hauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor
At least something's going on
We have a visual sighting on it
It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park
They're waving at us
Signaling us in the food drop area
They're waving us down
-- The prisoners wave the helicopters down
group of guards lands and runs over to the station wagon
They get the briefcase which has been sawed off the President's handcuffs
-- Snake is awake and surrounded by guards
The cheers are louder
' -- Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun
It's one of Snake's
still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was telling the truth or not
God,  hate that guy
Brain stands in front of his maps
He got in somehow
Yeah, yeah, but how
You gotta land the glider and take off
(he gestures at the map) You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees
Port Authority's too low to the ground
Unless it was some
(he gets it
they don't call him "Brain" for nothing) Someplace high up
World Trade Center
That's it
There we go
The World Trade Center
And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to take off than it was for him to land
-- Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President
69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon
No bullshit or he's dead
" Where's the tape
Not here
He reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles
They're Plissken's
Yeah, they were on the table
He never did use them, though, and only half of them is necessary in his case anyway
So much for your man, Hauk
Hauk hesitates
This is the last thing he wants
Warm up the choppers
We're moving in
-- Helicopters prepare for takeoff
-- Hauk sits at the microphone
Plissken
The master life clock reads 1:56:38
37
36, -- Snake slowly gets to his feet
He's still groggy, but it's time for him to move
Come on, get up
Snake limps through a hallway and into a stadium
-- Boos greet Snake as he walks in
In the center of the room is a fighting ring
Snake climbs in, not without effort
huge and extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers
Snake notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock
In the balcony above is the Duke
The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and everyone gets silent
They sent in their best man
And when we roll down the 69th street bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man leading the way
From the neck up
The crowd cheers
On the hood of my car
More cheers
Let's do it
Ugly and Snake take bats
They circle each other
Ugly strikes at Snake
Snake ricochets off the ring
He rolls around, fighting for his life
-- Brain and Maggie walk around
They knock on a door and Weirdo answers
He's wearing Cabbie's hat
Hello
Where'd you get the hat
Got it from Cabbie
Yeah
Traded him
For what
What are you so nervous about
'm here to see the President
Who says
The Duke
No he doesn't
Well
'll have to tell him you said that
Weirdo doesn't really believe it
If it's not true, so what
But if it  true, the Duke will have him tortured to death
Wait a minute
Why
He's got something hidden in his clothing
The Duke wants it
What
'll show you
You'll tell me
Cyanide capsules
The Duke don't want a dead president
Brain pushes his way in
-- Gentlemen
Mr
President
Weirdo lets the door slide closed
Brain starts checking the President's clothes
The President has been dressed in a wig and tied to a chair with an American Flag on it
Cyanide
Yeah
He might try to take it tomorrow
Weirdo walks up to Brain
That's bullshit
You're not supposed to be in here, Brain -- Brain stabs Weirdo, who dies with a gasp
Maggie dispatches of the three guards
She smiles
Brain unties the President's hand
The President snatches off the wig in a rage
-- Snake notices a guard wearing the eagle tracer
trash can lid and a bat with spikes on it is handed to him
The next round begins
-- Brain, the President, and Maggie sneak out
guy in a cowboy hat notices
-- Ugly and Snake keep fighting
Snake is not doing very well
But he's catching up
As Ugly tries to hit him, he nails Ugly in the groin, then in the back of the head
The crowd begins cheering "
" The Duke can't believe it
Snake runs to the guard with the tracer and activates it
-- The Master Life Clock begins blinking "Tracer Status:
" Tracer activated at one hour, thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds
Rehme jumps out of his seat
Hauk
-- Snake limps around, getting his stuff back together
He looks at his life clock
1:34:54
53
He doesn't have much time
The guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the Duke and yells for attention
Duke immediately gets up and leaves, as do his hangers-on
The crowd shuts up
'
The crowd rushes out
Snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast as he can
-- Rehme catches up to Hauk at the last second
Hauk has been stalling
(shouting over noise) Hauk
Plissken's tracer
Hauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot
Get on the radio
Keep them down
Nobody move
-- Two monitors show Snake's tracer
He's approaching the World Trade Center
knew that son of a bitch was alive
He's inside
-- Snake limps around
He notices a cab
Fifty flights of stairs with his leg shot to hell
He hesitates only for a second, then starts up
-- The Vice President, Hauk and Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors
It's gone
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes
Download the choppers
We're in a standby situation
Rehme runs off
Anybody could have pushed that button
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch
Now we'll give him a little more time, just to make sure
The master clock shows 59:44
43
-- Snake gets out of the elevator
Maggie, Brain, and the President all take cover behind a chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down the glider
It doesn't work
The glider floats away
Goddamned redskins
They're savages, Mr
President
Snake runs to get them
They get in the elevator
-- Snake has the President by the arm and is leading everyone out
Listen, Snake,  swear to god,  thought you were dead -- Yeah, you and everybody else
He grabs Brain by the tie and aims the gun at his head
That's your car in the lobby
The keys
Quick
Quick
Diagram of the bridge
Hey, hey, hey -- Snake takes all the abovementioned items
'm the only one who knows how to read that, Snake -- Stay out of my way, Harold
Besides, you can't read and drive at the same time
You need us
Snake is tired
He's pissed
He's got half an hour to live if that
He doesn't have time for Brain's shit, and he lets him know it
You shouldn't have double-crossed me again, Brain
Come on, let's go -- He suddenly notices there's nothing on the end of the President's chain
He holds it in front of the President's face
They sawed it off
The tape
Gone
don't know where
do
Snake shoots him a look
Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is telling the truth
Maybe
Swear to god, Snake,  know where it is
Just take us to the car and 'll take you right to it
Shit
He tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain
They go down the stairs
Snake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining
Don't talk
Breathe
Come on, come on, we're wasting time
Snake gets into the car
It won't start
What's wrong
Dead, Harold
What
Snake hands the keys to Brain
Here, take these
Snake looks under the hood
There's a man with a crossbow pointed straight at him
Shit
They've been caught
Again
Car trouble
Snake looks over the hood
There's the Duke
With a dozen guards
Brain steps out
Hi, Duke
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake
You and Brain just say good- bye to each other
The Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment
At that moment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent
At the same time, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow
Steam flies everywhere, enough for cover
The four of them run for it
The Duke runs after them
-- cab pulls up
Its radio is playing "American Bandstand"
Guess who's driving
You got it
The group of four runs up to the cab
Snake runs around and makes Cabbie scoot over
He wants to drive
Cabbie looks shocked
,
The Duke and his followers arrive too late
-- (trying to explain the map) and then there's three more
Snake waves him off
Cabbie's trying to make conversation
They're behind us -- They come in groups of threes
Snake pops the American Bandstand tape out of the tape player and puts it in his pocket
Where's the tape, Brain
What tape
Where is it
Tape
The tape from the briefcase
Oh, that tape
He pulls it out of his pocket
Here it is
Cabbie hands it to Snake
Brain laughs, trying to cover his ass
You traded away your hat for it
How'd you know
See, see
Snake pops it into the deck
It begins spewing out information
It's the right one
He slips it into his pocket
Here, give me that tape
No way
Not just yet
Snake checks his life clock
23:20
19
18
17
Didn't that guy say 15 minutes before the last hour was up
But Hauk said they'd been playing with this, so the 15 minutes was built in already
Still, 23 minutes
That's cutting it pretty fucking close
-- Snake races as fast as the cab can go
-- Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely
They're not
The Duke is behind, but he's  behind
Easy
easy
Go for it, Snake
69TH   -- Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle
Cabbie looks like he's having a heart attack
Snake swerves on Brain's direction
So far so good
mine goes off, but it's behind them
The Duke goes forward
He's going by the seat of his pants
But he knows the general direction of how Snake went
mine goes off behind him, too
-- Brain reads the map
Cabbie continues to freak out
You've got to slow down a little, Snake
think there are three mines ahead, Snake
You think
69TH   -- The Duke continues in pursuit
-- Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when  tell you
You're pushing her too hard, Snake
, ,
69TH   -- The cab explodes, being cut right in half
Everyone makes it except Cabbie
Cabbie had been driving that very same cab for thirty years
He died with it
The President, Snake, Maggie and Brain all keep going on foot
said
you asshole
Brain leads the way as they keep crossing the bridge
Stay to the right, stay to the right, now jog left
Hold it, left
left
,
The other three go right
Brain goes left and a mine explodes under him
Maggie walks up to the body in shock
Snake limps up to her
Brain
Keep moving
The Duke's car is coming
Snake checks his life clock Maggie
he's dead
Come on
Maggie calmly holds out her hand
Snake smiles and hands her his gun
His grin grows
It's one of respect for what she's about to do
He runs off after the President
Maggie walks around to Brain, then steps in front of him
She points the gun at the Duke's car
The first three shots don't connect
The fourth nails the headlight, and then the Duke runs her over
He keeps going
-- Rehme runs up to Hauk and the Vice President
Station 19
They spotted two cars on the 69th street bridge
Is it Plissken
Taxicab and a Cadillac
Taxi hit a mine
There's four people on foot
Fourteen minutes
Get a jeep with a winch over there fast
He pulls out a phone
Strombaerden
Get over to Station 19
They're coming across the bridge
69TH   -- The President and Snake run on
-- jeep pulls up
Rehme's voice comes up over the loudspeaker
The guards on the jeep ready the winch
This is Rehme, Security Control
We are in a standby situation
Repeat
We are in a standby situation
All helicopters, down
Wall guard, do not fire on prisoners
Repeat, do not fire on prisoners
All vehicles, stand by
Repeat, stand by
69TH   -- Snake and the President are close enough to the wall to hear all this
-- The wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the President and Snake
69TH   -- Snake pushes the President up to the wall
The winch comes down and Snake helps the President into it first
The President goes up and over
Snake's life clock reads 1:32
But he doesn't have time to watch seconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him
Snake ducks for cover
The wall guards die
The winch comes down again, and the Duke sees it
He starts toward it
Snake tackles him and beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out
He grabs the winch
-- hand stops the winch from moving
69TH   -- Snake comes to a stop
He panics and starts pulling on the winch line
The Duke comes to and stands up
But he can't get anywhere because the President has found a machine gun and is now firing away
He is very accurate
He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing
(manic voice) Yeah, hey, Number One
You're the Duke
You're the Duke
The President calms down somewhat
You're
the Duke
You're -Number-One
The President starts the winch again
Snake climbs up and gets over as fast as he can without injuring himself
-- Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine
Hauk interrupts the medic
The tape, Plissken
Snake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk
He is furious
As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back
He holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck
They buzz, they buzz louder, and then he takes them away
That's it
Snake continues to pant and fume
He stares at them, then lifts his wrist to look at his life clock
2 seconds
One second
Beep
Nothing
Snake lowers his wrist
'    -- jeep pulls Rehme up
He jogs to the President, who is being shaved and prepared for broadcast
radioed ahead, Mr
President
They know the situation
They're waiting for your broadcast
Yeah
Snake approaches
The President nods
Oh, it's all right
Snake walks up and looks the President straight in the eye
, uh
want to thank you
Anything you want
you just name it
Just a moment of your time
Three minutes, sir
Yes
We did get you out
lot of people died in the process
just wondered how you felt about it
want to thank them
This nation appreciates their sacrifice
The President is full of shit after all
Snake has reason for his cynicism
The President is uncomfortable with Snake's glare and it shows
Look, uh, 'm on the air in
(questioning his aide) Two and a half minutes
Yes, sir
Snake lights a cigarette and walks away
Rehme watches
-- Snake walks away
Hauk stands nearby
Snake stops in his tracks
You going to kill me now, Snake
'm too tired
Maybe later
've got another deal for you
want you to think it over while you're resting
want to give you a job
We'd make one hell of a team, Snake
(glaring) The name's Plissken
He limps away
'    -- The President looks suitably freshened up
He's even smiling a little
You're on camera, Mr
President
Good evening
Although  shall not be present at this historic summit meeting,  present this, in the hope that our great nations may learn to live in peace
He pops in the tape and presses the "" button
and out comes "American Bandstand"
The President's face goes slack
His career's over
-- Snake keeps limping
He pulls a tape out of his pocket, yanks the magnetic tape out, winds it around his hand, rips it to shreds, and throws the tape away
