She's breathtakingly beautiful
Morning light fills the room
The sound of wind, and rippling cloth
Maria stirs, and opens her eyes
She stretches contentedly
Then she frowns
Rolls over
She's alone in the bed
No, she's not:  (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her
Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him
Hey
Are you okay
Peter doesn't turn
He slowly stands and walks forward towards an
There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly, almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles
Maria gets out of bed, concerned
Peter
What's the matter
He pauses at the window
Turns his head to look back at her
His eyes are vacant
His face is a blank
Then Peter slowly leans forward
And falls from the window
Maria stands in shock as the sound of   from outside reaches her ears
Then    from below
Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards the window
We   her and     -- -- '  lies in the middle of the street

As if hitting grooves we cannot see -- -- the blood slowly forms the shape of two

The flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat
She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness

) Karen
She turns to see her boyfriend  (20s, American) approaching
With a reassuring smile he takes her hand -- -- and together, they force their way through the throng, trying to escape the flow
They're jostled and crushed by the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer
'll never get used to this
Maybe we should find a different train station
He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still holding Karen's hand
She turns, wondering what's going on
She sees the smile on his lips a moment before -- -- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her
As if the crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all
It's tender and loving, and she responds
at first
But then she pulls away, shy
public display of affection is considered rude in Japan
There's an opening ahead into a
Doug and Karen deftly slip out of the traffic -- 2a                                                                 2a 2b

Doug smiles as they pass by two    , making out on the street corner
He turns to give Karen a sarcastic look -- Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      2A

She's looking in the other direction, at a trickle of  wafting up over a nearby fence

The fence surrounds a  adjacent to the temple
We walk past this temple every day, Karen -- Yeah, but 've never seen this before
stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a bundle of incense and bowing before the grave
It's a Buddhist ritual
The incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors, to help them remain at peace
She turns as Doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with his Zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it
It's amazing
You're like this infinite storehouse of wisdom
Or trivia
'm not sure which
It's not trivia
It's what they believe
And it's far better, by the way, than your little pollution ritual
Doug's grin softens to a smile
He doesn't respond
but the way he's looking at Karen makes her curious: What
He turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his cigarette and crushing it
Finally: Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      2B

You seem to be able to remember everything that's really important

Seven years of bad luck

Leaning against a desk behind Reception is Karen's boss (40s, American)
He's got a phone to his ear -- it's ringing
An   picks up in Japanese
Alex mutters and hangs up
Then he notices -- Karen
She's started up a  in the center of the lobby
She turns and comes back down, walking over to Alex
Are you free this afternoon
just came by to pick up some books  left here
'm not scheduled to work today -- know
But are you free
Do you have class
(shaking her head:) Just a test to study for
Why
Alex smiles, holding out a file
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    6
Your wish has been granted
Karen takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page - - a picture of an   () is attached
It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and can't reach her at home
She must be sick, or something
And she has the damn house key
Studying the file, Karen squints
What's this phrase
"Mild dementia with severe lethargy
" Apparently she sleeps through most of the day
Her daughter-in-law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there
Karen seems unsure
It's a big step for her
You're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own
Besides, it's an English-only house
One of Alex's - appears in the doorway, motioning to him
Alex quickly hands Karen a card: Here's the address
Use the wall chart if you need help -- and don't forget to bring a map

Karen looks at   -- a string of thirty numbers and Japanese characters
She glances up at : a color-coded diagram shows how the long address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture, City, Ward, District, Block, Sub-Block and House Number

Karen nods
But she's not quite as confident

She's lying on her stomach on a stained mattress, feebly looking up at Karen
Oh my God

Emma looks dazed and disoriented

Okay, Emma

Kneeling in front of Emma, Karen notices a - around one of her fingers
Blood has soaked through it
Looks like you need a new Band-Aid
How'd this happen, Emma

Maybe that will help you feel better
Emma doesn't even turn towards her

She looks underneath the couch for the missing piece

She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling around

She has a small cut on her finger

There it is again, and this time there's no doubt -- The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs

And then there's a muffled
There's a cat in there
Karen pulls off the duct tape
She reaches for the door handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside -- The closet seems empty, except for a large  on a shelf
Karen reaches inside and picks it up

Karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile

As Karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base: ( ) "Listen, just give me a call when you can, okay

Emma, who were you talking to
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        15
That's when Karen notices   in the mattress, across from where Emma is sitting
Where someone else would be, if the old woman was having a conversation
Emma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes

You should get some rest, Emma
She helps Emma lie back -- -- but as the old woman's eyes move to the ceiling, they suddenly grow wide, her mouth opening in fear -- -- Karen follows her gaze, looking up -- -- and she , falling off the mattress, backing away -- is lowering from the ceiling
Formless at first, but flowing and shifting
like a  draped with black silk
Drifting down until the shadowy "head" is only inches from Emma's terrified face
And then the "head" slowly turns, rotating towards Karen

Looks exhausted
Matthew enters, surprised to see her
You're up
Mmmmmm
Matthew glances into the back room through another sliding door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like the living room
:   Emma is asleep on her mattress
wonder if Mom's okay
She's been sleeping ever since we got here
Not at night
Matthew turns to her, surprised
told you, Matthew, you can sleep through anything
Matthew comes over, kisses her
'm sorry, sweetheart
It was probably just the move -- 'm sure she'll get back on schedule
Jennifer nods, not convinced
You seen my travel mug

Yeah
Maybe

Matthew scans it as he fills his mug

felt so
stupid
This will get easier soon, for Mom, for all of us

She turns to him
Or else
Or else 'll tell the company it's just not working out, and that we're going back to the States with or without my old job
They can get someone else to crunch their numbers
This makes Jennifer feel better

Deal

Is this Yoko's bike
think so
It's been here all night
Matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate, leaning it against the wall (where we saw it earlier)
He turns back to Jennifer, giving her a kiss
'll probably be home late, maybe around nine or so
Jennifer gives him a look
knew you'd forget
Matthew pauses, looks back blankly
Jennifer just smiles
Dinner, your sister
At seven
Oh yeah
Right
You were going to cook

They usually run long
Jennifer rolls her eyes

Barely a lick of English on any of the brightly-colored packages
Jennifer is, in a word, clueless

But there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house -- a disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly related to moving in
Yoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess
Then she sees  at the far end of the living room, her back to Yoko
She's looking down at something in her hands
Hi, Emma
It's good to see you again
Emma turns
Looks blankly at Yoko, who approaches
Realizing the woman doesn't remember her: My name is Yoko
The old woman still gives no sign of recognition
Yoko gently takes her arm
You should be in bed -- Then she sees what Emma was looking at: the roll of She's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade

The old woman must be asleep: Yoko gently lays down the tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut
Then Yoko moves through the   to the   -- -- she picks up  , finally where it belongs

Yoko stands in the doorway, listening for the sounds
But they've stopped
She finishes her call and hangs up

She sticks the cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room
As Yoko straightens the bedspread, she hears something
Pauses
And we hear it too -- -- a familiar
Quiet and muffled
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04         49

She puts them on, and goes back to work

Stares at them

But maybe, in a way, it will help you later

She notices Nakagawa isn't taking notes
He seems somewhat uncomfortable, as if he's building to something: About the Japanese boy you said you saw there -- Did you find him
No, not yet
You said the boy had been taped into the closet
Yes, that's right

Nakagawa frowns, scribbles a note
didn't see any book on the table
Perhaps someone moved it
Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet
She thinks, recalling: asked him his name
He said `Toshio'
Nakagawa immediately tenses

He can see how exhausted Karen is
But something's troubling him: One more question, please
He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out Karen found, and taped together
He shows it to her
We found this in the room where

This is him
This is the boy

Yes

To a Japanese family, who lived in that house
They were all found dead
Doug studies her for a moment
So you think the events are connected
How would you explain it
She watches Doug as he thinks
Carefully
Okay
How about this: the American family knew about what had happened there before, and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events
Karen gives Doug a skeptical look
It's exactly how superstitions survive: if you walk under a ladder and think uh-oh, you're in for some bad luck, sure enough, what do you know
You trip over -- (heard it before:) -- trip over the curb and sprain your ankle
Makes sense, right

You just need to rest

Peter shakes his head, looking distastefully at the letter

She says used to tutor her, but  don't know who the hell she is
The co-worker shrugs and leaves
Disturbed, Peter fingers the blue envelope
His eyes go to one of his desk drawers
He slides it open

He dumps the letters into a trash can

He glances down at the   in his hand
He stuffs it in his pocket, unsure about what he's going to do
Then he opens the gate and goes in, walking to the front door

Silence from inside
He rings the bell

No one comes
He's about to leave -- But then he hears something from around the side of the house
It sounded like a muffled  of water

It's quiet

After a moment, Peter decides to check it out
As he steps around a bush, he suddenly stops, surprised to see -- ' : two  hang from a window at the side of the house
They look disembodied, mottled and bruised

No reaction
There's definitely something wrong with this boy
Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house

The boy slowly straightens
His eyes focus on Peter
Then he
Startled, Peter tries to see inside: ( ) Hey

Peter quickly goes back to the front door

He opens the door

Excuse me

His concern for the boy wins out
He kicks off his shoes, and quickly walks to the open bathroom door

As Peter helps the boy to his feet, he glances at the bathtub
It's filled, literally to the brim, with water

Where are your parents
The boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed
Peter studies him, looking at the ugly  on his arms and legs
There's also a big one around his neck
( ) What happened to you
Peter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he , pulling backwards
His eyes manage to focus on Peter
Then the boy looks away

Aoki exchanges a look with the officers
Can you tell me your name, please
Karen looks at the somber faces in the quiet station
She backs away from the desk as the realization sinks in
They're dead, aren't they
Karen turns and runs for the exit
Miss, wait please -- But she's long gone

Karen picks up a red pen and draws a line through them
Then we see one final name at the bottom: `Me

The only one left
Karen puts down her pen
Then she looks up at -- --  , where's she's taped all the pictures and articles in a circle
Karen realizes something
She reaches for the lamp, and turns it closer -- -- the picture in the middle of the "spider's web" is gone
The photo of The House
Karen draws a breath
Then, out of the corner of her eye, she sees something she hadn't noticed before -- -- a faint red  from a small table by the kitchen
She slowly stands
Walks over to it
The flashing red light is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at -- --

The same one Karen found in the closet
He opens it

: it's a journal Kayako kept
As Peter flips through it, '  speaks the words
and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we recognize, that she's written repeatedly -- -- "Peter"
It's been written over and over, in both English and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it
Past the early pages Karen saw,   becomes more manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl, '  becomes more desperate and pleading
Taped on the final page is  :  with a group of his University friends, at a party
Kayako has scribbled hearts around his head, and   the other faces

Karen falls backwards, against the wall

Karen moves out of the way

Then a familiar sound reaches our ears:
It's coming from Toshio's room
