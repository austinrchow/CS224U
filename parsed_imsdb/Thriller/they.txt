Mechanical pieces
Small and intricate
Glittering in the sunlight
The gears are turning within an    sitting on a book shelf, a small pendulum swinging back and forth behind the glass housing
The room is barren except for a pair of open suitcases and a bed that's been stripped
Sitting on the mattress is
Smart and clever
Dressed in a graduation gown and staring out the window
She seems to be lost in thought, immobile, until the bedroom door swings open and
, aged seventeen and wearing a suit and tie, steps inside
Dad says we gotta get moving
We're late
'm getting ready
You're sitting on the bed
(dryly) Thanks for clearing that up
'll be right down
He steps out
Julia takes a framed picture out of her suitcase -- a candid shot of herself standing with her , forties, a healthy and vibrant woman
(cont'd) Sure do miss you
Above her, a rotates
Creating a soft
- - Julia walks out of the building where her father,  , an older man with a kind face, waits
Connor is checking his reflection in the car window, adjusting his tie, fussing with his hair
You ready
All set packed up everything
(remembering) Oh, except Mom's clock --  think there's something wrong with it
It's not telling the right time
'll get it fixed
Probably just needs a few new parts
Guy smiles at Julia for a moment
Very warmly
(cont'd) You look just like your mother
Julia is momentarily uncomfortable
But she recovers, smiles and kisses her father on the cheek
We'll be late
,   -  - Students dressed in graduation caps and gowns are gathered on the campus grounds
Julia stands by herself, taking pictures with a professional Nikon camera
She focuses the camera upon
, 22, beautiful and sexy
Very particular and demanding
She smiles perfectly as Julia snaps the picture
But her boyfriend,  , cute and mischievous, sporting pink hair and loud clothes, makes a face
Winding her film, Julia searches a moment, then smiles
Raising her camera lens, she snaps a picture of
Early twenties
Dark hair
Strapping and perfectly handsome
He wears a blue and gold striped tie with his starched white shirt and graduation gown
He kisses her
Passionate and gentle
You packed up
Ready to move in
'll be storing some of the stuff you've already got
Television

Microwave

Julia smiles at him
Bed
Med School doesn't start until August
At least not for the freshmen, so we've got plenty of time to see Europe, take the car trip up north
hope it won't be a drag
There's a lot of stuff to move out of my mother's cabin
Our friends will be there
It'll be fun
hope so
Beat
You okay
Tense
Would it help if  massaged your breasts
No
Because it would help me
(stifling laughter) Maybe later
The students start forming into lines
(cont'd) Hey,  saw your Mom and kid sister
Where's your Dad
Beat
He's not coming
But it's your graduation
Paul shrugs again
brief sting of hurt on his face
Wasn't a good enough reason in High School either
Paul looks away
Julia knows how painful this is and won't insult him by trying to diminish it
Julia smiles and runs her finger across his tie knot
like your tie
colors
School spirit
am a Bruin
The lines start moving towards the stadium
Hundreds of  rise up from the graduating students
As she walks, a sound draws Julia's attention
Standing on the lawn is a  , no more than four years-old,  and clinging to his mother's legs
Julia stops walking as she gazes at the child
The line comes to a halt behind her
(cont'd) Julia
We can't graduate unless you move
Sorry
She stalks walking again
Paul puts his arms around her
' -  - big, traditional house nestled in the hills
and graduating  exchange polite conversation in the yard
' -   - Sitting between a pair of open french doors is "the gang" consisting of Julia and Paul and Terry and Sam
They throw around conversation, ignoring the party
It's secluded
Nobody said anything to me about the cabin being secluded
said it was a cabin in the woods
thought seclusion was a given
'm no good out in the woods
You know what lives in the woods
Animals that sting
Animals that bite
So avoid the animals
really appreciate you guys helping me
couldn't move everything alone
Hey, it's our last chance to be together
Terry and  are excited
(turns) Aren't we, Ter
She's not excited
Can  bring my cotton bedsheets to the cabin
If  try to sleep in anything but cotton,  get hives
Whatever makes you happy
Sam grabs a large drawing pad from the steps
He opens it
Speaking of which, 've got your graduation gift
As specified
Let's see
Sam holds up a sketch of Clark Kent changing to Superman
Like it
It's great
Thanks Sam
Paul checks out the drawing
His nose crinkles
Superman
Why'd you want a drawing of Superman
He's very attractive
(staring) You're kidding
No
He's not even real
think most women tend to wonder if Superman is super in every way
don't
You see
There goes your argument
(thoughtfully) But Spiderman has a nice ass
Off everyone's -- (cont'd) What
' -  - Julia finishes washing her hands
Dries them
Grabbing her camera and the drawing, Julia opens the bathroom door
' -  - and freezes
Standing within an open bedroom is
Another college graduate
Tan and attractive
Dressed exactly like Paul -- identical white shirt, gold and blue striped tie
He pulls off his tie and unbuttons his shirt
Julia doesn't move
The student peels off his shirt
Her eyes are drawn to a Superman "" insignia tattooed on his shoulder
The student catches sight of Julia in the hallway
Her face turns bright red immediately
She starts to laugh
He smiles at her
bit flattered
Flirting
Changing into something more formal
He holds up a pair of ripped jeans
Julia backs down the hallway
Still laughing
Embarrassed
'm sorry was just using the
(laughs) Really
'm sorry
'll forgive you this once
She quickly leaves
The blond student watches her go
grin on his face
' -   - Julia walks out the back door
Stifling her laughter
Paul is talking with Guy on the lawn
Julia  a picture of them together, winds her film, and notices
Sweet and innocent
Sitting on a bench
Motionless
Julia walks towards her
The little girl is staring across the lawn at a pool shed
Transfixed
group of children are playing on the grass in front of it
The girl becomes aware of Julia's presence and turns around
Hi
(quiet) Hi
Silence
You sitting here all by yourself
The girl slowly nods "Yes
" (cont'd) Don't you want to play with the other kids
The girls shakes her head "No
" (cont'd) Want me to leave you alone
The girl shakes her head "No
" More silence
(cont'd) Want to mix this up and ask me something
The little girl notices the camera
Are you taking pictures for Sam's family
No, 'm just (then) 'm a friend of Sam's
But 'm also a photographer
take pictures
Beat
Will you take a picture of me
Why
So you won't forget me
(surprised) Why would forget you
Because they're coming for me
long beat
Julia sits next to her
Who is
The monsters
What monsters
There
Behind the door
The girl points towards the pool shed
The rusted door of the shed is slightly open
Just a crack
Those other kids don't look too scared
They should be
Beat
(playing along) So how come only you can see them
Because  know they're real
used to have a little brother, but they came and got him
Now my parents say  never had a brother before
(pause) Soon
my parents won't remember me either
Something about the girl's tone of voice is unnerving
As if she's resigned herself to this
slight wind through the trees
The girl rises
(cont'd) gotta go
They know 'm talking about them
Wait a second
Julia  a picture of the girl
(cont'd) Feel better
The girl stares at her
Are you scared of monsters
No
Beat
am
The girl turns and runs across the lawn
Julia is left sitting on the bench
She glances over at the pool shed again
Raises her camera and focuses on the door which is still cracked open
She snaps the picture
' - Julia and Paul are romantically entangled as they enter the apartment
little drunk
Kissing and frolicking
She strips off his jacket and tie
Paul abruptly stops
Wait a minute (grabbing both sides of his shirt) This is a job for
Paul rips his shirt wide open
Buttons popping everywhere
They both start laughing
Joining together, he guides her towards the bathroom
The wind gently on the balcony
Windchimes spinning
- cloud of hot steam
The soothing rush of warm water running over tanned and naked skin
Julia stands underneath the shower, her body relaxing into Paul's chest, his muscular arms encircling her body, his lips buried in her neck and shoulders
Her eyes are shut
Her expression is calm
- Standing in the guest bedroom at Sam's house
Young and muscular
Bathed in sunlight
The tattoo on his shoulder
Her eyes still pressed closed
Smiling a little
Water continues rushing from the shower head, creating a  that eventually becomes : - The setting sun blushes crimson across the rolling waves of the Pacific
Streaking along the highway is a  , packed with luggage, headlights on
- Paul sits behind the wheel
He's bopping and  with Sam to - that  from the speakers
Very energized
Julia sits on the passenger side, leaning against the window, trying to shut out the music
Terry looks just as miserable
Finally, Julia turns off the radio
silent beat
The guys catch their girlfriends' expressions
Sorry
(overlapping) Sorry
Terry leans forward between the seats
So the cabin has electricity, right
And plumbing
Everything we need
Uh-huh
So it has everything
It has everything
Wait a minute
hear a shoe about to drop
Except a phone
There it is
(scandalized) need a phone
It's like family to me
Mom, Dad, my brother
phone So you're roughing it
The last time tried to rough it,  was in therapy for a year
Why didn't your mother have a phone
guess she wanted to be left alone
At least until she got sick
Paul looks to her
This won't be too hard on you, will it
Staying at her place
It's okay
'm enjoying this
Julia smiles at him
Paul smiles back
Good
He switches the radio back on and continues  with Sam
Julia and Terry both stare straight ahead, ears pounding
This is turning into a  trip
- Paul's Range Rover makes its way down a long, winding road
The Rover's headlights illuminate the woods lining the road on both sides
- The inside of the Range Rover is dark
Only the faint glow from the dashboard lights provides any ambient illumination
Sam and Terry are snuggled together in the back seat
Everything is quiet
Julia is thinking
Finally, she breaks the silence
Do you believe in monsters
beat
Everyone else in the car trades looks
We've been in the car too long
'm just asking
Like what
The Boogeyman
The Boogeyman
The thing under the bed
The monster hiding in the closet
What made you think of that
little girl at Sam's house
She was convinced there was a monster trying to get her
You're saying you believe her
Julia is suddenly on the spot
She backtracks
Of course don't
There are no monsters
Not really
Sure there are
Ted Bundy
Son of Sam
Ed Gein
Who was Ed Gein
He was a mass murderer
This old hermit who'd kill people and take the parts he wanted
Heads
Livers
Intestines
Sex organs
Why did he use the parts for
Everything
The police found a skull that was used for a soup bowl
Faces were stuffed and mounted like hunting trophies on the wall
Bones were used for furniture
He also wore their skin
Like clothes
Terry recoils into her seat
Grossed out
Sorry asked
You wanted proof
There it is
But it's not like he's a monster under the bed
So
So why are kids afraid of that
Because they live in a completely different world than we do
(then) Think about it
Why do kids pick up on things that we can't
Bumps in the night
footsteps in the hallway
thumping inside their closet
Overactive imagination
Wrong
Perfect awareness
(beat) Kids have a perfect awareness of everything around them
Every sound
Every shadow
Everything gets quiet
(cont'd) The Boogeyman could be real
So could monsters
Just because you've never seen them doesn't mean they aren't there
Silence
The car engine purrs softly
This is starting to make sense
And it's spooky
All right
'm creeped out
But my bullshit alarm is going off
You just can't handle it
Right
Because it's bullshit
Serial killers aside, my take on this subject is very simple
If  don't have a picture of it -- it's not real
Okay, is this conversation like a radio station
Can we just change the channel
Because personally, 'd like to get to sleep tonight
Terry has just finished saying these words, when -- runs out of the woods into the middle of the road
black shape in the headlights
Eyes flashing in the dark
Paul  on the brakes
Too late
The    into it throwing the shape into a ditch at the side of the road
The Range Rover swerves and comes to a
Everyone catches their breath
moment of dead silence
(cont'd) Everyone okay
(nods) We're fine
What was that
think it was a dog
Julia unlocks her door
We'd better check the car
She steps out of the Rover
The others follow
- The hazard lights are switched on
Paul walks around to the front of the Rover
The bumper is dented
Look at that
There's a couple thousand dollars out of my wallet
You can probably get someone to pop it back
Sure
For a couple hundred dollars
Sam looks down the road
He can barely make out a large form resting lifeless in the ditch
He starts walking towards it
'm sorry about your car, Paul
(begrudging) Yeah, well
Shit happens
The conversation becomes distant as Sam walks slowly up the road, moving past the yellow flashing   which  rhythmically
click, click, click Sam approaches the ditch
Darkness is all around
click
click
click
He kneels down alongside the body of the animal
Very little is visible of the corpse except for its dark, mangled form sprawled across the dirt
Sam picks up a stick and pokes at the body
Nothing happens
He pokes at the corpse again
The hind legs of the corpse suddenly twitch
reflex action
Sam leaps back
The life nearly scared out of him
flap of hairless skin slides away from one of the animal's hind legs
Sam leans forward to get a better look, becoming simultaneously repulsed and fascinated
Hey guys
What
Take a look at this
Is it a dog
Sam glances at the dead corpse and back to his friends again
He looks shaken
don't know
The rest of the group moves down the road
weird unease has started to settle in
Paul and Julia kneel down in front of the corpse
It's almost unrecognizable
The darkness smothering the road keeps them from getting a handle on any of the body's features
It looks like a dog to me
Did you see the leg
What about it
Sam takes the stick and gently pushes away the flap of torn skin for a better look
The group leans forward
deep bleeding wound has been exposed
Through the torn flesh and blood pumping over charcoal skin, the group can see bones flashing into the moonlight
But intermingled with the animal's skeleton are
Glittering and clean
series of connected stainless steel threads and pallid bone that have grown together
Ever seen anything like that
No
It looks like steel
Like someone put steel into its body
don't think it was put in there
It looks like it grew that way
That's impossible
What kind of animal has steel in its skeleton
Terry steps forward tentatively
What are you looking at
Are you sure it's dead
Come on, honey
It's a dog
Not a zombie
Julia
Where's your camera
It's in the car
've got it
Paul races back to the Range Rover and opens the passenger door
He withdraws Julia's camera
Julia takes a step back into the middle of the road
The wind is sifting through the trees, creating a soft  noise as the branches dance and twist in the shadows
Paul returns and hands the camera to Sam
You want to turn it over
'm not touching it
Sam kneels down
He points the camera and shoots
The camera flash cuts through the darkness and falls upon the corpse
But only for a millisecond of clarity
Twisted metal
Skin
Appendages
Madness
Both of the young men stand frozen, thunderstruck, staring down at the misshapen shape in front of them
long period of amazed silence follows
That's wrong
That's all wrong
Paul shakes his head
That's not a dog
(stunned) What were those things coming out of its back
Paul starts recoiling
His stomach is getting weak
That's not a dog
The cool summer wind  through the trees around them
(sickened) That doesn't even make sense Paul
Paul looks over at her
(cont'd) Let's get in the car
We need some flashlights
(hushed) Screw the flashlights
What the hell is it
Dude
We're outta here
Julia and Paul walk briskly to the Range Rover
Sam and Terry follow them, glancing back over their shoulders
What the hell is it
Paul tosses the camera into the Rover's back seat
He  the door shut
Julia opens the front passenger door
soft from the woods
Almost like footsteps
Get in the car
Julia hops into the front seat and  her door
- The atmosphere is quickly turning into panic
Paul jumps behind the wheel as both Sam and Terry close their doors
want to know what that thing was
Paul presses the automatic door lock
Paul, start the car
Keys
He searches his pockets
They're empty
He checks his jacket
want to know what it was
Will you shut up
Paul fishes out the car keys from his jacket pocket
He starts the ignition
The engine  to life
Go
heavy
Right outside the back window
Sam and Terry instinctively look towards the rear hatch
There's something behind the car
Paul hits the gas
- The Range Rover disappears into the night
The calm and unnerving quiet of the woods are left behind
The wind  softly
-    - fast food joint at the side of the road
- Everyone is sitting quietly at a table
Fast food leavings are littered across their plastic trays
Nobody is saying anything or looking at one another
Finally
want to get the body
Everyone's face drops into shock
Paul almost laughs
You do that
We'll wait for your ass right here
Sam leans forward in his seat
Intense
Nothing about that thing looked right
Absolutely nothing
There was metal in its skeleton
Maybe it wasn't metal
It might've just looked like metal
There were fucking gears, for Chrissake
Fine
Go back out there
Do whatever the hell you want
But count me out
'm done
We've already got a picture, Sam
Let's get a few more then
want to get a good look at that thing up close
(adamant) 'm not going back there
Let Julia decide
It's her camera
The group stares at Julia
She remains silent
Your call
Julia stares back at all of them
moment
small begins  and  in the restaurant
Julia flinches at the unexpected sound, glancing over at the child's parents as they quiet him down
She rises from the table
have to use the bathroom
She walks straight into the bathroom
After she's gone
'm not going back there
-  - Large and poorly lit
Several closed bathroom stalls face a row of sinks and a huge mirror
toilet Julia leaves one of the stalls and pulls the door closed behind her
She moves to the mirror, washes her hands, and retrieves a brush from her purse
Water from one of the leaky pipes in the bathroom while the fluorescent bulb over the mirror  softly
Julia is about to brush her hair, but something unnerves her
She cocks her head slightly
feeling
She turns around and checks out the bathroom
The doors to the stalls are all closed shut
Empty and quiet
She starts brushing her hair
few moments pass
Then, she stops and listens to the water from the pipe
Julia turns back around and looks at the bathroom
One of the stall doors all the way at the end is now slightly open
Not much
Just enough to reveal a patch of darkness and gloom within
The sound of water dripping abruptly stops
Silence follows
Julia looks like she's about to crawl out of her skin
She quickly shoves her brush back into her purse and leaves
- Julia walks towards her friends as they collect themselves
Everyone is slow getting their stuff together
want to leave
Hold up
We're coming
The starts  again
Pointing at the bathroom
This disturbs Julia further
Paul
Okay
Slow down
The group leaves the table
-   - The group emerges from the restaurant
The parking lot is almost deserted
No people are in sight
Julia moves leisurely towards the Range Rover, just ahead of Terry and Sam -- but she'd walk a lot faster if Paul's arm weren't draped around her shoulder
She looks tight and nervous
Her eyes scanning the parking lot
The cars are empty
Sidewalk litter dances in the wind
Inside one of the parked cars, a featureless is sitting behind the wheel
The shape turns and stares at them
Everyone piles into the Range Rover
Julia throws a nervous glance back at the  in the car
He's still watching them
Everyone piles into the car
- Paul starts the engine and pulls out of the parking lot
Julia relaxes into her seat, relieved
-   - The Range Rover heads off into the woods
- - rustic home surrounded by huge pine trees and beach grass overlooking the ocean
There are no neighbors in sight
Paul's Range Rover is parked out front
- - The basement is saturated in a bright red light
Julia is developing a photograph within a small basin
Paul and Terry are seated on the stairs
Sam is pacing
How much longer
Thirty seconds
It's coming out
still think we should get the body
We could drive out there, haul it into the car
'm not loading that thing into my car
don't give a shit what it is
It's not coming back here
Julia lifts the developed picture out of the basin
Done
She switches on the light
The group crowds around her
What is it
What does it look like
The photograph is blurred
The body is indistinguishable
Damn
What happened to the picture
Out of focus
What do you mean it's out of focus
took the picture
The flash went off
Sam, this is a professional camera with a zoom lens
You can't just point and shoot
quiet moment as they stare at the picture
Well, so much for that
Sam looks at the picture, then at his friends
With a look of somber frustration, Sam quietly turns and charges up the stairs, taking two at a time
After he's gone It's not a big deal
Whatever it was
(then) He'll get over it
-  - Cloudy and overcast
set of colorless waves  into the rocks
Sam and Julia and Terry walk just beyond the rippling surf, arguing with each other
can't get over it
That thing looked wrong
Completely wrong
Of course it looked wrong
Paul rammed it with his car
What about the blood
It wasn't red
it was black -- it was like
oil coming from a busted engine
must've missed that
Let's find it
Cut it up
Study it
(measured) Sam,  realize that you're an extroverted comic book artist and 'm a neurotic
But it's only now at this moment that 'm wondering why we're dating
Sam turns back to Julia -- 'll pay you to take me back
You don't have to pay me
Take the car
The Rover's a shift
can only drive an automatic
Ask Paul
He's out running
Besides, you heard him last night
He'd never do it
Julia stares at him
It's a dead animal
So come with me
You take the pictures this time
If it's just a dead animal, then you're right and 'm wrong
But if it's not, we've got a picture of it
picture of what
Beat
monster
set of foaming waves  as they slide along the sand
Julia stands with her arms folded
There's something really creepy about it which she doesn't want to admit
Monsters don't exist
What
(pause) Sayin' yes
or saying no
Julia stares at him, deadpan
Sam just stares right back
- The same lonely stretch of road from the night before
The Range Rover appears around a corner and pulls over to the side of the road
Julia opens her door, camera in hand, and gets out
Sam follows her lead
This is it
think so
You can see the way the road turns sharply to the left
The rest of the drive was straight
You've got film, right
new roll
You can have all the pictures you want
Julia and Sam start searching the ditch
Feet crunching in the dirt
Moving away from the car
soft echoes from somewhere in the woods
place just beyond the wall of pine branches and shrubbery that shivers in the breeze
Sam and Julia look around
They wait
Nothing
Nobody
(slight grin) The Boogeyman lives here
So will you if you keep talking like that
They keep walking
beat passes
Julia
Can ask you something
Go ahead
Last night on the road, after  took the picture and we started walking to Paul's car, did you have the same feeling
What feeling
That we were being chased
Julia doesn't say anything
She stops cold in her tracks
Just ahead of her, resting motionless in the ditch, is
Swathed in dark fur, twisted at a pathetic angle, huge gashes in its side
The corpse of a Doberman pinscher Flies are and swarming over the dog's open wounds
Julia and Sam move towards the dog's lifeless form
There's your monster
That's a dog
Right
Sam kneels in front of the corpse
Waves off some flies
That's not what saw
don't see any other corpses on the side of the road, do you
long moment
Sam stares back down at the Doberman's body
That's not what saw
Eyes slightly open
misshapen form plagued with flies
The sound of drowns out the   through the trees
- - Paul is jogging through the woods
light mist hangs in the cool air
The sounds of the forest surround him
Suddenly, the birds stop singing
Paul becomes aware of this
He stops running and looks around
The forest is deathly still
The sound of a being crushed underfoot
Then nothing
Another moment
Paul keeps going, a chill on his spine, looking back over his shoulder
-   - picture postcard community consisting of quaint storefront shops and manicured parks
Paul stands right in front of a freshly painted realty office building with a picketed fence, sipping a Coke, watching a   across the street screaming and shouting at traffic
She's right next to the parked Range Rover
Julia walks out of the realty office
Finished
Done
The cabin has a buyer
What about the movers
They're coming on Sunday afternoon so we'll have to start packing
The homeless woman starts walking off down the sidewalk
Moving away from the Rover's parking space
Good
She's leaving
thought we were gonna have to make a run for the car
feel sorry for those people
Me too
But that doesn't mean  want to get screamed at
People are ignoring her
Maybe that's the only way she can get attention
She's doing a good job
Kept me away
They start crossing the street towards the car
How does someone end up like that
think we're witnessing it first-hand with Sam
What did you guys find on the road anyway
dog
Paul stares at her
Surprised
Really
Yeah
Personally, 'm glad we didn't find Frankenstein's monster
You just like being right
(grins) Damn straight
- - Sam heads away from the cabin, his drawing sketch pad under his arm, moving into the woods
- - picture is lifted out of the developing basin
The shot of the little girl from the party
Her expression is distant
Tortured
Bathed in the red light, Julia gazes at the picture for a moment, then places it to the side
She goes to work on the next piece of developing paper into the basin
She waits
Rocks the basin a bit
The  in the basement
The picture starts to manifest
The photo of the children and pool shed at Sam's house
Julia frowns slightly
Something is wrong with the photograph as the details become more tangible
She lifts the photo out of the basin
Mystified
: Standing just inside the shed's door is a Featureless
Barely distinguishable
Hiding in the dark
- - Sam is sitting on a fallen tree trunk, sketching on his drawing pad with a feverish intensity
: rough drawing of the animal's leg, intertwined with steel rods and metal threads which culminate in a large pulley where the hip bone should be
- - warm and comfortable cabin
Simple and subdued
Paul is seated on the couch, typing into his powerbook which is hooked up into a phone jack in the wall
Julia stands next to him, holding the photograph
've never seen anything like this before
thought it might be a flaw in the negative, but now 'm not so sure
Will you take a look
(not paying attention) Okay
He keeps watching
Today
'm busy
You're in a chat room with a bunch of strangers
(defensive) They're friends
Oh yeah
What are their last names
They sit face to face
Paul is speechless for a moment, then impatiently takes the photograph and looks at it
don't see anything
He puts the photo down and gets back to the chat room
You didn't even look
(he didn't) looked
There's somebody in the shed
couldn't see it when  took the picture, but now it's there
know
Usually when you take a picture, you can't see a blur
Paul smiles at her
Completely smug
Julia stares right back
Give your "friends" my best
Julia takes the photograph and leaves
Paul types into his computer: "
" The message pops up next to his user name
Within seconds, several other user names in the chat room respond with "'
" - Terry is sitting on the counter, twirling her hair and chatting on a
Julia enters the kitchen
(on the phone) 'm not kidding, Dana
There's no phone
(beat) There's a jack and the phone line works, but there's no phone Uh-huh
Paul was able to get on the internet
'm using his cell
(quietly) need you to look at something
Terry nods
Hold on
Here
Julia holds out the picture
Terry looks it over briefly
(polite) Nice picture
She gets back to her phone conversation
(cont'd) 'm back
(beat) don't know if he has any free minutes, but he definitely won't after this conversation
Uh-huh
Thank God for AirTouch
Frustrated, Julia takes the picture and leaves the kitchen
- - The air is completely still
hush has fallen
The only sound is the ocean and crickets chirping in the grass
Julia wanders outside holding some of the developed photographs from the party
Sam is sitting on the front steps, working on his drawing
Sam
Could you look at
Sam looks up from his drawing pad
What
Beat
Never mind
Julia sits on the porch glider and looks through the photos
The little girl looking back over her shoulder
The blurred shape inside of the shed
moment passes
Julia shuts her eyes as a slight breeze comes up
She slips into a dream-like state, calm and relaxed, before opening her eyes to find
Sitting back on the hood of a sports car
Wearing a white tank top undershirt
The tattooed "" insignia visible on his shoulder
Bathed in soft moonlight
He even looks good in the dark
Their eyes meet
Smiles are traded between them
The wind sifts gently over the porch
It's all very dream-like - - spacious bedroom
Typical
Julia is already in bed and wearing a night shirt
Paul is grinding out a set of crunches
It just would have been nice if somebody had looked at it
You were on the internet
Terry was on the phone
felt like  was living with a bunch of machines instead of people
Someone's overreacting
Would you look at it again
already did
And  still don't see anything
Paul gets into bed
That little girl said there was a monster in the shed
(kisses her) It was probably another dog
Good night
He switches off the light
Paul turns over and goes to sleep
Julia sits for a moment in the dark
Alone with her thoughts
She looks over at the walk-in closet across the room
The closet door is slightly open
Just a crack
Not enough to provide any clear view of what lies within, but just enough for something -- monsters included -- to peek out
Julia stares at the closet
Spooked
She knows better, but it's dark and her primal fears are taking control
(to herself) Stupid
She gets out of bed and tiptoes to the closet, shutting the door
Then she gets back into bed
Smiling to herself, she goes to sleep
- The wind is picking up
Trees rustle
- - The clock on the night table reads 3:15
Julia turns over in her sleep and stirs awake
She groggily looks over towards the closet
Julia practically sits up in bed
The closet door is wide open
childhood nightmare come to life
Julia's breathing quickens
She reaches towards the other side of the bed
(a whisper) Paul
Her hand finds nothing but sheets and empty space
There's nobody there
She quickly turns to locate her boyfriend
But he's gone
She tries to switch on the light
The light stays off
She tries again
Nothing happens
Then, she hears it
faint sound
Almost like a shuffling The sound of something dragging itself lightly across the floor to the edge of the bed
Julia's throat has gone dry
Carefully, she creeps towards Paul's side of the bed and checks the floor
There is nothing in sight
The only sign of movement are the shadows from the trees outside
There is only one place left to look
Julia cautiously steps down to the floor
Sinking down on her knees, she gently lifts up the dust ruffle and looks into the inky darkness underneath the bed
The space is empty
Julia drops the dust ruffle and sits up,
Then, a familiar voice comes from it
Hey
it's just me
Paul switches on the light
He's wearing a  sweatshirt
The light wouldn't turn on
Works now
Julia catches her breath
The fear finally draining from her
Where were you
was cold so got a sweater from the closet
And  went to the bathroom
Why were you looking under the bed
Julia isn't quite sure how to answer
She's embarrassed
thought there was something in the room
(skeptical) Something
Like what
- - Packing tape is pulled back from a roll
Julia finishes taping up a cardboard box
Terry is packing some books into another box of her own
You thought there was a monster in the room
And you admitted it
didn't know what else to say
Advice
When you don't know what else to say, you lie
But  really did hear something
You're worse than my boyfriend
Julia looks towards the front door
Sam is sitting on the porch steps, sketching on his pad, oblivious to everything around him
He's in his own world, isn't he
That's an understatement
have a sinking feeling that sex is out of the question for this trip
This sparks something in Julia
She hesitates, looking through an open doorway where Paul can be seen packing some clothes
Julia speaks to Terry in confidence
Do you fantasize about other people
If  haven't yet,  probably will by the time we're ready to leave
Hesitant beat
've been fantasizing about a guy
Anyone we know
Blond
Good looking
Nice body
'd like to know that
(hushed) He has a Superman tattoo on his shoulder
Terry's mouth drops
The girls move closer together
No
Yes
No
Yes When did this start
Sam's party walked out of the bathroom and he was changing out of his suit
He lost his tie, his shirt
and then he spotted me
What did you say
Keep going
got out of there
But 've been fantasizing about him ever since
Fuck yeah
Power to the people
But Paul is the perfect boyfriend
Top to bottom
He's gorgeous
He's smart
He's gonna be a doctor
(continuing) He never gets upset about anything
What the hell is wrong with me
It's just a fantasy
Yeah, but when made love to Paul on grad night
thought of him Terry stares
Wow
know
Don't tell Paul about this
'd rather not test the whole "he never gets upset about anything" part
Are you okay
don't know think 'm flipping out
Seeing things in pictures
Thinking that there's a monster in my closet
(rising) You're being too sensitive
We woke up with our closet wide open and 'm not upset about it
Julia reacts
Your closet was open
Having to wash my hair without an all-natural conditioner
That upsets me
She walks out
Julia sits quietly in the living room, left alone with her own puzzled thoughts
- - Julia is walking down the hallway
She happens to pass the bathroom door which is slightly open
' Within the bathroom
The   is toweling off
Completely naked
The tattoo plainly visible on his shoulder
His eyes lock on hers
Julia , and runs straight into Paul
She
Jesus
You scared me
'm sorry
It's okay wasn't looking
'm going for a run
Okay
See you when you get back
(remembers) Oh, Paul
Don't leave the closet door open anymore, all right
(confused) Huh
The closet
Last night
You left it open
closed it after  got my sweatshirt
Did not
Serious thought you opened it
Wasn't me
moment
Well damn, Julia
Your monster isn't just noisy, he's also inconsiderate
He kisses her on the cheek and takes off
Julia stands alone in the empty hallway, a chill running down her spine
- The door slowly creaks open
Julia stands in the doorway, surveying the closet -- a cluttered and claustrophobic space despite its size
Clothes draped on hangars
Cardboard boxes stacked on shelves
Shadows
Julia moves inside and pulls a string hanging from a light bulb which acts as a switch
Tick-tick
The bulb stays dark
She tries again
Tick-tick
The light still won't come on
Julia carefully looks through some of the clothes
Nothing
She kneels down and checks the floor
long behind her
The natural light fades
Julia looks over her shoulder, a bit skittish, as the closet door eases back towards the doorjamb
But there's nobody there
Just the faintest hint of a draft
Julia keeps searching through the clutter
Moving shoes and boxes out of the way
Searching
Then, she spots something glittering in the ribbon of light coming from the closet doorway small object resting in the corner
Julia reaches down and picks it up
Small and intricate with erratic markings
Twisted and strangely ornate
The shape and texture of the metal is almost completely alien
Julia holds the metal into the light
Extremely curious
Behind her, a shadow moves
Julia , dropping the object and whirling around as a cardboard box  down behind her
Tumbling from one of the shelves above
Old shoes scatter across the floor
Julia catches her breath
Heart pounding
On the floor, the metal object sparkles in the light
draft  through the open closet door
- The Range Rover races down the empty road
- Julia sits behind the wheel
Her eyes intense
She looks over at the passenger seat where both her purse and the metal object are located
-   - The Range Rover streaks out of the woods towards Santa Mira
-  - Julia walks up the front steps leading to the library -- a weathered building that overlooks the town square
banner hangs over the front entrance
It reads
' - - The stacks are deserted and still
Julia sits at a reading table, flipping through a book, surrounded by long rows of bookshelves
- Julia flips from page to page, allowing momentary glimpses of various drawings: vampires, werewolves, witches, a ghastly thing crawling out from under a maiden's bed
as she puts down the book and grabs another from a stack on the table
She opens it and starts paging through
- As Julia finds a drawing of a sleeping child
Just beyond the bed is an open closet door, the horrid face a  watching the child from within
Julia shivers down to her soul
familiar feeling of late
slight catches her attention
She looks across the reading room to find -- Ten years old
Tow-haired
Sitting a few tables away but almost directly opposite her
He's wearing a Superman shirt
He smiles timidly and waves
Julia waves back
behind her
Julia turns and looks over her shoulder
She barely catches sight of a shadow slipping across the wall in the stacks
The  of chair legs against the cold floor
Julia looks back towards where the  was sitting
The chair is pushed back and empty
Another in the stacks
Then silence
feeling of anxiety washes over Julia as she grabs some of the books and leaves
- It's getting dark
Moonshadows shift across the lawn
- - Soft rock seeps from a pair of portable compact disc player speakers
Paul removes a lid of grass and some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint
Everyone looks pretty toasted
Cardboard boxes and candles are everywhere
Sam is sitting off to himself
He's still drawing on his pad
Julia is reading one of the books from the library
(takes a hit) Monsters
Symbols and dream images
Now you see,  don't agree with that
think everything has some kind of physical representation
People can't just come up with this stuff
You did a good job last night
Julia hands him the metal object from the closet
And this
What do you make of this
Where'd you find it
In the closet you didn't leave open
What's she talking about
(wearisome) My girlfriend believes in the Boogeyman
never said it was the Boogeyman
Maybe it's some primeval energy that causes a response in human beings
This could be the physical representation of that energy
Julia
It's piece of shit
disagree
Julia turns hopefully to Terry -- Yes
It's the physical representation of a piece of shit
Pot-induced laughter
Julia takes back the object
You're not being objective about this
Have either of you ever been scared
Really scared
'm scared right now that you've smoked too much
Paul
Okay
Sure
've been really scared
Like when
Beat
Maybe when we hit the dog
Sam looks unsettled
You mean this
Sam tosses his sketch pad into the center of the floor
Everyone leans forward, getting a good look at Sam's detailed drawing of -- Completely fleshed out with distinct mechanical parts hinged into flesh and bone
Almost as accurate as a photograph
(cont'd) That thing we hit on the road
It wasn't a dog
It wasn't some primeval force, either
(then) It was a monster
Julia picks up the drawing as Paul peers over her shoulder
The picture looks particularly unsettling in the flickering firelight
It almost looks alive
- - It's late
The fire is dwindling
Terry and Sam have both passed out
Julia relaxes on the floor, staring at Sam's drawing while resting in Paul's lap
can't believe Sam drew this
can
He's been acting like a freak
Beat
You think we could've been wrong
About what
About the dog
Maybe the next day when Sam and  went back to the road
maybe we found the wrong body
Can we drop this
Please
just want to know
(clipped) Stop
just want to know what's going on
Nothing's going on
Here, give me the drawing
'm not done yet
Your hands are shaking
Come on, Julia
Give yourself a break
She hands the drawing pad to him
Paul puts it on the couch
We need to talk about this
Tomorrow
Just relax
Paul begins stroking her hair
Gently and repeatedly
Just for a minute
Julia looks really tired
She closes her eyes for a moment as Paul's steady breathing fills the room
The she opens them, turns her head and gazes at
Sitting in a chair
Smoking a cigarette
Smiling down at her
She cranks her head and looks deeply into her boyfriend's eyes
He smirks and gently strokes her hair
(cont'd) Nice
(soft) You're tired
Go to sleep
Her breathing becomes more steady
In the distance, a  begins to permeate the cabin
Grinding and drumming like the churning of a large factory
calming and soothing noise, drifting over
Quick which are strung together: (a)  turbine driven by a cloud of pumping steam
(b) The Superman tattoo on the Blond Student's shoulder
(c)  Doberman running across a road
(d)  man limping along wearing leg braces and using steel crutches
(e)  woman's hands slipping over a young man's bare chest
(f)  back brace being locked into place
-  -  (
) The stall door at the far end of the bathroom eases open
-   -  ( ) except for the
Julia stumbles through the snake pit
stagger around her
Many of them are dressed like homeless people
Staring into space
Bodies twitching and gnawing on their fingers
Lying in their own urine
Julia looks skyward towards a  that doubles for a ceiling
Dark figures are standing on the screen, looking down at them
pair of gently take Julia's arm and lead her out of the snake pit
Julia looks at the wall as she walks
'  - shadows move across the wall
Almost like ripples in water
But the shadows gradually become the silhouettes of    -- arms, legs, heads, feet -- hanging and rocking gently from hooks - -  (
) Blood trickles down over the Superman tattoo
-  -  (
) Clawed fingers slide around the open stall door
- -  (
) is having a seizure
Propped against the wall
Shaking horribly
His head and body are entirely covered with braces that form a metal exoskeleton
' -  (
) gynecology exam
woman's legs are held open by stirrups
pair of hands protected by rubber gloves cruelly insert a large alien-looking   -- which is nothing but sharp tentacles and angles -- between the legs
- woman shrieking through rotting teeth and blood
- -  (
) Julia steps into the surgical room
The from Sam's party is resting on a gurney
Her small body is clamped down with metal bands
Her blonde curls draped over the edge
Her eyes open and staring at nothing

' Julia tries to scream
No sound comes out
The shears close
Several drops of
then a
hit the tile floor
The of the is interrupted by - ROOm - Julia lurches awake
Paul and Terry are lying immobile on the floor
Hundreds of candles have been placed throughout the room, bathing the cabin in a dull amber glow
There is Julia starts to rise to her feet
Her fingers graze something sharp
She winces and snatches her fingers away from
Julia discovers a small ribbon of blood trickling from her index finger
She sucks on it, and notices -- Sitting behind the couch
His eyes are intense as he erases something from his drawing pad
Julia walks around him until she can see the sketch
'
Sam erases the picture, working from the shoulders up
There is still Julia is dumbfounded
She hears a slight noise coming from somewhere in the cabin small  sound
Soft and unobtrusive
Julia looks around
The sound seemed to come from behind her
But there's nothing in the room
Her friends are still asleep
Sam is concentrating on his drawing
More
Unmistakable this time
diminutive , almost like fingernails raking on icy glass, slithering out from a darkened hallway
She moves towards the sound
- - Julia creeps into the hallway until she can barely see the rows of bedroom doors
All of them are closed shut
The sound rises up again
Much closer
Behind one of the bedroom doors
Beckoning
Julia reaches out for the doorknob
- - The door opens
Julia's stomach rises into her throat
Terror floods her face
Resting on the bed is a
So smeared with blood that the corpse inside isn't visible except for its massive bulk
Something  on the   from Julia's body goes rigid
She can't force herself to move
The body bag is slowly unzipped from the inside
Stretching down the length of the plastic until the bag is wide open
The corpse inside is still hidden
As if drawn by some alien force, Julia moves to the bed
Her entire body is shaking
She reaches out and carefully peels back the plastic
Resting within the body bag is
Eyes puffed shut
Hair slicked with blood
Her skin is livid
Her face is ghostly white and smeared with crimson gore
Julia is frozen in place
Heart pounding
Terrified
' - - Julia is startled awake and groggily looks around the room
Paul and Terry are still in the process of getting up
Look who's up
(smiles) You sleep well
Julia back
She looks pretty freaked
(cont'd) Uh-oh
didn't sleep well either
dreamt that all these cockroaches were eating my legs
You want to trade
Right before  woke up, my head exploded and all these snakes came out
Where's Sam
Probably went to bed
Terry nods as she rises to her feet
need a hairbrush
And a facial
She stumbles into the hallway
Paul turns to Julia
You had nightmares too
Worst ones 've had in a long time
thought  was hallucinating
Paul winces and rubs his temples
(cont'd) What's wrong
Headache
'll be fine
Terry briskly walks out the hallway
She looks alarmed
You guys
Something's wrong
- - The group walks towards one of the bedroom doors
It's Sam can't get the door open
Paul tries the doorknob
The door won't budge
Paul
Sam, open up
No answer
He harder
(cont'd) Sam
He won't answer
Maybe he can't answer
Paul shoves hard against the door
But it still won't give
What about the bathroom door
It connects to your room
tried it
It's locked
Paul turns the doorknob and throws all his weight against the door, trying his best to bust it down
No such luck
(voice rising) Sam He tries again and again
The door inches open
Just a crack
(cont'd) Help me out with this
Paul and Julia push on the door, forcing it wider
- - Paul struggles through the aperture, slipping underneath a mattress that's been placed against the door, and stumbles into the room
The bedroom is a disaster area Clothes and smashed glass cover the floor
Mirrors have been shattered
Most of the furniture and portions of the bed have been piled in front of the door, creating an almost impassible barricade
The window is wide open, the curtains billowing in the breeze
Julia and Terry make their way into the room
Stupefied
Careful of the glass
Don't step on it
Total silence
The group stares at the room
Taking it in
Trying to comprehend it
What happened
(frozen) You got me
- - Paul and Terry are walking along the trail
Searching
(calling) Sam
No reply
Her words sound hollow in the empty forest as they keep moving, passing behind huge pine trees that obscure them from view
soft breeze rises up and  through the trees
- - Julia is cleaning the mess in the room
She's just finished tossing a few shards of broken glass into a garbage bag when she  and draws her index finger back
The finger has a scab on it
Exactly where she cut it in the dream
Dried blood marks the wound
- - Terry looks beside herself
Paul and Julia are seated
He must have gotten out through the window
That's the only thing  can figure
We have to call the police
You looked everywhere
Everywhere near the cabin
But we can't cover every square inch of forest out there
He might be sick
He might need help
can't understand why he'd do something like this
He was acting nuts
Really nuts
(impatient) need a phone
Wait
've got my cell
Paul fishes the cell phone out of his pocket
He hands it to her
Almost on cue
Terry glances over at her friends, then clicks the receiver
Hello
(beat) Sam Julia and Paul sit up in their seats
(cont'd) Where are you
No, where are you
(beat) How did you get there
Terry hurriedly grabs a pen
She starts writing on a pad
(cont'd) Just a minute
'm writing it down
Market Street
The Ramada
think  know where it is
(beat) Sam, what's going on
What happened
(then) Sam
She hangs up the phone
Where is he
San Francisco
What
don't know
He wants me to meet him
My brother has an apartment up there
He's out of town, but  have a spare key
guess  could stay there
Beat
You still want to call the police
Silence
Terry doesn't respond to this
Outside an open window, the   through the trees
- An empty bus station consisting of a single room with a  sitting behind the front desk
Julia and Paul are sitting on a pair of chairs, waiting patiently
Terry is using a phone booth outside
She hangs up and walks into the depot
Did you get his parents
It was the wrong number
Didn't Sam give you that number
Maybe  wrote it down wrong
Terry winces a bit
She massages her legs
Are you okay
My legs are killing me
You sure you don't want us to drive you
Nah
You have to stick around for the movers
'll be fine
The bus arrives in front of the depot
(cont'd) There's my ride
Terry grabs her suitcase
Julia hands her a slip of paper
This is Paul's cell number
You call us
Let us know what happens
just need to talk to him
Don't call the police or anything until 've had a chance to do that
Okay
Thanks
Terry hugs Julia
Paul gives her a quick kiss on the cheek
Remember
Call us
will
Carrying her suitcase, Terry backs toward the door, smiling sadly at Julia and Paul as she opens it
(cont'd) It'll be okay
Everything's okay
Her voice resonates with desperate hope rather than confidence
She leaves the depot
Paul places his arms around Julia as they watch the bus leave the station, trailing smoke
- - Julia is cleaning up
She kneels down and picks up some of the melted candles and beer bottles
Paul walks into room holding a broken picture frame
talked to the movers
Why didn't they show up
The company has no record of the order
Beat
What
know
It's crazy
Are they coming now
It'll take them a while to work us into the schedule -- get a van out here to pick up everything
How long
Three days
(exhausted) Shit
Paul holds out the mangled frame
also found this in the guest bedroom
Sam knocked one of the packing boxes over
This was inside
Julia takes a look at the frame
It's the same picture from her room of herself with her mother
The broken glass has torn the photograph
(cont'd) wasn't sure if you wanted to keep it
No
've got one
Beat
(cont'd) You know this is the only picture  have of my mother
(beat) She was always taking pictures of us, but we never got any of her
(emotional) If  didn't have this,  couldn't prove that  had a mother
That's not true
Another beat
'm so worried about Sam
Julia drowns in her thoughts
Paul touches her cheek
Let's get outta here
(smiles) Good idea
'll get my keys
Paul walks out
Julia places the frame on the coffee table
She notices something on the floor
Julia squints
It's a small object resting in the corner almost hidden from view
Julia reaches into the shadows and picks up
with  markings
Julia stares at the object in her palm
Surprised
(to herself) Where are these coming from
-  - warm summer afternoon
The entire town has congragated in a park with a breathtaking view of the ocean
and
huge banner draped over the street reads
45TH  ' Julia navigates her way past the booths and thrill rides that have been erected on the lawn
She watches some passersby
'
as   talks on a cell phone while her six year-old  tugs at her sleeve
Trying to get her attention
The mother keeps pushing the child away as she talks
Julia observes this scene until she hears
' (
) 'm your mother
Julia steps out of the crowd
Searches for the voice
is shadowing a -  walking with her boyfriend
They're trying to ignore her
'm your mother 'm your mother
'm your mother
The couple walks faster
The Homeless Woman is left behind
(cont'd) (futile) 'm your mother Julia stares helplessly
- - Spinning merrily in the center of the park
Bright lights
Loud
Young kids and teenagers occupy the horses and benches
Julia slowly walks towards the carousel, snapping pictures of the children and whirling lights
Behind her, the sound of a   rises above the music and laughter
She turns and finds a two year old  sitting on her father's shoulders, crying and pointing at -- Wearing his blue Superman shirt
He's sitting on a swing set by himself
Sad and alone
He makes eye contact with Julia
Waves timidly
She smiles at him and waves back
: Gears turning
The poles spearing the horses rising and falling into the floor
The platform rotating near the grass
The becomes the  of
-  - Julia is wandering through a maze of shooting galleries
She searches through the crowds of teenagers and children at the booths
Finally, she locates
Approaching her with a large Teddy Bear under his arm
Where did you go
Basketball toss
won this for you
Julia smiles at the bear
You sure you want to give him up
(nice smile) think he'd crowd my Barbie collection
Julia kisses him
He kisses her back and winces in pain
You okay
Head still hurts
Need some aspirin
Already took some
'll be okay
Paul notices that they've wandered into a row of  and
(cont'd) Hey, look
Want to get your palm read
As long as you're feeling up to it
am
Come on
Julia spots another booth with a sign overhead: "
" Just a minute
You go to the palm reader
want to check out this one
"The past through possessions
" (unimpressed) Scam city
And palm reading isn't
She's got him there
All right
'll meet you over there
Thanks
She kisses him quickly
They split up
'  - Paul approaches the booth
An African-American woman in her mid-forties, , sits behind the counter
Loose and upbeat
Wearing more colors in her clothing than even a rainbow could provide
Can you read my palm
She grins
You got five bucks
- Julia walks to the front counter of the booth
pair of women are sitting behind the counter, but the one who sticks out is , sixty, psychic and clairvoyant
She wears a purple kaftan which barely hides her weakness for ice cream and cookies
Can we help you, honey
You can tell me things just by holding something of mine
Right
Absolutely have a perfect track record
found two missing children in the spring of '74, and helped the state police catch a murderer in '81
Wow
That's amazing
(sourly) My grandchildren aren't quite as impressed
(a little brighter) What did you want me to look at
Julia reaches into her pocket and gently places something on the counter in front of Rosemary
'  - Tess takes Paul's hand
So what do you want to know
It's kinda stupid
But  sorta wanted to know about my Dad
If  should see him
(knowingly) You and your father don't get along
No
Something happened
My parents got divorced when  was sixteen
got into a fight with him
Said some stuff
He bows his head a little
tough subject for him
Let's take a look
Tess cocks her head a little to the side
She looks confused
(cont'd) (soft) 'll be damned
What's wrong
Well kid, you might be the first person to make me hang up my fortune telling degree
Usually the palm makes sense, and this one doesn't
How do you mean
According to this, you don't exist
Paul, his face turning white
- Rosemary handles one of the metal objects, turning it over in her palm
Julia watches her as she goes through this ritual
This is interesting
Let me guess
They came from a vacuum cleaner, right
Beat
Machines
Excuse me
This came from a machine
But not a household appliance
Where did it come from
Rosemary turns the object over in her palm
Over and over
Something that was alive
Julia leans forward in her seat
But you just said it came from a machine
know
So how can a machine be alive
don't make the news
just report it
found the larger one inside of a closet
Do you know how it got there
Rosemary continues meditating
Turning the object over between her fingers
Staring at it
Gradually, she falls into a trance
Her breathing slows
We shed our parts
What
And our skin
'm sorry
What are you talking about
Rosemary is oblivious to anything around her
But they need to be replaced
Some of the parts we can find
(beat) Others need to be harvested
The other seated next to Rosemary throws her a curious glance as she counts up some money
(cont'd) We'll wait on the side of the road
Until one of the machines come
(beat) One of us will be sacrificed
That will stop the machine
Then we can take whatever skins are inside
(softer) We can use their parts
Paul walks up
Julia
She motions for him to be quiet
We stopped the machine
But there are more of the skins than we thought
Julia
Let's take off
Hold on
We must wait
More of us are needed to capture them
What's she talking about
Wait just a minute
Please
Beat
The objects continue turning in her hand
and turning
and turning
and turning There are more of us now
We've surrounded them
But they're leaving too quickly
Julia
and turning
We'll follow them
We'll watch them
(beat) We'll take them as the need for parts becomes necessary
(louder) Julia
The wind gently through the booth's tent
Maybe we'll only take one
(beat) Maybe we'll take another
and another
and another
and another sudden gust of wind rises through the tent as
The sound of mumbling and confusion seethes from the crowd
Julia rises out of her chair
Paul takes her into her arms as  can be heard  throughout the park
Above them, the wind  through the trees
- - Julia sits on the porch
Paul is stretched out on the grass looking up at the stars
So the power went out
That doesn't mean anything
Did you hear what she said
No
She was talking about the accident
The night you hit that thing on the road
She knew about that
Julia, a psychic tells you some random shit and then lets  make sense out of it
She said it was waiting for us
Oh sure
An animal was waiting for us to come along and run it down
What was the explanation
Rotten home life
Was it taking Prozac
It wanted to stop the car
Why
Something about needing parts
If it needed parts, it shouldn't have committed suicide
She said there were more of them
Who cares what she said
It doesn't mean anything
But it's not just that
Julia's voice becomes soft
As if she were telling a secret
(cont'd) 've also had this feeling
Ever since Sam disappeared
can't shake it
What is it
feel like something's missing
Something
don't know
It's on the tip of my tongue
just feel like ever since we woke up that morning, something's not right
Like
there's someone who should be here Right
Sam
It's not Sam
(then) Did that palm reader say anything strange to you
Anything at all
Paul hesitates
He looks back at the night sky
No
Beat
Can  use your phone
-   - traditional home
The phone rings and Connor comes charging down the stairs
He answers it
Hello
- -  - Julia is sitting on the couch
Connor
It's Julia
Oh
thought you were someone else
Nice to hear your voice too
You having fun
(understated) Not exactly
got my 's back
720 verbal
690 math
You think that's good enough to get into Berkeley
You'll get in
Listen, is Dad there
No
Well could you leave him a message
Uh-huh
Tell him that the movers didn't come, so 'll be here a few more days
Tell him that  have some stuff of Mom's that he might want
Okay
Don't forget
Jesus
Show a little faith
When have  ever forgotten something
- piece of developing paper is slipped into the tray basin
Julia gently rocks the basin back and forth
picture starts to manifest on the paper
- - Paul splashes his face with water
He looks worse than he did the night before
Weaker
He grabs some aspirin from the medicine cabinet
- Julia leans forward to get a better view of the developing picture
An image is slowly forming -- carousel horses, the vague outlines of poles and children
- - Paul is shirtless and doing one-armed push-ups
His muscles churn
His body rises and falls like a piston
- The picture has come into view
The carousel
The children laughing as they ride the horses
And something else
An irregularity
dark form in the center of the carousel
- - Paul's arm as he does push-ups, sweat beading on his biceps, muscles rippling
The  of pulsates and segues into
- Julia takes the picture out of the developing basin
- There's a dark standing in the middle of the carousel
Blurred and indistinct it's waving at the camera
- - Paul is sitting on the couch, wearing a  cross country tank top and tying his shoes
Julia enters from the basement
She's carrying a stack of developed pictures
Paul, you have to see this
The picture came out, but there's something really strange in the middle of it
Just like the other one of the shed
He looks at the picture
Looks like someone on the carousel
But there's no features
It's like a shadow
So there wasn't enough light
Paul rubs his forehead
Julia is genuinely concerned
What's the matter
My head feels worse
Maybe you should lie down
have to go running
No you don't
Of course  do
Your body's like a machine
It needs upkeep
Not when you're physically ill
'll be okay
Paul
'll be okay
(about the picture) Is that it
Not exactly
(beat) When  saw this picture,  decided to look at the other one
Just for comparison's sake
So
Julia takes out another photograph
pulled this one by mistake
The picture of that little girl from the party
She hands him the picture
(cont'd) Look
Paul's face collapses into slack disbelief
from the photo
Vanished
Paul turns to Julia as she looks into his eyes with a mixture of fear and apprehension
(cont'd) What's going on
This time, he doesn't have an answer
- - Murky and still
few shafts of sunlight permeate the gloom
Paul is jogging along the trail, keeping a steady pace, the sounds of the forest all around him
- The trail snakes towards a wooden bridge that spans over a trickling creek
Paul runs across, the soles of his sneakers  on creaking wood
He moves deeper into the woods
- - lonely part of the woods where almost all the daylight is blocked out by the trees
Paul jogs along the trail when he slows to a halt, sweaty and out of breath
His skin is pale
His limbs are shivering
Paul cradles his head, shutting his eyes, suffering from obvious pain
(very soft) Oh God
make it stop
He starts walking forward again
Very slowly
slight sound as he kicks something at his feet
His eyes blink open as he looks down
There are several pieces of metal littering the trail
Almost like nuts and bolts, but alien in their design
Paul reaches down and picks one of the bolts up
Studies it
He keeps walking, following more pieces of metal that lead off the footpath
- darker spot enclosed by pine trees
few birds are singing overhead
Paul enters the forest, pushing back branches, following the trail of discarded metal until he freezes
his eyes staring directly ahead at
Hanging from branches
Scattered on the ground
Like the skin of a snake which has been shed
Paul is completely unsettled
He kneels down, picking up a flap of skin from the ground, peeling it away from a steel  dripping with oozing slime
Holds it up
It's still black in color but almost transparent in the murky light
The wind through the trees, mussing Paul's hair
Paul drops the piece of skin on the ground
The birds abruptly stop singing in unison
The
Paul looks around the forest
The sudden quiet has got him spooked
His arms and legs stiffen
Paul can't even bring himself to move or breathe
Paul freaks and whirls around, grabbing his shoulder to find Clinging to him
He rips it off and sprints for the footpath
- - Paul sprints out of the forest, running with blinding speed and adrenaline
He doesn't look back
Behind him, the wind  through the trees again
- - Julia comes up from the basement
She hears  coming from the bathroom
- Julia enters the bathroom
Paul is retching and coughing into the toilet
Hair plastered to his forehead
Pale as death
Shaking badly
Paul
What's wrong
(feeble) Sick
She goes to him
Rubs his shoulders as he  again
Oh baby
Julia brushes the hair from his forehead
She freezes
Just above his temple is a
No bigger than the head of an eraser
Identical to the one on Julia's finger
(cont'd) Paul
Where did this come from
What
This scab
Julia runs her finger over the scab
Paul immediately reels from her touch, pain shooting through his head, furious
Jesus
Fuck
Julia is shocked by the severity of his reaction
'm sorry
Paul holds his head tight
Almost near tears
Fighting pain
Just don't touch it
How long has it been there
Ever since my head started to hurt
(then) think 'm hallucinating
What did you see
Skin
like it was shed
and all of these metal pieces
Julia is terribly concerned now
His description frightens her, but she maintains a visage of calm
Do you want to see a doctor
know there's one in Santa Mira
can see a doctor in Los Angeles
(then) Look,  want to get out of here, okay
Let's go home
Beat
Okay
She squeezes his shoulder and walks into -- - - Julia pulls out their duffle bags and suitcases
Paul's cell phone  on the table
Julia snatches up the phone and answers
Hello
Yes
(then) Wait a minute slow down,  can't understand what you're saying
Complete astonishment storms Julia's face
Paul wanders in
Who is it
It's Terry
Something went wrong
-  - Gloomy and overcast
Storm clouds are brewing
-  - The Range Rover pulls down a crowded street
- Julia is sitting behind the wheel
Navigating traffic
Paul sits on the passenger side, leaning against the window, his face pressed against the glass
Somber and weak
The twisted remains of a car accident has brought everything to a near standstill
Police are everywhere
An ambulance is parked along the curb, lights flashing
Julia leans forward to get a better look
' presses a white towel against his thigh
Blood gushes from it
huge metal  sticks out of his leg
-  - The Range Rover moves past the shredded cars involved in the accident
Twisted metal covers the street
- Summer rain is falling
overhead
The Rover pulls up to the sidewalk, directly in front of an extremely opulent upper-class house
- Julia turns to Paul who sits silently in the passenger seat
He doesn't move
Sure you don't want to come with me
'm too sick need to stay someplace
'm worried about leaving you here
(shrugs) It's not like he'll disown me
know
And  really need him right now
More
Julia kisses his cheek
'm taking the cell phone
You call me
Promise
See a doctor
will
Paul opens the passenger door and steps out into the rain
Julia watches him approach the house
Then, she pulls away from the curb
-  - nice house
Large and affluent
The few moments pass before a sullen  arrives at the front door and pulls it open, revealing
standing on the front porch
His wet hair plastered to his forehead, rain streaming off his cheeks, his handsome face turned pallid and colorless
He manages a sheepish smile
Dad
Standing at the door is a man in his mid-fifties,
severe presence with a soured and weathered face
He stares at Paul without any sign of emotion
Paul notices the slight
He presses onward
bit haltingly
Still hopeful and trying to connect
(cont'd) was hoping we could talk
(beat) know we haven't done much of that recently, but still
(beat) was hoping
Beat
(cont'd) 'm in a lot of trouble
'm getting sick
and  was hoping
(beat) was hoping you could help
Paul is having difficulty speaking
He's almost reduced to tears as he stands in the cold, stinging rain
(cont'd) want to come home
Please Dad
(desperate) Please let me come home
moment of silence
(cont'd) Please
His father stands steely eyed
His voice is icy and distant
don't know you
Paul is devastated
He can barely utter a sound
'm your son
Agonizing beat
don't have a son
(then) don't know you
He slowly closes the door
Paul begins weeping openly
Dad
The door is shut in his face
Nothing can be heard except for the rain falling outside
-  - Julia is standing near the entrance
Waiting patiently
figure across the street catches Julia's attention -- a   stumbling down the sidewalk, talking to himself, shaking a rattle
(
) Julia
Julia turns around, searching, not immediately recognizing the figure that briskly approaches her -- It's Terry
But her once perfect appearance has become harsh and drawn
Her blonde hair has been colored dark brown
There are sagging circles under her eyes
Her skin is colorless
She moves quickly
Nervously
Julia is shocked
Terry
Terry's hands tremble
'm glad you came
You don't have any idea how scared 've been
Why did you change your hair
Terry is about to answer when a  starts crying in the market
Fear takes control of her face
We can't stay here
Why
Where are you parked
On the street
Good
If we keep moving, they might have trouble tracking us
Terry takes Julia's arm and leads her out of the market
-  - Terry is moving at a swift pace
She keeps looking back over her shoulder as Julia tries to keep up
Rain drenches them
What the hell is going on
Where's Sam
He's dead
This almost sends Julia reeling
Her mouth falls open
What
There's three things you should remember
Three things
What happened to Sam
First, whenever you see a baby or a kid crying, keep moving
Children can sense them
That's your warning
Warning against who
Second, they can control anything electrical or mechanical
Lamps
Cars
Phones
Terry, you're not making any sense
Third -- they can change things
They can make you disappear
Tell me what happened to Sam
am telling you
(terrified) They took him
They made him disappear
Julia stops walking
Speechless
-   - young is typing on his powerbook, oblivious to the  sitting on the sidewalk, head buried in his knees, a sign at his feet reading "
" soft whirring noise seeping from the computer as the student types
The becomes the
The Range Rover appears on the street and moves past
(
) They take away your identity
People stop remembering you
Your place in society vanishes
-   - Julia is behind the wheel
Terry is devouring a cigarette
That's how they get you
By making people not even care about you anymore
Did you try Sam's parents
Did you get the right number this time
The number called at the bus station was his parents
(cryptic) We didn't hit a dog on the road
But  saw it
They switched bodies
Who are "they
" cult
Killers
Terry starts laughing to herself
Tears welling in her eyes
Hopeless
Terrified
You have no idea
No idea what you're dealing with
(then) They don't even belong here
They're like
like machines That's what Sam said
Like machines with all this skin and moving parts
They're machines
Monsters
They're monsters, Julia
Julia stops at a light
crosses the street in front of them
He's just a yuppie with a cell phone
But Terry stiffens in her seat, watching him suspiciously
Then, almost as an aside, he winks at her
(cont'd) Drive
can't
There's a red
Then make a right
Just keep driving
Julia is growing frightened by Terry's paranoia
-  - The Rover makes a right turn and cruises down another block
- Terry keeps her eyes riveted on the  on the sidewalk
She's practically in tears
Remember when we hit that thing with the car
(hushed) It wasn't an accident
It was a set-up
They planned it all along
How do you know this
Sam told me
He figured everything out
Why are they coming after us
What do they want with us
They have flesh and metal parts in their bodies
Sometimes they shed what they don't need
But other parts keep getting worn out or lost
So they take people constantly to get new parts
(soft) That's not possible
They wear the skin
That's why you don't notice them
Half of the time they're wearing people's skin
Or they're hiding in dark places
Alleys
Closets
Julia is horrified
Terry
please stop
They take other parts too
Whatever they need
They're scavengers
No sense of compassion
No remorse
don't believe this
That's why they came after us
They got Joey first
At the cabin
Julia is dumbfounded
Joey
That's what Sam saw
That's why he left
He woke up and got a look at them -- at what they were doing to Joey
Terry
Stripping him taking his skin off Julia pulls over to the curb and stops
Who is Joey
What are you talking about
(amazed) You don't remember
No
There were five of us
He came up in his own car
He was Paul's best friend -- they always wore the same thing for Christ sakes
There were only four of us
You
Me
Paul
Sam
Terry is shaking now
Complete fright
They got to you
They got to you
Nobody got to me
Terry starts collecting her things
Look, could you drop me off at my brother's apartment
need to pick up some things before  go to the airport
Where are you going
To see my parents
You can't just leave
Terry starts weeping
Grabbing her legs and squeezing them
They put things in my legs so they can track me
It hurts
(very concerned) Terry
What can do to help you
Terry takes her hand
Her eyes pleading
Remember me
Please remember me
From the street outside the car, the sound of a   can be heard
Terry's head snaps around
She stares out the windshield at the screaming child
(cont'd) They found me again
Before Julia can react, Terry bolts from the car
Terry
Julia pursues
-  - Julia pushes and shoves her way along the sidewalk
Terry is running like a madwoman
Pure unabated terror
Terry rushes down into a subway entrance
Julia follows
- People are crowded on the platform, waiting as a  train rushes into the station
The doors open
Passengers move off the train
Others get on
Julia rushes down the stairs and pushes past the arriving commuters
There's no sign of Terry
Julia keeps searching
Looks right
Then left
Finally, she spots Terry boarding the  train
Terry
Wait
Julia rushes forward, squirming through the crowd, until she reaches the doors just as they She looks through the windows, trying to find Terry amongst the crowd inside
The train starts to move
Standing at one of the train's passenger windows, his face and palms pressed against the glass, is -- Staring directly at her
Dark circles around his eyes
He smiles at Julia
His teeth are made of metal
Julia stands thunderstruck
The  in the window moves past
The train shoots into the awaiting tunnel
Julia is left standing frozen and immobile on the platform
Near the subway entrance, a   with    is convulsing as he sits against the wall
Eyes wide open
Shaking horribly and staring at nothing
-   - Quiet and dimly lit
Several of the lights are burnt out, leaving the hallway drowning in shadows
The elevator doors open
Terry exits and moves quickly down the hallway
Her face is terrified
Sick
She arrives at an apartment
Terry fumbles with her keys
soft in the hallway
Deep and hollow
Terry spins around, the keys  in her hand
Nothing there
The hall appears to be empty and dark
One of the lights overhead is flickering and buzzing softly, providing scant illumination
She takes a step back
soft sound at her feet
Terry looks down to find a few pieces of  littering the floor
Nuts and bolts
Rods
Alien in design
Terry's paranoia rises to a fever pitch
She turns the key in the lock
Opens the front door
-   - Terry shuts the door
Locks it
Switches on the lights
Drops her  and   on a coffee table
She moves briskly into -- -  - An open suitcase on the bed
Terry snatches up a   and jams the ticket folder into her purse
Slams the suitcase closed
-   - Terry leaves the bedroom, carrying the suitcase, and walks straight towards the front door
She collects her keys and her cell phone from the table
The lights in the apartment simultaneously go out
Terry is caught entirely off guard
She spins around to face the living room
Nobody's there
Nothing
Terry's breathing quickens
She puts the suitcase down
crack of reverberates outside
Moving with the cautious steps of a small child, she walks towards the front door
Foot by foot
The only sound is her
She arrives at the peephole and looks out into the empty hall
Moving right in front of the door
One of its yellow eyes piercing through
surrounded by midnight skin pierced with metal bolts and rods
The like it's going to break off its hinges
Something against the wood
Terry tears through the apartment, feet
She rushes into the bedroom
The front door in the living room
-  - Terry  the bedroom door and locks it
Backs away towards the bed, when
Grabbing hold of her ankle
Fused together from rotting flesh, human parts, and metal pieces
Terry pitches forward, , falling to her hands and knees
The hand starts dragging her under the bed
Terry kicks and claws on the floor
Somehow manages to free herself from the hand's grip
She goes for the window and pulls it open
Steps outside
The entire bed is  and tossed aside
-   - Terry is immediately drenched by the storm
The door within her bedroom can be heard , followed by a  unlike anything on this earth
Terry rushes down the fire escape,   on the metal steps
But she stops dead in her tracks when she notices -- Standing in the alley far below
Looking up at her
Waiting
sound rises up behind her (horrified) Oh God
Terry desperately goes to a window
She pulls it open, stepping inside, -  - The apartment floor is being renovated
Plastic tarps cover the doors and windows
Terry races through the hallway,   as she  on the doors
Terry rockets around the corner
She presses the elevator door button frantically
The sound of and  fills the hallway
The elevator doors slide open
Terry lunges into the elevator, hits for the lobby, then starts   on the door close button
Several shadows appear in the hallway
Getting closer
Terry and keeps pounding the button
The bizarre becomes a   just as
The elevator doors pull shut
Closing on the unseen things in the hallway
- The car starts going down
Floor lights blink above the door
8
7
6
Terry punches out 9-1-1 on the cell phone's keypad
Nothing comes through the receiver
Only static
Come on
come on
She dials again
4
3
2 More static over the cell phone
Terry has started crying in anguish when the elevator comes to an abrupt halt
The doors stay closed
Terry looks above the elevator doors
The floor light reads -- "" (Basement) Terry starts pressing for the lobby
The elevator won't move
She presses the "door open" button, the alarm button, anything at all
Nothing responds
(cont'd) Nothing
Futile silence
She's about to try dialing on the cell phone again, when
heavy thudding sound above the elevator car roof
The light overhead flickers like a candle
Terry gazes at the failing light, then tracks her eyes towards the trap door in the roof
few more hollow Terry is petrified
She takes a step backward
The light flashes off and on again
creating a strobe light effect
Behind her, the elevator doors silently pull open
Terry's gaze is still focussed on the ceiling trap door
Behind her, the basement is pitch black
She continues moving backwards towards the open elevator doors, step after step, completely unaware
In the moment it takes to draw a breath and scream, it's already over
The light goes out
-   - The lobby is vacant and terribly still
The elevator doors remain closed, a few sounds coming from the shaft far below
Then nothing
-  - The sound of a Julia is sitting inside of the parked Range Rover, the cell phone pressed against her ear
' (from phone) Hello

Julia stares at the cell phone in stunned confusion, until a sharp pain courses through her hand
She  and nearly drops the phone
Julia checks her pricked finger
The An infected red spot with a open hole in the center
The skin actually seems to be rotting around it, allowing the wound to expand like a sinkhole
- small box of aspirin are taken from the shelf
Paul tightens his fist around the box, shutting his eyes, fighting the excruciating the pain in his head
He takes a deep breath and moves to the register
Need anything else
(weak) No
The cashier rings him up
Four thirty-two
Paul flips open his wallet
His face drops into shock
There's nothing inside his wallet
No credit cards
No money
No driver's license
Not a thing

Pleading eyes
Dishevelled and caked with grime
She holds up the drooping sleeve where a hand once was
Help me
They took my hand
Paul stumbles back
Horrified

Paul turns and starts running
Faster than he's ever run in his life
Disappearing down the dark street
-   - Small and trendy
Young clientele
- Julia sits at an empty booth
Staring at various black and white photographs of graduation
The four friends are sitting together on the back porch, smiling for the camera
She squeezes her finger to help numb the pain, her mind turning
(to herself) Joey
(then) Terry, what were you talking about
Julia flips to another photograph
picture of Julia, Paul, Sam, and Terry on the  campus
Dressed for graduation
Julia shakes her head
Her eyes are locked on the faces of her friends
(cont'd) There's four of us
There's only four of us

She studies the picture
Beat
Julia sits up in her chair
revelation crosses her face

Julia looks like she's falling into a deep hole
Her mind is racing for answers

Smoking a cigarette
Smiling down at her

) It's just a fantasy
:
-   - Candles have been placed around the room
Paul and Terry are asleep on the floor
Blood drips over the   on Joey's shoulder
Julia slowly awakens to the sounds of   over sickening   like cloth being torn in half
There are silhouettes on the wall of tearing off pieces of something in the room
Large flaps
Chunks
Moving rapidly and ferociously
Julia spots Sam across the room
(shrieking) Julia turns her head in the direction of the ripping and tearing sounds
Her eyes slowly widen as her mouth drops into a soundless, petrified look of horror
hand with midnight skin, six fingers, and punctured with steel rods covers her eyes
- plate on the floor
Julia is jolted out of her thought, looks over to find a  picking up the pieces
The lights flicker in the shop
This unnerves Julia completely
She starts gathering the photographs together
She becomes aware of the pain in her finger again
Looks at the scab
(a whisper) Terry's legs Paul's headaches
thought crashes like thunder in her head
(cont'd) Oh no
Julia quickly grabs a knife from the table
She gets up and walks straight to the ladies restroom
-  - Cramped and dirty
Julia holds her finger over the sink
With the point of the knife's blade, she begins digging into her finger
The pain is immediate
Julia grimaces, tears forming in her eyes, as the wound blossoms bright red
Blood drips into the sink Julia drops the knife into the sink and pinches the wound
Squeezing hard
speck of metal flashes inSIDE the wound Julia continues squeezing, tears rolling, fingernails digging into the wound as
Julia starts pulling it out of her finger
The splinter rises from the wound
and rises and rises
More blood spatters into the sink
Julia is and  as the pain becomes excruciating
The glittering splinter is five inches long and growing
The splinter is pulled out
It's seven inches long Julia drops the splinter into the sink
She moves away from the counter, back towards the living room, unbelieving, horrified
She stumbles towards the door
- Julia walks out of the restroom
Stops cold
Everyone in the coffee shop is staring at her
The customers
The waiters
The lights are dimming
lack of power
Julia forces herself to move
She goes to her table, picks up the photographs, and suddenly notices that in the graduation pictures -- --
Julia grabs the photographs and turns around
The customers in the coffee shop are standing now
Their eyes are dark shadows
Something about the way they stand is completely unnatural
All wrong
Panic begins to settle in
Julia quickly walks to the door
Julia
She turns
The waiter stands behind her
Eyes burning
(cont'd) (menacing) Why'd you take it out
That's enough
Julia gets the hell out of there
- Julia bolts out the door and rushes across the street
She reaches her car, disarms the alarm, and gets inside
- Julia drops the photos into the passenger seat
Starts the car
The
She answers it
Hello
-   - Paul on a pay phone
There's panic in his voice
Julia
It's Paul
Where are you
At a pay phone
What about your Dad
He wouldn't let me in
He told me he didn't have a son
(then) Julia, everything in my wallet's gone
Credit cards
Money
Driver's license
Everything
- between Julia and Paul
Then it's already started
What's started
Terrified beat
Julia trains her eyes on the coffee shop
Listen
There's not much time
They're watching me right now
Who is
Just listen to me
There were five of us at the cabin
(beat) Your best friend was with us
Joey
He had blond hair
He had a Superman tattoo on his shoulder
don't know anyone named Joey
That's because they erased your memory
If you remembered him
if you remembered what they did to him, you might run like Sam
That would make it hard for them to hunt you down
Where's Sam
He's dead
What
They killed him
They
Monsters
Paul can barely stand up
His skull is pounding
Monsters
They really exist, Paul
They use human beings for parts
Like machines
can't take this
What you saw in the forest wasn't a hallucination
They've been watching us the entire time
Following us
can't -- There's a tracking device in your head
Right where the scab is
Her words sound chilling in the night air
Foreboding and deadly
Paul is filled with dread
My head
They want us for parts
That's why they're tracking us
They take the skin and wear it
Just let me think for a second
They already got Sam and Terry
And now they're making us disappear
(then) Think about it
Your wallet
Your father
It can't be true
It is true
We're next
Paul becomes upset
He nods with grave understanding
What are we gonna do
We have to get back home
They're all over the place, but we can make it
Okay
Where are you
Just below Union Square
Right near the cable cars
Where they turn them around
All right
There's a subway station near there
can see it
Wait for me
At the top of the stairs
'll be there in five minutes
Okay
love you
(in pain) love you
Please hurry
Paul hangs up
- Julia tosses down the cell phone
The car engine
What now
She tries to start the car, but it the engine won't turn over
Just as she's about to try a second time, she looks out the windshield
Julia frantically tries to start the car again
No dice
She rips open the door
- Julia takes off running
The  pursue
-  - Julia turns a corner and runs straight into an intersection
as a  barrels towards her
Julia barely leaps out of the way as the bus  to a halt, nearly running her down
She rises to her feet as the bus starts moving again
Several of the passengers have their faces pressed against the windows
Watching her
Dark circles around their eyes
Julia keeps going
The   from the coffee shop are marooned on the opposite corner by traffic
They stand motionless
Watching her escape
-  - long flight of stone stairs leads down to the  and  stations below
Paul sits down on the steps
Looking
Waiting
-   - Julia charges down the sidewalk
Weaving past bystanders
As she runs, Julia brushes past    from Sam's graduation party
Standing abnormally
She watches Julia race off into the crowd with cold, soulless eyes
-  - Paul is sitting still
His head cradled in his hands
appears in front of him
Paul looks up
Smiles
Hey
-   - Julia races across the intersection and streaks towards the subway station entrance
-  - Paul is nowhere to be found
The stairs are empty
Paul
Julia looks around desperately
She can't find him in the crowds on the sidewalks
She turns and looks down the stairs towards the open entryway to the subway system
Paul is walking through the entryway
friend with him is patting him on the shoulder
Just after Paul has disappeared through the entryway, the friend turns around
'
His lips are parched, pitch black eyes bulging, his features somehow more twisted and unfamiliar
His face twitches as he stares coldly at Julia, and he runs
Small pieces of metal drop from Sam's pants legs as he disappears through the entryway
(cont'd) She frantically rushes down the stairs
(cont'd) ' She rushes through the entryway
-   - The upper level is almost completely empty save a few kids and late-night commuters
Julia is hysterical now
The first time we've seen her lose control
She looks around frantically
Spots Paul and Sam going down the escalator together
Paul
Julia rushes towards the turnstiles
Jumps them
steps out of his booth
Hey
You need a ticket
Hey
She keeps going
-  - Paul and Sam reach the bottom of the escalators
They move towards the platform
The lights start twinkling
Losing power
(confused) thought you said she'd be here
Sam smirks back, mute
and
The lights -  - Julia bolts down the escalator
-  - She reaches the platform and rushes to the center
There's nobody else down there
The lights are flickering
Slowly, they return to normal
(calling) Paul
No response
train through the station
Julia moves to the opposite side and looks
Resting on the tracks, leading into the tunnel, are a trail of metal pieces
Exactly like the ones from the cabin
Julia looks back
The  is coming down the escalator
Without hesitation, she jumps down to the tracks
Moving quickly and bending down to avoid being seen, she rushes into the awaiting subway tunnel
- Drowned in shadows
An unnatural silence fills the tunnel
Julia moves cautiously amongst the tracks
Eyes scanning the darkness
Following the trail of discarded metal
Julia spins around
few more   rise from electrical sparks on the tracks
Blue light flashes within the tunnel
Then, it ceases
She turns back to continue her search, wind sifting through her hair, when she finds -- At the base of the subway wall
Julia reaches down and palms a few metal pieces at the base of the hole
She peers inside
dull flickering light flashes within
Julia takes a calming breath
She moves into the hole
- narrow and claustrophobic space
Julia squirms through the confined space, pulling herself towards the flashing light
- Julia pulls herself through another opening and finds herself standing in the threshold of a corridor
Both the walls and floor are constructed of crude metal grates and long pipes
Anything could be hiding within
Waiting
She moves slowly into the corridor, a   flickering around her
She gropes towards another opening
The sound of her   is slowly replaced by the - Steam rises from the pipes
Bathing the stairwell in mist
The fluorescent lights above are glimmering in the darkness
Julia stands at the top of the stairwell
She can't even see the bottom of the steps
Carefully, she starts moving down
Her hand gripping the metal railing
The grows louder
Her foot accidentally kicks a few pieces of metal on the steps
light  as the metal scatters down ahead of her
The is closer now
Just beyond the sheathing clouds of blue and white mist
The metal railing is suddenly replaced by
Julia pulls her hand away from the railing
Looks skyward and discovers more  are being used to brace the ceiling along with metal beams
She stops
Shutting her eyes in fear
Starts to lose control
From somewhere within, she manages to steady herself
Keeps going through the awaiting steam curtain at the bottom
- The steam parts to reveal a dark space
Cold and damp
Julia moves into the main hallway, stumbling through a hallway that can best be described as a living nightmare
Mammoth pipes and human skin has been fashioned together into a wall, pulsating with the    that saturates the entire hallway
Steam jets into the hallway intermittently from the pipes
Creating great clouds
Julia is beyond horrified
Her face registers a numbness
Complete and total astonishment
Human bones and body parts have been so expertly fashioned into the corridor that it's impossible to distinguish where the organic ends and the mechanical begins
She enters another corridor
Her face is struck by a
She presses onward
Slipping past the skulls and littered metal on the floor
Another Something leaps out of the middle of it
Julia whirls back around a corner, pressing flat against the wall as a   moves through the steam
Unidentifiable features
Movements that suggest nothing by chaos and madness
The and  in the hallway
Julia waits
She doesn't even breathe
The  stops
She gradually turns to peek back into the hallway where the thing once stood
' as she looks around the corner
The shape has disappeared
Carefully she keeps going forward
Drenched in water and sweat
Slipping through the steam clouds that mask another entrance
- massive room where empty human skins are dangling from hooks, complete and preserved from head to toe
The skins sway and rock gently in the draft
Thousands of them
Julia moves towards the center of the room
large awaits
But the surface of the table is sunken like a water basin
Next to the table is a pedestal littered with
Cutting tools
Knives
Curved hooks
Julia notices that Paul's torn clothes are resting at the foot of the table
Shirt shredded to a rag
Sneakers orphaned nearby
Jeans spattered with blood
Her breathing quickens
Her heart
She reaches the foot of the table
Paul is lying within the basin, completely naked and partially covered with
Organs and entrails
The basin is filled with water and blood
An immobile form is resting next to him
Julia moves quickly
She tries to wake him up
Paul
Paul, wake up
He stirs
His nose crinkles slightly
(cont'd) Wake up
She grabs him and lifts him up
He starts
(cont'd) You've gotta hurry
(then) Here
Julia grabs his jeans
She helps him slide down from the basin and he pulls them on
skinned grabs hers
Julia yelps a
The other form -- a thing in the basin -- rises and turns
Slicked with blood
Empty sockets where the eyes should be
Mouth falling open
horror that shouldn't be alive
Julia again
Her free hand grabs a  from the pedestal and swings the blade into the thing's neck
Blood fountains up
The thing begins
With Paul leaning on her for support, Julia rapidly heads for the door
- Julia navigates her way through the hallways
Moving blindly through sudden   , the sound of  around them
Paul leans on her, his eyes remaining closed, and stumbling
' Racing through the halls
The steam clouds suddenly  into her view
- Julia reaches the stairwell and helps Paul climb the steps
She looks back over her shoulder
Nothing behind them
- Julia stops at the corridor opening
The strobe light  within
Clicking
The corridor looks empty
Nothing but pipes and shadows
We're almost there
Julia turns to Paul and finds a face with glaring yellow eyes and metal teeth
He stares back at her
moment of sheer horror
Julia reels back into the corridor
Pressed flat against the wall
Sliding towards the crawl space opening
Paul starts advancing into the corridor
Grinning with teeth that flash with every click of the strobe light
She keeps sliding away
He grabs his chest and   , tearing the covering skin apart as he would a shirt menagerie of human bones and metal are revealed behind it
Julia tries to scream
Eyes wide
She can't make a sound
Paul tears the skin covering his chest wider
Pulling it away
Stripping himself clean
Julia reaches the crawl space
Sliding down
The last pieces Paul's skin are torn off
The thing that had been pretending to be Paul stands in his place
Only brief glimpses are allowed by the strobe light
An abysm of immemorial lunacy consisting of fashioned human parts and twisted metal
human heart beating within exposed ribs
Bones combined with pulleys and rods
The face of a skull
contradiction of all matter and cosmic order
Julia slips back into the crawl space
Still trying to scream
- Julia drags herself through the crawl space
Moving quickly
Panicked
- Julia squeezes herself through the exposed hole
She kicks to her feet and tears off into the tunnel
-   - Julia has almost reached the platform opening for the train
, -  - Julia runs directly parallel to the subway platform
The lights alongside of her start flickering and go out, one by one, as she advances
She reaches the opposite tunnel and grabs hold of the platform, pulling herself up
The platform goes dark
Appearing out of the far tunnel are a   , scampering along the walls and running on all fours across the tracks
Their characteristics barely visible
Julia kicks back as the shrieking things bear down on her, yellow eyes flaring in the dark, metal teeth flashing
Julia tries to run for the escalator, but the things cover the walls behind the tracks
Ready to spring
Finally, one of the monsters does leap towards her
Reducing the monster to a few vestiges of scattered metal
The other creatures on the tracks are also run down
Julia watches as the train  past
And then, silence
Nothing is left except for a few swirling newspapers
The lights flicker and come back to life
Rising up to her feet, rescued from death by chance, Julia starts backing towards the escalator
Her eyes locked upon the darkened tunnel before she turns and races up
-  - Rain has started falling again
Pelting the stairs
Julia dashes up the stairwell and sprints into the street
She doesn't look back
: -  - The rain falls so heavily that it creates a dense, blue  which shrouds the entire street
Julia appears through the storm, running towards a telephone booth on the street corner
She rips open the door, steps inside, and slams the door shut
- She drops a few quarters into the phone
Dials
And waits
-   - Dark and still
Lightning frames the windows
The picture of Julia and her mother rests near a phone as the line
Guy comes downstairs and answers the portable
Hello
Static
(cont'd) (bewildered) Is anyone there
- flash of outside
Daddy
It's Julia
(beat) They might still be around
feeding on power from the phone lines
Can you hear me
(beat) Dad
(over phone) can't hear you
Hello
Beat
Daddy, help me help me, please
-   - More resounds over the phone
Guy hesitates a moment, then returns the portable to the cradle
- The line is abruptly cut off
Julia begins to cry
She covers her face with her hands
The tears roll through her fingers
-   - Guy stares at the phone for a moment
strange feeling
Something isn't right
He thinks a moment
Then shakes it off and heads upstairs, moving directly past the picture next to the phone
Lightning flashes across the picture's glass frame
: -   - The afternoon rush of people trying to get home
come down the escalator into the station
is among them, now eighteen and wearing a Berkeley sweatshirt
His friends are  and Why the hell didn't we bring the car
You wanna pay for gas
Better than this shit
hate
He has a point
made the mistake of trying to use the bathroom
What do these people do
Stand with their ass hanging over the toilet and aim
Connor checks his watch
We're late
Party started an hour ago
We'll make it
(trace of sarcasm) Yeah Connor
Relax
We might get there right after the kegs dry out
(resigned) should study anyway
calls out from across the platform
(
) Connor
He turns around and scans the crowd, locating a ragged figure that moves quickly towards him
With her dirty clothing and sunken eyes, it takes a moment to register
This is Julia
Her skin is pale
Her hair is stringy and knotted
've been looking for you
What
(hushed) Great
Just ignore her
They tried to get me
Several times
But managed to get away
've always managed to get away
train rushes into the station
Connor is speechless
'm
sorry But you'll help me
You will help me
Connor raises his hands and backs towards the train as the doors slide open
His friends are already aboard
'm sorry
No, wait
it's Julia
don't you remember
He gets into the train
His friends are laughing
Connor turns to his friends with a look of smirking disbelief
How the fuck did she know my name
She heard me say it
Jesus Christ
(overlapping) It's Julia
'm your sister
The doors slide closed in her face
- Julia begins beating on the doors to be heard
Connor and his friends are a little freaked but they're still laughing at her
'
The train starts to move
People inside move in front of the doors and block Julia's view of her brother
(cont'd) ' Julia runs alongside the train
Still beating on the doors
Her face awash with tears
(cont'd) ' (shrieks) The train picks up speed
Julia is left behind
The grinding of the wheels is heard as the train moves into the subway tunnel
The sound of machines drowns out every other sound and consumes all
