Try a Goddamn turkey roll and you'll discover how
They're delicious
that we are in a modest Ohio house in the year 1979
At a wake
Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly dressed
Quiet discussions
Some crying
Either nothing was in there, or like whatever they scraped up-- Jesus -- guys-- heard it crushed her completely
At least keep your voices -- steel beam-- those things weigh a ton
Literally
If it had been open casket, would not be eating right now
Despite the turkey rolls

They look up -- in the other room, a dog (mutt, Lucy) has jumped on a guest, for food
, Joe's father, 42, black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot
Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my movie anymore
Why
Why do you think why
The story
It's about the living dead
His mother's not a zombie
But she's dead, shithead
Those turkey rolls are pretty good

Told you
'  -  - grey, snow-covered, early February day here in ,
Many cars are parked outside the house, notably a '    in the driveway
Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit, now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years
He solemnly looks down at the  he still holds
No doubt trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around his mother's neck
Then a
Joe looks up
has arrived -- a distinct 1968   -- a with a    down its center
Joe watches as the car sits there for a moment
Then a  gets out
Someone Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally
man in his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt
He's not exactly sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been drinking
This is
Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house
Joe's eyes glued on the house for a while
Then he looks back to the locket
He  , and stares at the picture inside (which we do not see)
And as he stares,  come to his eyes
moment broken by the     -- Joe turns toward the house
After a beat, the  of something -- something glass
Then the house   bursts open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and - Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car
When he slams the back door, he sees Joe
Sort of freezes as their eyes lock
But Jack's more uncomfortable : 'll be home soon
And Jack gets into the car and drives away
Joe watches them drive off
And after a beat, he looks down at the locket again
Mom's just gone
Finally he   -- and we hear an oddly   and our
Over darkness:  -- then a  : " want you

- Hundreds of  eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, winter a memory
emphatically embrace each other good-bye
run off, just happy to be out
Lots of "Have a great summer
" Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack on shoulder
Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe : That was the longest day ever-- here
What's this
New scene, check it out
Let's hit the 7
(as he reads) You hear Martin barfed in the hall
know, does that guy ever not barf
Keep reading
--  am reading
-- Not carefully
Focus, this is important
-- Detective Hathaway has a wife
(') think it might help make my movie better
need two things: a better story and production value
They head across the street to the 7-Eleven
Suddenly Cary is there, a   on his right arm now: Martin booted all over his locker, it was the grossest one yet-- Let Joe focus, he's reading
After he ate two boxes of Mike and Ikes-- never seen so many colors in my life
Will you shut up a minute

Who's gonna play the wife, Jen
No way -- did  tell you what she did with my top hat
Oh yeah, that was bad
What wife
Alice Dainard
Joe stops
His friends don't
-- 7- - As they head to the doors: was returning that book on codes and ciphers-- she was in the silent reading section --  thought, "Screw it
" So  asked her if she'd play Hathaway's wife
You talked to Alice Dainard really
You're not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section-- Shut up
It's for "silent reading
" She said yes, we're filming tonight and she's driving
7- -  - Joe, Charles and Cary scan the candy aisle
-- driving where

To the train depot -- did you not read the scene  just gave you
Does Alice have a license
Is she old enough
Whose car are we taking
Are you making this up
Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to drive and  accepted-- (takes scene pages) Can  see --
-- was she nice
Why is she doing this
don't understand, we don't even know her-- Maybe she just wants to be in a good movie, y'ever think of that
don't think that's what it is-- 've been working on this movie for months
'm just trying to make it good
(reading, disapproving) Hathaway's married now
Really
Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary
What was she reading
what
In the silent reading section, what was Alice reading
Who gives a rat's ass what she was reading-- the festival deadline's in one week -- my movie's gotta be great

He watches

We see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through in the air
It's an old office door, ajar
Hathaway is still
Nervous
Watching the door -- waiting for it to open

As he tosses Joe a  8  : 'm coming
( ) There's a whole article in there about stories, you should read it, it explains everything

) Jesus, that's what 've been explaining: in the scene we're filming tonight, the wife telling the detecting she's scared for him, that she loves him-- Charles
-- '
-- so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares -- you'll feel something -- because you don't want him to die because they love each other
Does that make sense

You're impossible

Mom, it's not fair that  can't go to Wendy's
Every single person is going except me

So
Get off that thing
Mom, why can't  switch with Charles
Because you crushed Charles' top hat, you ever think of that
Disgusted, Jen  sets Charles' place as -- Oh, really, guess what
We're switching

Charles grabs a roll
Guess what, no we're not

And we se his : Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and - shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands, quietly

But he can't look away
And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up
Joe's mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets it together, quick
Puts on a strong face

Thanks
That's called a "sharteeze" by the way
Well then  totally sharteezed in my pants
That's exactly what 'm talking about: the world is crazy, there's a name for everything
Twizzler me
Joe passes him a Twizzler
So
people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory, right
Martin
don't see how the guy playing Detective Hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from
Another classic from Smartin
told you,  don't like it when you call me that
'm sorry, Smartin
Shut up
-- 15
All the boys look
Their faces
Headlights
The boys stand as the car  beside them -- ' ' But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14- year-old
She sees Joe
Joe Lamb
-- yeah
What the hell's he doing here
Make-up, sound and special effects
He's the deputy's kid
-- what
(touch flattered) -- you knew that
(') Charles,  don't have a license can't drive with him
You want Joe to-- stay back
--
It's too late
He's seeing me in this car right now
You can trust me
My dad'll never know
won't tell him anything
Looking away, she's pissed
All the boys in silent wait
She considers, annoyed
Shakes her head
Finally: Get in
The boys   into the car
- The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small town, driving through a rural landscape
16
(
) () You're driving very well
'm impressed
- Alice drives
The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as he pulls out , arranging them
With her driving, there's an unusual, electric energy in the air
Joe eats his Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice
So  wrote a couple new lines, can show you
What
New lines
Charles-- what,  have new lines
Shut up
There aren't a lot-- 'm sorta trying to drive-- What would be great is: could you cry during the scene
Can you do that
no
Cary messes with the radio
Alice moves his hand away
(') Stop
You know the first place 'm gonna drive when  get my license
(offering to Alice) Want one
Alice looks at him in the rear view
Their eyes hold a beat
17
New Castle, Pennsylvania
Fireworks capital of America
She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road
So  don't have any new lines, right
Because  just learned these
Shut up
have never been a passenger in a vehicle without an adult driving
'm unresolved as to how  feel about it
- The Buick   a solitary
The car dips into the darkness, beneath a blanket of stars
- The Buick pulls up to this small,    in the middle of, essentially, nowhere
series of illuminates the
There's a small office, currently closed
No one around
The kids get out of the car
Guys, there's an electrical socket up here
Hey, Charles, Charles, do  have more lines
No
But you can pick up some stuff
The boys carry many bags and the tripod
- Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he creates with both hands
18
(') Guys, this is going to be great
Get the lights and camera on that end, we'll shoot this direction first, like we talked about
Joe, get the mike plugged in-- make sure the new batteries are in the camera before you do the make-up
Okay
Joe walks past Alive, who watches him
It strikes her that Joe is Charles' lackey
-  - Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading and memorizing his lines
"-- Sweetheart, this is my job, have no choice
" "That's nothing you need to worry about
" "What am  suppose to go to Michigan with you
" Cary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind, sending Martin running after it
(') No, no, no
Cary
Preston sets up the lights as Cary arrives to show him his backpack full of : took apart two packs of cherry bombs and made my own -80
Your obsession with fireworks -- and 'm saying this as a friend -- concerns me
And my mother
Well you're a pussy
And your mom has one
Cary takes off
Martin returns with his paper
19
Bogus, Cary
-  -    - Charles writes in his notebook
He starts to get up
Martin,  have a new line for you
He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice
He walks over to Martin, Cary and Preston
Charles and Martin

Inside is an assortment of -, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of

He looks to her
beat
You mind
Alice shakes her head: nope
Joe starts stippling the make-up onto her face
He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a girl he's admired for some time
After a beat: My dad works at the mill
And she looks at him
Almost as if she were looking for something
Joe stops stippling
The tension is almost too much for him to bear
Close you eyes
Please
He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up
She does
Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids
There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed
Then, -: (
) So this is very emotional
-  - The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and camera (a ) are set
Alice has been made up, wears a coat with purse
Martin, in his tie, faces her
They both look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera
20
Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat
Alice: Mrs
Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investiga-- know, we read it, we get it
Okay, 'm just directing
Martin get on your mark
Martin, you're going to have to reassure her
Do you know what "reassure her" means
Yeah,  think so
Okay-- we're starting on Alice's side first-- Preston: a couple seconds after "action" walk to the pay phone, make it look like this place is busy-- know what that looks like
Everyone  -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker: Asshole, could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera
Sorry man
Let's rehearse this -- save your real performances for when we're filming, though
Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the camera
Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera- height
Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the actors' heads
Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk
(') Ready
Here we go
action
21
Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, and
: 'm going to stay here and investigate
think it would be safer if you leave town
John
don't like it
This case
These murders
What am  supposed to do, go to Michigan with you
Preston walks past them, acting in the background
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year
We're    , watching Alice
Slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role -- Sweetheart
This is my job
The dead, coming back to life think you're in danger-- have no choice-- You do have a choice
We all do
And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs her lines
Not overdone, not hammy
Just fucking real
(') John, 've never asked you to stop
've never asked you to give up or walk away
Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily transported
But it's  who, as he stares, becomes galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set: (') But 'm asking you now-- please
For me
Don't go back
Don't leave me
() 22
(') need to know this isn't the last time 'll see you
() just love you so much
Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance
love you too
And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure: Was that okay
Or
not really
Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as he searches, behind him, a  -- -- uh, that was
'm
that-- yeah, good
Just like that
Then a distant  -- Charles looks:
,
He turns to them all: (') Is there film in the camera
--  didn't put it in-- Joe, get the mike ready
Go, go, Preston, get in position
Costume, costume
Martin, get that tripod set up
Joe, help her with her costume
Hurry, hurry
Go
hope we don't miss the train
Preston, get in position
Martin, you know you lines, right As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages
love how calm he is
Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy
23
Joe laughs a little as he goes -- Cary   a 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary  the film: Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera: Everyone ready
Be extra loud when the train passes by
Oh God, hope it stops
You ready
They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in her background -- Charles puts on the headphones -- (') And
And they're shooting: 'm going to stay here and investigate
think it would be safer if you left town for a couple of days
John
don't like it
This case
These murders
What am  supposed to do, go to Michigan with you
Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year
Sweetheart
This is my job
Charles watches, beaming with excitement
Joe holds the boom, looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he notices something in the distance
quarter mile away, a vehicle drives along the horizon
beat
But the train is  --   -- which makes Joe turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them -- , so the actors begin to  over the : , '
24
John, 've never asked you to stop
've never asked you to give up or walk away
Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle , unsettled -- as the train    -- Joe looks back toward Alice -- a   , shockingly
(') But 'm asking you now-- please
For me
Don't go back
Don't leave me
need to know this isn't the last time 'll see you
() just love you so much
Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is almost  at how good this looks -- but Joe toward the headlights -- the train -
love you too
And Joe finally swings the mike down and : ,
Joe what the hell are y--
-- just then ---
, ,     --    --  -- Run

They run off

And then -- '
Just the odd, dying  and -- of   running out of momentum,  of , the unnatural bending of steel
In the ,  lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly shut
His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: Joe stands up fast, faces a  of twisted -- -     around him
Just another few feet and he would've been crushed
But what was that sound
Something metal
Then again:
Joe , afraid -- it was almost a   -- or
crazy , another , then and
We see Joe         -- :

Joe turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the  -- but it is
Nothing
'  -- on its side, (
) Guys
Joe finds , on his knees,   -- Martin keeps throwing up, but pumps a
(') Martin, are you okay
Preston, is that you
'm okay
Though  think 'm having a heart attack
And  have a scrape
Joe   -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary appears, smiling
This kid enjoyed the crash: 26
Guys, did you see those explosions
That was awesome
Has anyone seen Alice
(
) 'm alive
Is anyone dead
Through the debris, steel and dust
Joe moves forward -- Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust -- Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train and Joe's heart sinks as he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed
Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood -- (') -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono
Martin, still sick, calls out: -- what
Guys, what is it
shit
Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of ,   -- everything stops -- but then: (
) -- what's all that blood
Joe   -- standing in the dusty mess is  -- shaken, but absolutely alive
Joe just
(') What's the blood
-- did someone get hurt--
But    -- he moves to the blood -- reaches below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out -- ( ) Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't touch -- what are you-- careful
Joe pulls out his  -
He brightens: It's my fake blood
It's fake
What is this stuff
27
'
Joe notices this and   self-consciously
calls out: Guys, what are these things
Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads off):  have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing    - which now litter the ground
Joe kneels, picks one up: Hey, don't touch it, what are you doing
They look like white Rubik's cubes or something
They're heavy like metal or something
There's like a billion of them
It's just a few inches per side, an
Behind them, having walked up the   of overturned train cars, Cary calls out: Guys, get up here
You can see everything from up here
They move up the mass of metal, revealing a It seems to stretch on forever
It is
Oh my God
Look at that
According to my Uncle Seth, an accident like this is exceptionally rare
It wasn't an accident
(turns away, eyes on the ) There was a truck
On the tracks
What
Driving on the tracks
Joe's seen it
He points
Chilled
There
28
Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is  - and lying in the overgrown grass
How can a pick-up truck derail a train
That's impossible
Obviously it isn't
from behind the  - as the kids approach from the wreckage
as they arrive at the truck and ; what they see makes Joe's heart pound -- they're stunned -- all of them
They just stop
Finally: holy shit
-- is that him
(covers her mouth)) -- yeah, it's him-- -- who
It is, yeah, for sure-- Holy shit
(') What
Who is that
: it's
-- 75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage
Alice moves closer -- scared and sad for him -- Dr
Woodward
No one can take their eyes off this as, : That's Dr
Woodward
The science guy
Biology
Honors biology
29
Wow
'm not in his class
We know
Shut up, Cary
Remember when Old Man Woodward took your Electronic Football
Yeah, he put it in the "dungeon," never gave it back
The dungeon
That trailer Woodward keeps in the school parking lot
Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her -- Dr
Woodward
But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he , his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was , that has now fallen onto the ground
Joe picks it up
: it's an   -- thin, off-white paper
They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward
We see     -- a  , from Nevada to Dayton -- and  written along the way
Map of the contiguous United States
-- what's the writing
(') -- dates and times
-- what's that line across
It's a schedule for the train
But a  has appeared:    -- before they can react, it     --
,   , in a : -- who-- who are you
30
They're all speechless for a moment
Finally, too loudly: Dr
Woodward
It's Charles Kaznyk
From fourth period
You've been in an accident
--    ,  -- They will kill you
Do not speak of this -- or you -- and your parents - - will die
We're on Joe's stunned face -- but   make him turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck, -- -- guys, look -- The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them: () -- we shouldn't be here-- The kids start moving away -- My dad will de-ball me
Let's get out of here
Now they're  --   getting closer
Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera
Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse -- she eyes the   getting closer: ,
Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the car, past a whining Charles
31
As the   , Joe runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice  the car into , - , narrowly avoids debris, then -- the   arrive --  -- their adrenaline pumping
One man who     , eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: He then looks to the ground in front of him
,    8
Nelec steps to it, picks it up
Looks at it
Then back up at the disappearing car
We        -- - The Buick speeds past
- Overlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera: Holy shit, that was insane
He had a gun
An actual physical gun
can't believe all that just happened here
Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like happens here
shattered now
My heart is pounding
That train could of killed us
( ) Are you okay
As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no
Oh shit, all the glass just fell out
It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling
32
Guys, keep it down
Joe: what was Woodward talking about
don't know,  don't know-- 'm never taking a train again
"You'll die, your parents will die," guys, that is not good information
Great, the focus ring just fell off
No one cares about your
Am  the only one shaking
'm also crying -- We can't tell anyone we were there - - we can't say a thing about it -- my dad cannot find out  took his car, do you guys hear me
It's okay-- no one's saying anything
None of us
(to his friends) Guys -- we're not gonna say anything -- are we
The boys all muster, "no's
" Joe turns sweetly to Alice
(') See
No one's gonna know
Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe
But they all stare off for a long beat
haunted
- The Buick
33
'  - as the Buick pulls up
The dusty boys pile out
They all kind of look at each other
What a night
Charles, who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod
Joe nods
Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out
Joe, this is yours
Joe goes to the window
Alice holds it out:
He takes it with: -- oh, thanks, should never have done this
She just drives away
Left there are Joe, Charles, Preston, Cary and Martin
They all kind of look at Alice go
'  - Joe in the bath
The quiet  of water as Joe holds the He relives the night: he mouths explosions
Remembers the fear
then he smiles
'  - Joe is   as if from a nightmare; Jack has awoken him, quickly bucking his holster, urgent: Gotta head in early -- -- okay-- Make sure you let Lucy out
--  will -- Pull back  to see Joe's room -- while in the is his desk, crowded with stuff
In focus, however, is the he took from the crash site
As the shot progresses, you may notice that     ; ,
You gonna -- what, you with Charles today
Yeah, 'll be with Charles-- Make sure you get the yard
-- okay,  will
Jack heads off
34
'  -  - : Joe fills Lucy's   with kibble
No dog
'  - Joe hurries across the street
'  - Typical Kaznyk bustle: Father busily packs sack lunches
Hot Jen eats cereal, reads a magazine
One Twin plays loudly against a wall
Peg keeps walking through the scene with clothes
Mother cooks, says to the other twin (in grimy ): Mom, come on
' No
You're not wearing that
No one in this house is wearing that
Compared to Debbie's these are long
' Just listen to your mother
can't wear these or go to Wendy's party
This is not fair
' Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa
Mom's racist
Are there anymore English muffins
' don't know, go check
' Peg, tell the twins to stop
They don't listen to me
35
' Hi, Joe
It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door
Morning, Mr
Kaznyk-- ' Hi, Joe
Did you hear about the train accident
Uh
no
' It's on the news
Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the , ;   of the wreck
The , "  -
" Joe sits beside Charles
They both watch, stunned, as a
appears on the , with the heading " ,
" : Can you believe this
No
It's on the news
That means it's real
(
) Meanwhile, local science teacher Thomas Woodward is still being treated by Air Force medical personnel after last night's train derailment
Woodward apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his pick-up truck, which was hit by the speeding train at approximately one Eighty-two train cars were thrown from the tracks in the derailment, the largest such accident in Ohio's history
The condition of Woodward, who has taught at Lillian Middle School for the past six years, remains unknown
36
Both stare at the train crash, stunned
Finally, quietly: Looks like a disaster movie, doesn't it
And we    , going from depressed and lost to : () oh my God, Joe
that's -- -- what
We can use this -- we can film it -- (starts to smile) -- you wanna go back
(turns to him) --okay-- Holy shit, that's mint
You're a total brain--
We gotta get the camera fixed and the film developed from last night--  gotta go steal some more money from my mom
,  -  - Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a , the massive   in the background -- If any of the footage from last night is usable, that means we need Alice to play the wife again
Yeah,  thought she was good
She was mint, but she's never gonna do it
think she will
37
There's no way
You heard what she said
But that was before the new pages, right
You honestly think she cares about the scenes
,  -   - from the town's   -- Joe and Charles ride their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large drive past, we may note the Airman in the passenger seat    with a handheld device
Man, did you hear what she said last night
" never should have done this
" Dude, she was totally wigged
Yes, she was, we all were
Did you see her face
Yeah,  saw her face
Man, what's wrong with you
Nothing
think she's going to do it
They park their bikes outside    -
- The book opens -- Joe's finger goes down -- finds " " and the phone number
We're in: 38
- - Joe at the counter,    , Charles behind him with , the 19-year-old, dark-haired, bearded salesman with a big collared button-down shirt
Lens is cracked
Focus ring broke
() Ya think it's fixable
Joe  Alice's phone number
think it's cheaper to buy a new one
( ) We're screwed, man, it's over
(
) We can use my dad's camera -- it's got sound and-- Hello
Alice-- hi, it's Joe
Lamb
As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film: (
) Hi
So we have some new scenes
For the movie
We were hoping you'd be in `em
(
) Oh-- no
No, 'm done with that
Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "  "  8 film , speaking in a soft voice: Really
`Cause these are really good scenes
Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny
We need this developed as soon as possible -- can you do overnight
39
Asshole, no one can do overnight
You wanna buy some pot
Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything
no, thank you
You guys are weak
(
) 'm watching the crash on the news
Yeah,  know,  saw it
() Are you okay
Well, what's the fastest you can do
can make it a rush, you get the film back in three days-- what's your sister up to
The hot one, not the other one
don't know
(
) should go
(
) -- wait, hold on -- lemme come over and show you the pages, okay
'll be right there
No, d-- '  - Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods
Joe with Alice at her front door
She seems unnerved: don't care what Charles wants-- said no on the phone
40
You totally did, that's true, know, but-- And now you're at my house
am, which-- under normal conditions  would nev-- It's too weird after last night-- don't understand how you guys can keep working on your stupid movie, really don't
We have to-- while the crash is still there
(waits, anxious, then, :) please
(she considers, then:) No
But Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up
(') You should go
Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery bag
He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches: What's this
He was just inviting me to a party
Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but at the same time, can barely look at him: She's not going to your party
Yessir
Louis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare
41
You know better than this
She nods, uncomfortable
Louis turns to Joe: (') You get outta her
You go home and don't come back,  don't wanna see you
Louis goes back inside
Alice follows, turns to Joe
As awkward moment between them
Then, quietly, conflicted: 'll do it
-- what
She closes the door
Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy
Off his smile, we   :
- Martin -- as Detective Hathaway --    -- shooting , dressed in a dirty suit, as a man -- his eyes     -- and as he is , he       -- and he
We then find , behind his camera, yelling out: That was mint
So good
And it looked huge with the train
Wow
Joe: go reload the cap gun
-- , rising   , thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble
Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's dad's   on tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered
, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera
Beyond them, in the valley, the seems to go forever
,  and
buzz in the distant sky
Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash
During all this: We'll get the other direction next - - Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go a little faster next time
42
'll try, but 'm still crying about last night,  feel like 'm crazy
Cary sits, pulls off the -    that were covering his closed eyes
Did it really look good
My death
as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the train, haunted
Quiet: what do you think happened
Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well
You mean why he crashed the train
just got a horrible feeling
Martin has arrives there too
Preston too: Anyone else still shaking from the crash
got in my parents' bed last night
Haven't done that since was eleven
Joe suddenly    , back toward the camera
(') did  just insult him
Joe grabs the camera, near Charles: -- dude, what are you doing
Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the lens -- uses the  -- and   '  -- the , -- he  from
Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat, finally standing up, looking out at the crash: 43
That whole thing's an Air Force train
-- what
- The kids sit at a table at the window
The   is across the street
They're talking excitedly but quietly: make models-- plastic ones-- you know, glue `em, paint `em-- And he's not embarrassed by that
Looks who's talking, Math Camp
is there, delivering more  -- Thanks, could  have a coffee, please
Cream on the side
(really
) Sure
She heads off
Cary smiles at Alice
He is so sophisticated
Shut up,  like coffee
No one likes coffee
Keep going
Air Force trains -- even models -- have these hooks
Ooo
Ooo ooo ooo
They do -- for when their train cars are put on transport ships
44
Every car in that crash had hooks, every one
Joe: stop talking about it
Am  the only one who doesn't understand what this all means
Probably, Smartin
Shut up,  don't like that-- Dr
Woodward had that map
He drove onto the tracks
Maybe there was something-- -- he wanted to destroy, he wanted to destroy
yeah
Please shut up, all of you
say he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself
He had a gun, why not use that
There are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide: pills, -- Pussy, stop pulling the fries away
ordered these for a reason
-- he gets all possessive with his fries, it's so annoying
(') You could jump from a building
Fall down stairs
Well, that's not really effective
45
So, if it's Air Force, what would the Air Force have on a train
( ) You heard what the Old Man said, we can't talk about this
(to waitress, with coffee) -- thank you, very much
Drowning, hari kari, also known as seppuku--
Excuse me, could we please get another order of fries because my friend here is fat
Funny, Chompers, at least  don't use a booster seat
What was your teacher even talking about
Who are we supposed to be afraid of anyway
don't wanna find out -- guys, we gotta forget we were there
Joe, seriously
you really wanna take a chance that something could happen to your dad, too
This lands for Joe -- for all of them -- as we  : - The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile
Hundreds of work to clean up fast
truck   , taking us to Jack and Nelec, who  together amid the debris
Choppers land and take off in the background: Yes,  understand, this crash has caused a whole mess of confusion
46
As you can expect, the local authorities are trying to figure out just what happened here as well as how to help you out
It's under control
It'll be a very fast clean-up
Colonel, there isn't anything should know, is there
Not that  can think of, Deputy understand you have concerns about our cargo
'd like to see that manifest, yes
That's not going to be possible
Colonel, 've got a lot of people in my town that are gonna want to know what's taking place
-- what town is that
Lillian
Deputy, if you're asking me if we had any dangerous property on board this train,  can assure you the answer's no
Colonel
Excuse me
Jack looks at Nelec -- not quite believing him
47
- Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking up reports from his desk, on his way out
They gave me the run around for two hours before  was allowed to talk to anyone
'd say they have their hands full, wouldn't you
Nelec -- the Colonel -- refused to show me their manifest, said they were carrying mostly airplane parts- It's Air Force, Jack
Airplane parts sorta make sense
Sheriff, 'm telling you, there's something else going on -- they're taking molds of tire tracks -- now why would they be doing that
Who are they looking for
And they're packing these weird little cubes into crates and they're-- Weird little cubes
--yeah, into these red trucks, dozens of these trucks -- and 'm telling you, they're scrambling to get the hell outta there-- 'd say that's a good thing, wouldn't you
Sheriff,  think you need to go check it out
And  think you need a break
() Jack, 've been telling you this since Elizabeth
() 48
(') You're a good deputy
But you need to take a vacation
() Go home
Take off your uniform
Go fishing
And give your son a hug
Pruitt walks off
Jack, unsettled, watches him go
- -- they're fingers on a , a sitting beside them
to 23-year-old , who digs the  he's listening to
He is alone in the station store
Behind him, 60-year-old   enters
Hey Breen, 'm not sure Edie's paying you to listen to the radio
Breen doesn't respond
The sheriff throws a candy bar at him
(') Breen
Breen pulls off the headphones
Hey, Sheriff
What's that
Walkman
It's like a stereo, play your own cassette tapes
( ) You wanna try it
(pays for the candy bars) don't think so
Kids walking around with their own stereos
Just what we need
It's a slippery slope
He exits the store
yessir
Pruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again
49
- We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past earlier
Pruitt's   filling up, the only car here
High overhead, a yellow  sign  atop a tall pole near the road
Pruitt crosses to his car
Peels the candy bar
Hearing something, he turns -- a of the '  white  on black; the gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is -- he    -- ,  -- - Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear ) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the squad car     as if the , , as the back to the pavement --   -- - Gas  onto the asphalt,   , horrible, -- - '   as Breen      off the headphones: the hell was that
He looks outside -- sees the car -- shattered windows
Confused, he heads out -- - Breen moves tentatively toward the   -- quickly glances for Pruitt, who's missing
He gets close to the car, confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the pump and replaces it
His heart pounds as he starts for the building -- but     -- falls hard -- looks up -- sees whatever's coming for him --  as he gets to his feet and     -- - Breen   -- we're   as behind him: An       and -- 50
- -- where the turning, lit         -- we can only    happening inside the station until the sign    -- everything inside looks like it's in a  -- '  - -- and Breen's as the turning Kelvin sign     -- as the ,    : -   -
It's , and she's becoming a
We are: '  - Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple  -
Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones
In the background, the other kids prepare to film
He hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed
Where'd you learn how to do this
Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook
She nods
Whatever
Charles is suddenly there, with Cary: Hey
So 'm gonna need more shots of the train crash, obviously-- you know that train model you made
Can we blow it up and film it
Joe doesn't want to do this at all
But
sure
Mint
Gnarly
Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions
Alice looks at him knowingly
(') don't care, they can blow it up
can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid
() () 51
(') You wanna see it
Later
The
train
My train model
The train made
The      --   -- then back on
That's like the third time Dude
Bitchen
that's happened
So how am  supposed to be a zombie
Oh
Just be a lifeless ghoul
Someone with no soul, dead eyes
Scary
'you ever have Mrs
Mullin
For English
Yeah-- -- like her
But hungry, like hungry for human flesh
To make them turn into zombies, because that's what zombies do
Alice considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her best zombie
Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good
(') Oh my God
That's really good
And Alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance
Or is this something else--
And she , which makes Joe go still -- a shiver down his spine -- he's never felt anything like this in his life
And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's smiling
He doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool
(') not bad
- We're    ,     --  as Jack, and
come out here
We pass and    to the Sheriff Pruitt dropped
52
-- Careful, there was a gas spill
don't even know how much fuel 've lost
-- You don't seem to be asking a lot of questions
-- Give this man some time, Mr
Blakely
He's just the Deputy, he's not the Sheriff
Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19
Jack pulls out a handkerchief, lifts the fun --    the engraved initials "
"
He opens the cylinder to check if it had been fired
No squad car here
Jack checks out the broken as he makes a walkie call: (') think this is most likely a bear attack
Remember when  said you talk too much
Well, this is the time
Vicky, ya heard from Sheriff Pruitt this morning
(
) Negative, still no word
Vicky,  need you to have Dayton send a  unit out to Edie's
You put out an  on the Sheriff and Breen Haskell -- send units to their houses immediately
You copy all of that
(
) copy
And Jack, we're getting a lot of unusual calls
what kind of unusual calls
53
- Angry , 65,     : ,  --   , Jack follows: Never seen this kinda thing before
Izzy opens   :
(') What the hell am  supposed to do
Insurance company thought  was joking with him
Look at my Bonneville here-- look at this got a call about this car yesterday
What am  going to tell the customer
--
Having trouble with anyone lately, Izzy
was thinking, you should talk to Louis Dainard
didn't help him out with financing last year, wouldn't be surprised if this was-- some sorta sick retribution
As Jack heads back to his car,   move to him, walk with him,  : -- Some strange shit has been -- d'you call the station going on
My antenna's gone-- yet
You need to call the our dog is gone, he hasn't station
And file a report, come home this morning -- before anything can be done Jack, my lights keep going on about it
And then we can and off
Counting on you, take care of these things
If Jack
you do that for me,  promise you, 'll handle it myself
He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how stressed he is
He stops, noticing , ,  atop the trucks, and the men inside seemingly scanning the area
Jack is disturbed by this
54
Joe rides along a hillside
Parks his bike
Walks toward the edge

He stops to reveal the town of Lillian

We're on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something he sees makes him stop
He slowly takes a step back
Then another

Then we see the  --    -- " " It's  in them
Joe is so stunned, he doesn't notice the   that pass in the background behind him
'  -  - -: back door opens, Joe enters
on the table
Jack and four   in the living room, smoking, reviewing  , marking , taking notes --     '  -- We need more help around here
We've got four men on the Pruitt case alone
We've called into Dayton, they'll be out in the ---- 55
That's not enough
People don't feel safe here -- and you know why
`Cause they're not-- The officers agree
Joe moves into the doorway where his dad and other convene
(') -- the Air Force isn't answering a damn question: they've got trucks at Woodward's house, looking for -- They've got trucks all over town
saw a guy riding shotgun in one of those trucks -- had some kind of scanner in his hand -- --like a Geiger counter or -- know
They're saying it's just clean-up at the train crash, but they're taking molds of tire tracks
Which means they're looking for someone-- now what's that about
Joe has heard this and    -- the men all turn, silent
Joe, on the spot: -- have you
seen Lucy
'm sure she's around
put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there
-- oh--  ate those
Sorry, Kid-- That's
okay, 'll find a-- Then the    -- the men react -- it -- Jack grabs his radio a the  : 56

Get water and power out there now
'   - Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room, watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie talkie
So the Air Force is looking for a car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're taking tire prints from the crash site
Over
don't wanna hear about it
They could be monitoring us right now
Jesus, shut up
Over
( ) And the military's at Woodward's house
Looking for his research
Whatever that means
Joe -- Are you gonna come help me tomorrow or not
need you to make Alice a zombie again
And Joe tries to snap himself out of it
But is disturbed

Glances at the power line
Doesn't understand what he sees --
He radios in: This is Rooney at Mary-10, was there re-routing on this line

In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls
He begins ; a   shows him rising to the bare utility pole
When Rooney finally gets to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer
After a moment, though, he stops

He looks over toward the Except it's mostly hidden by the trees

Twenty microwave ovens: gone from my inventory

The town  its approval -- Jack, impotent, tries: Mrs
Babbit,  don't believe the Russians have anything to do with what's happening in town-- but 'm calling the curfew because w-- Until you can tell me who's messing with us,  say it's the Soviets and we're at war
like you, Jack, but we need Sheriff Pruitt back
The town  in agreement -- We have good people working on that
Mr
McCandless
short, bald man of 65,
speaks: Since Wednesday morning, my Ham radio's been a mess -- all sorts of frequencies  like to scan
Some kind of buzz modulation-- have you found that

McCandless, can  speak with you for a moment, privately
The Mayor takes over as Jack has a   with Mr

Patty, get in touch with Vicky

No, sir,  haven't seen him
There's a sink hole in my garage
It almost sank a foot
Hey Tom
Tom, have you seen Milner

No

Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner with a descrambler don't you
Voice inverter, yeah

Whatever, get it down and set it up for me
What is this

Hey -- he was at my house yesterday morning, are you aware of that

And so it my daughter
Louis heads out --     he turns, , and as that door opens, we  : '  - The door opens of his messy, motherless room
Joe and Alice enter
He could not be more self-conscious
He moves stacks of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of underwear and socks
He closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair
She looks around sa she enters
The light dim, intimate
Oh gawd,  didn't clean up
Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to the floor;     spill out and we get a of some "-" and other "-" in
Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his : -- you made all these
62
Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame
watched that one on
--- Alice sits on the bed
Joe takes the -
She moves close: (') This is the train they wanna destroy
Alice hold it
Joe watches her
She really looks at it
it looks real
(beat, studies) It looks so old
That's dry brush technique
(off her look) After you've painted the base color, you take something like
(grabs up Testors bottle) Euro Gray
Her face is so close to his
Her hair touches his ear
Euro Gray
There are so many different grays, it's crazy
And you pour a little onto like a paper plate
Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush
Then you make small brush strokes on the model
Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be
Around the wheels
Or where the doors would slide
Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here,  used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before
Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off
Lost in thought, he looks at her
Suddenly self-conscious
63
What was that necklace
(off his awkward stare) The one you were holding at the train crash
Was it your mom's
It takes him a beat
Finally: My dad gave it to her the day  was born
She wears it all the time
Used to
() It was bad, how she-- died and stuff, but they got the necklace back
So
Their tension   an out of breath Charles: Guys, what the hell
No one knew where you were
We're sitting right here
You gotta be the soldier
thought you were calling Evan
Evan blew us off, he's a pussy
( ) Excuse me
It's okay
You gotta do it
You're the only one
- '  - Jack with   (24): The hell do you mean you "found my dog in Brookville
" That's a -- 64
Lucy-- that's where she is
We've gotten nearly thirty calls from people who have found local dogs
Thing is, the calls coming in aren't local
Tally puts a  on his desk -- 28  in a , anywhere from a 20 to 150  ,
(') It's like they all just
ran away, every direction
Jack is stunned
- Officer Rosko at his desk, with a  , a   at his desk beside a --
He takes notes: It's not her
She never's disappeared before
Alright
Now what does she look like
She's got dark hair, it was in rollers
Do you know what rollers are
Yes,  know what rollers are
She went to her car-- Suddenly a    from the
Rosko quickly hits  on the reel-to-reel -- -- He grabs speaker, turns the volume knob, puts the speaker close to the tape recorder, turns on recorder

Maybe they don't erations

Maybe they're not Air Force
What's he say
Operation what
--: Walking Distance
'  - parked everywhere
Personnel removing boxes from the house, packing it all up
But out front, Joe is dressed as an Airman, performing with Martin, dressed as the detective
Military trucks surround the house
Hathaway is with a : came as soon as  could, what's happening here
Military police investigation
It was a suicide
Suicide
Who was it
former Air Force officer
He called me last night, said he had a secret that he couldn't keep any longer
Officer Joe hands Hathaway a
Hathaway looks at it
66
What's this
He worked at Romero Chemical
He found out some things the company's been doing
After what you told me at the bar,  thought you should know
Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him: () Are we gonna get in trouble here--
(-) Shhhh
Production value
It's for the movie
This proves it
They knew, the company knew
Thank you so much for the information
We just made the discovery ourselves
You understand this is top secret
Of course
would never have given you this information if you and  hadn't served together in Vietnam
As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching Joe, smiling
But then she sees something that disturbs her: Jack's  pulls up
'  - dozen  go through     of documents
Books and personal belongings are put into boxes, taken from the house
Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who reviews a folder
Nothing so far-- 67
How much more is there
Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe more
What, more tax returns
It's here somewhere
If we can't find it, Woodward'll tell us where it is
But Nelec has seen something outside:
the hell's that
looks like kids making a movie
Behind them, a , showing the street, where Jack insists Joe get into the car
Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car
'  - As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy
He moves toward Joe and his friends: Joe
( ) Hey, Mr
Lamb
Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from Charles and saying firmly, to Joe: Get in the car
Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice -- he's taken back to the squad car -- Uh-- Mr
Lamb
That's your camera, but technically, that's my film-- 68
Jack  the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and  that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe in the back
Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him: would like to help you out deputy
really would
But we operate on a need to know basis
Why are your trucks sweeping the town
We'll be out of your way shortly
Then 'm sure you wouldn't mind me contacting
Talk to some friends about "Walking Distance
" This lands on Nelec
(') All right
We'll do it that way
Jack heads off
Deputy
( ) Let's talk
Just not here
Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec
- Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again
Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a "
" Look
Alice watches him sympathetically
She mouths to him a guilty, "
is it me
" And Joe shakes his head: "No
" But we -- and she -- know better
'  - The squad car pulls up
Jack gets out, Joe follows -- : 69
'  - Door opens
Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him
Joe closes the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained: This is new
All this
For the both of us
Dealing with-- all this, just us
So 'm going to make this as clear and simple as  can: You're not friends with Alice Dainard
When  say no,  don't mean maybe
don't mean yes mean no
've known Louis Dainard for alotta years-- he's been nothing but trouble
Your mother used to say he's not a bad guy, he just needs a chance, he's just sad - - well  tried to be good to him, but  can't
Not anymore
will not allow him or his daughter in this house
will not allow you spending time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you're doing
'
hope we're clear
Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says: We're not clear
Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds -- What'd you say
We're not clear
You and  aren't clear about anything
We couldn't be less clear
Joseph Francis Lamb-- () Just `cause mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me
You don't
You don't know about Alice either -- she's kind
70
'm not having this discussion with you--
She's  to me
don't care what she is
Her father is a selfish, irresponsible son-of-a-bitch
Jack moves  to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back -- Jack is fucking intense: (') You listen to me, 've got twelve thousand people in this town that are scared out of their minds-- they've got one person they can rely on -- it used to be someone else, but now it's just me
Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying
And to whom he's saying it
But somehow, in this moment, he can't be a better father than law officer
Not yet
More upset at himself than Joe, he heads out
- Joe rides    --   --
- Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave
Holds her , staring at it
He's just come here for comfort
But then -- a  -- and Joe turns
Deep and low, in the distance
Joe is motionless
He stands, pulls out his flashlight -- aims the beam down   , toward the big '  in the distance
Another ,   -- then a high pitch , like and Joe backs up, nervous
Another odd sound -- then -- which   : - Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield
71
- Jack's car pulls up
He gets out of the car
Suddenly the three large  '    -- all aimed at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see -- Hello--
And now  are seen of , holding and aiming Then, a  over a  : (
) Drop your weapons
Put your hands on the car
--'m here to see Colonel Nelec
He told me to meet him here
(
) You're under military arrest
Drop your weapons
'
- Past an  and medical machinery
He's looking at someone we don't yet see
In the background, Overmyer stands, watching
Nelec is quiet, simple: don't want any more trouble
Do you
Now we see who he's talking to
'
Battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant
(') We've been going through your belongings, looking for evidence
Of what you knew, how you knew it
and who else might know
() remember you
In the lab
And recall we didn't see eye to eye, but that's no excuse for doing what you did here
72
Dr
Woodward swallows
Feels that his time on Earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here
By the door, Overmyer is quietly putting on his
(') So in the spirit of moving forward and avoiding more trouble, tell us where you put your research
know you had someone document the crash that night
Tell me who that was and 'll help you,  swear to God
On my mother's life -- if you help us now, we will take care of you
've seen what happens, Mr
Nelec, when you take care of people
--'m going to bait him
'm going to catch him
He's in me, you know
As  am in him
So when you see him next, as 'm sure you will
'll be watching you, too
Nelec offers a vague, searching smile
But Woodward will not - - not ever -- relent
So
Nelec moves to the door, he remains , his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the bed
' , : '  - Joe sleeps, power still out
Then, a
He wakes up
Another
His window
He moves to it
Opens it
It's Alice
Joe is half asleep, but also stunned
Very quietly: -- are you-- were you sleeping
Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay
Yeah
() Oh, you wanna come in
73
And Alice climbs in
Joe sits on the floor
Alice does too
It's odd and silent for a moment
Power's still out
Room's still messy
was in bed, couldn't sleep
() Thinking
wanted to tell you something, before tomorrow -- Don't let Charles blow up your train
Joe stares, amazed at her
(') don't think it's right, do you know he's your friend, but he's so -- He can be sorta li-- 've known him since Kindergarten, though-- He shouldn't always get what he wants
mean, who always gets what they want
--  know  don't know you at all
Even though
it sort of feels like  do
() Do you not
feel like that
-- no,  totally do, 'm just
sort of in shock at this whole -- And the   -- Joe's   goes on behind him -- but more chilling, the  comes back on; the Joe crawls to the projector to stop it -- but: -- no, keep it-- please -- Alice moves closer to the screen
Joe sits behind her
She watches the film
Can't take her eyes away
(') is that her
74
yeah
And as Alice watches, we
as tears start to fill her eyes
Behind her, at a near : (') it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here
(beat, lost in it) she used to look at me, this way
like really look
And just
knew  was there
That existed
tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that
Finally, quietly: He drank that morning
My dad
() He missed his shift
(beat, hard) Your mom took it for him
The day of the accident
Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned
Finally, eyes wet, Alice turns to Joe
(') know he wishes it was him
Instead of her
( ) and sometimes  wish it was, too
Joe just stares at her
heartsick and speechless
Finally: Don't say that
() He's your dad
Just then, the  8 movie : the film
Joe turns off the projector -- but a
sort of -
Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound remains
Then they look: , sitting on his desk
Joe and Alice move to it
He turns on his desk lamp
The cube , almost imperceptibly
-- has this--
-- no
75
Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube -- the thing
They are amazed
They get  -- eyes at desk level -- the -- he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube   - -    --     , -
She screams -- they both fall to the floor,  --    Joe, his heart pounding
He moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the
'  - Alice enters the dark house quietly
She steps carefully toward her room, when -- (
) Morning
His voice makes her
She turns: sitting in the dark, in an armchair, is her father
He's awake
And drunk
(') You wanna tell me where you were
Or you want me to tell you
tense beat, her mind races
Breathe, Alice, just breathe
(') Sit down
should go to bed
wanna talk to you
said sit down
don't want to sit down
Then go
Be just like your mother and leave
This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house
(') ,
76
'  - - Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a past the factory and over the hills
The front door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable: But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his -- starts it up --    and goes after her -- - - Alice  , she wants to escape everywhere
No cars on the street, no people
block behind her, : a turns onto the road
Her father's car -- she makes a turn -- - - We're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk -- - - Alice makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals hard, crying and hyperventilating -- '
Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car ,
- - Alice  -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back
- - Louis is bleeding
Badly hurt
He adjusts himself -- painfully -- then looks into the - --

Louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and his door is   -- he goes for the passenger door -- - - -- when Louis finally gets out -- he runs from his car -- stumbling drunk and bleeding -- , -- But all that's there is her bike -- and before he can even get that far, Louis   onto the pavement, crying, a drunken, horrified, shocked, battered

We   in a of a field at night
Then a of   standing in the field
But  stands out front, wearing a
And suddenly the quiet is broken by the
,    as the flames  in the tall, dry grass
Over the radio: Firelight is 0500 hours
Operation Walking Distance is in effect
- minus four hours until evacuation
Evacuation is -minus four hours
78
,  - The distant factory, the even more distant mountains, and an ominous    -- a far-off  is
Then: (
) Why are you not reacting
- - Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood
( ) That thing went through my wall
told you not to pick it up in the first place
What are you so angry about
That 'm not going to let you blow up my train
That's part of it
Juts a part
Donny's returned with a
red "" stamp on it
He gives Charles his change: Tall your sister Donny from Olsen's broke up with Karen, that shit ended a week ago
Charles heads off -- Joe follows
- - As Charles rides off with the film, Joe follows -- and we along the   as they go -- What's your problem
My whole movie's a disaster `cause of you
know, my dad's being a turkey
79
Whatever
We're still gonna finish your movie
It's not about the movie
What are you talking about
Of course it is
Just forget it
Why
There's nothing wrong-- As we   , we arrive at the top of the , where         -- unseen from the street
In the distance, -- '  - As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house: 'll get the camera back,  know where my dad put it -- We can still make the festival
It's not about the movie
Then what is it about
Jesus, you don't even get it do you
It's obvious
What's obvious
Gawd, you're a dumb ass
80
Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside
Joe follows
'  - Charles threads the film into the projector
That night of the crash, you started getting all weird
-- what
Like Mr
Attitude all of a sudden
Your movie was over
That's what you said
You were upset
gave you a camera
helped you
Don't pretend like you did it for me
You didn't do it for me and you know it
What's your problem
Charles   ,    -- It was never about me
It was always about Alice
And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: , from the night of the train crash
The scene plays as they filmed it: John
don't like it
This case
These murders
What am  supposed to do, go to Michigan with you
as Joe and Charles argue: Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie
81
Not so you could fall in love with her
Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this
What do you even care what  think about Alice
Because  like her
That's why
That's why  asked her in the first place
So  could get to know her, not
-- wait, you like Alice Dainard
You're such an idiot
(from Charles' movie) Guys, look out
They watch for a moment as the    -- but it's  ,  , the camera picks up almost nothing
Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially
Look at all that smoke
We can't use any of this
And you won't even let me blow up your train
Everything's bogus
We can make another train and blow that one up
Joe moves forward
Part of the film   , too
(') do like her
Sorry about that
Shut up
It's okay
() That's not even what bothers me
(beat, finally, sad) It's that she likes you too
That really bothers me
dunno
82
But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- : Charles
know it's stupid
What would she ever like me
haven't leaned out yet, which the doctor says is gonna -- But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen -- Charles looks too --     : through the --   --   -- ,    -- what the hell is it
--    , -- we only see the  as it clears frame -- (') -- Joe, what the hell--
' -- then from outside:     , The boys look at each other -- afraid
- as they : - of the neighborhood -- in the distance: ,    drive
coming from their homes in the -: confusion and talk, more
Finally, as we  ,     , trying to make sense of this -- Joe calls to a passing adult,
: Mr
Harkin
What's going on
Evacuation
The fire
Mr
Harkin  -- Joe turns to look -- we : ,
of  busses  -- -- carrying all the belongings they can
Others quickly   , strapping belongings to the roof
Over all this: 83
(
) -- Due to a wildfire that is raging out of control and threatening to reach the Lillian Chemical Plant-- Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost
amid the madness
(
) (') -- an evacuation has been called for your safety
Please remain calm and as you board the bus
- Joe and Charles get on, frightened and uncomfortable
They sit
Outside: the madness of the evac -- they scan the crowd
You see your family anywhere
-- no, you see your dad
-- no

' Charles, Charles -- sweetheart, are you okay
went back to the house and you were gone
They made us get on the bus
' Hi, Joe
Hi

You gonna tell him about that thing
Yeah
' Come back if you can't find him
He heads off

Walkie  and as  check their wrist bands
Joe passes an   and : --  need to go back to my -- sir, the town is sealed house,  left some medication off -- no one is allowed back that my wife needs-- -- you can talk to the nurses -- no, we can't get it here -- the town must stay anywhere else,  need to go empty until we've been given back-- the all-clear-- the
so far
- lies in a cot in the  , fifty beds transferred from the hospital
Louis stares off, head bandaged, eyes open,   , like a man as tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is
Find Joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally sees Louis and hurries to him
85
Mr
Dainard, it's Joe Lamb
know you don't like me sir, and 'm sorry about that-- but 'm looking for my dad-- And Louis    and pulls him close
In a voice desperate and heartsick, he says: It took her
(long beat, sotto) what
It took her
saw it
It was
something
so
big, like nothing -- it was-- and no one
no one believes me
() no one believes me-- they just keep giving me pills
It took her
Joe, it took Alice
no one believes me
Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this --  : believe you
And Louis looks at him with hope -- (
) (') It took Alice
, assembled around a set of cots
That thing took her--
-- are you shitting me
(') Guys,
They look at him like he's from Uranus
Back where
To do what
(') Back to town -- to find Alice -- we have to find her-- 86
She's dead, if it took her, she-- -- don't say that
Wait a minute -- first of all, want to live
Okay
'm going whether you come or not-- which  really hope you do
(pats his backpack) 've got six tons of explosives in here, let's find that thing and blow it to shit
- Jen, Charles' hot sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia House Records choices
Charles is in her face
As if 'm gonna help you
Do this for me and 'll babysit the twins next week so you can go to Wendy's stupid party
Jen suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously
(') am not shitting you
You can't ask me any questions though
You can't tell anyone
'm serious
No one
does it have to be him
Yes or no, you ugly freak
'm about to rescind the offer
- Jen looks   , vulnerable, but seductive: 87
This whole evacuation thing's freaking me out
Making me rethink my priorities
Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back
Now we see Donny, looking
Utterly stunned
-- we totally could
asked Charles about you, and he said you're a great guy-- totally am
Will you hate me if  start our relationship by asking a favor
- as Donny moves through  , Joe, Charles, Cary and Martin keeping up: So there are rules to being in my car, okay
Where the hell are we going anyway
We're going to the school to open the trailer Woodward had in the parking lot
bet that's where he keeps his research
The boys duck as  pass by
What research
We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing so we can find it
And that's how we're gonna save Alice
88
Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery and no one touches the , gottit
You think Woodward's got information about that thing in the dungeon
Why else are there padlocks on the door
( ) We're going to the school
When did this one get so bossy

Jack, up all night and pissed off, but bored being pissed off,    : Hey
gotta take a leak
What am supposed to do, piss in here

Soldier with the semi-auto behind him, aimed at his back
As Jack passes an open door, he spies an empty office -- through the window on the tarmac are a few  , a handful of airmen
Jack's mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of the hall -- Jack turns: So am  going in alone or are y--

: 89
- as he  through the dark building -- oh shit -- he comes to a stop, back against the wall -- but on his face: ' ,

Charles, Cary and Martin in back
Well, so guys, if the Air Force has already searches Woodward's house, wouldn't they've already searched the classroom too
Hay Donny, this car is gnarly
90
was thinking about that too
Maybe the classroom, but not the dungeon
Yeah, Woodward has all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon
Where's the dungeon
Shut up
What kind of music does she like
Your sister
don't care
Disco  guess
could get back into disco
We shouldn't take River Road, they had a roadblock
Dork
saw it
Observe
Donny  the steering wheel -- he turns onto a   -- the car  away from camera -- - Donny's car pulls up, lights go off
The kids pile out -- So what,  wait here like a douche
Yes
Thank you very much
Do you have a tire iron
- of the boys
They move fast across the alley, to a  locked with -- the
91
Joe tries  the locks off with the tire iron -- it doesn't budge
Joe, let me try -- let me try
Joe hands the tire iron to Charles -- he tries -- nothing
As Martin grabs the tire iron: (') Joe, this is impossible, man
Martin breaks off the  --
(') -- loosened it for you
Now we    -- we're    as it opens -- the boys look    -- their faces say it all:
-- Look at all this junk
He's got movies in here
- The boys -- with  -- turn a corner -- hurry down the hall -- cannot believe we're breaking into school, who does that
No one does that-- idiots do that-- The boys      and enter

Charles threads the film
Dr
Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellis Air Base in 1963 because of "subversive conduct," whatever that is
92
Joe holds up a 20-year-old  of
Among them is 50-year-old : Dude, check it out
Old Man Woodward
Back when he was like Middle-Aged Man Woodward

Joe is suddenly hopeful: why--
But just as he's spoken, a , - The    , Charles , hurt -- At the front of the bus,   --   , -- - The bus was hit   it rides for a moment -- - The   struggles with the wheel -- 98

Overmyer is stunned for a moment, but hides it well: Yessir
Open the door
Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the controls: the door   as it opens

In the back, the boys are all frozen for a moment, watching
Overmyer moves for the door
Five feet away from the door, he stops, turns back to Nelec: Is there anywhere in particul-- -- -- the Driver  -- the thing  , who --   -- the projectile , , ,      ,   , --         -- Joe   -- Behind him, Martin

-- you guys okay
--  wanna go home so bad -- Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the handle -- but it's never gonna open
On the  side of the glass, Nelec rights himself, momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily, he moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either
And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his fate
Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face -- to silently -- in a look -- repent
Instantly, Joe knows he's about to watch this man's life end
Nelec turns -- the creature is  the bus door -- -- to make it
So it can get inside
The Driver's    -- he's trying to get out, but cannot -- is  -- as

Up there, there's broken glass -- -- here, use me, 'm strong
Lemme get on your shoulders

The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's fallen -
He grabs it and scampers back to the glass as
Pieces of metal and glass  like ice chips as the creature violently  the bus door opening-- On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick window -- which he must  --   to get out -- essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse
Using both fists, Joe  the window

Come on, you
With all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile,
The creature  the bus door --  it wider like a sardine can --        , ,
He makes a  on his walkie: This is Nelec -- use the big guns
Whatever happens to me, you take it down, you kill him -- -- and he drops the walkie and   -- the behind the glass with the boys as Joe hits the glass again --  -- a  of glass -- You can do it
Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec That was never really hope anyway
Joe hits again and
The window
Glass chunks   on the boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the -- Go
Joe, move
With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus
And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first Joe, then Charles (      : "You gotta lose some weight --" " know
"), Then Cary, and Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear and turn back for a moment -- Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature - ,  , And as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge -- Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified: -- it was my turn once

They're sort of stunned

Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt -- suddenly   , acting the role of Air Force: Hey fellas, 've got orders from Colonel Nelec to personally transport this man to base

think we should go
No--
No, look
The car : It's
He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them: Ho ho
You dorks are alive didn't know

We need to get back to town
Hop in, man
But you should know: am massively stoned right now
You want me to drive

Woodward said it's subterranean-- think  know where it-- What's that

Hey

Drugs are so bad
Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and  across the street, zig-zagging between the enormous   -- 106

Surface to air, radar -- all of them
It's a mess out here, sir
Soldier hurries off

An     -- the boys  as they run -- and     -- four boys racing through a neighborhood under siege -- power   -- and some explosions are much closer than others -- another and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside -- - -- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark space by the   emanating from the windows
They're all out of breath in a strange  -- You guys see those explosions

Oh, Kathy's cool

Another fucking   -- sound of   -- and the creature  -- 107
And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window -- Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts: Come on, guys, let's go
Come on
Joe runs -- the others follow -- Where we going
To the cemetery-- But as they get to the living room a They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a sudden -- his leg  by concrete
If there's good news here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions getting further away
But there's blood and Martin is in real pain
What happened to my leg
It hurts
Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone sticking out of your leg
There's a hole in the house
Joe, gimme that thing on the curtains
Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a  in it;   can be seen driving past outside
Joe hands Charles the thick fabric tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it around Martin's leg, tight -- 'm gonna go find Alice-- you have to stay with Martin
Charles looks at Martin -- can't argue
Says, sincerely: you gonna be okay without me
(a meaningful beat) yeah
108
Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary: 'm not staying with the girls
God, Cary
Shut up
Calm down
Oh, my leg hurts
Come on, Cary, we gotta go
Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off -- This is going to hurt
Martin screams

Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated
The only lone figures in town

It's dirt
Why is there dirt in these windows
Help me, on three

The two begin  the door together -- on three -- one -- two --
Again and again, until finally the door -- and they almost   -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking -- the entire floor of the shed has been --     , dirt , caked along the sides of the structure

It's awkward
But not angry
Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad: came to your house that day
To tell you that  never meant to hurt anyone
Swear to God

About what happened to your wife
Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road beat
Finally: It was an accident

Makeshift   provide some light; a number of other are visible from here, too
Joe and Cary look at the space in disbelief
What is this
We're under the water tower

Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt
Cary looks: , ,

Joe and Cary would  if they didn't need to stay quiet
In a panicked : It's eating a person
Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an section of the rock-wall,   , , as he sees, among them,
His heart , his resolve quadruples
Cary sees her too -- She's here
We're going to use your firecrackers
don't think it's going to hurt it, Joe
There are other tunnels
So
need you to make noise
Lots of it, right here, in two minutes
Make it loud and make it last-- gimme some sparklers

But Joe's already gone
Stay with Cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of , glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view -- #3 - with Joe as he races, a   giving him his light -- the   all but gone now

Then went to my car to get my bag-- It's been experimented on for years
It's terrified and exhausted and hungry, it just wants to go home
When it touched me,  knew -- 116
