Then we  it: An 80's version of a log cabin
with crisp, clean lines
energy efficient and snug
A85 16 as a giant  descends from the mountains behind the house balancing a giant log on his right shoulder and carrying a chain saw in his left hand
This is
He's in his mid-thirties
a man of raw power and vitality
and something else: Joy
Joy, and a sense of calm
Matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin
He puts down the log and chain saw, then picks up firewood and begins to  it with awesome single swipes of an axe

None of the above escapes matrix's eye

She laughs as he tickles her
Dad

He raises his hands, open, trusting
Instantly she attacks again, then runs like hell as he pursues her, -  25 Matrix's Blazer is parked here
Father and daughter sit across from each other-she has a cone, he has a dish
He uses his spoon to steal some of her flavor and jimmies
he gets away with this twice before she pokes him on the nose with the cone

The view through the expansive picture window is breathtaking
Matrix leafs through some of Jenny's rock'n'roll magazines
When  was a boy and rock and roll came to East Germany, the communists said it was subversive

You don't want to know
Suddenly Matrix gets an odd look on his face

What's wrong
He shushes her, puts his hand up to block the sun as he peers through the picture window
