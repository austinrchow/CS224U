href <b>// --> </b> by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner Based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis Fourth Draft November 1998 - An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous exotic flowers
The clientele is young, wealthy and confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaia, Armani power suits
- on a  reading out the specials
With goat cheese profiteroles and  also have an arugula Caesar salad
For entrees tonight  have a swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale
Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen table cloths
Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four inches square and look exactly alike
- on various diners as we hear fragments of conversation
"Is that Charlie Sheen over there
" "Excuse me
ordered cactus pear sorbet
" And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth
- on porcelain plates containing elaborate perpendicular desserts descending on another table
,  ,   and are at a table set for four
They are all wearing expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back hair
Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses
The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins: (
) We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California place on the Upper East Side
The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately decorated starters
As he does so we hear Bateman's description of each of the men at the table
(
) You'll notice that my friends and  all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us
McDermott is the biggest asshole
Van Patten is the yes man
Price is the most wired
'm the best looking
We all have light tans
Right now 'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress
What are the rules for a sweater vest
McDERMOTT What do you mean
Yes
Clarify
McDERMOTT Well, is it strictly informal- Or can it be worn with a suit
McDERMOTT (Smiling) Exactly With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest
plaid suit would cal  for a bolder vest
McDERMOTT But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie
Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look too studied
You think so
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look
Good point
Excuse me, gentlemen
Van Patten leaves the table
As he does so, a busboy discreetly removes their largely untouched plates
Van Patten looks puffy
Has he stopped working out
It looks that way, doesn't it
McDERMOTT (Staring at retreating waiter) Did he just take our plates away
He took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished
God,  hate this place
This is a chicks' restaurant
Why aren't we at Dorsia
McDERMOTT Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head
(He guffaws) Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him
McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses
McDERMOTT Is that Reed Robinson over there
Are you freebasing or what
That's not Robinson
McDERMOTT Who is it then
That's Paul Owen
That's not Paul Owen
Paul Owen's on the other side of the room
Over there
He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses
McDERMOTT Who is he with
(Distracted by the waitress's cleavage as she bends over to uncork a bottle of wine  the waitress glares at him) Some weasel from Kicker Peabody
Van Patten returns
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in
McDERMOTT Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there
Yes
McDufus,  am
McDERMOTT He's handling the Fisher account
Lucky bastard
McDERMOTT Lucky Jew bastard
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything
McDERMOTT Listen
've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah
The bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah
You spin a dreidel
McDERMOTT Oh my God
Bateman, do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes
Some latkes
No
Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks
McDERMOTT Oh  forgot
Bateman's dating someone from the Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back
The voice of reason
The boy next door
And speaking of reasonable
He shows McDermott the bill for the meal
McDERMOTT Only $470
(Without irony) Not bad
The others murmur agreement
Four platinum Amex cards slap down on the table
- Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes
Price is lighting up a cigar
McDERMOTT Last week  picked up this Vassar chick- Oh God,  was there
don't need to hear this story again
McDERMOTT But  never told you what happened afterwards
So okay,  pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on spring break and she's practically blowing me in the Chandelier Room and so  take her back to my place- Whoa, wait
May  ask where Pamela is during all this
McDERMOTT Oh fuck you
want a blowjob, Bate-man
want a chick who's gonna let me- (Putting his hands over his ears) don't want to hear this
He's going to say something disgusting
McDERMOTT You prude
Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op together or jet down to Saint Bart's
just want some chick whose face  can sit on for thirty, forty minutes
Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it
McDERMOTT Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to this
She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking rhino tipsy, and get this- She let you fuck her without a condom
McDERMOTT This is a Vassar girl
She's not from Queens
She would only-are you ready
(Dramatic pause) She would only give me a handjob, and get this
she kept her glove on
The men sit in shocked, horrified silence
Never date a Vassar girl
- The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel
McDermott holds the door open for a passing  , who looks confused
McDERMOTT suppose he doesn't want the car
Price, ask him if he takes American Express
(Offering card) You take Amex, dude
The man stumbles away
The club , seeing the limousine, unhooks the velvet rope and welcomes them inside
,  - Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels
thuds through an open doorway
Trashed-looking girls stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the counter chatting to friends
There are almost as many men as women in the room
Couples stand in line, twitching as they wait to do coke
As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes past them and slams the door
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy- 'm not sure, guy, but  don't think dyslexia is a virus
Oh, who knows
They don't know that
Prove it
Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in
Price is sweating
'm shaking
You open it
Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke
Jeez
That's not a helluva lot, is it
Maybe it's just the light
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram
(He dips the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) Oh my God
What
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low
Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts
It's definitely weak but  have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay
want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran
The    next door yells at them in an effeminate voice: Could you keep it down, 'm trying to do drugs
Price pounds his fist against the stall
(screaming) Calm down
Let's do it anyway guess you're right
(Raising his voice) ,         '
Fuck you
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) No,
(He collapses, panting against the stall door) Sorry, dude
Steroids
Okay, let's do it
That's the spirit
They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into their gums
- Bateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume" plays in the background
(to ) Two Stoli on the rocks
He hands her two drink tickets
It's after eleven
Those aren't good anymore
It's a cash bar
That'll be twenty-five dollars
Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her a $50
She turns her back and searches the cash register for change
You are a fucking ugly bitch  want to stab to death and then play around with your blood
The music muffles his voice
She turns around
He is smiling at her
She gives him his change impassively
' - Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light
huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive electronic equipment
The room is impeccably neat, and oddly impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of a design magazine
(

) My name is Patrick Bateman
am twenty-six years old
live in the American Garden Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse
Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his toilet
(
0
)  believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, 'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches
can do a thousand now
Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face
Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living room wearing the ice pack
: mirror-lined bathroom
Bateman is luxuriating in the shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles
(
) After  remove the icepack,  use a deep pore-cleanser lotion
In the shower,  use a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub
Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a gel facial masque
(
) Then  apply an herb mint facial masque which leave on for ten minutes while  prepare the rest of my routine
Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products
He begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in readiness on the marble counter
(
) always use an after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion
Bateman stares into the mirror
The masque has dried, giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been wrapped in plastic
He begins slowly peeling the gel masque off his face
(
) There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though  can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable:  simply am not there
- Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by Bateman's interior decorator
Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and tone
(
) It is hard for me to make sense on any given level
My self is fabricated, an aberration
My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent
Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, adjusting his cuff-links
(
0
) My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago, if they ever did exist
He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees
He gives his reflection a smile
&  - As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another  who looks just like him
Morning, Hamilton
Nice tan
Bateman walks past the desk of , his secretary, pulling his Walkman from around his neck
Jean is attractive, wholesome, earnest
She smiles shyly
She loves him
Late
Aerobics class
Sorry
Any messages
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today
He didn't say what he was canceling or why
occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club
Anyone else
And
Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17
When
After six
Negative
Cancel it
Jean follows him into his office
Oh
And what should  say
Just
say
no
Just say no
Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions
Okay, Jean
need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons
All right
(Playfully) Yes, sir
She turns to leave
Oh wait
And  need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight tonight
Jean turns around
Oh, something
romantic
No, silly
Forget it
'll make them
Thanks
'll do it
No
No
Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay
You look nice today
Jean exits
Bateman straightens some magazines in his office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a slightly different angle
He fiddles with some pencils in a beer stein
He puts on some  and flips through a Sports Illustrated
He buzzes Jean
She comes in a moment later with the Perrier and a file
Yes
Is that the Ransom file
Thanks
Don't wear that outfit again
Ummm
what
didn't hear you
said "Do not wear that outfit again
" Wear a dress
skirt or something
Jean stands there, then looks down at herself
(Smiling bravely) You don't like this,  take it
Come on, you're prettier than that
(Sarcastically) Thanks, Patrick
The phone  and Jean turns to leave
'm not here
And high heels
like high heels
As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the  set in one corner of the room and starts watching Jeopardy
- , Patrick Bateman's fiancee, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping a bottle of mineral water
Evelyn is blonde, classically beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with herself
She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a small child
'd want a zydeco band, Patrick
That's what 'd want, a zydeco band
Or mariachi
Or reggae
Something ethnic to shock Daddy Oh,  can't decide
And lots of chocolate truffles
Godiva
And oysters on the halfshell
- on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring out the window
(
) 'm trying to listen to the new George Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancee-keeps buzzing in my ear
Evelyn continues to make notes
Marzipan
Pink tents
Hundreds, thousands of roses
Photographers
Annie Leibovitz
We'll get Annie Leibovitz
And we'll hire someone to videotape
Patrick, we should do it
(Removing his Walkman) Do
what
Get married
Have a wedding
Evelyn
Yes, darling
Is your Evian spiked
We should do it
No- can't take the time off work
Your father practically owns the company
You can do anything you like, silly
don't want to talk about it
Well, you hate that job anyway
Why don't you just quit
You don't have to work
Because
want
to
fit
in
The taxi bumps to a halt
- cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in self-conscious brutalist chic
Iron girders, walls of waxed plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel smashed-plate painting on one wall
The tables and chairs are made of extremely uncomfortable bolted steel
(
) 'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace since 'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave
Tm Price and two downtown types,  and , are already seated
Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, with green streaks in her black hair
Stash is pale, with ragged black hair and bad skin
They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus that look like minimalist art
The menu's in braille
He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long kiss
have to talk to you
He drags her away, half giggling and protesting
(Over her shoulder) Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash
He's an artist
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and checking his hair) Hi
Pat Bateman
Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing
Let me guess-you live in the East Village
Pause
SoHo
and   arrive at the table
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is considerably more fragile and neurotic
Luis is half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please
He wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, bow-ties, boldly patterned vests
They exchange air kisses
As soon as Luis turns his back, Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck
(Whispering) Stop it
Stash and Vanden watch them in silence
: Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear
Everyone else is quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching Evelyn and Price
(
) am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn are having an affair
Timothy is the only interesting person  know
Courtney is almost perfect looking
She s usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs
Tonight believe it's Xanax
More disturbing than her drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business
Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze
Tell me
Stash
do you think SoHo is becoming to
commercial
Yes,  read that
Oh, who gives a rat's ass
Hey
That affects us
(Wired on coke) Oh ho ho
That affects us
What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey
Doesn't that affect us, too
mean don't you know anything about Sri Lanka
About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of Israelis there
Doesn't that affect us
Oh come on
Price
There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about
Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand
Like what
Well, we have to end apartheid for one
And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger
But we can't ignore our social needs
either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system
We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice
The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably
We also have to control the influx of illegal immigrants
We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on , in movies, in pop music, everywhere
Most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people
Price chokes on his drink
Everyone is silent and mystified
Patrick, how thought-provoking
'  - Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television
Why don t you just go for Price
Oh God, Patrick
Why Price
Price
He's rich
Everybody's rich
He's good-looking
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick
He has a great body Everybody has a great body now
Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get Evelyn to have sex with him
She ignores him, watching the Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand
Finally, he straddles her, penis close to her face
She tries to look around him at the , then takes notice
What do you want to do with that, floss with it
Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television
Are you using minoxidil
No
'm not
Why should
Your hairline looks like it's receding
It's not
- It is 3 a
m
Bateman is standing at an , listening to the comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk past him
He collects his money, placing it carefully in his wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling
He catches up to her as she pauses at a red light
Hello
The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing his smile, smiles back
- Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the counter
Listen, wait
You're not
shhh wait
you're not giving me valid reasons
The woman continues to speak to him in another language, grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket
What are you trying to say to me
Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained sheets out of the bag and is staring at them
Bleach-ee
Are you trying to say bleach-ee
Bleach-ee
Oh my God
She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking
(Talking over her) Two things
One
You can't bleach a Soprani
Out of the question
Two
(Louder) Two
can only get these sheets in Santa Fe
These are very expensive sheets and  really need them clean
She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her
If you don't shut your fucking mouth  will kill you, are you understanding me
She talks faster
Now listen- have a very important lunch meeting (Checks Rolex) at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and  need those no wait, twenty minutes
have a lunch meeting at Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and  need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon
She keeps talking
Listen
cannot understand you
Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the counter
This is crazy
You're a fool
can't cope with this
Bateman is on the verge of tears
Stupid bitchee
Understand
Oh Christ
Someone enters the store behind him
It's , late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks
Patrick
She takes off her sunglasses
Hi, Patrick
thought that was you
Hello (Mumbles un incomprehensible name) Awkward pause
Well
Isn't it ridiculous
Coming all the way up here, but you know
They really are the best
Then why can't they get these stains out
mean can you talk to these people or something
'm not getting anywhere
Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding up
She touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking again
Oh my,  see
What are those
Oh my
Um, well
it s cranberry juice
Cranapple
VICTORiA (Skeptically) Really
Well,  mean, um, it s really
Bosco
You know, like
like a Dove Bar
It's a Dove Bar
Hershey's Syrup
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah
Oh  get it
Fun with chocolate
Listen, if you could talk to them (He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand) would really appreciate it
'm really late
have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes
Bateman turns to leave
Hubert's
Oh really
It moved uptown, right
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, 've got to go
Thank you, uh
Victoria
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week
You know, 'm downtown near Wall Street quite often
Oh,  don't know, Victoria
'm at work all the time
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday
(Checking his watch) Next Saturday
(Shrugging) Yeah
Oh, can't, 'm afraid
Matinee of Les Miserables
Listen, 've really got to go
'll-Oh
Christ
'll call you
Okay
Do
Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes out the door
Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound of the bell on the closing door
'  - Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to Courtney on a portable phone
He's holding a video box in one hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass
Offscreen we hear the sounds of the porn movie as he talks
Listen, what are you doing tonight
What
Oh, 'm
busy
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona
You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans
What could you possibly be up to tonight
Stop it
'm
On a lot of lithium
Waiting for Luis to call me
He said he'd call tonight
Oh don't be difficult, Patrick
You should come have dinner with me
But-when
Am  confused or were we talking about tonight
Ummm
yeah
Luis is calling me tonight need to be home for that
Pumpkin
Yes
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole
Uh huh
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York
know
Stop it
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay
have to go
Courtney
Dinner
can't
'm thinking Dorsia
Dorsia's nice
Nice
You like it there, don't you
The question is do you like it, Courtney
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight
Okay
Yeah
What time
Eight
Pick me up
Sounds like 'll have to
Don't fall asleep, okay
Wear something fabulous
Dorsia, remember
Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the number for Dorsia with trembling fingers
It's busy and so he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial
He waits with his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there is finally an answer
' Dorsia
Please hold
He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense
' Dorsia
(Both of his eyes are closed) Umm
yes
know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps
Long pause
The Maitre ' starts giggling quietly and then more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he hangs up the phone
- Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab
Courtney is heavily medicated
facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where  bought this silver muffin dish
(She starts to pass out) Is that Donald Trump's car
(Thickly) Oh God, Patrick
Shut up
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium
Or have a Diet Coke
Some caffeine might get you out of this slump
just want to have a child
Just
two
perfect
children
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze) The cab draws up outside a restaurant
The awning reads "Barcadia
" - An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths, minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting
waiter has come to take their drink orders
&
Straight
Champagne on the rocks
Oh-could  have that with a twist
She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up
Are we here
Yes
This is Dorsia
(Examining a menu that says "Barcadia" in large script) Yes, dear
Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and starts to slide off of her chair
Bateman grabs her by both shoulders and props her up
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash
New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish
" You'll love it
And then
the red snapper with violets and pine nuts
think that'll follow nicely
Mmmm
thanks, Patrick
She falls asleep at the table
'  - Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed
Bateman is on top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray
He tears it open with his teeth, puts it on
(Dazed on lithium) want you to fuck me
Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her
Luis is a despicable twit
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit
hate him
He keeps fucking her
No, you idiot
said "Is it a receptacle tip
" Not, is Luis a despicable twit
Is it a receptacle tip
Get off me
Is it a what
Pull out
'm ignoring you
(screaming) Pull out, goddamnit
(Slowing down but not stopping) What do you want, Courtney
She pushes him away from her
It's a plain end
think
Turn the light on
She tries to sit up
Oh Jesus
'm going home
Patrick
Turn on the Light
He turns on the light
It's a plain end, see
So
Take it off
Why
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip (She covers herself with her comforter) to catch the force of the ejaculate
'm getting out of here
Where's your lithium
Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying
(Screaming) Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex
Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it
And see, Courtney, it's there for what
Huh
Tell us
(He slaps her again lightly) Why is it pulled down half an inch
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate
(Choking crying) Well, it's not a turn-on for me
have a promotion coming to me
don't want to get
Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom
See
Happy
You dumb bitch
Are you happy, you dumb bitch
Oh God, just get it over with
He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and falls down next to her
They lie side by side with their bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the ceiling
,  &  - Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto a spectacular view of Manhattan
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney
Dorsia, how impressive
How on earth did you get a reservation there
Lucky,  guess
That's a wonderful jacket
Let me guess, Valentino Couture
Uh huh
(Reaching out to touch it) It looks so soft
(Catching Luis hand) Your compliment was sufficient Luis
Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague on his left
Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St
Journal under his arm
He is handsome, supremely confident and self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men
(To Bateman) Hello, Halberstam
Nice tie
How the hell are you
've been great
And you
Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's thoughts
(
) Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam
It seems logical because Marcus also works at & and in fact does the same exact thing  do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses
Marcus and  even go to the same barber, although  have a slightly better haircut
During this voiceover the   over to , who is conferring with a colleague in the opposite corner of the room
He bears a superficial resemblance to Bateman
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus
(Nervous) It's
it's
all right
Really
That's interesting
(He stares at Bateman, smiling) Not great
Oh well, you know
And how's Cecilia
She's a great girl
Oh yes
'm very lucky
McDermott and Price enter
McDERMOTT Hey
Owen
Congratulations on the Fisher account
Thank you, Baxter
Listen, Paul
Squash
Call me
(Hands him a business card) How about Friday
No can do
Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia
Great sea urchin ceviche
There is a stunned silence as he walks away and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers
- on Bateman's face, cold with hatred
(Whispering) Jesus
Dorsia
On a Friday night
How'd he swing that
McDERMOTT (Whispering) think he's lying
Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card
(Suddenly enthused) What's that, a gram
New card
What do you think
McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully
McDERMOTT Whoa
Very nice
Take a look
He hands it to Van Patten
Picked them up from the printers yesterday Good coloring
That's bone
And the lettering is something called Silian Rail
McDERMOTT (Envious) Silian Rail
It is very cool, Bateman
But that's nothing
He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the table
Look at this
They all lean forward to inspect it
That's really nice
Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to control his anxiety
Eggshell with Romalian type
(Turning to Bateman) What do you think
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak) Nice
(Holding the card up to the light) Jesus
This is really super
How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful
Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at McDermott's
(
) can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine
But wait
You ain't seen nothin' yet
He holds up his own card
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white
(Choking with anxiety) Impressive
Very nice
Let's see Paul Owen's card
Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it up for their inspection: " ,  & , " Bateman swallows, speechless
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card
(
) Look at that subtle off-white coloring
The tasteful thickness of it
Oh my God, it even has a watermark
His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it until it fills the screen
He lets it fall
The
Is something wrong
Patrick
you're sweating
- The financial district
The streets are eerily deserted
Bateman stands at an , enjoying the reassuring sound of $500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine
As he turns to leave, he notices someone across the street
is lying in a doorway on top of an open grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: small, thin dog lies next to him
He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants
(Offering his hand) Hello
Pat Bateman
The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up
You want some money
Some
food
The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry
Bateman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a $ 0 bill, then changes his mind and holds out a $5 instead
Is this what you need
The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose
'm so hungry
It's cold out, too, isn't it
'm so hungry
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) Why don't you get a job
If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job
(Shivering and sobbing) lost my job
Why
Were you drinking
Is that why you lost it
Insider trading
Just joking
No, really-were you drinking on the job
was fired
was laid off
Gee, uh, that's too bad
'm so hungry
The dog starts to whimper
Why don't you get another one
Why don't , you get another job
'm not
You're not what
Qualified for anything else
'm hungry know that,  know that
Jeez, you're like a broken record
'm trying to help you
'm hungry
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs
From people who do work
What am  gonna do
Listen, what's your name
Al
Speak up
Come on
Al
Get a goddamn job, Al
You've got a negative attitude
That's what's stopping you
You've got to get your act together
'll help you
You re so kind, mister
You're kind
You're a kind man
can tell
(Petting the dog) Shhhh
it's okay
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist) Please
don know what to do
'm so cold
(Stroking his face, whispering) Do ,you know how bad you smell
The stench, my God
can't
can't find a shelter You reek
You reek of
shit
Do you know that
(Shouting) Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot
Al
'm sorry
Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet
It's just that
don't know  don't have anything in common with you
He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with a serrated edge
He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to protect it
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are
'  as Bateman lunges at him with the knife
of the street
Bateman's shadowed figure is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is silent
shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground
There's a quarter
Go buy some gum
Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the body left twitching on the ground
- - on Bateman's face and torso
His eyes are closed as a woman's hands rub cream into his face
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman
So fine, so smooth
His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he closes them again
(
) have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except for greed ,und disgust
Something horrible is happening inside me and  don't know why
: Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the who is giving him a pedicure
She is cutting his nails with tiny sharp scissors
He stares at them longingly
(
) My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days
feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy
: Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning bed, wearing goggles
(
) think my mask of sanity is about to slip
- An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets, naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes
Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the  '
Marcus Halberstam
For two at eight
' Your friend has already been seated
Follow me, Mr
Halberstam
Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of ram's horns
He is arguing with the
No,  want to know
came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the way, almost completely empty
Am  to believe that all ten people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of cilantro crawfish gumbo
'm very sorry sir
There was a fire in the kitchen earlier today, and- &, straight
And a Dixie beer
Would you like to hear- Double Absolut martini
Yes, sir
Would you like to hear the specials
Not if you want to keep your spleen
The Waiter leaves
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam
This place is hot, very hot
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here
Yeah, well, you're late
Hey, 'm a child of divorce
Give me a break (Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood) Hmmm,  see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello
We should've gone to Dorsia
could've gotten us a table
Nobody goes there anymore
There is a long disgruntled silence
Is that Ivana Trump over there
(Laughs) Jeez Patrick  mean Marcus, what are you thinking
Why would Ivana be at Texarkana
Another pause
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account
How did you get it
could tell you that, Halberstam, but then 'd have to kill you
He guffaws
Bateman laughs politely
: Paul Owen is very drunk
cold sober
like to dissect girls
Did you know 'm utterly insane
Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another drink
Great tan, Marcus
Really impressive
Where do you tan
Salon
've got a tanning bed at home
You should look into it
Bateman nods, agitated
And Cecelia, how is she
Where is she tonight
Cecelia is, well
you know (Cecelia
think she's having dinner with
Evelyn Williams
Evelyn
Great ass
Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman
What a dork
Another Martini, Paul
Owen nods drunkenly
: The end of the meal
Owen is squeezing a lime onto the table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk
The check is laid down
(Talking to Owen like a child) Paul, give me your Amex card
Good boy
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check
Two-hundred-and-fifty
Very reasonable
Let's leave a big tip, shall we
My place hr a nightcap
No, man
'm gonna bail
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch
(Helping him into his jacket) 've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us
'  - The living room floor has been meticulously covered with newspaper
Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass in his hand
Bateman is looking through his CDs
You like Huey Lewis and the News
They're okay
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste
But then Sports came out in 1983,  think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically
Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower
He takes two Valium
(Said partly from the bathroom) The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen from behind ail the time
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but  think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor
Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys catalogue
Hey, Halberstam
Yes, Owen
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place
Do you have a dog
chow or something
No, Owen
(Confused) Is that a raincoat
Yes, it is
Bateman moves to the  player
He takes a  out of its case and slides it in the machine
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore
, their most accomplished album
think  heir undisputed masterpiece is "HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics
But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends
It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself
Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square
" crosses the room and picks up the ax
We follow  from behind as he walks up to Owen, the ax raised over his head
Hey, Paul
As Owen turns around,  '  we see Bateman swing the ax toward his face
Blood sprays onto the white raincoat
, we see  as he yanks the ax out
Owen drops to the floor
His body falls out of the frame
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically
Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor
(Raising the ax and screaming) Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking stupid bastard
as he beats Owen with the back of the ax
, the sound of the ax hitting Owen
(Panting) Fucking bastard
Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting
He folds the coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly over the back of a chair
He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene
He checks his Rolex and lights a cigar
, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard
- drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby, past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment
- is trying to hail a cab
Owen's body is at his feet
Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him
Patrick
Is that you
No, Luis
It's not me
You're mistaken
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban
This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman
Where are you going
We're going to Nell's
Gwendolyn's father's buying it
(Looking down at the body) Where did you get your overnight bag
Commes des Garcon
cab stops
opens the door and manages to get Owen's body into the backseat
Bateman gets into the cab
Call me please, Patrick
Jesus lives, Luis
' '   - bare room, lit by one light bulb
The walls are blank except for a Les Miserables poster
There is one ratty chair
Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in a bathtub
He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the body dissolve
'  - Bateman is letting himself into the apartment
It is very similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist
The walls are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting on the wall
One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch
Where to send the bastard
Dallas
Pans
He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing toiletries and shoving them in
Singapore
London
'll send the asshole to London
He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans over the answering machine
He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech
Hi, this is Paul
've been called away to London for a few days
Meredith, 'll call you when  get back
Hasta la vista, baby
'  - Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing Kenny
We hear the  until Jean enters and he takes the Walkman off
(Faintly irritable) What is it
Patrick
(Condescendingly) Ye-es, Je-an
Patrick, a Mr
Donald  is here to see you
Who
Detective Donald
Silence
Bateman stares out the window, then down at the drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back cover of Sports Illustrated
Tell him 'm at lunch
(whispering) Patrick,  think he knows you're here
It's only ten-thirty
Silence
Send him in,  guess
As she exits, he picks up the cordless phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion to your physique
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt
hold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties
The door to the office opens and he waves in is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of the type Bateman and his friends might wear
Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to carry on with his fake conversation
Kimball looks up at him curiously, noticing the silence
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) Right
And yes
always tip the stylist fifteen percent
Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in exasperation
nods understandingly
Listen, John, 've got to go
Boone Pickens just walked in
(He laughs inanely) Just joking
(Pause) No don't tip the owner of the salon
Okay, John, right, got it
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) Sorry about that
No, 'm sorry
should've made an appointment
(Gesturing toward the phone) Was that anything important
Oh that
Just mulling over business problems
Examining opportunities
Exchanging rumors
Spreading gossip
They laugh politely
(Holding out his hand) Hi
'm Donald (Shaking firmly) Hi
Pat Bateman
Nice to meet you
'm sorry to barge in on you like this
but  was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and
well, you're here, so
know how busy you guys can get
stares at the three open copies of Sports Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is still running
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) So, what's the topic of discussion
've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen
You're not with the  or anything, are you
Nothing like that
'm just a private investigator
Ah,  see
Yes
Paul's disappearance
Yes
So it's nothing that official
just have some basic questions
About Paul Owen
About yourself- Coffee
No
'm okay
Perrier
San Pellegrino
No, 'm okay
takes out a small black notepad and the same gold Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use
Bateman buzzes Jean
(
) Patrick
Can you bring Mr
Mr
Kimball a bottle of San Pelle- Oh no, 'm okay
It's no problem Bateman watches intently as  writes something down in his notebook, then crosses something out
Jean enters and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman
He glares at her
smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves
Well, what's the topic of discussion
The disappearance of Paul Owen
Oh right
Well,  haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything
(Trying to laugh) Not on "Page Six" at least
think his family wants this kept quiet
Understandable
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino) Lime
No, really
'm okay
You sure
can always get you a lime
pause
Just some preliminary questions that  need for my own files, okay
Shoot
How old are you
Twenty-six
'll be twenty-seven in October
(Scribbling in his notebook) Where did you go to school
Harvard
The Harvard Business School
Your address
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street
The American Gardens Building
(Looking up, impressed) Nice
Very nice
(Flattered) Thanks
pause as  studies his notebook
Bateman closes his eyes, as if in pain
Pardon me, but are you okay
Who do you ask
You seem
nervous
Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a bottle of aspirin
Nuprin
Uh
no, thanks
Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the desk
Bad habit
know
'm sorry
pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes
Would you rather  not smoke
No,  guess it's okay
You sure
No problem
(Buzzing Jean) (
) Yes, Patrick
Bring us an ashtray for Mr
, please
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence
What can you tell me about Paul Owen
Well
He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows them dry
How well did you know him
'm
at a loss
He was part of that whole
Yale thing, you know
Yale thing
pause
Yeah
Yale thing
What do you mean
Yale thing
pause
Well,  think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual
Who did a lot of cocaine
that Yale thing
silence during which the sound of the air conditioner becomes deafening
So
there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen
He led what  suppose was an orderly life
He
ate a balanced diet
What kind of man was he
Besides
(He hesitates tries to smile) the information you've just given
hope 'm not being cross-examined here
Do you feel that way
No
Not really
(As he writes without looking up) Where did Paul hang out
Hang
out
Yeah
You know
hang out
Let me think
The Newport
Harry's
Fluties
Endochine
Nell's
Comell Club
The New York Yacht Club
The regular places
He had a yacht
No, he just hung out there
And where did he go to school
slight pause
Don't you know this
just wanted to know if you know
Before Yale
If  remember correctly, Saint Paul's
Listen,  just
just want to help
understand
He makes another note
Anything else you can tell me about Owen
We were both seven in 1969
(Smiles) So was
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London
Well, maybe he did, huh
His girlfriend doesn't think so
But
has anyone seen him in London
Actually, yes
Hmmm
Well, 've had a hard time getting an actual verification
Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so
Oh
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship
What
know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey know this sounds like a lame question, but last month- don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- Yikes
No
Paul wasn't into that
He followed a balanced diet and- Yeah,  know, and was into that whole Yale thing
pause - the longest so far
Have you consulted a psychic
No
Had his apartment been burglarized
No, it actually hadn't
Toiletries were missing suit was gone
So was some luggage
That's it
mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right
No, not yet
As  said, we're not sure
But
basically no one has seen or heard anything
That's so typical, isn't it
It's just strange
(He stares out the window, lost in thought) One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then
Nothing
People just
disappear
The earth just opens up and swallows people
(He checks his Rolex) Eerie
Really eerie
Silence
(Standing up) You'll have to excuse me
have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown mean aren't you going to be late
Uh, no
There's one
down here
Oh really
didn't know that
Bateman leads him to the door
Yes
It's very good
turns to face him
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all
Absolutely, 'm 100% with you
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr
Bateman
Bateman closes the door firmly on
He closes his eyes and leans against the door, sweating
'  - perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect green grapes, a few berries
, the       can be heard from the living room
The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw Massacre
There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, next to a copy of
: Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, jerking off
He is squealing into the phone and breathing
You like that, slut
The person on the other end clearly hangs up
- on his fingers dialing the phone
You want to know what 'm wearing
Sixty-dollar boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white cotton -shirt by Commes des Garcons
(He snorts like a pig) My Rolex cost- Another hang-up
He dials again
(Whipering) 'm a corporate raider
orchestrate hostile takeovers
What do you think of that
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) Huh, bitch
(
) Dad, is that you
Bateman hangs up, frustrated
/
- Bateman cruises around in the limo
It pulls up alongside , a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket
Bateman opens his window to speak to her
haven't seen you around here
You just haven't been looking
Would you like to see my apartment
Bateman flips on the light inside the limo
He's wearing a tuxedo
(looking away to some dark corner) 'm not supposed to
Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now notices, then takes
Do you want to come to my apartment or not
'm not supposed to
(She pockets the bill) But  can make an exception
Do you take American Express
Christie is still looking out behind her
Do you take American Express
Christie looks at him like he's crazy
'm joking
Come on, get in
As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone
He reads off a credit card number
'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does couples
Couples
Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the American Gardens Building
Apartment 7C
And  really can't stress blonde enough
Blonde
He hangs up
'm Paul
My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that
You are Christie
You are to respond only to Christie
Is that clear
'  - Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white milky bath oil
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking
Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and Bateman is casually touching her breast
want you to clean your vagina
Christie reaches for a washcloth
No
From behind
Get on your knees
Christie shrugs
want to watch
You have a very nice body
The doorman
Bateman answers
Thank you
Send her up
Christie, get out and dry off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks
Bateman answers the door
You've arrived
How lovely, let me take your coat
'm Paul
How good of you to come
The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered
Bateman takes her coat and inspects her body and face
Not quite blonde, are you
More dirty blonde
'm going to call you Sabrina
'm Paul Owen
Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a glass of wine
Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the couch, and Bateman sits across from them
There is a long silence
So, don't you want to know what  do
The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles
Christie shrugs
No
(Smiling) No, not really
Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs
Well,  work on Wall Street
At Pierce & Pierce
(Long pause) Have you heard of it
Another long pause
They shake their heads
Christie stands up and goes over to the  collection
You have a really nice place here
Paul
How much did you pay for it
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut  can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap
Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a pack of cigarettes out of her purse
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates
No, no smoking
Not in here
He walks over to Christie
Varda truffle
Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head
Sabrina takes one
don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very fine Chardonnay you're not drinking
Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection
He takes one out and examines it
Do you like Phil Collins
've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke
Before that  really didn't understand any of their work
It was too artsy, too intellectual
It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent
He puts aside the  and takes out another one
think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed masterpiece
He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him into the bedroom
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums
Christie, take off the robe
Bateman puts out a lace teddy
He motions to Christie to put it on
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford
You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument
Sabrina, remove your dress
Bateman starts to undress
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little
Sabrina dances awkwardly
Christie sits on the bed
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion
" In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political authority
Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and commitment
The song is extremely uplifting
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything 've heard in rock
He turns on the video camera
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your asshole
Bateman looks through the viewfinder
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds
" Sabrina, don't just stare at it
Eat it
He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in the
But  also think that Phill Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and stress the word artist
This is "Sussudio," a great, great song, a personal favorite
"Sussudio
" We see this in  , or through the
: Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina on either side of him
Sabrina accidentally touches his wrist
Bateman's eyes open
Don't touch the Rolex
Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire
He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar
He turns around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up and get dressed
He takes the coat hanger
We're not through yet
: Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently
They are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding
Bateman has a deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder
In the b
g
Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing
McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are having drinks
Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and gives them the finger
What an asshole
McDERMOTT Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price
He's a fucking drug addict
No self-control
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody
What do you think, Bateman
know her
knew her
McDERMOTT Why do you say it like that
Why does he say it like that
Because he dated her
How did you guess
Girls dig Bateman
He's
You're total , Bateman
Thanks, guy, but
she's got a lousy personality
McDERMOTT So what
It's all looks
Laurie Kennedy is a babe
Don't even pretend you were interested for any other reason
If they have a good personality, then something is very wrong
McDERMOTT If they have a good personality and they are not great looking-who fucking cares
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay
What if they have a good personality
(He smiles giving up) know,  know- There are no girls with good personalities
(They laugh and high-five each other) good personality consists of a chick with a little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut
McDERMOTT Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly chicks
Absolutely
McDERMOTT And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are
Pause
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women
Ed Gein
Maitre d' at Canal Bar
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties
He was an interesting guy
McDERMOTT So what did Ed say
He said, "When  see a pretty girl walking down the street  think two things
One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat her right
" Pauses, finishes his drink
McDERMOTT What does the other part of him think
What her head would look like on a stick
McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back at Bateman
Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily join In
Luis Carruthers walks up to the table
(Shyly) Hi, guys
wanna get your opinion on something
McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table
McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you know how we feel about it
Luis laughs good-naturedly
Yes,  do
No, it's my business card- decided to get a new one too
He pulls out something incredibly tasteful
Everyone compliments Luis except Bateman
The   and all we hear is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with himself
Listen, what about dinner
(Suddenly angry) Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten
"What about fucking dinner
" McDERMOTT Ah, cheer up, Bateman
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck) What's the matter
No shiatsu this morning
(Watching Luis going into the men's room) Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump
McDERMOTT Whoa, hold on there, little buddy
Excuse me
He gets up from the table
As Bateman walks away, Van Patten grabs a waiter
Is this tap water
don't drink tap water Bring me an Evian or something, okay
'  - Bateman pulls on his gloves as he enters the men's room
Carruthers is standing in a stall with his back to Bateman
The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman approaches, then abruptly stops
Slowly, Bateman brings his hands up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet
All we can hear is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing
Slowly he starts to squeeze
Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around
Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in thought
Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's wrist
He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side of his face
God, Patrick
Why here
He strokes Bateman's hair
've seen you looking at me
've noticed your hot body
Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs away
He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck
Carruthers immediately takes them and places them back
Bateman drops them again
Don't be shy
Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift his hands again, but abandons the attempt
You don't know how long 've wanted it
Ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206
You know the one, you were wearing that red-striped paisley Armani tie
Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are still unzipped
He moves past him out of the stall and stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he realizes he still has his gloves on
Carruthers comes up behind him
want you
want you
too
Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter and several customers and cursing
Noticing the maitre d' and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely, Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at them
Carruthers walks up behind him
(Hissing) What
is
it
Where are you going
(Stumbling away from him) 've gotta
've gotta
return some videotapes
Patrick
What
(Silently mouthing the words) 'll call you
Bateman storms out of the restaurant
'  - Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back
He feels something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, a black cat with blue jewel eyes
There is silence
Will you call me before Thanksgiving
Maybe
Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her nightstand, swallowing several
Bateman gets up and begins to dress, admiring himself in the mirror
Courtney watches the  at low volume
What are you doing tonight
Dinner at the River Cafe
Au Bar afterwards, maybe
That's nice
You and
Luis
(Lighting a cigarette) We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is
never knew you smoked
(Smiling sadly) You never noticed
Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie
Listen
Patrick
Can we talk
You look marvelous
There's nothing to say
You're going to marry Luis
Next week, no Less
(Sarcastically) Isn't that special
( pause) Patrick
Yes, Courtney
C0URTNEY If  don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay
(Flatly) You too
Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its head
Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door
Patrick
Yes
Nothing
- big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies
Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and tries to attract the bartender's attention
He is wearing a suit and his tie is loosened
Kimball approaches him
Mr
Bateman
Bateman gasps and recovers
Detective Kendall
uh Campbell
Kimball
(Extending his hand) Call me Don
Don
So
you hang out here a lot
Uh, yes
mean
whenever necessary
You know
Pause
How's the investigation going
Taken anyone in for "formal questioning
" (He makes quotation marks in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh) 0h no
Informal conversations, mostly
What's that, Stoli
Yeah
No Finlandia, as usual
Fucking dump
(Looking at his glass) Too true
You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think
Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically
Some people just can t help themselves
Another Stoli
Bateman shakes his head
mean they want to get caught
Dan, great to see you again
Like  said, you need anything at all, 'm your man
don't envy your job
mean Owen was a
complex man
Bateman wanders away
He looks back uneasily at , who is watching him from the bar
walks by
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man
The man stares at him
mean-Mon
We be jammin'
The man walks by, shaking his head
Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in black designer dresses
Across the room he spots McDermott and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black mini-dresses
Price and McDermott are having a whispered argument
have to talk to these girls
They're models
McDERMOTT Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder
You went last time
Stay here
McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears
Bateman looks at the models
and  are staring into space, smoking
is trying to work out how to unfold her napkin
Price signals to Bateman for help
(Clapping his hands together) Let's have a conversation
So
it was hot out today, no
Silence
Where did Craig go
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs
McDermott is going to sign a peace treaty with him between the United States and Russia
McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know
Well
yeah
But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions
You're not confused, are you
No, not really
Gorbachev's not downstairs
(Smiling) Are you Iying
Yes, Caron's right
Gorbachev's not downstairs
He's at Tunnel
(To Daisy) Ask me a question
So, what do you do
What do you think  do
model
An actor
No
Flattering, but no
Well
m into, well, murders and executions mostly
(Unfazed) Do you like it
Welt
it depends, why
Well, most guys  know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it
Silence
So, where do you work out
: The club is half-empty now
Price is leaning over a balcony, messed-up on drugs
Bateman comes up behind him in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over the railing
Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman is reaching for him
(Shouting) 'm leaving
'm getting out
Leaving what
This
Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his drink
Don't, 'll drink it
(Screaming) Listen to me, Patrick
'm leaving
Where to
Are you going to go get a gram
'm leaving
am
leaving
Don't tell me
merchant banking
No, you dumb son of a bitch
'm serious
'm disappearing
(laughing) Where to
Morgan Stanley
Rehab
What
Price looks away
McDermott and Daisy walk up to them
McDERMOTT Hey-don't worry, be happy
Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is shouting something that can't be heard, then Goodbye
Fuckheads
He climbs over the railing
What is he doing
Price
Come back
Price leaps from the balcony
He disappears for a moment then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd
- Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand what  was doing with a yuppie
Oh really
He said
(She laughs) He said you gave him bad vibes
That's
that's too bad
You think 'm dumb, don't you
What
You think 'm dumb
You think all models are dumb
(insincerely) No
really don't
That's okay
don't mind
There's something sweet about you
She takes his hand as they get into a cab
'  - Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase
He pauses in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the case
'  - Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York Times crossword puzzle at dusk
Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with a folder in her hand
Bateman ignores her
Doin' the crossword
Bateman nods without looking up
Need help
doesn't respond
We see that every space on the puzzle has been filled in with the words  or
Jean drops the folder on his desk and then walks out
Jean
(Re-enters office) Yes, Patrick
Would you like to accompany me to dinner
He erases one of the 's on the crossword puzzle
That is
if you're not doing anything
Oh no
have no plans
(Lowering his Wayfarers) Well, isn't this a coincidence
pause
Listen, where should we go
He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer
Anywhere you want
Let's not think about what  want
How about anywhere you want
Oh Patrick,  can't make this decision
No, come on
Anywhere you want
Oh,  can't
(Sighs) don't know
Come on
Where do you want to go
Anywhere you want
Just say it
can get us in anywhere
long pause
What about
Dorsia
Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles at her
Soooo
Dorsia is where Jean wants to go
Oh,  don't know
No, we'll go anywhere you want
Dorsia is
fine
He dials the number
' Dorsia, yes
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock
He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean
' We are totally booked
Oh really
That's great
' said we are totally booked
Two at nine
Perfect
' There are no tables available tonight
The waiting list is also totally booked
See you then
He hangs up the phone
He walks over to the coat rack
He glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the desk, confused
Yes
You're dressed
okay
You didn't give them a name
They know me
Pause
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock for drinks, okay
She turns to leave
And Jean
You'll want to change before we go out
'  - Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out
Patrick, it's so
elegant
What a wonderful view
Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady visible
Jean
Sorbet
Thanks, Patrick
'd love some
Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in his hand and hands her the sorbet
Jean is eating the sorbet
Want a bite
'm on a diet
But thank you
You don't need to lose any weight
You're kidding, right
You look great
Very fit
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) You can always he thinner
Look
better
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner
don't want to ruin your willpower
No
It's all right
'm not very good at controlling it anyway
Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up his knife drawer, looking at the knives
So listen, what do you really want to do with your life
Pause
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay
Well, 'd like to travel
And maybe go back to school, but  really don't know
'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but 'm so
don't know
unsure
Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge of the blade
Do you have a boyfriend
No, not really
Interesting
(Shyly) Are you seeing anyone
mean, seriously
Maybe
don't know Not really
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun
Jean, do you feel
fulfilled
mean, in your life
Well,  guess  do
For a long time  was too focused on my work,  think, but now 've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and
growing
Growing
'm glad you said that
Bateman picks up the duct tape
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie
Had you heard this
Who's Ted Bundy
Forget it
What's that
Oh
Uh, tape
Duct tape
need it for
taping something
Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy
Jean puts her spoon down on the table
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun) What
No
Put it in the carton
Sorry
(She puts the spoon in the carton) Jean
What
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to
From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and stands behind the couch
'm looking for
guess you could say  just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special
Hmmmm
He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head
The phone
Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun behind his back
The answering machine picks up
As Bateman listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she listens to the message
Patrick  know you're there
Pick up the phone, you bad boy
What are you up to tonight
It's me
Don't try to hide
hope you're not out with some little number you picked up because you're my Mr
Bateman
My boy next door
Anyway you never called me and you said you would and 'll leave a message for Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps
You hate that
Bye Mr
Big Time  Patrick
Bye
Bye
Silence
Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset
Was that
Evelyn
Silence
Are you still seeing her
Silence
'm sorry,  have no right to ask that
Silence
Do you want me to go
long pause
Yes
don t think  can
control myself
know  should go
know  have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and
mean, do you want me to go
Another long pause
If you stay,  think something bad will happen think  might hurt you
(Almost hopefully) You don't want to get hurt, do you
No
No,  guess not
don't want to get bruised
You're right,  should go
She gets up to leave
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21
Thanks
It slipped my mind completely
He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes
'  - Bateman enters &, walks up the corridor and pauses outside the door to his office
He sees  in conversation with Jean, and Jean looking through her date book
He watches for a moment, frozen with anxiety
He then bursts in, shutting the door behind him
Kimball-'ve been wanting to talk with you, Come into my office
Jean, great jacket
Matsuda
Jean looks flustered
Kimball follows Bateman into his office
actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence
Yeah, gone into rehab
Shame
(Hopefully) Is he a suspect
Not really
pause
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance
(He checks his notebook) Which was on the twentieth of December
God
guess
was probably returning videotapes
He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his diary
had a date with a girl named Veronica
Wait
That's not what 've got
What
That's not the information 've received
Well
Wait
What information have you received
Let's see
(He flips through his notebook) That you were with- Well,  could he wrong
Well
When was the last time you were with Paul Owen
(Clearly nervous and under pressure) We had
gone to a new musical called
Oh Africa, Brave Africa
It was
a laugh riot
and that's about it
think we had dinner at Orso's
No, Petaluma
No, Orso's
The
last time physically saw him was
at an automated teller
can't remember which
just one that was near, um, Nell's
Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now
He opens his briefcase to put away his notebook
Well, thank you, Mr
Bateman
Patrick, please
hope 've been informative
Long day-a bit scattered
Listen, 'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when 've sorted out all this information
Great, yes, 'd like that
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier
Absolutely
'm with you on that one
Kimball is rifling through his briefcase
He pulls out a new shrink wrapped  and holds it up
Huey Lewis and the News
Great stuff
Heard it just bought it on my way here
Bateman stares at the  - stunned, terrified
Never
mean
don't really like
singers
Not a big music fan, eh
No,  like music
Just-they're-Huey's too
black sounding
For me
Well, to each his own
So-lunch, Thursday
'll call your secretary about reservations
'll be there

- The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a half-opened window
'm not so sure about this
had to go to Emergency after last time
Oh this won't be anything like last time,  promise
don't think so
He hands her a $500 bill
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute
The driver's here, you'll be safe
Christie gets in hesitantly
Nothing like last time, promise
Alright
He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party) So, you're looking great, how have you been
( little confused) Well,  actually might need a little surgery after last time
(Mock shock) Really
My friend told me  should maybe even get a lawyer
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that
Here
He writes her a check for $ ,000 to cash and hands it to her
She snatches the check out of his hand and gets quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street
Bitch
He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge wad of cash at her
She hesitates; he uses the money to lure her into the car
As she reluctantly gets into the limo, she reaches for the money
He snatches it away
Uh uh uh
Half now, half later
She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt
Okay, your name is Christie
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth
She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly
You'll like her
She's a very nice girl
Don't say anything about yourself
Is that clear
Christie
Christie nods
'  - The living room:  has kicked off her shoes and flopped down on the couch underneath the Baselitz
Elizabeth is an attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to examine a
You look really familiar
Did you you go to Dalton
Christie shakes her head
The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and putting them in a bottle of wine
In the living room, Elizabeth is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars
think  met you at Au Bar, didn't
With Spicey
Christie looks blank
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar
Christie still blank
You know, Au Bar
Christie shakes her head
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible
went to a birth day party there for Malcolm Forbes
Oh my God, please
Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at the floor
There is an awkward silence
This is nicer than your other apartment
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment) It's not that nice
Silence
Where did you two meet
Oh God
met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, '87, and
(Turning to Patrick) You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole
(Sarcastically) Hot number
What do you mean, she was a hot number
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob
(To Christie) Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need say more
What do you do
long silence
Christie reddens and stares at the floor
She's my
cousin
(Skeptically) Uh huh
She's from
France
pause
Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously
Where's your phone
've got to call Harley
Bateman hands her a cordless phone
She dials, and stares At Christie while she waits for someone to answer
Where do you summer
Southampton
Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth
No
(Listening to the receiver) Oh God, it's his machine
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning
He's a goddamn drug dealer
These are his peak hours
Don't tell him you're here
Why would
Bateman has poured her another glass of wine
She downs the whole glass, making a face
This tastes weird
(She examines the label and shrugs) Harley
It's me
need your services
Translate that anyway you'd like
'm at- (Whispering) You're at Paul Owen s
Who
(Whispering) Paul Owen
want the number, idiot
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever) Anyway, 'm at Paul Norman's and 'll try you later and if don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night 'm going to sic my hairdresser on you
She hangs up
Did you know that guy who disappeared
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too
Was he a friend of yours
No
Do you have any coke
Or Halcyon
'd take a Halcyon
Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her another glass of the drugged wine
Listen,  would just like to see
the two of you
get it on
What's wrong with that
It's totally disease-free
(Laughing) Patrick, you re a lunatic
Come on
Don't you find Christie attractive
Let's not get lewd
(Flirty) 'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation
Come on
think it would be a turn-on
(To Christie) Does he do this all the time
Christie shrugs
Christie, you're not drinking your wine
Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip
(To Elizabeth) Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl
No
'm not a lesbian
Why do you think 'd be into that
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick
You're making me feel weird
: Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making out with Christie
Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston , showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it
Did you know that, Christie
Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening
You actually listen to Whitney Houston
You actually have a Whitney Houston
More than one
She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor
(Ignoring her) It's hard to choose a favorite track among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation and dignity
It's universal message crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves
to act kinder
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves
As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and watches it slide into the machine
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's beautifully stated on the album
- --    of Elizabeth, Christie and Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom
of the bedroom, partially blocked by the video camera in the foreground
Their bodies are an incoherent tangle of arms and legs
The only sounds are moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against flesh
Christie's head and shoulders
Her eyes are shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional performance, turning her head every so often to check the progress of her partners
Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure, moaning loudly
Her voice gets louder and louder and then shifts to actual pain
Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind Christie
There is blood on his face
Christie turns her head and sees him
She screams and leaps off the bed, running out of the room
She slams the mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed
We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming
Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening doors, looking for an escape
She hears the     coming from the bedroom
She opens a closet
The closet lights up as she opens the door and sees two dead, women hanging inside
She screams, then claps a hand over her mouth
She stops and listens She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by the light from a television set
Through the darkness she sees a head on the top of the  and starts to whimper
She runs toward the nearest door
Finding herself in the main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then runs
Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw, spattered with blood
Christie screams and changes direction
Bateman leaps at her, bellowing
They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the bathtub
Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood
Christie falls, tries to get up
Bateman grabs her leg
He tries to bite it
She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the front door
He runs after her
Not the face, you bitch
Not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash
Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door
Bateman runs after her
She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors
She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the buttons
She sees the stairwell and runs for it
Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw
She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims the chainsaw at her and drops it
Christie  , then is suddenly silent
'  we see Christie's body sprawled facedown at the bottom of the stairwell
The chainsaw sticks out of her back like a sword
- An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table
Bateman is at a table with Evelyn
They are both drawing on the tablecloth
Bateman is drawing Christie with the chainsaw in her back
want a firm commitment
think, Evelyn, that we've
lost touch
Evelyn waves to a couple across the room
(Distracted) Why
What's wrong
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but  have no other way to fulfill my needs
The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a new bracelet
Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly
We need to talk
Talk about what, Patrick
What is there to talk about
It's over, Evelyn
It's all over (Motioning to the waiter for water) Touchy, touchy
'm sorry  brought the wedding up
Let's just avoid the issue, alright
Now, are we having coffee
'm fucking serious
It's fucking over
Us
This is no joke
don't think we should see each other anymore
But your friends are my friends
My friends are your friends
don't think it would work
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) You have a little something on your upper lip
(Brushing her hand away) know that your friends are my friends
've thought about that
You can have them
Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a realization dawning
You're really serious, aren't you
Yes,  am
But what about the past
Our past
We never really shared one
You're inhuman
'm
in touch with humanity
Evelyn, 'm sorry
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words) You're just not terribly important to me
Evelyn begins to cry
No, no, no
know my behavior is
erratic sometimes
She reaches desperately across the table and takes his hand
Bateman pulls his hand away
(Sobbing) What do you want me to do, what is it you want
The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare
Bateman is becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed
(Looking uncomfortably around the room) If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now
Oh God,  can't believe this
'm leaving now
've assessed the situation and 'm going
Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself
She blots the tears so they will not affect her make-up
(Surprisingly calm) Where are you going
'm just leaving
But where
have to return some videotapes
He rushes out of the room
- Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat
Here kitty, kitty
The small mangy cat rubs against him
He picks it up and walks toward an , holding the cat
He puts his card in the machine
The screen reads:
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the deposit slot with some difficulty
The kitten squeals
He takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the kitten
He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him
Oh my God
Stop that
What are you doing
Bateman wheels around and shoots her
She falls screaming to the floor
Responding to the gunshot,      in the distance
Bateman breaks into a run
The police car screeches after him
(
) Bateman ducks down an alley
- rushes toward him, seemingly from out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away from him
Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again
He reloads the gun
The sound of more   arriving
He runs out of the alley
- As he reaches the street, he finds approaching
Halt
Put down your weapon
The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air
Bateman shoots at them
The police return fire
Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues shooting wildly
bullet hits the gas tank of one of the police cars
It catches fire and explodes
The flames light up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living and dead
: Bateman flees from the scene
The camera follows him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each one, setting off a cacophony of
draws near
: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a tail, brilliantly lit office building
As he approaches, the lights in the building are going off floor by floor
- He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator
Burning the midnight oil, Mr
Smith
You forgot to sign in
Bateman wheels around and shoots him
He runs toward the revolving doors
As he swings around in the doors, he notices a  who has witnessed the shooting
He revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor
: He runs out of the building and across the street to an identical office building, the one that houses Pierce & Pierce
&   - Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce   and signs in
He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close behind him
'  - Bateman stands looking out through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view of the city and the river
Below him he sees a   swarming over the roof of the opposite building
There are ambulances standing by, flares everywhere, distant sirens
Suddenly,      draws near
Frightened, he drops to the floor behind his desk
Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light
He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling
Harold, it's Bateman
Patrick Bateman
You're my lawyer so  think you should know-'ve killed a lot of people
Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some homeless people, maybe five or ten, an  girl  met in Central Park
left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin' Donuts
killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun
and a man, some old faggot with a dog
Last week killed another girl with a chainsaw- had to, she almost got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, can't remember but she's dead too
And Paul Owen
killed Paul Owen with an ax, in the face
His body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen
don't want to leave anything out here
guess 've killed 20 people, maybe 40- have tapes of a lot of it
Some of the girls have seen the tapes,  even
well,  ate some of their brains and  tried to cook a little
Tonight  just, well,  had to kill a lot of people and 'm not sure  'm going to get away with it this time- mean  guess 'm a pretty sick guy
So-if you get hack tomorrow,  may show up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open
Bateman hangs up the phone
The helicopter searchlight circles back, briefly illuminating the room
The camera rises up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the sky
- and Bateman are sitting at a corner table
(Very surprised) No hash browns
Not in the mood,  guess
But
everyone orders the hash browns here mean- it's-have you been here before
(Deliberately nonchalant) Yes, of course
The hash browns are delicious
'm just
not
ordering them
(Looking at him like he's nuts) Suit yourself,  guess
Pause
So, the night he disappeared
Any new thoughts on what you did
'm not really sure
had a shower
and some sorbet
think maybe you've got your dates mixed up
But how
Where do you place Paul that night
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with
Marcus Halberstam
And
've questioned him
Marcus
Yes
And he denies it
Though at first he couldn't be sure
But Marcus denied it
Yes
Well, does Marcus have an alibi
Yes
pause
He does
You're sure
(smiling) checked it out
It's clean
Oh
Now where were you
(He laughs) (Laughing with him) Where was Marcus
He wasn't with Paul Owen
So who was he with
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and (He pauses, Then looks up) - you
moment of stunned silence
Oh, right
Of course
We had wanted Paul Owen to come
But he said he had plans
guess  had dinner with Victoria
the following night
Personally  think the guy went a little nutso
Split town for a while
Maybe he did go to London
Sightseeing
Drinking
Whatever
Anyway, 'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later
( pause) mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous
Isn't that right, Patrick
McDermott stops by the table
McDERMOTT How's the investigation
Talking to Bateman
Don't believe a word he says
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) Bateman, what's wrong with ,you
Bateman looks at him in silence, panicking
McDERMOTT You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky without ordering the hash browns
Jesus, Bateman, you're a raving maniac
Been at Pierce & Pierce too long
(He wanders off muttering) No fucking hash browns
'   - Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building
He has a surgical mask in one hand
What can  do for you, sir
20B
Of course
Mrs
Wolfe is up there right now
Mrs
Wolfe
The real estate agent
You do have an appointment, don't you
Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway
Owen's door is open
The apartment is freshly painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz
There are flowers everywhere, and a    stands admiring the place talkingto the realtor,
Bateman wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs
He stops at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging
He opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty
Mrs
Wolfe approaches, smiling
Are you my two o'clock
No
Mrs
Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the surgical mash clutched in his hand
Her expression changes
Can  help you
'm looking for
Paul Owen's
place
She stares at him impassively
Doesn't he live here
No, he doesn't
Are you sure
You saw the ad in the Times
No
Yes
mean yes,  did
In the Times
But
doesn't Paul Owen still live here
There was no ad in the Times
Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other
think you should go now
But  think
want to know what happened here
Don't make any trouble
Please
suggest you go
Bateman backs away slowly
Don't come back
won't
don't worry
Mrs
Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall, rattled, and gets into the elevator
- Bateman enters the revolving door of an office building, panicking and breathing heavily
He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks deranged
He goes around the revolving door twice and comes out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a just like him
Hey, Kinsley
Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed
See you at Fluties, okay
The guy walks away, utterly unfazed
Bateman wanders down the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage cans, etc
- Bateman searches his pockets for pills
He finds three different pills and swallows them
He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his face, dialing a number
(
) Patrick Bateman's office
Jean
Hello
Jean
(
) Patrick
Is that you
Hello
Jean,  need help
(
) Where are you
Jean-'m not- (
) Craig McDermott called
He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch
(
) Patrick
can't hear you
What are  doing
(
) Where are you
Patrick, what's wrong
don't think 'm gonna make it, Jean
Pause
to the office this afternoon
(
) Why
(Screaming) Just
say
no
(
) What is it, Patrick
Are you alright
Stop sounding so Fucking sad
Jesus
He hangs up
He throws the Walkman which is around his neck into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his jacket
' - Jean sits at Bateman's desk
She looks around, and then opens his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it
'  - Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking and disheveled
He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, still breathing heavily
Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations
McDERMOTT Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough day at the office
They all laugh
McDERMOTT Hey, look-Price is back
And he's drinking Perrier
He s a changed man
Except
he still can't get a reservation to save his life
Bateman sits down silently
McDERMOTT Why don't you try  50 Wooster
Just fucking call them
(On automatic) 'm not going anywhere unless we have a reservation
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, faggots-just get a res
Keep your shirt on
Maybe lose the suspenders
Bateman spots   at the bar, tenses
(He downs his drink) Excuse me, gentlemen
Right back
He approaches Carnes cautiously
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s
Bateman approaches, trying to act casual
Shut up, Carnes, they will not
Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused
So, Harold, did you get my message
Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling
Then laughs
Jesus, Davis
Yes
That was hilarious
That was you, wasn't it
(Waving smoke out of his face) Yes, naturally
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls
Oh that s fabulous
That's rich
Pause It was a pretty long message, wasn't it
What exactly do you mean
The message you left
Carnes is distracted, waving at people
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia
You're still seeing her, right
But wait, Harold, what do you mean
Carnes isn't really listening
Excuse me
Nothing
Good to see you
Is that Edward Towers
He turns to go
Carnes
Wait
(Sighing) Davis
'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that  couldn't fully appreciate it
wasn't fooled for a second
Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott
Otherwise, it was amusing
Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something
Hilarious, Davis
killer
What are you talking about
Bateman is what
Oh Christ
He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone
what was it you said he did to her
Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing couple
He laughs politely
Now, if you'll excuse me,  really must
(Desperate, shouting) Wait
Stop
You don't seem to understand
You're not really comprehending any of this
killed him
did it, Carnes
'm Patrick Bateman
chopped Owen's fucking head off
tortured dozens of girls
The whole message  left on your machine was true
Excuse me
really must he going
No
Listen, don't you know who  am
'm not Davis, 'm Patrick Bateman
talk to you on the phone all the time
Don't you recognize me
You're my lawyer
Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance
Now, Carnes, listen to me
Listen very, very carefully
killed Paul Owen and  liked it
can't make myself any clearer But that's simply not possible
And  don't find this funny anymore
It never was supposed to he
Why isn't it possible
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly) It's just not
Why not, you stupid bastard
Carnes stares at him
Because  had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London
just ten days ago
No, you
didn't
Now, if you'll excuse me
Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra
They are halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's lying
How can he lie like that
How can he pull that shit
What shit
Now where do we have reservations at
mean 'm not really hungry, but  would like to have reservations somewhere
(To Bateman) don't believe it
He looks so
normal
He seems so
out of it
So
undangerous
McDERMOTT He is totally harmless you geek
Was totally harmless
Just like you are totally harmless
But he did do all that shit and you have failed lo get us into  50, so, you know, what can  say
just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit
How can you be so fucking,  don't know, cool about it
Some guys are just born cool,  guess
Bateman laughs at this
Price shoots him a look
And Bateman, what are   fucking zany about
'm just a happy camper
Rockin' and a-rollin'
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal
Working for  now
McDERMOTT Do you want another Perrier Timothy
Some seltzer water
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless Old codger
But inside
Pause
But inside
The       and we hear Bateman's thoughts: (
) But inside doesn't matter
McDERMOTT (Bored) Inside
Yes, inside
Believe it or not, Price we're actually listening to you
Bateman
Come on, what do you think
Bateman looks up and smiles at Price
Then shrugs
Whatever
The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers
need a Scotch
The sounds of the bar fade down
The following voiceover runs over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking on portable phones, talking, laughing, (
) There are no more barriers to cross
All  have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem  have caused and my utter indifference toward it,  have now surpassed
'  - Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary
We see the pages that she is looking at
They are filled with doodles of mutilated women and their names
Jean looks lost and frightened, and begins to cry
(
) My pain is constant and sharp and  do not hope for a better world for anyone
fact  want my pain to be inflicted on others
want no escape
'  - As the film ends the camera moves  on Bateman
He is leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch, his eyes blank
(
) But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis
gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling
There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this
This confession has meant nothing
The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him: "
