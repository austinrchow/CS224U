Does Chloe kiss as good as  do

Oh, you
She kisses him and they are locked

The  shifts to  :  Just beyond the thicket of lacy vines
It is a slow tracking shot which gives the impression that we are watching the action from the  of another person, an unseen visitor
watching the two teen-aged Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters
This unseen observer will be called the

She reaches up to take his hand away

Somebody'll see
No, they won't
He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so that part of her bra is exposed
He seals her protesting lips by kissing her
From the 's , the   to get a better angle

Come on, Claudette

They kiss again, passionately

Just as it gets to its final position, the  13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane of glass
There is a loud crash
The logo shifts to the upper left corner of the  as we  , white on black

In a   we see the one main street

Superimposed title: in front of the bank reveals a day/date/time/temp sign which blinks: , 13 7:01 60 Degrees , 13 7:01 60 Degrees We can begin to hear a small-town   as a pick-up truck moves down the street past the  in her late teens
She has a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt
She wears her hair in a long braid
She wears Nike jogging shoes
This is

This is Big Dave and it's time for you lazy bones to
It's black cat day in Crystal Lake
Don't forget the big drawing today to see who gets our   13TH Monster Surprise: either a man's digital continuous readout watch or a Panasonic color television set

- In  a hand moves to turn down an old brown plastic radio from which Big Dave is doing his morning-man routine
(
) Don't walk under a ladder
Don't spill any salt, don't
The radio is turned way down
We see that the hand belongs to , a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with a pencil stuck in it
, the boss, is seen in the working the grill
The regulars are there:  five  and two  who always come in for breakfast
They are the retailers, the oil delivery man, the switchboard operators, and the cop

Okay, Annie

He is smirking
He's fifty, strong, and balding
He makes no attempts to hide his appreciation for 's figure
They exits
wouldn't send my kids to that camp for all the tea in China
(kidding) thought you hated your kids
looks around, does a take, then laughs

- walks a half step behind the  , heading for his truck which is parked there on the street
All the girls up there gonna look as good as you
don't know
wonders if she should accept the ride with this guy
Suddenly, from between two parked cars pops , a crazy hobo who has two dead rats in his mouth, their tails in his teeth; they swing from him like a strange beard
Goddamnit, Ralph
Get outta here
(to ) Don't worry about him
He's harmless
(back to Ralph) 'won

It's Friday the 13th
He giggles and skulks away
Climb on up, Miss
The   gives her a boost up and then climbs aboard the rig
: 12
- As the truck pulls away, we see  through the windshield, standing at the edge of the road
He is angry and upset now
He pats his rats
The   shifts, looks over and smiles
His two front teeth are missing on top
Must be the fourth time somebody's tried to reopen that place
Camp Crystal Lake
He nods
Something always happens up there
He turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the  again

- The oil truck thunders along the road
: 14
- The oil truck has stopped
stands alongside the driver's side
Don't let the spooks getcha, Annie
smiles
No sweat
Thanks a lot for the lift
He nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have been if he were thirty years younger
He puts it in gear and roars off
looks around and sees an old gas station
It is closed
There's a sign which reads:  "No Gas 'Til Sat

The dog comes pets him and then heads off up the road
The dog watches her go

It's hot and she's late
She looks up
From her  a Jeep barrels along the road towards us
puts out her numb
: 16
- From the ' , we see  waiting for a lift
The , unseen, shifts down until  is alongside
The Jeep, an uncovered model, stops
smiles a big delicious smile at us as we sit in the 's seat
Hiya
'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake
Can you help me out
Apparently the  nods, because  beams at us
She tosses her pack in the back and hops aboard
The accelerates

The sun and shadows keep us from seeing the

- Still in the 's , the  watches as  looks around, admires the woods, the Jeep, the day
Things are going her way
can't remember being this excited about anything

hate it when people call 'em kids
Sounds like little goats
The forest outside the speeding Jeep is deeper and signs of civilization have all but disappeared
still turns and looks at the  when she speaks to the
(continuing) The job market for teachers is supposed to be the pits these days, but  don't care
When you have a dream as long as have, you'll do anything
look of surprise passes 's young face
(continuing) Wasn't that Camp Crystal Lake
Just back there

- In the  the sign for Camp Crystal Lake
In the , the Jeep roars off into the distance

/'  - (frightened, confused) think we better stop
Please stop
Please
Stop
The Jeep's speed increases
(continuing) Please
grabs for the ignition key, but the 's hand darts out and slaps  away
We see that this hand is missing its little finger
Panicked, without any other recourse,  looks about her and then leaps from the moving Jeep, aiming for the relatively soft underbrush alongside the narrow road
: 21
- lands, rolls, is upended, scratched by brambles, and flips
She scrambles to her feet and starts running towards the camp
: 22
- The Jeep stops, turns quickly, heads back for her
: 23
- From the 's  we see  run, looking back in fear
: 24
- 's feet pound the hard-packed dirt
She looks over her shoulder to see the Jeep
The sun flares on the Jeep's windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of the
In a final desperate move,  drives into the underbrush to escape
The Jeep skids to a stop

/ - The  becomes the  and chases into the thicket
Branches and briars snap back at us
Just ahead, the terror- stuck  stumbles and falls
She screams as a knife flashes past her in a blur
When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise on 's face
The
Her throat has been cut
She collapses out of

: 26
- gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway
We hear rock 'n roll  coming from a car radio as this much-in- need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car
: 27
- In the camper van are three young people
They are full of fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake
They are instantly likeable
At the wheel is , a short 22-year-old whose well-developed upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting
He is nice- looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction
He is funny and alert
Next to him is , an athlete whose clean-cut look is as American as popcorn
He is quieter, two years younger and not as smart as
He has to think things through
is 's girlfriend
She is leaning over the front passenger seat so she can messenger 's shoulders
She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun
She enjoys every minute of every day
She hasn't been touched by tragedy
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy
There you are dead wrong
Ha
Sometimes  only think about kissing women
finds a sore spot on 's back
Ow
was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake
Besides yourself
You are a true pierce of work, Ned
hits  on the arms, playfully
(continuing) How about our last jay
Good call
reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a joint
What about the dope paragraph in Mr
Christy's letter
Quote:  Controlled substances are expressly forbidden
Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal
Unquote
We got two weeks before the kids even arrive
Then 'll act responsibly
Until then, hit me
She takes the lighted joint and tokes
: 28
- The van turns past the sign that reads: --Established 1935 : 29
- is wide-eyed, looking at the lush surroundings
It's beautiful
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years
: 30
- The   what  saw
The buildings are run down at the heels
It is the same camp we saw in the early scenes, but time has torn the place badly
The van passes the  and we see the three new looking out the window
: 31
- This is the main building
It is the building where Barry and Claudette met
Outside is a flagpole, a small parking area, a large overhanging tree
In the  we can see part of the lake
In the  there is a Jeep
: 32
- An axe flashes through the  and hacks apart the halves of a huge tree stump
The    to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs, a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat
This is He is strong, charming, and engaging
He is animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to do things
In the  the van comes to a stop
No sooner has  hopped down, than  is beckoning him over
Wanta give me a hand here
smiles and comes quickly
(continuing) Alice
steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had polio when he was a kid
His upper body is strong, but his legs are slightly deformed
He and  hustle over to the big stump
(continuing) Wanta roll this sucker out of the way
Alice
comes into the
She is carrying a shovel and a bucket and has obviously been working for a couple of hours
Cabin  is ready
Push on this side
Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned
Push
They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work
(continuing) That's got her
Thanks
'm Steve Christy
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake
You got some grubby clothes
Climb into 'em
Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse

What happened to Brenda
You told her to sweep the courts

Let's go, folks
As soon as he's gone,  turns to

shrugs
You can changed in three

- The  looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull up
brush slaps into view
is sweating while finishing a coat of paint on the last canoe
is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore
He rubs his long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone call his name
He turns to see  at the bottom of the trail
Steve said for you to start on the boats
finished the boats
nods slowly
'll tell him
She turns away
Alice
The others show up
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen
Annie
puts his brush in a coffee can of turps
look at him, then turns again
You think you're gonna last all summer
'm not sure 'll last all week
(pauses) 'll tell Steve
: 34
'  - and  are rehanging a door
Next to them is , a dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting the wall
On the other side  is scraping some flaking paint
Shim it up just a scooch
levers the door higher at the top
(continuing) Perfection
Hold it
uses a long ratchet screwdriver
(continuing) To answer your question, my parents once owned this camp
There were some tragic accidents and they went bankrupt promised them 'd reopen if  could
See if it closes right now
swings the door on its hinges
Looks good
Perfection
Did you meet Brenda
turns and nods
(continuing) She's archery
He's rifle ranged
And 'm behind schedule
Let's go, Ned
They exit with the tool box
stops and turns to , who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead
: 35
- , , , , ,  and  are lugging a swimming float down to the water's edge
supervises as he carries the thing, which is quite heavy
They ad-lid as appropriate
("There goes my hernia
" "Are you sure you're lifting
" "Not so fast
" "'m walking backward
") They drop the things carefully
Come on back here and let's above the float in
They get behind it and shove it into the water
hops aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand
: 36
- The screen has gone completely black
The door to the shed is whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the sun
There is a shape
The    so that we can see that  has come in on an errand
As  looks around, we can take the time to see that there are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests, etc
Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives in sheathes, also hanging neatly
Suddenly a hand comes into  and touches  on the shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task
turns with a start
He looks into the
to see  standing in the doorway
What are those for
An Indian raid
She points to the row of hatchets and knives
Steve's got a woodlore program
You see any life rings
looks behind some piled up equipment
She pulls out two rings
Here
Meet me in my cabin after taps
Okay, Camper
She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose
For sure
They exit together
: 37
&   - comes upon , who is renailing floorboards on the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin
On the railing is a sketch pad which Steve thumbs through
:  '
It is a moody pierce, a sense of foreboding dominates it
Otherwise, it is the camp's central compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus
You draw very well
Oh, thanks
wish  could spend more time at it
misses a nail and hits her thumb
She reacts good- naturedly and keeps on working
bends down next to
This isn't your cup of tea, hunh
She shakes her head
(continuing) Any particular reason
Just a feeling
(pause) Nothing personal
(nodding) You want to leave
don't know
Probably be best for everybody
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but  mean to make it my whole life
It's been my whole life
Gimme a chance
Stay a week
Help get it ready
Next Friday, if you're not happy, 'll put you on the bus myself
'll be grateful
He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek
She looks up
She nods
Next Friday
Thanks, Alice
He stands up
(continuing) 've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but 'll be back around ten
If you're still up, we can talk, okay
Sure
She watches him cross out of

-  () is at the wheel of his Jeep
The  are standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep
You want it listed separately
Yeah
Brenda, after lunch hit the archery range
If Annie gets here, have her start in on the kitchen
Do your best
Tomorrow we have a preliminary inspection by the state safety people
'd like to look good
He wheels the car around and out the driveway
The others stand looking before  breaks the silence
He neglected to mention this place is called "Camp Blood" downtown
They are all getting back to work
How come
Some campers drowned
Then some counsellors got killed
No shit
When
Late fifties sometime
They never caught the guy who did it either
Neddy collects weird facts
Next he is going to tell us that there are poisonous snakes in the outhouse and green lizards in the lake
As they laugh, the   on
: 39
- has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job
She enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of this area
She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated
rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter and heads for a tripod in the middle distance
There are already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far
The targets are heavy
This isn't an easy one-person job
The    tighter and tighter on her as she gets closer to setting up the target
In , she lifts a target up
Her head is very close to the face of the target
She gets it up, lets the tripod take the weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by eighteen inches
whips around
:  a very cocky , standing by the lean- to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked simultaneously
He has a feather stuck in his hair
She grabs the arrow and storms at him
You're crazy
She snaps the arrow in half
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry
(plussed) don't believe you
Want to see my trick shot
It's even better
still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's little she can do
She laughs
(still laughing) You ever fire one of those bows again, and 'll tack you up on the wall to dry
God, but  love that sexy talk
snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows
: 40
&   - This is a fairly large single room
The walls are bare and uninsulated
There are a few easels, but for the most part, the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches
The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey wood interior appear silver-colored
, her hair in a bandana, has just finished sweeping up
The  picks up on 's sketch of the central camp area on one easel
On a second easel she has done the preliminary sketch of the lake itself
It is also a moody picture
cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a little, then goes on to her next task
There is a row of newly- arrived cardboard boxes
She opens the first in  with a matte knife
She take out the invoice and checks it against the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the campers will make lanyards
: 41
&   - We watch through one of the dusty panes, seeing the charcoal sketch in the ,  in the  checking her materials against her invoice
: 42
&   -  () snaps around, sensing that she is being watched
In her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane
Her face relaxes until
The sound of a door slamming echoes through the room
The    from her face to see someone standing in the doorway
It is
Sorry
How you doing
smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory
watches her
Did you want something
She starts to take a box down from a high shelf
She doesn't realize that there is something on top of the box
Steve said you were thinking of leaving
True
Un-hunh
lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working tools clatters down, shattering the silence
fends off the flying implements and  rushes to her side
(continuing) Oh, my God
You okay
She nods
(continuing) You're lucky
They stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor
looks at her while they work
(continuing) How come you're leaving
It's long and personal
It has nothing to do with you or the other kids
Maybe  can help
looks at  and smiles
This really is a very nice, if naive, young man
And it's this place
It makes no sense, but it spooks me
(smiling) You're right
It makes no sense
As  nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside
: 43
&   - is the source of the scream
She runs towards the , dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter
Her feet are bare
When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by and  who have found two giant green bullfrogs
The screams were not serious and  is doing some of it for effect
brings up the rear
They are all dressed more or less for a frolic in the lake
and  stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin is smiling,  is a little bit amused
Help me
Save me
The frog people are after me
It's swim time at Camp Crystal Lake
Come on, Alice,  need protection
: 44
- reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull of a hot afternoon
At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of the group:  , , , ,  and
They are sitting or paddling or diving off the float
There is no real attempt to exert too much energy
Gradually we become aware that this    is someone's The  moves from its stable position, now hand-held, on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight
Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through
Occasionally, we can see part of the 's arm fending off the underbrush
: 45
- The group sits or lies in the cool water, more or less focused on , who is acting as moderator
What do you want to be when you grow up
Dancer
Cowboy
Girls can't be cowboys
Okay, Fireman
goes to
Jack
Coach, athletic director somewhere
Filmmaker
Artist
Doctor
Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be

Vitamin 's supposed to neutralize the nitrites or something

He looks with googly eyes at
There are sand sharks in this lake and they can eat the bathing suit right off you

(continuing) See
'm getting to you
Very slowly
does a porpoise drive and disappears
is not laughing
She is looking off towards the cabin area
sees her and look where she looks
What'd you see
don't know
Marcie's got me paranoid
She smiles
: 48
'  - The , shooting from the 's , moves to a place alongside Alice's cabin
There is underbrush about two feet tall and all around that area
The  stops, leans down and reaches into  with a gloved hand
The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a burlap bag which has been secreted there
The hand lifts the bag, which has something in it that moves
The   around to the side of the cabin right below the window
The window is open, making entry quite simple
The 's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake
One hand has the animal firmly behind the jaws
The hand takes the snake and puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white coverlet
It slithers across the bed
The 's hand closes the window

It still hurts

We were supposed to meet in
When  got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife

What'll you do when you leave here

- machete rips through some vines
Again it hacks at the brush
to reveal  clearing away the years of vine growth which have choked off a path
He wipes the perspiration from his eyes and continues along
: 51
- Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area
There are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's an aging set of parallel bars
There is even a set of weights made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement
of 's face in a distorted, twisted expression
He explodes his breath
We   to see  watching  work out on the uneven parallel bars
He is really very good and there is no doubt about his strength
Not bad
As  moves off the apparatus,  comes in and does a neat little turn which is dazzling
does a take
Holy shit
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we
: 52
- The sun has dropped lower on the horizon
The  looks down on  as she sleeps peacefully in the late sun
shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with a start
to see  standing over her with a machete

What time is it
Almost five

Now 'm only eleven hours behind schedule
Steve is going to have a small cow
They walk away from the shore

We realize we have seen this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it
You can only do what you can do
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes--like you don't care about children
laughs at her imitation
(continuing) 'll see you later
She turns to go up the steps to her front door
Alice
She stops and look down at him
He is serious and he cares
appreciates what's she's just heard
She knows that it wasn't easy for  to say
You're very nice
They share a short silent moment
Hope you will
smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long blade
watches him go
She shrugs
This might be a good place to stay
She turns and goes into her cabin
: 54
'  - In the  is the camp bed with its white coverlet
The snake is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere
is humming to herself and is happier now than she has been since we met her
The room is small
There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden dresser with a cloudy mirror on top
The walls are a light blue, freshly painted
The wall on the inside does not go all the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side
looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what she sees
She pushes her hair so that she looks a little sexier
She smiles at herself
She reaches out in
Open a drawer
Takes out a towel
turns and goes to her footlocker
Bends down and opens it up
Takes out a terrycloth robe
She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door
: 55
'  - heads from her cabin to the showers
: 56
- walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a towel-turban
She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for her hairbrush
She takes her towel off and lets her tangled hair fall down
She hums
Opens her top drawer
Nothing there
Opens the next drawer
Nothing there
Opens the next drawer
Nothing there
opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes
It flails at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier as having a Navajo bracelet on it
The snake strikes the bracelet, hangs on as  tries to shake it free
The snake falls to the floor and recoils for another attack
There is no way that  can get past the snake to run away
Her scream is loud
: 57
- , returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears (
) Help
doesn't hesitate
Carrying his machete, he runs to 's cabin
and  follow in the
: 58
'  - is backed against the wall
The snake could strike and get her
runs into the room, still carrying his machete
He looks at
(a tight whisper) There's a fucking snake in here
sees it
He freezes, then takes a step forward
Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the machete, cutting the snake into two pieces
Blood spurts onto the floor
and  enter
carries a shovel as a weapon
stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further to see the blood and guts
Steve never mentioned serpents
Jack, would you get some paper towels
nods and exits
How the
did he get in there
Slipped in
Probably liked the scent of your perfume
return and tosses a roll to
Thanks
You okay now
nods
gives her an extra hug
Then steps back awkwardly, stepping on 's big toe
Go ahead
walk on 'em all the time
(to ) Would you shovel Mr
Snake outta here
nods
He picks up his shovel and we see in  as he gets underneath the wide-fanged snake
begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper toweling
: 59
- Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among the late afternoon rays of the sun
We can hear the sounds of the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt
: 60
- The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the same room, cut off by a partition
The kitchen has a couple of sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and some windows which look out on the rear
is making a salad for herself
She is a vegetarian
is making a guacamole dip
In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table
and  are playing
She all right
Get ready for the schneider
Yeah
Scared the hell out    No chance
of her
Four zip
How'd it get in the drawer
walks into the kitchen
She has washed her face after getting her act together
She stands in the doorway to the kitchen
How you doin'
Okay
Can  help
It's catch as catch can
'm making a salad
The guys are planning to cook greaseburgers for themselves
There's a lot of dishes if you just want something to do
smiles
Nods
The way  feel, that's perfect
goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the dirty dish pan
comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and pieces of old Indian costumery
He does a bad dance
and  quit their game and come to the doorway
What the hell
Where'd you get that stuff
Oh, Lord
Neddy
It's gonna be a long summer
Wait, wait
When  was finding these goodies in the shed
also found this letter which a camper never sent home
Listen
He takes a letter out of his breechclout
He pretends to read, when really we can see that the paper is blank
(improvising) Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine except for the strange man who flies at night and sucks our counsellor's body
leans against the sink and laughs
She is a very pretty girl, younger than she first appeared
(continuing) And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor
He says that whenever 'm scared,  can sleep in his bunk with him
and  laugh
takes off his headdress
(continuing) No wonder they lost America
How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that
What's to eat
Whatever you make yourself
looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side
Does she sees something
The    to look over her shoulder
The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but there is something standing there out by a cabin
But it stands, doesn't move
Is it a building
to see  using her dishcloth to clear the glass
When we  , the shape is gone
:
Curious
cold chill
looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about food
How can you eat that stuff
You like them rare
Looks like dead animals
Too bad that Annie never Cannibals
It's old          showed
She was supposed counsellor
to be a good cook
You can get all the protein   No way  am gonna play chef you need if you mix them      to all of you guys
It's right
women's lib from here on out
The squaws are revolting
looks up
Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room
The bulb does not light
pulls it again
Trouble
Bad bulb or no power
It's getting a little gloomy in here
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator
The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty
God, but  love that macho talk
Emergency generators
The Indian used campfires
turns to
Give me a hand
For sure
: 61
- steps in and, in , we see there is a puddle where he is standing
The puddle is somehow significant
leans over 's shoulder to see what he's doing
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine
Here we go
The  watches 's actions tightly
In a   we see 's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he concentrates
He bites down on it
:  as  pulls the starter cord
The engine roars into action
(yelling) Now ya' close the switch
as 's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal switch
spark arcs and we   to see  with a perfect connection running through his body
There is a sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, screams, the generator chugs roughly
Hundreds of volts are streaking through 's body and grounded through his wet shoes
reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop- kick on his friend, severing the contact
stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead
The machine stops
: 62
- lands, almost unconscious
kneels into  and cheeks 's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his breathing
shakes his head
'll be okay
Holy shit
Don't get up
Take a second
lies back down
Covers his eyes with his arm
You saved my life
had to
Thanks
figured if  didn't save you
'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite
looks up and smiles
give him a hand and the groggy athlete gets to his feet
Whew
Satisfied that  won't fall down,  goes to the shed and looks in
We can look in over 's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred switch and a now-silent generator
This puddle was enough to ground you all the way to China
looks in, too
Floor probably leaks
This area is full of springs
short somewhere
leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches another wire
(continuing) There's the problem, Jack
Wire worked itself loose
He starts to wind it round a set-screw in
Just in cause this bugger goes bad
'm gonna pick up some lanterns from the equipment shack
walks away
: 63
- The door opens at us, letting in the limited light
comes in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp
He flicks it on
As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets and knives
They are all missing
takes his booty and exits
The light is gone and we are alone in the dark
: 64
- of the lightbulb over the kitchen area
It flickers on as we hear in the  the sound of the generator start up
The bulb glows, goes down, glows cheerily
What hath God wrought
That was the telephone
Ha
You wily oriental
The phone was "Mr
Watson, come in here,  need you
" "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph
comes in with his lanterns followed by
Last line of Gone With the Wind
Frankly, Scarlet,  don't give a damn
listens as she washes the dishes
It looks as if things will be okay
Shows how much you know
It's something about tomorrow
Tomorrow is another day
Right
Right
is finishing up making her green California dip
Suddenly  cries out
Everybody whips around to see
holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a bottle
She has cut her finger
It is not a serious cut, but the blood is visible
This just plain ain't my day
reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid
You okay
Those things can be nasty
Wash it out real good
comes up to
Lemme see
Doesn't look too bad
That said, the  go back to what they were doing
and  are featured even though we can hear the others
takes great care and puts the BandAid on 's finger
They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest continues
Who played the role of Gorgon in Star Trek
don't want you getting      Melvin Belli
hurt
Aaaargh
That my was careless
guaranteed winner
How'd it get in there
Melvin Belli
Somebody probably dropped something too hard
Alice, you're just lucky there are no snakes in the dishwater here
is hovering over a bowl of California dip which has just made
He dips a chip as soon as she steps back
Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy
Suddenly 's face goes red
His eyes bulge out
He grabs his throat and gags
Coughs, can't clear it
What is it
Is it stuck
points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he writhes about
Help him
Oh, my God
Roll him over
Get behind him more
As  and  flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich, stops his act and grins from ear to ear
It's a big finish: Ta-da
: as it sinks in that  has been putting them on
Not funny, Ned
stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens
But it's in the brochure
"Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program
"  You just saw it
tries to laugh it off
They shake their heads walks away
looks at
Chance to get even
'll spot you five points
Hey, look, 'm sorry
'll never do it again
turns and heads for the door
comes up next to him
The  are out of earshot now
and  play a little ping-pong
is a little embarrassed by his play-acting stunt
(continuing) 'm sorry
Ned
We're gonna be working together for a while
You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay
relaxes
Nods
He knows what she means
He turns to look at the others
Tell 'em 'm sorry
nods
Sure
'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's
Today wiped me out
(pause) Thanks, Alice
You're welcome
The  stays on 's face as  exits
In the , speaks
hope that's the last time we see the Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program
: 65
- We watch  come away from the main cabin and walk moodily toward his cabin
The  stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush
It cuts through
He flips a few stones in his hand
looks off
Sees something
:  a shape--a human shape--standing by a cabin
walks towards it
Hello
Can  help you
: 66
- is just drying her hands
She stands next to a giant stack of clean dishes and pots
is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower and cucumber slices
and  saunter in
You just had some lucky shots
Where's Ned
He went to bed early
don't blame him
He's probably setting up another one of his practical jokes
Yeah, like draining the lake
They laugh
(to ) Hey, how about a walk by the lake
The  all go "Ooooooooh
" (continuing) Just a walk, for Chrissakes
(kidding) Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here
(to ) Wait a minute, 'll get my diaphragm and be right with you
puts an arm through 's arm and they exit
The  laugh
: 67
- and  walk across the pint needles towards the lake
There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on the horizon
and  walk along the shore to the lake
They have turned on the flashlights which they carry with them
Wind's up
It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees
Makes me want to hold on and never let go
love you
love you
They kiss
pulls back
(continuing) What about Neddy
don't love Neddy
He keeps on acting like such an asshole
(yelling) Ned
Don't call him
thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures
Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know
guess
The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light
Looks like a storm
'm a little scared of storms
Always have been
Since  was a kid
You
The brick
shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie shadows
She flashes hers at him
've dreamed this dream
Maybe half a dozen times
There is a thunderstorm
The rain comes down like pebbles
can hear the sound
try to close my ears off
It doesn't work
The sounds gets louder
The rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers
And the sound stops
loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart
is startled and reaches out for her lover
It's just a dream
call it my shower dream
They look at one another in the two lights
They grin
Rain drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them
This is no dream
Want to escape for a while
Lead the way
turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin
is only a half step behind, laughing
we watch them run
There is no theme, just the rumble of thunder
: 68
'  - The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and and  rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the nearest bed
Are you wet
Just a little
Wait a minute, woman
He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points straight up and gives them some light to see by
They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by 's hand coming up from behind  and tugging his t-shirt up towards his head
He leans back and takes it off, and tosses it at the
: 69
- The rain has gathered in intensity
comes up to the front door and looks out
comes up behind her
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched
Not if they're where  think they are
laughs
'm not always this stupid
She turned back into the cabin
: 70
'  - on  and  as they make love under a camp blanket
Their breathing and noises are heard just above the sounds of the rain outside
The  becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and dribbled down
As the bed shakes with its love-making, the up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course
As the   , it pulls back slightly and we see lying in the upper bunk
In a flash of lightning we realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed
:   and  lie completely still beneath their blanket
The   along their quiet bodies
's face is contented
is ready to doze off
Mmmmmmmph
Mmmmmmmph
Best over
Umhummmmph
Like waves
It's never been likes waves before
Whassamatta
Gotta pee
You're lying on my bladder
She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt
While still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited clothing
gives her room
(dressing) know this ain't very romantic, but what can  say
don't want to explode
She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone
lies back and puts his hands under his hand
: 71
- runs across the now-wet central area towards the bathroom facility
She tries to skip between the raindrops, but she knows she'll get a drenching
: 72
'  - rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette and lights it
He inhales deeply, rolls on his back
Something overhead catches his eye
Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors
We hear the toilet flush
We   the toilet booth as  stands reading the graffiti to herself
We can only see her from the chest up
(reading) "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie Makit
"  "The Yellow Stream by
Daley
"  Not the most original stuff, kids
There is a noise outside the stall
(continuing) Jack
She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is playing tricks with her
picks up the flashlight and exits the stall
73     crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the flashlight down and turns on the water faucet
There is no water
: ' :  of
From the end of the row of showers, we watch  bend under the sink and turn on one of the spigots
Water rushes into the sink
74     :  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and turns off the water
Again she hears a noise
She looks to the row of showers and smiles
Jack
The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut
looks over, smiles
She thinks someone is trying to scare her
(continuing) Jack
Neddy
Don't put me on
There is a dripping sound
stops at the first shower, hesitates
Throws back the first curtain
There is no one there
She reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off
She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the empty toilet
Then reaches in to the shower curtain
(continuing) Allee allee infree
She throws back the curtain
Again no one is there
She breathes a sigh of disappointment
(continuing) Must be my imagination
In  she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the explodes with a
It happens in a flash
shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first shower
hatchet glints
screams
The hatchet strikes
The flashlight clatters to the floor
: 75
- The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an establishing shot of the diner
Through the window, which are being pelted with rain, we can see a  and some seated on stools at the counter
: 76
- The  is different from the morning woman, slightly older, but still attractive
She says good night to her , who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the counter
Seated there is  , finishing his cup of coffee
The waitress, , picks up his empty pie plate and tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes
Anything else you want
No, thanks
'm fine
Sandy
You can't go back there tonight
Not in that stuff
'Less you wanta get drownded
(drinking quickly) got to
Aw
likes  and enjoys flirting with him
have six new counsellor up there
They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain
How much do  owe you
One night on the town
mean
know what you mean
Two and a quarter
Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone
pays up and walks to the cash register
(continuing) You got a roof for that Jeep
She rings up the money
Gives him his change
He hands her a tip
Yeah
got it on before this-- (indicates the storm outside) --all started
That's thirty percent
For two lonely nights
She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that extra makeup
Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb self
smiles and leaves
She watches, then counts her changes and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day
: 77
- The rain continues as  exits the diner, gets in his Jeep and starts it up
He roars off through a big puddle, splashing water towards the
The Jeep pulls a small equipment trailer
: 78
- The Jeep plows through the rain, leaving the town lights behind
sign off to the side reads: 45 Mi
: 79
- ' :  From outside the cabin, we can see some activity in the big meeting room
The  moves slightly from left to right as the shot is established
Then an unseen hand releases a branch which partially blocks the shot
: 80
- enters from the kitchen, carrying two cups of coffee
She hands one to , who is curled up on the couch in front of the fire
stands to the left of the hearth, picks up a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn
You think they fell asleep
Anything's possible
My parents taught me to leave sleeping lovers alone
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon
It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them
Good point
Well, it hasn't been that long
smiles
Long enough for me
They laugh
think we should go wake them up
Just in case
Give them a little while longer
It's still early, anyway
guess
: 81
- The rain is very heavy
Steve's Jeep drives past the
The tires squish in the muddy roadway
: 82
'  - Lighted by dash panel,  tries to concentrate on seeing the road
He leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get rid of the condensation
From his  we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay ahead of the rain
Beyond them the headlights make a slight dent in the night
In the  we hear a country station on the radio, but it is bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical storm
's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio
: 83
- has finished her coffee
enters, shakes the rain off his poncho and stamps his feet
Got to it just in time
The generator was running on fumes
filled it up
That should keep it humming until Steve gets back
gets up
Good night, Alice
Good night, Brenda
takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her head like a portable tent, she races off into the night
watches her go
glimmer of lightning outlines her as she heads off
walks back into the big room, followed by
Help you clean up
Absolutely
She walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups into the kitchen
: 84
- The door opens and  comes in with her lantern and slicker
Her actions are direct and business-like
goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an examination lamp
She takes out a toothbrush and some other toilet articles
She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out
She put her lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves
She stands up, and washes her hands and face
She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound that Marcie had heard
looks off at the shower stalls, shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit
: 85
- 's Jeep coughs, sputters, stalls
we can hear him trying to re-start his dead engine
-r-r-r
: 86
'  - angrily steps on the gas again and hits the starter
-r-r-r-rrr
nothing
He looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view mirror
, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to flag down the oncoming car
: 87
- smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police car, driven by a middle-aged cop named
has the window down already
told you not to buy that hunk of junk
think water got into the electrical system
You ride me back to camp
'll get one of my counsellors to drive me back tomorrow morning
Why not
is around the car and hopping in almost before can answer
(continuing) "To serve and protect" don't mean to chauffeur
He puts the car in gear and roars into the night
: 88
' /'  - Under a single hanging lightbulb,  finishes writing at a small table
The weather howls outside
There's a tapping sound looks up
Listens, yawns, then gets up and starts to take off her clothes
: 89
'  - Through her window we can see  changing into her soft yellow pajamas
: 90
'  - The tapping returns
That could drive a person bug-city
The  is apparently coming from the front of the cabin; perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet
grabs her slicker and heads out
The    through the darkened cabin to the front door
: 91
'  - There is a small roof overhang like a porch, affording some protection from the wind and wet
, :  as  hears the tapping sound closer by
She looks and sees
:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a string and left it dangling from the eaves
The wind blows, making the knife tap against the building
Neddy
Cut the screwing around, Neddy
She grabs the knife, breaking the string
(continuing) This isn't even half funny
Angry,  turns and goes back inside the cabin
: 92
'  - comes in shaking off her slicker, carrying the knife
Christ, what a jerk
The single bulb goes out
(continuing) Great
Now what
crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a match
She fires up the propane lantern
(continuing) Looks like  turn in early
She moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed
She reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear, revealing something that has been left there
:  Fear spreads across her face
:      :   camp hatchet lies across her pillow
The shiny blade is marked with blood
turns and runs from her room
: 93
/ - runs through the rain, her flimsy pajamas drenched
Her bare feet slip in the mud
She heads for a small rise that leads to the softball field
: 94
- of  running across the softball diamond
: 95
- :  a hand reaches in and slams on a circuit breaker
: 96
- :  Two large spot lights on a telephone pole light up
: 97
- The softball field is now lit
is confused
She looks off behind the backstop
Then to center field
Confused, she runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind third base
The  slowly zooms in on the darkness where exited
We hold on that spot for several seconds
Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream
Then another
: 98
- is at one of the windows
don't here it anymore
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain
It sounded like Brenda
'll go take a look
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field
We are looking over at her shoulder
The distant glimmer suddenly goes dark
joins her and looks
Where
They're off now
heads for the door
'll go check on Brenda
Okay
turns
is halfway out the door
(continuing) 'll go with you
shrugs
If it'll make you feel better
: 99
- The rain continues as they drive along
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th
They keep statistics
We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon
It affects people
Makes 'em nuts

Another coincidence
Yeah
: 100
- turns as the cop's car door slams
peels out on the wet road
as  watches the lights grow dim in the distance
:  as  turns and jogs the other way
Low thunder rolls in the distance
: 101
'  - and  have made their way to 's cabin
From the outside they can see the Coleman lantern burning on the table within
Brenda
Brenda
You there
There is no response
The  stays in a  of  as she and  cross up the stairs and into the cabin

They go to the door

Jack
Marcie
Hey, guys
opens the door to the cabin
: 104
'  - The door opens at us
We see the silhouetted figures of and
flips on the light switch
The cabin is empty
Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the contents neatly laid out
: 105
- It is dark inside
The door slams open at us as  and make their way inside
Marcie
Brenda
Jack
walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers
(continuing) think we should call the police, Bill
, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods and turns back to
Okay
They exit
There is a beat
and then a slickered shape passes between us and the night sky light which comes through the windows
The shape is dragging something
: 106
- and  are on the porch of one of the cabins
To the left of the door is a small sign that reads:  "Office
" tries the door, but cannot open it
Sucker's locked
Who's got the key
ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and comes up with a short 2x4
She crosses to the door and smashes through one of the window panes
She puts her arm through the broken glass, unlocks the door and enters
follows
The  continues to watch them from outside the cabin
They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's desk
picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch on the desk set several times
(continuing) It's dead
Try the pay phone
Do you have a dime
quarter
No
There must be some in the desk somewhere
They fumble through the desk to find some change
finds some in the postage drawer
He then crosses over to a pay phone mounted on the wall
The  moves to the cornice of the building where the phone line exits
It follows the link up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and phone lines come in from the pole
Here we see a dangling phone cable which has been recently cut
, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead telephone
(
) Hello
Hello
This damn thing's dead, too
: 107
- and  comes out into the rain, heading for the camper van
They hop in
: 108
/  - slides behind the wheel
The keys are in the ignition
hops in on the passenger side
turns over the engine
It grinds away but does not catch
From an  behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine fail to catch
We look in the mirror and see someone standing in the distance, watching
gets out of the driver's side
Slams the door
The with him as he opens the door to the engine
joins him as he shines his light on the engine
What's the matter with it
Wet
don't know
He tries a few more times
Why don't we run
Just run now
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads
Steve'll be back in an hour
Things will straighten out then
We'll take his Jeep and get help
He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands
(continuing) Don't worry
There is probably some really stupid explanation for all this
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll smile
(pause) Promise
nods
: 109
- In the  we see a camp sign
In the  we see a figure running towards us
The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as Just as he's about to make the turn into the driveway, he looks up and smiles
He stops and catches his breath as the other person catches him in the light of a flashlight
Hi
What are you doing out in this mess
He shields his eyes from the light
: 110
- From across the lake, the lights from the camp twinkle through the rain drops
: 111
- The  as  moves to the shed
The noise of the generator grows louder as the door is opened
: 112
- sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap
In the , sits on the couch, dozing
On the coffee table in front of her is a large machete
's eyes are closing
He jerks himself awake, then starts to doze again
The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out
snaps awake
He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks it on
Oh, shit
He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some lanterns
He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong table
checks on , makes sure she's asleep, then exits, carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp
on 's peaceful face as she slumbers
: 113
- The rain has lessened a bit
approaches the shed with his fluorescent lamp and rifle
He has the rifle at the ready
on his hand on the door handle
He pulls it open
: 114
- The generator stands there quietly
comes into view, spraying the interior with lamplight
In the  a broken sparkplug which  does not see immediately
It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer
goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top
He looks in--there is enough gas
He puts the cap back on
Then his eye catches something
He looks at the broken plug
He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it
He puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed
: 115
- sits up into the , startled and afraid
Bill
She gets her bearings and looks around
Stands up
She looks at the bulb overhead
Pulls its string
No light
She sees the lanterns which have been placed around
(continuing) The generator
Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a little
Smiles
She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern, and walks into the kitchen
: 116
- puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea kettle with water
She puts it on the stove and pops on a burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee
Impatient and curious, she walks to the front door of the cabin and looks out
Bill
Bill
The calm which she had grasped a few moments before is beginning to desert her
: 117    :  Whistling tea kettle on the kitchen stove
: 118
- takes the kettle off the flame
The whistling stops abruptly
pours water into the two cups
She stirs the coffee
Unable to contain her impatience any longer,  picks up her lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door
: 119
- walks very quickly around the side of the cabin, headed for the generator shed
Bill
: 120
- The door to the shed is closed
looks around and then puts a hand on the hand
In  we see the hand pull
The door doesn't budge
:   decides to pull harder
She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs
She pulls until she finally wrenches the door open
The lamp casts long shadows upwards
The generator sits silent
leans into the shed to look
The   very slowly around behind her so that we can see behind the right-hand corner of the building
As we clear the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down from a branch above
The something turns slowly in the wind
It is --dead--in a travesty of the martyrdom of St
Sebastian, shot with arrows
comes out of the shed, distraught
Bill
She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body
:
She is riveted with horror, unable to move or turn or run
The  screams with the , the insistent , a shriek and a thunderclap
finally gives voice to her terror--again and again
She turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main cabin
(continuing) Help
Help
: 121
- bursts through the front door into
Jack
Marcie
Help me
: 122
- races to the coffee table, looking for 's machete
It is not there
The knife
She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it
:  as she scrabbles on all fours
Nothing under the couch
gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the lamp
Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass, shattering the pane in the window opposite
It is , long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced
sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front door
flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited figure
screams
The figure holds  in a strong grasp
When  focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early forties
She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking
This is
She wants  to stop shrieking long enough to tell her what the matter is
sobs incoherently, pointing back to the rear window
There now, my dear
Please
can't help you if you can't talk to me
There, there now
allows the woman to lead her back into the room
leads  to the couch
In the  we can see the broken window, but  is not visible
He's dead
She's dead
all dead
Please save me
oh
poor Bill
Oh my God, oh my God
oh God
It will be all right
'll take care of you
Jack
Marcie
Ned
comforts her with a strong arm
It's just this place
The storm
That's why you're all upset
No, no, they're all dead
points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table without looking
looks, shrugs
'll go look
's face registers the new terror
They'll kill you
Don't leave me
smiles warmly
'm not afraid
waits by the couch as
crosses the room to the back window
All dead
Neddy
Oh, Marcie
stands close to the fireplace
reaches the window and looks out
's body sways just out of reach
is shocked
Oh, my lord
turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table, she picks up the lantern
waits at the fireplace
(continuing) So young, so pretty
What monster could have done such a thing
Bill--Bill--Bill is out there
She lets
take her in her arms
We shall go straight to the police
backs up
The killer is still out there
will protect you
looks around the room
(continuing) Oh, this place
It should never have been a camp
Not for children
They had so much trouble here
The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace
log burns through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks
(continuing) Camp Blood
has almost completely calmed the girl down
Strokes her soft hair
(continuing) You know a boy drowned the year before those two others were killed
An accident
It was inadequate supervision
The counsellors were not paying enough attention
They were making love when that boy drowned
looks up as the  strokes her hair
:   as the  's hand strokes the 's hair
The hand is missing its little finger
The  enters upon the  in a lyrical, child-like version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light
(continuing) We should go now
Maybe we should wait for Mr
Christy
shakes her head gently
No
That won't be necessary
As she speaks,
reaches into her slicker in a surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting knife
don't understand
on the , filtered, echoed and distant, is the of a ten year old boy, , crying for help in a fantasy version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957
(
) (filtered) Help me, mommy
save me
please, mommy
please, mommy
help me, mommy
save me
(cocking her hand to listen) am, Jason
am
(a little confused) Why shouldn't we wait for Mr
Christy
has gone through some subtle changes
While her voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip into her other manifestation
All of this is in concert with the visibility of her weapon
It was my son they killed
They said he drowned, but  know it was inadequate supervision
starts to become increasingly anxious
She can't see the knife rise behind her
Mr
Christy will be back soon
shakes her head from side to side
No, he won't
killed him as well
The shock of recognition hits
In  her eyes look up and see the knife which
now has poised and ready to strike
bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks
stands and steps forward
(continuing) couldn't let them start this camp again, could
, in panic, looks for an escape
She grabs the fireplace poker
won't let you
swings the poker back and forth
(continuing) No
No
No
raises her arm to slash downward with the knife
swings the poker hard to
' other arm and rib cage
is in pain, her face a mask of rage
drops the poker to run for the door
hesitates for a moment, then follows deliberately
Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder
: 123
/ - gets to the door and stops
She fiddles with the side of the screen
somebody has latched it
on , taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at the door, snapping the latch
:  as  runs out into the rain, the mud, the thunder and the lightning
The  is going full-tilt as makes a quick turn to run towards the road
-:  as  bumps into an object which swings from above
slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of hanging from the tree
rope is looped under his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade protrudes from his heart
:   in terror
:   runs and suddenly bumps into another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree
:  of , dead
:   runs for the Arts & Crafts
In the  we see can the yellow-slickered
closing the distance between herself and
: 124
&   - runs for the door, slams through it
The  waits for
, but she does not appear
: 125
- runs to the door and opens it quickly
: 126
&   - is hiding in the shadows behind a table
We hear the of the generator starting outside and suddenly three bright overhead lights come on
looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to reveal her hiding place
She looks for an escape
There's a window
She starts for it, then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table
:
opens the door and walks in a few feet
She carries a machete in her hand
We see this instrument in as we hear  the sound of her son, , calling to her
(
) Help, mommy, 'm drowning
Oh, mommy, please
The    to her face and we see that the voice of is coming from within her in
She is both characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed
can just make out what is happening and can hear the is very still
Her eyes widen as she listens to
rave
(Lipsync) Don't let me die, mommy
can't breathe
Help me, breathe
is having trouble catching her own breath
She strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the child stops
(in her own voice) can't let them kill any more children
Come out now
She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the When
is too quick for her, shoving a table across her path like a barred door
Before  can think twice, has shoved a second table in behind her so that now  is sandwiched between them
She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end-- the end where
is standing
looks behind her and sees a shelf
On the shelf is a box
is coming down the aisle between the two tables
Her machete is coming up in an attack
reaches into the box in  and pulls out a handful of leather-working tools
She hurls them at
as hard as she can
has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning knives
One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low animal bellow
leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door
shoves the tables over and hurries after her
gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out
We can hear '
(
) Kill her, mommy
Kill her
: 127
/
- The central area is bathed in light
The rain has stopped
has turned on all the flood-lights
runs to the corner of one of the cabins
She stops to look back
is gaining on her
runs to the equipment shed
:  The door is thrown back
goes in
Looks for a weapon
Nothing is available
sobs with fear
She runs
passes the equipment shed
: 128
- single bulb outside the building shows  as she bursts through the door
: 129
- It is a small cabin
On the walls are five
22 calibre rifles
runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles from the wall
She rummages in a drawer
It's empty
She tries another
Empty
Where are the goddamned bullets
The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it
looks around
: 130
- is on her way, charging through the night
: 131
- :  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the rifle
The hasp doesn't give
She gives it another butt stroke
It won't give
shadow covers 's back
She turns
:
is standing in the doorway, blocking the light
Still carrying the machete, steps slowly toward
, with an almost useless
22 in her hands, does the only thing she can
She takes the weapon by the barrel and, swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks
on the arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall
slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and drops to the floor
runs out the door
: 132
- huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the front door of the main cabin
She runs in quickly
There is no sign of
She turns off the lights and runs into the kitchen
: 133
- looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide
She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and then hides there, closing the door behind her
: 134
- There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices
's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the other side
relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside
As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam
Then we hear some shuffling around outside
The lights are turned on
(
) Please kill her, mommy
Help me, please
Kill her, mommy
There is the sound of pots being rustled through
Then the sound of another door being slammed
relaxes again
Then there is a silence
thinks about unlocking the door now
She reaches out for the lock
Then thinks better of the idea
She cases down the door frame to the floor
On all sides are the cans of food and cooking implements
There is a large skillet, some bags of flour, etc
covers her head with her arms
The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very slowly
We see it, but she does not
' hand finishes turning and now starts to push gently
There is almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested
The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song
(
) Come out, come out, wherever you are
jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small room
Fists bang in a rage on the floor
Please
folds her hands at the side of her face
The fist-banging gives way to a short silence
The silence is interrupted by a new sound:
has begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the door to the larder
:
oh, my God
At first we see nothing on our side
Then, gradually, we see little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops
's eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense, anything
Larger holes are now made
stops just long enough to take a peck inside
We can see her eye at the largest hole
She goes back to whacking away at the door
The hole is near the lock
It is soon big enough for
to reach inside with her hand and turn the rachet
realizes she must defend herself
She reaches down and picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens,  raises her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to come through the entrance
chops down with the machete
fends off the blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her head
As the machete blade bounces off the skillet,  is able to swing the skillet downward and hit
with a solid blow on top of her head
sprawls sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the floor
raises the skillet again to strike
She crosses carefully to
and pushes her gently with her foot, the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway
:
lies totally inert
There is a small puddle of blood under her head
:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses slowly out of the room
: 135
- The moon comes out from behind a cloud
pushes a canoe into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will permit, out in the lake to safety
: 136
- Exhausted,  puts her paddle across her lap and falls forward, slumped across a thwart
: 137
- The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day
The birds are up, foraging for food
As the  scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake
The canoe holding  is drifting in big slow circles across the surface of the lake
: 138
- lies, in , in the canoe, sleeping
She has not changed her position since collapsing a few hours before
The water laps gently against the side of the canoe
Very slowly, she wakes
She opens her eyes
The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree boughs that overhang the edge of the lake
They shade  from the bright rays of the sun
The canoe rocks gently
is still, listening to the sound of the lapping water
Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a  , and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of
, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe, barely missing 's slumped form
The canoe immediately overturns and both
and try to find their footing in the shallow water is covered in mud and blood
She sees  struggling to get up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete
turns, sees
coming
grabs a paddle floating near her
pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the waist-high water as fast as she can
She screams with rage
Her face goes through a horrifying transformation
From her mouth comes the
(Lipsync) Mommy
Mommy
Mommy
can't move fast enough to get away from
, who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit
slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle, using it like a staff to ward off the blow
The machete cuts the paddle nearly in half
raises the knife for another blow and  lunges for her knees and succeeds in throwing
into the water
The machete flies out of her hand and lands in the water
The two women roll in the water
is trying to strangle , her hands stretching to reach around her throat
They roll over and under the water
We cannot see who is winning
Suddenly
finds her footing and stands up, looking for
She is screeching madly
(Lipsync) (continuing) Kill her, mommy
Kill her, mommy
shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in one, wild swing, decapitates
, whose head flies off into the water
The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake
drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to shore
: 139
/ - walks slowly down the road away from the camp
We hear the sound of a car approaching
Now it comes into view
It is a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door that says "State Department of Health and Safety"
There are two middle-aged bureaucrats inside
waves down the car, which pulls up beside her
1st Good morning, miss
2nd (Leaning across the front seat) Are you all right, ma'am
Help me
The    while the two men get out of their vehicle and come around to help
: 140
- of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of Crystal Lake
The canoe lies half sunken in the shallows
One paddle drifts in the current
The lake has swallowed its secret
