Written by Massy Tadjedin Based on a screenplay by Marc Rocco April 15, 2003 pure white screen
Idyllic stillness
All of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to
After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a man's
Then, suddenly, the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man
(
) was 25 years old the first time died
, , One more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from William Starks'
the  of the hospital around him as  and  tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers
Our glimpse of  reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood -- and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull
Then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does the pace of the world around him
, , (
) remember there was so much white everywhere
And  felt peace
even though there was war around me
And felt alive, even though  knew  was dead
#1 Come on, come on, let's tag these guys and get them out of here
An , clipboard in hand, stands above ' unmoving body with another  (2) beside him
1 pulls the rest of the  off of  as the  searches for his   and gently closes his  with her hand
#2 [Reading from the ] Starks, William
Born December 25, 1966
#1 Wait, so how old
#2 25

#1 [Searching through records] Here he is
William Starks
Born in Vermont
He hasn't got a family listed
The naval hospital'll figure out what to do with him
As the  puts the  back down, she meets ' wide- open  -- now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life
She stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, blinks and a  runs down his cheek -- jarring her
#2 [Calling out] Oh my God
This soldier is
Code blue
This man just blinked
#1 He's been tagged already
Worry about the others
[then seeing blink] Oh shit
Shit
We need a doctor
Get a doctor over here now
As the   rush over to , preparing and  ,  merely closes his eyes and we follow the now  white sheet as it falls to the ground
, interviews    (30s) -- a particularly photogenic and affable participant
The level of arms on the ground really depends
[Answering a question] But no, 'd have to say we haven't had to engage on the ground as heavily as we might have expected
Have you lost any men today, Captain
No
One of my Corporals took a bullet to the head, but it looks like he might make it
Looks that way
: 3
, We see only the , and not the man to whom it belongs, enter the frame and pull the  on a gun
The sound pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of ' head in a , shaving the skin around it right off
, convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily and his arms suited with
's and dressings -- as a , a  and a  stand above him
' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before -- is alert, and striking
Even with the bandages, he remains well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down
Sergeant Starks was very lucky little more to the right and it wouldn't have wanted to come out
But he's never gonna be able to remember what happened
It's hard to say
Sergeant Starks could have retrograde amnesia or
[lowering his voice] any form of psychological suppression
It's very common with traumas like this
[Cutting him off] Sergeant Starks is in the room, [beat] and  want to know when 'm going home
When he speaks,  maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his surroundings
Sergeant, you have no surviving family in the States
'm sure you have friends or distant relatives, but unfortunately we have no record of them yet
Captain Medley has recommended you for the Purple Heart, Sergeant

lets the tribute roll right off him
He spots the in the Lieutenant's pocket
Can  have one of those
Of course
The  lights one for him
There is help for you, Sergeant
Of course there is
Their  start to fade as  smokes his cigarette, blowing the  upwards and following it with his eyes
He's finished with these men and everything they stand for

] didn't know where my home was just knew  didn't want to be there anymore
,  , , -- recovered now -- walks by himself along a long highway
He seems to be walking away from things even if he can't remember what they are yet
,  , , (30s) -- a hippie who happens to be a mother -- and her daughter,  (8) tremble in the cold next to their stalled car
sits next to the car, holding her knees to her chest, more like a child than her daughter
runs her little gloved hand over her mom's ski-hatted head as she cautiously watches  approach them
He cuts an arresting figure against the empty landscape
Come on, mom
Don't fall asleep
You two ok
Our car won't start
5
[Looking at ] What's your mom's name
[Cautiously] Jean
takes off his backpack and kneels down
Jean
Jean, can you hear me
need you to try to wake up, Jean
opens her eyes, stone red
Your mom take anything before this happened
Yeah, but  don't know what
[Beat] What's your name
Jackie
decidedly sticks out her gloved hand
smiles and briefly shakes it
rubs a hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks of what to do
Nice to meet you, Jackie
Why don't you wrap this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while take a look at your car
,  , , As Starks works on their engine,  anxiously watches her mother throw up in the distance
sees her watching and tries to distract her
What do you think of all this snow
looks at him curiously
[Beat] Nothing
looks at her and smiles at her honest answer; Jackie turns her head back towards her mother
6
But  like it  guess
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal
Yeah
gets behind the wheel, crouching down in the seat just enough so her foot reaches the pedal
Go ahead, turn it on
Keep pushing it
revs up the engine and, a few coughs and sputters later, the car settles into a nice, working hum
[Smiling] It works
steps down
She looks like she could hug Starks and, unexpectedly, decides to
As  awkwardly returns it, he sees  lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter
Get your fucking hands off my daughter
Mom, he just fixed our car
Jackie, get in the car
reaches for a  in the back of the truck but stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up
Look,  don't want any trouble, so
Neither do , ma'am
'll be on my way
Mom, you've got it wrong
motions for  to stop as he collects his bags
You're just gonna walk
7
Yeah, 'll hitch a ride or something
[Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel
'   are tied to the  of one of his bags
What're those
Dog tags
[Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification
What for
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are
[Still looking at them] Hm
unties them and gives them to her
She reads them
think  can remember what's on them
William Starks
[Beat] Thanks
: , faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic about him and a confused look on his face as a questions him
(
) "Jackie" and "Jean" are the only things you know for certain about that day
nods
8
(
) Are you aware we have no last name, no place of residence, and no record of any physical presence for these "friends" of yours
How's that possible in this day and age
nods as a muffled "Objection" flickers away in the background
(
) may need to actually hear that answer, Mr
Starks
[Beat] Yes
With Starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is suddenly illuminated and we see that   ' The  belongs to a satisfied  who turns to face a medium-sized  watching on
, There are three   called to the stand: , Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf;
, a psychiatrist; and  , the cop who first came upon the crime scene
Their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and confusingly -- just like it appears to himself
[Emotional] Eddie [correcting himself], Officer Harrison, was lying in a pool of his own blood -- on his back
William Starks could be blocking the incident
It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother
delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this
[Cont'd] Officer Harrison'd been shot three times
He was long dead by the time we got there
9
have heard of Gulf War Syndrome
The medical community is only beginning to gather information about it
Gulf War   Syndrome
What the
Why don't we   start diagnosing Hard Life Syndrome   while we're at it
've gotten a   lot of convictions we could overturn   with that logic
Sergeant Starks was awarded the Purple Heart
That award doesn't applaud violence or murder
[Beat] It applauds honor
[Cont'd] His subconscious is blocking it, the same way it began to in the Gulf, particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then
The following summations are punctuated by the between them and the simulated  around them as they speak -- like , at the beginning of his own testimony
[Disdainfully] It's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it
He absolutely was
Three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another
[Incensed] War isn't a  Special
Half the shit that went on couldn't be tidied into a top of the hour headline -- either 'cause it couldn't be said neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said at all
It was ugly
And they don't put ugly on
[Looking at Starks] If Starks did kill that officer [Beat] You can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind
10
For God's sake, my client said he thinks he's already died once
He doesn't know what's going on
: , , , lies bleeding -- eyes half open -- by  ' dead, bloodied body as falling  slowly whitens them both and covers any  that may have been left behind
We hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment

, nearly whispered] don't know how it happened
' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness
, The  nods as he hands the   back the verdict
On the count of first degree murder, we find the defendant, William Starks, not guilty by reason of insanity
,  , , In his mind,  is walking out of the woods as the sun sets and bounces off the snow all around him
We see watching him walk away into the woods

) hereby sentence you to be committed to a facility for the criminally insane, where  hope that doctors and the proper treatment can help you

] Mr
Starks,  hope that someday you might be well so that we will have lost only one life in this tragedy
, (overworked, dogmatic, disenchanted),
(30s, unassuming, perceptive), and (20s, green) are convened with other  at a routine hospital meeting
These doctors deal in the currency of madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden on their faces
'd certainly say he should be considered violent, just given his case
How'd he dodge a conviction
His defense argued post-traumatic stress and delusional disorder
He evidently couldn't account for a similar incident during his service in Desert Storm
[Beat] So why isn't he just in the psych ward of the county jail
Apparently, he's a decorated vet
And had another one testify for him
Who knows

William, can you hear me
nods groggily
've given you some drugs to help with your adjustment
[Cutting him off] What kind of drugs
[Beat] 'Cause these seem pretty
pretty serious
Well, your condition's pretty serious
[Beat] So they say
[Off Becker's steady gaze] What
'm just looking at you
Does that make you uncomfortable
Depends on what you're seeing
eyes  mistrustfully
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison
Correct
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you
13
It's not my job to believe you
[Squinting to better see] You're a doctor
would think
[Cutting him off firmly] It's not my job to believe you or to understand you
It's my job to try to cure you and if that's a no-go, then to
take some kind of care of you
[Flatly] Lucky me
looks at Starks -- his eyes casting shame upon the alleged murderer that sits before him
[Stupefied] You shot a man three times: first in his heart, then in his stomach and then
point blank, in the back of his head
And then you just
forgot all about it
whole life erased with three easy little words:
Don't
Know
What would it be if we could all not know what we didn't want to have to face
glances at his  and gets up -- still blurred in Starks'
It's only as he's walking off that Starks notices he has a limp

He's walking towards  who stands at the end of the hall, talking to other

don't
falters but stays up
He turns to see a shell of an looking right through him with wooden eyes
' eyes stay so completely fixed on the old man's haunting sight that he doesn't see what's ahead of him
14
He bumps right into a   whose sudden, earsplitting  peal interminably through the air
[Mumbling] 'm sorry

'm sorry
didn't mean it

The  is intolerable

What follows happens too quickly for  to react

They close the door and deftly administer a  and a

Come on, army boy
Time for some therapy

, ,  , The first face  sees as the world comes into focus is '
Around it loom those of

and
shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus hanging sternly on the wall
It is  : an apparatus designed to encase a man's body
Made of coarse, sickly- stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped around, the  looks medieval
Its appearance suggests its purpose: to slowly
has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement
Even under the tranquilizers,  formidably resists them as the  wrestle to strap him in
Then Starks, sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them
Wait
Wait a minute
Please
motions for them to stop with his hand
blinks, trying to bring the faces above him into focus
,  don't belong here
looks into Starks' eyes
Sanity stares back
No
don't think you do either
[Beat] But neither of us can do anything about that
barely nods and  is trussed in the  with writes some details down, presumably about Starks' treatment
-- just barely deep enough for a body or tall enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and , already dreadfully sheathed in the , is crammed inside
The  slam the cadaver drawer into the wall
is literally entombed alive
Silence
Stolen breath
They bolt the drawer and the  echoes through his body
The  and  of the space choke him as his heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle
16
We see only the  of a pair of petrified  on a man who's losing it -- hyperventilating, suffocating
for all intents and purposes, dying the worst kind of a death
Combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what's happening to him,  sees a single white  -- almost like a fleck of dust -- flitting between undecided  in the blackness until, slowly, it grows bigger and bigger
/ It's now a  of   that changes the more stares at it
Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with formless shapes and figures that  tries to discern before they change into something else
Only after blinks does he start to see the  of the  is from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time between
1)  little river of  marring the snow around it, spilling from
2)  ' mouth just seconds before his last breath
His eyes close and  sees and hears a
3) From the barrel of a  fired near him
sprays ' hands as he looks down at them and realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it
He looks up from his hands and sees in similar flashes
1) The snow beneath the  changing to  as stares at it
This time, the little river of  comes from
2) The  of  villagers, all still except one
3) That of a
She unflinchingly lays her hand in the entrails of a  and smears its blood on her face just before she lies back down among the dead, content to be one of them
The only  during these dreadful images have been a trapped man's anxious  and the  of a pumping so fast it could be a drum
The screen goes  and  as  clenches his eyes shut
17
Just then, as the  beneath his eyes starts to , something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the drawer
Right on his eye
The drop of  is enough to send this man right over the edge

He bends down to look more closely at a on the floor --   -- and as he runs his  over it and stands back up, he is back in the

The  are his  and, no matter how badly he wants to slow them down, he can't
, sees , 8, sitting by a window in the diner
She turns her head towards the  and, as she looks there, so does Starks
That is when he first lays eyes on a woman, a -- worn but still lovely -- leaving the diner
He is taken with her and, for the first time since he's been in the Jacket, seems calm
Just then, however, the reverie is shattered
: , ,  , The drawer is yanked open to reveal ' still, drenched face
,  and the  stand above him
Take him out of it
The  unstrap the  from his body
Blood from his chafed skin drips onto the burial slab
' eyes remain closed
William
William, can you hear me
18
We hear 's voice as it sounds to
'  open only enough for him to see the ' morph chillingly into one another's
[Less muffled] Pulse is 16, temp, just a hair under 90
'Bout right for three hours of psychosis
That's not enough, is it
looks at ' battered body
[Wearily, indifferently] It's enough for now
Take him to the infirmary and let him recover there
,  , sits, totally disoriented, in the ward with the other, more vocally  patients
He runs his hand uncertainly over the  on his arm from the Jacket and looks around -- not knowing where his  ends and  begins
The   from the previous day is moving slowly with the aid of his walker
He is far less threatening to today
just a senile man about to walk into a wall
[Getting up to help him] Let's get you a destination other than this wall
-- 40s, smart eyes, fidgety, with an innocent face -- watches  help turn the   around
That's Kingsley
Old bastard hears us, 'm sure
He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk
know
tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue
Literally
[Beat] You're the cop killer, right
Yeah, guess so
How'd you know
Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind
[Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie
() 19
(cont'd) Welcome to the village, William Starks
doesn't offer his hand, just looks back at MacKenzie
[Looking away] 'm not really in the mood to talk
That's too bad
don't believe in disposable language either -- you know, the small talk, the little talk
Chit
Chat
Useless
The game's something else though
Think about it: What can we trade with each other in the air between us
This
[running his hand through the air] is our court
[Beat, so eager it's sad] 'm ready to throw the ball
Come on
looks at  and sees that the constant flow of words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his eyes
dead arm hangs limply by his side, like a weight
[Relenting] What are you in here for
tried to kill my wife
Don't you go to jail for that
tried something like 30 times
There is, as  rightly figures, no suitable response to that
She's bigger than me, and she's stronger than me
And  never planned on doing it
It was always in the heat of the moment
didn't beat her or anything
Hell, she beat me
But when we'd start fighting, 'd go for the knife
Then she kept threatening to have me put away, and [looking around] she finally did
As he talks,  notes the  on Starks' arms
Dr
observes  and  talking and starts walking towards them
20
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy
Or just plain stupid
You'd think by the twentieth time, 'd have found an alternative method
Maybe a more effective one, if you know what mean
Morning, gentlemen
How are you doing today
winks discreetly at  before he replies
It's a hard one for me, Dr
Lorenson
[Finally turns to face her, grimly] The world around me, it's shrinking
There's not even room for light to make its way in
[Beat] Da-da-bum
Da- da-bum
feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me, Doc
Only today, he's not carrying flowers
reprimands MacKenzie by turning to Starks
What
It's better than fine
And you, Mr
Starks
[Already on the defense] 'm fine
Mr
MacKenzie, do you think  could talk to Mr
Starks privately
Of course you can, Doc
William, it was an absolute pleasure
Thanks for playing
Just before he walks away,  turns around nervously and uncharacteristically looks  right in the eye
21
Hey
when they talk you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them
[Beat] They don't eat you when there's music playing
looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words were directed or just the meandering of a nut
But MacKenzie just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away -- dead arm in tow
So you're ok
[Still distracted] What
asked you if you're ok
[Suspiciously] don't know
You tell me, Doc
You think there's anything wrong with me
don't know
You're not my patient
looks away
Lorenson gives him a once over
You look like you've lost some weight
Are you eating
am
One of the few things remember doing is eating
So  guess must be exercising it off in my dreams
looks at , seeing if he'll respond looks back curiously at ' pointed stare
You done with your small talk
Sure
Good
walks away slowly and  -- a fact that doesn't escape 's observation
22
' ,   , walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit of  at the top of the wall
He walks closer to them, when he suddenly hears some   from inside one of the stalls
He checks the first stall, pushing it open
It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock
The sound continues
walks slowly past the second stall to the third and then
The door swings all the way towards
He falls backwards -- his head just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink
, the , walks out
'm sorry, Starks
Must have not seen you coming there
writhes in  -- straining for his own breath now
[Leaning down close to him] Were you worried about me
[Smiling] That's so sweet
Thanks
With that,  walks out, leaving  on the floor
' ,  , , sits in his room, listening to the silence of the night interrupted by first faint, then approaching, Closer and closer
then harmfully near until and  enter his room
They pause -- awaiting a reaction
doesn't give them one
You gonna get the fuck up
,  , , walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own torture -- flanked by  and  on either side
, ,  , They're all in the room
seems pretty calm
Only in a do we see his eyes register the
'm glad to see you're cooperating this time, Mr
Starks
23
looks at the ,  restraints on it
They would really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with them
They might even knock someone out
and  move to undress him, when  makes a move to do it himself
They look to
who  that it's all right
begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps on one of Starks' bare feet
doesn't flinch
He merely turns away from them and bends down to take off his pants
On his way up, he and, using it like a weapon, aims to smack it across Damon's face
deftly ducks and the hits  instead
The force of the blow sends Becker down, and as he falls against the wall,  and leap to restrain Starks
opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into focus
His right cheek is cut pretty bad
helps to his feet and picks his   up off the floor
puts them on
Hold him while  get the tranquilizer
Fuck the tranquilizer
got a foot
Starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down
No
That's not necessary
looks down and sees his own  fall on the floor
He looks up at  who, even in his pain, looks shocked at the force he just used
Let him go
[More firmly]  said, let him go
As soon as they let him go,  lunges for  -- pushing him up against the wall
stops, presumably about to harm Becker but unsure, even to himself, of what he's capable of doing
looks fearlessly into Starks' eyes
24
[An inch away from his face] What, Starks
What are you going to do
End me just because 'm an inconvenience to you
[Beat] Just like you did with Officer Harrison
' face registers the meaning in Becker's words and a look of self-doubt crosses his face
The only thing your mind is missing is a conscience
lets go of him and, as soon as he does,  and restrain him
calmly wipes the  from his face, looks at his hand, shakes his head and walks out
Wait
Dr
Becker, how long do you want us to leave him in for
doesn't answer
He doesn't even turn around goes after him
Just strap him in for now
And  and  start to
' ,  ,  , turns around from the window and we see that his cheek is
He opens a drawer, takes out some  and pours himself a
He swallows some pills with it
After he drinks it, he looks up to see  standing opposite him, watching
You ok
'm fine
[Beat] Listen,  hate to bother you
Then don't
25
But
what about Starks
What about Starks
Should we be
Should we be what
Trying to change him any way we can
[Beat] Yes
But the Jacket
mean
should we be leaving him in like that
[As if stunned by the question] Leaving him in
[Beat] The medication 'm given him is intended to adjust -- maybe even reset -- his violent proclivities
You know, peel away some of those layers of hate
The Jacket's merely a safe place for that to happen
The grounds and the halls -- where  can't monitor side effects can't predict -- aren't
[Still doubtful] But, but
what about
[Mocking Gries] But
but what about the gun
mean, should he have been firing away like that
[Shaking his head at ] You can't fuck up a life that's already been fucked up
[Turning away] There, there's the insurance you're looking for
'm not looking for anything
shakes his head, laughing inside at the world's stupidity
[Beat] It's Christmas Eve, Justin
Don't you have somewhere to be
26
doesn't wait for an answer, just turns back towards the window and takes another sip of his drink
: ,  , turns on the television as  sits in one of the lounge chairs
Ah, man, look, It's  Wonderful Life
You got any booze
takes out a  from her
'Course  do
[Smiling] And it is the season for giving so let's get to it
smiles and rubs his hands together eagerly
, ,  , shot of the   , with no one in the room, just someone in the wall
finds himself in the physically wrenching place once more
But nothing happens for some seconds
He breathes anxiously, not knowing what to expect
His heart beats steadily:
, until, finally, with each beat, a becomes two flecks
then, two dots
then, two circles
then, the  of a pair of with a terrific meanness in them
The  blink, then disappear like they were never there
The pace of ' heart quickens, and the inexplicable madness surrounds him once more
, , , The  of   around him but he's in the middle of the murder scene, watching   lie on the floor
He turns to look over his shoulder and sees

Slowly the terrifying images shift to a naturalistic, real-time documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as it's occurring
As  blinks,  fall and he hears, over it all, a counseling voice
(
) When they take you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves, dance with them
The   become less terrible as they fade away
(
) They don't eat you when there's music playing
The scene morphs slowly and the following  appear vaguely -- forming the walls of the  around him

They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the whole wall is replaced with one large  of a -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a , moving a    out of her face with her hand
blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her
He reaches out and closes his  around her like he might catch hold of the moment with this simple gesture
The whole    twinkles marvelously, as we

,  , , The  (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin and a beautiful mouth that hasn't smiled in a long time -- emerges from the diner
Even with no effort, she is remarkably pretty
From her , we know that her day was spent there
simply stares at this  who seems markedly removed from the world around her
The only fact she wears on her is that she's tired
She spots  and can't help but do a double-take
Both are momentarily taken with each other, though she tries to hide any indication that she is
' She gets in her old car and starts it
As it warms up, she looks for  in her   and sees he's still there
He starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her car
, , , The  treads angrily towards
Where do you think you're going
looks at her
He doesn't know anymore than she does
You gonna answer me
just stares
If you're deaf, read my lips don't need a psycho following me today
[Beat] 'm not deaf
Good
She turns and gets back in her car, slamming the door shut
She starts to drive and  stares after her
29
After a few hundred yards, she  on the brakes and turns the car round, coming back
Then she jumps out of the car and heads back in the diner, without looking over at
,   , She comes out -- this time  in hand -- and sighs at Starks
[As if she owes him an explanation] forgot my purse
nods slowly
The  gets in her car and looks again at  in her
He has hardly any winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans and a flannel
He looks lost among his surroundings, as much because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't look like he belongs there
She reverses towards him
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve
You're never gonna get a cab here
[Beat] Thanks
She looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel
All right
[Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister
'm not sure
Let me ask you that again
This time, look around and consider your options
Being cold and freezing are his options
[Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister
[Nodding slowly] Yeah,  do
30
Great, get in
' So, where do you want me to drop you
rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks it over
She watches him curiously
'm not sure
You don't have anywhere to stay
don't think so
The  takes out a  and a sizable  from it; she swallows it smoothly, like someone used to doing so
Well, where are you from
'm not sure
[Beat]  don't really know
Of course you don't know
Why "of course"
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to
It'd be too simple
probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either
She looks over at him -- momentarily suspicious
He looks back innocuously; there's something innately safe about him
31
At least you're honest
That's some kind of start
sees her take another  from the flask
She pulls out a , and  lights it for her with some That's great
You're not sure where you're from or where you're going, but at least you've got manners
She laughs, noticeably more relaxed now after the drink
Well, you got a coat or something
[Looking down at his clothes] No
Doesn't look like it
Well, how'd you get here
[Beat]  was dropped off
Do you have a motel or something
Money
feels his pockets
No
Well, don't you somewhere
Stuff
Belongings
No
[Beat] Not around here
She casts a long sideward glance at , taking him and her circumstances in for herself
He looks back gently
All right, we'll get to my place and call around, see where  can take you
[Beat] Just don't think of trying anything
() 32
(cont'd) have the biggest defense for gun control living upstairs from me
She's armed and angry even when she's asleep
' , She is on the , calling various shelters
Her apartment has some pieces of mismatched furniture, along   with a string of lopsided   strewn around the    in the room
They, more than anything else, light the   place
[Pleading tone] could have him there in 15 minutes
[Beat, disappointed] Hmm
Yeah, thanks
Merry Christmas to you, too
She hangs up the phone
Great
That was our last option
What am  going to do with you
Nothing
[Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far
Where are you going
You'll freeze out there
You don't even have a coat
'll manage
No, you won't
You'll die of cold out there and then 'll have to feel guilty
And 've already got more guilt than  know what to do with
[Beat] Do you want something to drink
No, 'm ok
She leaves to the  to fix herself a drink and stares after her
Suddenly, a   is heard as something falls in the kitchen
' whole as he wonders whether he's being taken out of the Jacket
Shit
That was one of my good glasses
33
As she presumably cleans it up, we stay on  who slowly gains hold of himself
She comes back,  in hand and pushes the    in her face back the same way she did when he saw her in the tunnel
Even through her weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights
She takes a long
[Noticing he's shaken] Hey, you ok
[Beat] Yeah, 'm fine
You know what
It's Christmas Eve
And you look clean --  mean, you're normal-looking
[Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and have a couch
And sadly, no plans for the evening anyway
She looks back -- her  even more tired from the liquor
'm not gonna hurt you
[Softly] know
[Clearing her throat] 'm gonna go take a bath
Make yourself at home
You know, fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything
There's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway
And don't snoop, ok
Ok
[Beat] My name's William by the way
[Shakes her head] No, no
Let's not do the name stuff, 'cause you see,  don't want to meet you
may want to help you tonight, but  don't want to know you
Honest
nods as she walks out
' , , still without a coat, collects some

, ' , looks in her fridge
There's not much to work with -- just some  and plenty of
, ' , has lit a  and set out a feeble dinner for them when the  comes out of the bedroom in sweats
What's this
The best  could do with what was in your fridge
She looks and sees a  on a  in one plate and a on two different colors of  on the other
Then she looks over at the fire; it's obvious from the way she looks at it that it's been years, if ever, since someone's done something like this for her
only lit it because it was so cold in here
'm sorry if
No, it's fine
[Beat, swallow] Thanks
She turns and goes in the kitchen, calling out to him
You want a drink
Sure
, ' , As she makes their , a curious  crosses her face, just for a second
, ' , They've sat down to eat under the blinking
This is pretty good
Considering
35
Thanks
They eat quietly for a second
looks at her, then down at his food, still subtly stunned by it all
So you're a waitress, right mean
from the uniform you were wearing
Yup
That's me
You like it
[Beat]  do it
Have you always been a waitress
[Remembering sadly] No
used to be a nurse
[Beat] Why'd you stop
Shit happens, and your life changes
'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen
[Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from
don't know, but  think part of it's
looks around as he decides to be honest with her
That  don't really know what's real
She stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on her lips
Well, good for you
[Beat] Why
36
[Beat] Real is overrated
smiles back uncertainly
You don't think that's crazy
Maybe
[Beat] Maybe not
She holds up her glass somewhat sadly
Sometimes  don't know the difference myself
And, you know something think  like it better that way
[Finishes her drink] You want another one
She goes to the , and  clears their
, ' goes in the  as she comes out with their drinks
He hears her turn on the
She lands on an station that's playing "Girl of North Country" by Bob Dylan
, ' , smiles a little, then realizes he remembers, and likes, the song
It's the first familiar thing for him in days
He walks out slowly to the living room, where the sits on the couch, drinking
moves closer to the radio, leaning into it, listening and forgetting, for a short while -- only as long as a piece of song -- everything else
If you go when the snow flakes storm When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm To keep her from the howlin' winds
listens close -- smiling a small, sad smile
Over the , we pull back and see two very lonely people passing time together the way people sometimes need to be able to
37
This is a great song
You remember it
[Nodding slowly] It's like  feel like
know who am
just can't remember anything that made me this person
When  looks at her then, he's so close to a meltdown that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it
But hey, who can forget those words
The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy
How hard can that be to remember
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get
Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and still have to chop wood to make a fire
[Beat] And, being happy
you tell me if that's simple
The   flash drowsily to their own tempo
[re: the lights] Why don't  try to get them to stop blinking
, ' , She is visibly drained, after the day and the drinks
They told me  joined the army when was seventeen
That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since was born 'cause my mom split
So you never knew your mother
guess not
But, as of now,  never knew either
38
'm sorry
Yeah
[Beat] How about you
Never knew my father
grew up with my mother
Actually,  grew up around my mother
She was great though mean, the way she was with her friends
She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us
[Beat] She died young
How
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette
[Beat] came home from work and she was gone
The  still run after all these years
'm sorry
Yeah, me too
[Softly] Every day for the last ten years
That when you stopped being a nurse
She is surprised that he gleaned the connection -- and that he'd been listening so closely
[Exhausted] Yeah, that's when  stopped being a nurse
never thought  could stop being one,  wanted it for so long, but
you just can't do it anymore when you lose someone like that
You can't take care of other people
She closes her eyes and finally passes out
watches her face, lit serenely by the  and the Christmas lights
It bears her grief even in sleep

He covers her with a  then looks around and spots the only   in the room on her mantle
He walks towards them, tripping slightly on a  from the
He stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall
As he pulls himself up, he spots what is only inches away from where his hand landed on the wall:    , given to Jackie, only a couple weeks ago, hanging from a single  tacked into the wall
Stunned, he stares at his  and   scored on the metal
He looks back at the  and then to the few on the mantle: they are of  and her mother, runs his hand through his hair, trying to swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the situation

Totally disoriented,  nearly  on his way to the
The label on the first  reads "Jackie Price

He winces at the sight of the  and  streaked across Starks' face
checks his pulse and cleans his face as best as he can with a
William, can you hear me
His  echoes in the morgue, sounding to Starks, as it does to us, faint and distant
drips some  in Starks' mouth
As some of it trickles out, it runs into the , burning ' chafed skin

pushes the drawer back in, afraid of what they've done to this man

, ' (') , Only now, he's kneeling beside her sleeping , just looking at it
doesn't know what's going on but her serene, sleeping face steadies him
He can only call out the name he thinks she might respond to
Jackie
Jackie
Sure enough, she answers with a  in her sleep
Hm
We see, in ' eyes, the unbelievable connection: she is the same little girl he met only a few weeks ago in 1992
[Swallowing, softly] Jackie
[Beat] What year is it
[In a drunken slumber] What
What year is it
[Barely opening her eyes] 2004

picks her up and, in her sleep, she  her arms around his neck

, ' , As  closes the  , she sees her hungover reflection in it
She puts her face under the  and lets it restore some color and life in her
As she comes up, that's when she remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in her sleep

[Beat] What year is it
She   from the sink, staring at her reflection

He's holding the

He defensively as his   , startling her
[Desperately] Who are you
lets his  loosen
[Beat] 'm William Starks
short look of  cross her face before she leaps up
Get the hell out of my house
grabs the nearest object -- the   from the set -- and holds it, shaking, against stays calm; he hardly expected a different reaction
What'd you do
Snoop all over the place
You had no right
You had no right to go through anything
[Beat]  know it doesn't make sense
It doesn't even make sense to me
42
If you don't get out of my house right now, 'll call the police
[Remembering] Your mom was passed out on the side of the road when  found you
Her name was Jean
[Beat] She was dizzy the whole time
[Trembling] Why would you do something like this
tried to help you
Jackie, 'm William Starks
can prove it
What
Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license
No,  don't have anything to show you
'm here from a mental hospital
Well, you belong in one
[Solemnly] [Beat] You and your mom were in a truck and she kept a rifle in the back of it
Stop it
Stop it
covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes
' eyes plead right back
'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but 'm not lying to you
You can't be William Starks
He's dead
[Beat] What
43
William Starks is dead
[Beat] 've been to his grave
[Beat] What
His body was found New Year's Day, 19
1993
At Alpine
[Finishing for her] Alpine Grove
That's the mental hospital
How do you know that
looked it up
How
Then he remembers -- understanding with a chill that what she is saying could entirely be true
gave you my dog tags
No, you didn't
They found William Starks' body dead in the snow
How'd he die
don't know
But he did die
falters under the news
looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment
She settles for the  of  on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up
know what this is
picked you up when  was drunk and you probably thought 'm just fucked up enough to fall for this
But the thing is know what 'm doing when  drink just usually don't care
Right now, do though
And  want you out
Now
44
It's December 25th, 1993 today
No, it's not
[Beat] It's December 25th, 2004
[Desperate] That can't be
That's
just, mean
You're telling me  died in less than a week in the time 'm in
'm telling you  don't care what time you think you're in
You're not William Starks
[Beat]  don't believe in many things, but  believe in death
And it doesn't give back what it takes
So whoever you are did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave
'll leave
But look at me
Look at my face, Jackie
'm not lying
met you and your mother
told you then that 'd lost my memory
[Beat] There was no one for miles around so  know you know there's no way  could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around
Please
looks at her tenderly before he turns to leave
, a little calmer, looks at the door like he's still on the other side of it and calls out softly, and sadly
Happy Birthday
/ looks around him and, we see, from bottom up, the exterior around Jackie's house melt away as  suddenly faces the massacred village in Iraq
Shocked at what's happening to his body, he looks up, petrified
His body is wound as tightly as a knot
45
, , 1991 Again, we're glimpsing the scene through intermittently negotiated with real-time images
Opposite Starks stands a    -- seething in anger and pointing his gun at a  , presumably belonging to the  not five feet away
Next to Starks is an angry  , ordering  to follow him is watching himself in the scene
You walk on
They pick up their guns and fire at you, you stay
They pick up and fire at each other, and you walk on
He's got his gun pointed at a kid
That is not our problem
Yeah, well, none of this is our fuckin' problem
turns and aims his gun at a threatening to shoot a child
We hear him  in Arabic
What  doesn't see is another   (2) aiming his  at
We are leaving this site right now
doesn't hear him; he's busy perfecting his aim
[To the first Iraqi soldier] Hey
At the force of the word, the  lowers his gun and the flees
, who is now in the scene himself, lowers his gun slightly as he approaches the
Neither speaks the other's language but they're both saying everything with their eyes
Neither moves his off the other
Just then, though, we see the    get a clear aim at
46
He takes his  before anyone else does
goes down as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off
He falls to the ground
As the rest of the picture fades to black, all that is left is previously mysterious, still haunting  of  that we now see belonged to the And over it all is the now more distant    as the drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended
,  , ,
,  and   enter the room
You left him in all night
Shit, he's probably dead
[Defensively] tried to ask you if we should leave him in yesterday
Don't get all worked up, Justin expected some common sense on your part and clearly  was expecting too much
[Beat] Just open the drawer
We never should have done this to him
Well, what are we gonna do about it now
Nothing is Gries' answer
Still, Becker seems to share the concern
motions for them to open the drawer
They pull him out
looks cold and wrecked
Is he
[Impatiently] Is he dead
feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one
47
No
[To Harding and Damon] Get him upstairs

The attending  is walking around the ward
Where's William Starks
'm not sure
Dr
Becker had him moved
,  , walks anxiously down the halls of the hospital, peering into every room, looking for Starks
,  , spots  walking out the  of the hospital and  after him, in only his white coat
,  ,  (') [Calling out after him] Dr
Becker
Dr
Becker
Tom, wait
stops walking and waits a moment, registering the voice, before he turns around to face Dr
Lorenson
[Out of breath] Where's William Starks
He's recovering on the third floor
Are you kidding me
He's not psychotic
Then how would you describe him, Beth
Merely rebellious
He'll be a zombie in a few days, Tom
His behavior's hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics
48
And you know that from what, a couple two-minute stares across a room
[Firmly] He didn't need anti-psychotics, if that's even all you're giving him
ignores Lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see the from the  Starks gave him
[Steadily] After he slashed me with a hospital instrument,  determined, in my professional opinion, that Mr
Starks, needed a little placating
[Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked
You sure you want to begin making that kind of insinuation
[Beat] took five stitches during a routine therapy session
'm sure he took some, too
[Smirking, unphased] Happens sometimes when you've got to restrain them
You watch the rest of us work
You know that
[Appealing to him] Our patients are sick
Yes, they are
looks at ; he knows he's hiding something
He's not gonna end up like Casey, Tom
Whatever happened to him is not going to "happen" to Starks
don't know what you're trying to do here but he's not a lab animal, Tom
You can't reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment
49
Jesus, you really don't let up, do you
Just because you failed your patient doesn't necessarily mean the rest of us did, too
[Beat] Sorry to tarnish your war hero's image, but he is psychotic
looks back, starting to grasp Becker's misshapen beliefs
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's Christmas, and  have a family 'd like to see

His eyes bear his guilt

He swallows as he looks at the '  as she continues adjusting his pillows
[Swallowing nervously] Did you say something
The  shakes her head lightly and just then  steps out of the
said the drugs were to help you sleep
[Beat] Did you sleep well
Becker is remarkably calm, further confusing Starks' sense of reality
[Doubtfully] But  wasn't asleep
Was
Yes
You were
You were asleep for nearly a whole day
It's December 26th, William
sits up groggily, remembering what happened to him and wondering how much, if any of it, was real
It's December 26th
examines himself -- looking at his arms, spotting the on them
That's right, William
[Slowly figuring it out] 1992

Yes

It is 1992 in Alpine Grove

Becker doesn't even flinch as tries to get a better look at Becker's face
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to
That wasn't a fucking restraint
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is

But Becker just looks back innocently as he adjusts it
Relax
Don't act like  don't know what's real
[Beat] 'm not the one that's crazy here
[Pointedly] Of course you're not
Then he clarifies, wryly enough for Starks to catch it
53
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition
Don't give me that
know what's real, goddamnit
You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer

His name was Ted Casey
don't give a shit about your patient
wasn't pausing to see if you did
[Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather
squints as he searches out Becker's face
Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year old girl
[Beat] His lawyers asked me to have a look at him because, after his deeds were done
he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed her and woofed like a dog
He couldn't even remember his name when spoke to him, but, curiously enough, he could speak back
[Beat] Ted never went to prison because everyone -- including me -- was convinced he was sick
So he came here
leans into Starks' view to make sure he's listening
is
54
Then one day a little girl came with her mother to visit a relative and caught Ted stealing looks at her -- the kind you really have to steal if you know what  mean
[Beat]  asked Ted then if he could remember what the little girl who he had
slain was wearing
[Beat] He gave me a look 'll never forget, and, when he answered, it wasn't with a color or any sort of physical description 'd expect
"Oh yes," he said
" remember it
remember it well
" [Beat] Those were actually his last words  think
's expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and remorse as he recounts Ted's tale
We are not birds of a feather
Maybe not
[Beat] But  do think you're in a tree
woofing like a dog
And 'm just trying to help you the only way  can think of
gets up and, as he moves out of the light,  sees his  , reinforcing his memory of what happened
[Provokingly] What happened to your cheek, Dr
Becker
was careless
Happens sometimes
: ' ,  ,  , , 1992 looks out on the -  from his room on the third floor
He seems pacified for the moment
,  ,  , Everything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad mechanics of managing madness
and dated equipment litter the hall and, as we follow a  who walks among them, we spot  --  suspended in air and fixed on the ceiling -- pretending to be one of them
55
His  fall and he wipes his dried  as soon as she passes
has successfully made it out of his room
She turns one corner as  hustles to turn another
, is almost   there
As   pass him, lets his posture   collapse as he despondently hangs his head down so low they   can't see his face
They pass, and starts scuttling   towards the door to the outside
As soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold -- with only his    -- Starks walks normally, like he no longer remembers the risks
Instead he remembers what Jackie told him
[
] They found William Starks' body dead in the snow
[
] How'd he die
[
] don't know
But he did die
, leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold -- and lifts some snow to his mouth,  it like a man who needs to affirm he is still alive
He's so rapt that 's takes him by surprise
Hey
You're not supposed to be out here
stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where his body was found
The terrible question asks itself on his face: Is this when Starks is killed
[Turning around sharply] What are you going to do to me
Well
As  reaches into his  for something, anxiously holds his breath
It's  when it comes out and
a   when it opens up
lets out his breath, relieved
56
[Nonchalantly] thought 'd just ask you to come back inside with me
And if  didn't want to come
guess 'd ask you why
Because  don't think 'm crazy
You're not crazy
is surprised by Lorenson's agreement
You suffer from delusional disorder
That doesn't mean you're
crazy
It just means you're confused
And you're here, instead of in jail, because that was determined to have played a role in your killing of a police officer
[Correcting him] Alleged killing of a police officer
You were convicted of the crime
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything
Until  know that  did it, 'm not going to accept that did
You may never remember at all
[Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged
No
The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up
Not my mind
seems to realize -- at least for an instant -- that he is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively, and cogently, staring back at him
57
[Beat] William, 'd like to ask you something if  can
Since when do people around here have to ask permission to do anything
[Suspiciously] How's your treatment progressing with Dr
Becker
still doesn't know how much Lorenson knows, and if he should trust him
Fine
[Beat] Why made you ask
answers first with his eyes looking over Starks' body
merely stares back tersely
[Carefully] just hope you'd let me know if that wasn't the case
Why, what would you do
could try to
make it stop
No
don't want it to
So it's helping
[Choosing his words carefully] [Beat] It's making me feel like a different person
-- sensing she's not going to get any more from Starks -- turns around to go back inside
It's only as she turns her face away from  that we see how nervous she is
But you'd never guess it from her tone
[Casually] You comin'
looks towards the  locking him in from every direction
waits until she hears ' following her
She waits until  has reached her
58
You should be careful
You could be killed if they found you out here
Believe me,  know
, ,  , 1992 and  are eating opposite each other
What were you talking about the other day
wasn't talking about anything
Yeah, you were
What you said about them taking me out to the woods
clams up slightly at the mention of it
What do you know about the Jacket
's eyes start to twitch nervously
know you need one when it's really cold
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me
Listen
'm going to die
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with
It means you're sane on some level
[Gravely] No,  mean in four days, 'm supposed to die
[Beat] How do you know
The Jacket
59
grows visibly more nervous at this second mention of it
Oh no, you're pretty young
Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think
No
[Beat]  mean  found out while was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days
Just then,   is upon them
She carries a  in her hand which she  menacingly on the floor as she walks towards them
What are you two yappin' about
tenses up as he sees only the , which could inflict a  if hit across a man's head the right way
Nearly every object could be a threat to his life as this point
[Spoken like a nut] [Beat] We're talking about our ability to go forward in time, to go into the future
[To Starks] That is what we're talking about here, right
is startled MacKenzie gets it
Yeah, it is
You know something
You're two fucking freaks is what you are
[Smiling] Well, no shit, Einstein
What do you think we're doing in this place
tries not to laugh but a  slips out
want the two of you to shut the fuck up and eat your food
walks away with a final stare that Starks returns
[Under his breath] gotta get back in it, MacKenzie
60
It's gonna be sticky
Why
's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in its sudden jerks accompanying every word
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now
When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me
Women
So what am  supposed to do
You could still always give Becker an itch
'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway
[Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something
,  , 1992, Dr
and
are walking briskly to a meeting
We're late
wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget
Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have
Maybe it's not such a waste
looks at  askance before she sets the record straight
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about
61
They don't care about all the things we do right
[Beat] But they might they might care about what we're doing wrong
[Beat] That's what they should come here to look for
can see  is trying to tell her something
What should they be looking for
They should just be looking harder
grabs ' arm, sensing the import of her words
Where
[Beat] It's Becker isn't it
He's doing stuff, isn't he
Later
'll tell you about it later
We got a session to catch now
3,  , 1992, is in a different ward with  who appear more threatening and disturbed
As he is anxiously looking around -- presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the humming an eerily
Looking to see who it comes from,  happens to spot   -- a young, fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a  , , administering medication from a dated
looks around the room and notes there are or  around
The  , meanwhile, is focused on the medicine -- oblivious to the  eyeing her
The 's not that far away when he starts walking towards the
starts in their direction, picking up speed -- maneuvering through    -- as the  reaches the
He throws her  down and pushes her against the
She starts screaming as he pushes up against her
picks up the  and strikes the  across the head with it
The  holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his balance
It's clear he's impaired
But it's also clear he understands pain
62
[To Sally] You ok
As she , her  dart above to the  about to strike him
Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the in the stomach --  -- but not before the piece of he held from one of the broken   comes perilously close to ' head
The  bowls over and  looks at the  terrified
Is this when he dies
The  -- incensed more than ever -- lunges at him a final time
gets him by the , expertly applying and, after only a few seconds, subdues him himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them
He lets out a suspended , instinctively touching his to make sure he's not cut
He looks back at
Are you ok
Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone
Where is everyone
[Defensively] There's a state rep visiting so they've moved everyone around
But 've been alone before
Where are the other orderlies
In the therapy session downstairs
That's what the rep's sitting in on
Ok, listen
want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you
'll go get some doctors
looks at , wondering whether she can trust him
Her eyes shift to the  on the floor and she remembers that she can
63
, ,  , , 1992 The   -- 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy -- is recognizable among a group that includes the (Dr
Williams), ,  and
They are presiding over a    when  enters
[Calling out] Sorry 'm late, Dr
Becker
is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response
Mr
Starks, this session is for our civil patients
Damon, please take Mr
Starks back to his ward
cuts him off and threatens with his gaze
[Derisively] No
Please, Dr
Becker
You can strap me in a Jacket or even gag me, but please don't leave me out of therapy
This is where  feel like  make the most progress
relents, seeing  has the upper hand -- an , deranged but eager no less
Fine, Mr
Starks
You can pull up a chair for yourself
As  walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone -- as they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a physically ailing man
Using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the group, dragging a  behind him because he doesn't have the strength to lift it
sits down
Mr
Jensen, please continue
-- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's about to
Well, [beat] 've been approached by the Federal Trade Organization
's not listening to a word  says
But  is
64
[Calm as ever] And what have they approached you about, Mr
Jensen
They want me to head the Organization for the Organized
The other  look at him in wonder as the listens limply
The Organization
for the Organized
That's right
Have you heard of them
No, Mr
Jensen
have not
2 That's because there is no such Organization, you idiot
That is categorically not true
Bl-bl- blatantly and manifestly
've been asked to lead them
But, if you'd heard of them, then they wouldn't be hush-hush, would they
[Wearily] What do the rest of you think
The  stares at one another silently
[Loud and emphatic] Well, [beat]  know they exist
And how is that
looks at , who looks back avidly
eyes Starks nervously, like he senses what he is about to do
When  was in the Gulf, the Organization was recruiting the Organized
65
[Incensed] Is that a fact, Mr
Starks
Because if it's not, it doesn't help Mr
Jensen
[Looking right at Jensen] It is a fact
Bona fide, and classified
and  watch  curiously
knew it
knew it
Those little fuckers are everywhere
They recruit only the best, Mr
Jensen
[Beat]  didn't want to have to say this
Not even the  dare disrupt the silence
But these people [pointing to the Doctors] know about it
In fact, when Presidents of this country and heads of state leave office, they come here, to Alpine Grove
They're among us right now
[Looking right at Becker] Isn't that right, Dr
Thatcher
And Jensen, 'm proud they picked you
looks on nobly
They're always ordering us to stay calm, but how can we be calm
suddenly turns right at Becker, wrapping his message to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut
[Looking suddenly directly at Becker] All they do is give orders
That's all they have to do
And no one will ever know
All it comes down to is an order
[Beat] They've got hands everywhere
stands up, ready to  Mr
Jensen
The look to  for order
66
Long live the Organization for the Organized
Sit down, Mr
Starks
Sit down, Mr
Starks
But, at that, Jensen's completely lost it
His excitement erupts in the form of him  out of his chair and eagerly and elatedly   in the head
Sit down, Mr
Jensen
Too late
are on their feet,  jubilantly up in the air
And, in the midst of the havoc, the speechless order is soundly delivered in Becker's  to Damon
Dr
Thatcher
Dr
Becker
and  grab  while the other members of the slowly calm the other patients
is too busy to notice them taking Starks out
winks at , who smiles somewhat sadly back
: , ,  ,  , 1992 and  stand above Starks, who lies on the brutal slab, already hemmed in the Jacket
Starks, you're like a mule
You're real stubborn
But there's ways of fixin' that
All you need is a good stick
[Beat] Here's your stick
slams him in the drawer
/ ' eyes dart about him; it sounds like something is in there with him
The sound stops momentarily and, then, out of nowhere, a  falls on his eye
winces
He clenches his face, not knowing when the next drop will fall
His heart starts to beat more and more madly, punctuated by the  -- making a score fit only for hell
He closes his eyes and begins to die
67
, , , , 1992 and  -- 30s, shifty, a total stranger -- sit in silence in '
(We recognize the murder scene
) in the rearview mirror though doesn't see them yet
and  are talking to one another
's voice takes a dangerous tone
You ever been to jail
No
nods, distracting  long enough to slip a hand down his leg to the  he's hidden there
It's worse than war
It's worse than anywhere you've ever been
doubt it
[Beat]  don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it
carefully pulls over to the side of the road, assured and cautious with each word, each move
Well, 've never been to war, but 'm sure as hell not going back to prison
[Finally spotting Harrison] What's he pulling us over for
[Still preparing himself] Recreation
walks up to their car
Gentlemen, 'm gonna need you to step out of the car, with your hands at your side please
Why
68
[Sternly] Step out of the car
Ok, sir
was just asking what for
This is a stolen vehicle you're driving
Now put your hands in the air, out where  can see 'em
That's the second when   sees where ' is
As he reaches for his own , the situation explodes as   eclipse all else goes down, still holding his own  and  jumps out of the car to check on him
Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for
looks around, still holding the
Starks swallows, assessing whether to back away or not
waves his gun as he half points it in Harrison's direction
Then,  still in hand, he smirks nervously and looks at
Man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you ain't even worth a fucking bullet
raises the gun, then aims it away from  and shoots   once more
From the ground, fires back and , now lunging at Tenny, falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue anyone
smiles sardonically and slowly puts the  in his back pocket as he turns to leave
This  was one of the eerie  that haunted Starks in the
struggles but can't move
That's when he passes out, looking at   from the ground, as he did in the scene before
/ stands in the lighted tunnel, which only gets brighter as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's back in there
Then he sees an  of a ' that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the gradually dims
69
,   , 2004 enters the diner, calming down even more as he spots She looks up, holding  in her hand
She's understandably surprised and unexpectedly pleased when she sees him
She greets him with a small smile
She drops off her orders and then walks up to him
'll be off in 15 minutes
Can you wait till then
, , , 2004 and  smoke in the cold, standing next to the hood of her car
The Jacket
That's what they call it, right
Yeah
It was banned, you know
and it led to an investigation of Dr
Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients
That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients
[Starting to make sense] So he was giving me all kinds of drugs
[Nodding] Apparently
He was taking a lot of them, too
It said he was trying out behavior modification treatments that were banned back in the 70s -- "womb treatment" is the name he gave to what he did to you
[Cutting in] Womb
fuckin' womb
What kind of animal did he come out of
But no one knew until after
After
70
nods
[Beat] You bled to death
What
don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it
[Digesting] And you're sure my body was found on January 1st
nods
Do you really believe me
don't know
[Beat]  thought  was crazy after you left that day
died
still think  could be crazy
But then  replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it  could remember -- and it was like
don't care if was, or am
haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life
[Beat] And when you left, all wanted was
looks around her; coupled with the cold, her sobriety is obvious
takes hold of her and holds her face close to his so that their foreheads touch
[Softly]  want to trust you
Should trust you
Yes
Then we need to figure out what happened to you
It's the only thing we can do
know
71
Alpine Grove still exists
looked it up on the net
We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you
If they don't take me out before then
[As an afterthought] What's the net
looks at him and laughs
' , 2004, They are driving through  to looks out the window and watches her drive
didn't kill Officer Harrison
know
How
Did they figure it out after died
No
They never figured it out
did
Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road
Not without hurting them
,  , 2004 and  sit opposite
, the current young face of the hospital
has a boyish face and a matching gullibility
'm sorry  can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr
Starks
Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and 'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then
72
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died
No,  don't
'm sorry
wish  knew more
What about Dr
Thomas Becker or Dr
Loel Lorenson
There was also a Dr
Gries,  think
Well, Dr
Lorenson is still here at the hospital
If she was here at the time your father was, then 'm sure she'd be of more help to you
What about Dr
Becker and Mr
Gries
Unfortunately, 'm not familiar with Dr
Becker and Dr
Gries passed away three, four years ago
Do you have any kind of forwarding address for Dr
Becker
Your father was here 12 years ago doubt the hospital would have that, if Dr
Becker is still even alive
[Beat, a little suspiciously] Is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died
doesn't waver when he answers
He was the only family  remember
[Nodding] 'll see what  can find out about Dr
Becker
And maybe Dr
Lorenson will know something
73
,  , , 2004 Dr
leads  and  through a ward looks around in disbelief; it's more like a hospital now than it ever was in 1993
, ' ,  , 2004 As they arrive outside Lorenson's office,  turns to them
Let me just tell her we're here
goes inside and  takes '  as they wait
It's hardly more than a couple seconds when appears in the doorway
She looks at  curiously and the two share a very lengthy, intense
-- now in her 50s -- walks closer to Starks suspiciously
For his part,  doesn't look as unfamiliar with Lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape Lorenson
Hello
'm Beth Lorenson
She puts out a hand that is trembling slightly
It's nice to meet you, Mr
Starks
hesitates before he takes Lorenson's hand
There is something very eerie about the exchange
quickly lets go and  turns to
And you are
looks back uncomfortably
'm just William's friend
looks over both of them acutely and then calmly turns to Dr
Morgan
think we'll be fine from here
Thanks, Stanley
74
' ,  , 2004 leans against her desk while  and  sit in the chairs
As they talk, each seems cautious in his exchange -- not knowing what the other one does or doesn't know
My God you look exactly like him
never knew my father
Did you
Yeah,  did
[Beat] He was my most memorable patient
Why
considers her answer
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things
You thought my father was crazy
No
don't think he was crazy
He needed help
but he wasn't crazy
[Beat] Your father actually helped me with a case of mine
waits to see if  knows what she is talking about
What case
was working with a boy named Eugene
shows no recognition but  does
Who was Eugene
[Peaked] He was a friend's son
[Beat] Are you familiar with the case
75
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father
How did he help
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how 'd get through to him
How
He just said
that 'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him
don't understand
still don't either, even after all these years
Do you know how my father died
[Unconvincingly] don't know how much  remember but seem to think it was from a
cut or blow of some sort or another
How'd he get it
[Beat]  don't know
But Dr
Morgan said you were around when my father was
was
But  saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows
'm sorry  don't know more about your father's
[Sincerely] didn't know about everything that went on here
says it like she's hiding something
76
Well, do you think Dr
Becker would have any idea
How do you know about Dr
Becker
My dad wrote some things down before he died
looks like she's suddenly remembering something
That's right
He did
looks at Lorenson curiously; he doesn't know what Lorenson is talking about
So maybe Dr
Becker would know
[Beat] But, as 'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities
Why would we do that
just stares at , not knowing if he died by this man's hands or not, not knowing who he can trust
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups
see you've done your homework
[Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then
At the time, we didn't have the
resources to help our patients the way we needed to
[Beat] Now, we do
And things are different
wouldn't be so sure
Like you said about back then, you might not know everything going on around here
looks right at
77
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it
[Beat] Yeah, it is
[Eerily] It's almost as if your life depended on it
Isn't it
Exactly
Well
[beat] let me know how your search turns out
[Beat] We will
,  , and  walk briskly down it, away from Lorenson's office
don't believe a thing she just said
Me neither
Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene
have no idea
You think Lorenson kills you
Maybe
don't know
Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how  died
Let's see if they have an address for Becker
also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with
Why
78
Because that's the part  believe is true
You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts  pulled
nods
[Beat] There's one more thing  want to see
[  ],  , 2004 , determined, now leads
As they reach the end of the hall, we see  -- now in his 50s -- look after them curiously before he goes back to his work with a
,  , 2004 watches  ignore the "Authorized Personnel Only" as he pushes the door open without so much as a pause
, ,  , 2004 The morgue looks exactly as before
is momentarily jarred in the room
He looks to the wall on which the  hung and sees only the that used to hold it up
This was the room
They used to hang the Jacket there
[Turning to Jackie] This is where it happened
This is the room 'm actually in right now
isn't doubtful, but it's also hard to be convinced
can show you
It's probably in there
walks to the   and rests his hands on the one they put him in
Then, with great difficulty -- physical and emotional -- he opens it to see if there is anything left
He pulls it out, and there's nothing in there
79
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea
leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the stained metal -- still reddened and browned with   -- and the part of the morgue slab he  his  into when he was in it
looks at it in disbelief
Yes, it was
[Softly] My fingers were the only things  could move
[Beat] Dead bodies don't bleed
And they certainly can't claw so hard they dent metal
, , and  are leaving the , when  spots , now hardly a hair of the bully he was before stares at him curiously;  glares back furiously
You folks ain't supposed to be down here
We were just leaving
doesn't take his eyes off Starks
Do  know you from somewhere
You may have known my father, William Starks
smiles, remembering
That's right
Goddamn, you're the spitting image
didn't know he had a son
He didn't either
[With a dirty laugh] 'll be damned
He musta been 12 when he had you
[Beat] You could be his ghost
80
Did you know my father
Oh yeah, sure
He killed a cop, right
looms strangely over  in this exchange
You wouldn't happen to know how he died, would you
[Slightly apprehensive] No,  don't
just remember them finding his body
You don't know any more, Damon
[Shocked] How'd you know my name
My father used to talk about you
Oh yeah, what'd he say
Damon's eyes betray his unease
He said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail
is shocked, and cowed
So much that he shakes as he looks for his bearings
Look here,  don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me
That's too bad
thought you said you never knew your father
didn't
[Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death
81
don't know what you're talking about, man
swear
This is some weird shit you're telling me
and don't know how come you're doing it
starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and distraught before him
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head
Someone had to have given him it
never touched your father
swear
Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven leans in closer to  as he remembers
You know something, Damon
You're like a mule
You're real stubborn
But there's ways of fixin' that
All you need is a good stick
[Beat] Here's your stick
Live with it
looks like he could easily bash Damon's head against the wall, but instead he lets it go and walks away

Next to his grave is that of
looks down sadly at both comes up behind him
How long do we have
don't know
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now
looked him up and he was listed
looks scared and lost -- like it's all catching up to him
And like he might be being taken out of the Jacket
How far away is that

kisses his  -- from the war and the Jacket -- and lifts her higher so he can look at her as they make love for the first time
, ' , is lying in ' arms, running her  over one of the  on his chest
strokes her hair
What about Captain Medley
He never told them what happened to you over there
His testimony
that coward wanted them to think you were crazy
know
It was perfect
[Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything 'll ever say
[Frustrated] Well, doesn't what he did to you make you mad
Of course it makes me mad
It makes me more than mad
Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him
But what's it gonna do for me to find them now can't fix everything in three days
You've got to get yourself out of that place
They're going to kill you if you don't
might not be able to
It's not a prison, it's a hospital
There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it
She doesn't finish because it's too hard to
nods, wiping her tears and kissing her

, ' , , 2004 The sore sound of the  being opened stirs Jackie -- awakening her as if she heard it in her sleep
She reaches across the bed, but  is no longer there
She runs her hands over the bed like he's alive in the sheets
,  , , 1992 is administering medicine to a patient in the ward, when she sees -- almost like a shadow -- a being wheeled down the hall
She finishes with the patient and runs to the end of the hall in search of it
' , ,  ,  , 1992 lies recovering under a small light above his hospital bed
His body bears marks of the brutalization
As we pull back, we see
standing guard over him at the foot of his bed
, ,  , sits by a window --
's in his arm -- smoking feebly, still severely weak from the Jacket, while observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition
'll die either way
pulls up a chair and sits opposite him
can't try to help you unless you let me
[Beat]  know about the Jacket
waits to see what this means
'm sorry for what you were put through, and 'm sorry  couldn't stop it earlier
But  promise you that  will from now on
[Cutting him off] don't want you to
doesn't understand
85
What do you mean
You have no idea what's going on
No,  do
That's what 'm saying to you
Listen to me
You don't
The Jacket is my only chance in this place
just thinks it's another delusion
How can you say that in your physical condition
Do you realize that it's because you were put in it that you're as
weak as you are now
Becker's a man who's not well himself
searches for words that won't sound as crazy as he knows he appears
They don't exist
You don't understand
Then help me understand
You know, you're not alone
lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms
What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously
This has nothing to do with that
[Exasperated] Then what
What
[Beat]  can't guess it
You have to help me
fixes his eyes on Lorenson
He has nothing to lose but still he treads carefully
The words that follow come almost unwittingly
What you do not know is the only thing you know
() 86
(cont'd) [Beat] And what you own is what you do not own
And where you are is where you are not
[Beat] Where is that from
It's as though  hears his words for the first time
don't know
[Frustrated] Remember
Come on
Tell me what you do know
[Beat] 've seen a time that's not this time
And 'm only able to see it when 'm in the Jacket
Well, what time is it
2004
nods, trying to mask his dismay but failing
You don't believe me
[Testing him] Well, what year do you think it is now
[Exasperated] 'm not delusional
know it's 1992
Same as every sane person
Ok fine
Tell me about it
Tell me about the future
2004
What does it look like
It doesn't look all that different
The future doesn't look different
No
Not for people like me
[Beat] Not in the places  come from
87
What about the world
didn't see that much of it -- same as now
only saw it as part of my own life
looks at , unintentionally patronizing
Do you think you're traveling in time
Is that it
shakes his head and momentarily challenges Lorenson simply with his air of calm resolve
Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc
searches for another approach
[Beat] Like who
Like MacKenzie maybe
Maybe
[Matter-of-factly] Did he tell you he tried to kill his wife
nods
MacKenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here
All because his wife left him for another man
moves to put his cigarette out and his
almost falls out of his arm
makes a move to adjust it and flinches perceptibly, startling
[Adjusting it himself] Maybe that just makes him weak, not crazy
Or maybe he is crazy
[Beat] Still doesn't make me think  am
() 88
[Adjusting it himself] And, judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient, it doesn't even make you think  am, so what don't you work on persuading yourself first
Why don't you help me
Because  don't have time
Why not
'm about to die unless  do something to stop it
And how do you know that
Because of the future
know what's going to happen
William, that is just another facet of my delusions
Then,  remembers the only thing that might help him
He pauses, trying to recall as much of it as he can
And what about your work with Eugene -- the kid
Is that another facet of my delusions
-- having prepared to continue -- is bowled over at the mention of her patient
She loses all color and calm in her features
How do you know about Eugene
You told me about him
saw you and think you thought  knew something about him
So you told me
doesn't know what to say
[Somewhat angrily] How do you know about Eugene
89
[Shaking his head in disbelief] You told me
It's like two parts of you talking through me
Look, judging from your reaction, there's no other way  could know about him
There obviously is, so what don't you just tell me how you found out about him
looks at her convincingly
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what 'm saying is true
don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions
They're not my delusions
Look, just leave my business with Becker to me
One thing's got nothing to do with the other
One's got everything to do with the other
So unless you want my blood on your hands
leave what's between me and Becker between me and Becker
backs off, jarred by Starks' assertions and fearful of his debilitating vehemence
,  , , 1992 sits idly on one of the hallway benches until the hallway is clear of the
Then he scuttles quickly -- all the time close to the wall -- to Starks' room
' ,  , , 1992 gets inside, ducks as a  passes and then taps lightly on the wall, announcing himself gladly
90
Hey,  brought you some smokes
doesn't waste any time
Lorenson said your wife left you for another man and that's when you lost it
almost imperceptibly winces -- confirming the truth for Starks -- before he has to sit down
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"
Is it true
tosses him the  and lights himself one
She left me,  tried to kill her, tried to kill myself
She was mean, was weak,  was cruel so she left, didn't plan it, didn't see it
suddenly stops, distraught
When he resumes, it's in an oddly more normal tone than he's ever used before
[Softly] didn't want to see it
'm in here because they say  have a nervous condition
[Beat] Well, here's my question, who wouldn't be nervous if they really looked at their life
[Beat] Whose life is that good
doesn't have an answer
Not this luckless little mammal's
What difference is it to them
[Beat, slows down] You believe what you want to believe
One version is easier than another so you make it your own
As MacKenzie runs his hand over his forehead, he looks hurt, and sad, but strangely not a bit crazy
91
'll tell you this though
However nuts  am,  wasn't nuts enough not to know how wrong it was to put a human being in something like that
's twitching continues as he recollects it
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy
[Shrugging] What if we are
There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself
[Beat] Everyone does it, don't they
Even Becker
That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3
Becker does
Are you sure
've been here for 11 years
It's my neighborhood
'Course 'm sure
He's as drugged up as the rest of us guess he has to be to put up with all this
nods and MacKenzie puts his head down, suddenly vulnerable and embarrassed
lights
Thanks for the cigarettes
You still got a lot of problems, MacKenzie, but you're ok
and  smoke together quietly

It's especially hard with the
still connected to one of his arms
At least it's some kind of bars we've got you behind
turns, startled
92
Hello, William
understand you've been asking for me almost every hour
would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about
That's too bad
It is
But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them
They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh
Temporarily
lights a cigarette and, with that gesture, adopts the unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears little resemblance to his usual demeanor
Makes it a little easier for me to get away with mine
looks at  seriously
And what's that
My business
Yes
Getting away with things
Like whatever  may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison
You killed him
simply delivers one slow nod
93
And wound up in a better cage
[Beat] But  still want to make a deal
looks understandably disgusted and  proceeds with the calculation of someone who is guilty
See, the deluxe lab animal treatment 've been receiving -- well,  don't think it's worked
woke up today and realized
[eerily lowering his voice]
don't think 'm cured
So really, what was the point
Torture
think that's still sort of illegal in some states -- though we'll have to check on Vermont
And, how's this for the cherry on top: it seems my physician is a pill-popping freak
[Beat] Last time  checked, that makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows
[Humbly, deftly] " don't remember everything they did to me
just remember the worst parts
"  think  should be sitting down when  say it, don't you think
It takes  some seconds to swallow this
think
have to think about it
cocks his head to one side as he does
Then he slowly makes his way over to  and leans in closer to him
instinctively raises his hand to his  -- prepared to be defensive if he has to be
If this is the moment when he's killed
But  only  the
angrily out of Starks' arm, tearing his skin with it
think your story needs a little fleshing out before it's ready to go
turns to leave as  bleeds onto the floor
'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks
Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off
94
You sure you know where to find one
've managed to every Sunday of my life
[Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks
And what does that mean
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to
smirks at the hypocrisy he sees
Becker, how do you sleep at night
You in here
[Beat] Works like a drug
leaves without looking back and  closes his eyes, breathing a sigh of relief that it's over
,  , 1992, , dressed to leave, stops to talk to , one of the evening nurses
Nina, William Starks is to stay in all night
If anything is supposed to change,  want to be called about it
Sure, Dr
Lorenson
' , , 1992 comes home to an unremarkable apartment to find a thin, young mother,  , and her eleven year-old mute, and seemingly retarded son, , waiting for her outside her door
Hi
[Beat] Sorry 'm late
95
It's ok
[To Eugene] Hi, Eugene
returns her greeting with a blank stare
' , , sets her things down on the kitchen table as starts to tidy things around the apartment
Talia,  need to ask you something
looks at
What is it
Have you told anyone about my sessions with Eugene
[With an accent] Of course not
[Off Lorenson's still doubtful look]  swear  haven't wouldn't do that to Eugene, or you
You know that
Has anyone been asking about him
No
would have told you
nods
She believes her

No funny business or we can make this a lot fucking harder for you

One look at the  and the   burns once more
[Weakly] No funny business
,  , , 1992 hustles Starks down the hall as fast as they can before the  or any other staff member spots them
/, ' , sits opposite , who quietly observes him, jotting some notes down on her pad
She is intermittently holding up  for Eugene, asking him to repeat their names as if she were teaching him to read
Eugene, this is a "
" starts to pronounce the word when abruptly, and without any warning, he looks like he's unconscious, only with a blank stare
Lorenson quickly moves beside Eugene and watches him from up close, apparently not altogether surprised at what's happening
doesn't even blink
The only sounds we hear from him are a couple, barely audible guttural noises
-- exhausted -- takes off her glasses wearily and gently addresses the boy
Come on back down here
Wherever you are
try to come on back
You'll like it,  promise
Just then,  walks in with ,  and  for Eugene and Lorenson
She spots her son in his absent, staring state and forces her face into a small, sad smile to avoid tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before them
gently touches ' hand
looks at her warmly

He looks around, trying to make sure it really is her car
He looks in the back and sees a pair of sneakers and an empty  of
He looks outside and sees a few people walking into the of the gas station
He trembles with cold as he looks down at his plaid shirt
Then,  unexpectedly appears outside the ' opening the car door and nearly spilling her  when she spots  next to her
Seeing it's him though, she smiles warmly
You just scared me, that's all
She leans over to him and gives him a kiss, handing him the coffee
Me, too
Here, drink this

You're sure
Yeah
called the number yesterday to make sure
Thomas Becker, retired gets out of the car
' , , 2004, knocks on the door
No answer
' , , 2004, tries to look through the windows to see if anyone's there
No one is
It looks small and dark inside
' , , 2004, knocks again, looking down anxiously at his feet
walks up to him from around the side of the house
They don't have the time to wait
They're not here
They're not
[Beat, lost] No
notices how  Starks looks
Maybe they're out
nods
99
' , 2004, rubs his hands together as he looks out the windows and sees   or  on the street
watches him despairingly
How much time do we have
[Distracted] don't know
What
What are you thinking
There're no cars on this street
looks around; there really aren't
Yeah, you're right
But wait, how can that be
turns to , thinking
don't know
Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream
How can you have a street with no cars on it
don't know
But this isn't a dream
'm real, and so is where we are
Then why isn't there anyone around
[Beat]  don't know
runs his hand over his head and closes his eyes in desperation
What are you doing
doesn't answer
William
William
opens his eyes
She sighs in relief
100
Maybe he's gone somewhere
He'll have to come back
starts to shake his head in disbelief, when suddenly, he realizes
Of course he will
[Beat] What day of the week is it
It's Sunday
[Nodding] It's Sunday
So
looks ecstatic with hope
Look where these people live
small, beautiful, removed place
They've got lives to be grateful for
William, you're not making sense
[Beat] They're at Church
And  bet that's where Becker is

Though it's aged slightly, it hasn't softened

They are leaning against her car when  spots him
walks beside a   -- presumably his registers his formidableness with some surprise; Becker's maintained a strong physique and is hardly a shade less intimidating than he was before
Only his hand has a permanent shake now
doesn't waste any time
He heads straight for him
Almost sensing him,  looks in his direction
The casual look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of
You still go to Church
How's that work
Your God just doesn't notice
That it
[Beat, serious] How you doin', Dr
Becker
stops walking and looks at Starks
His  looks at him
' Grandpa
[Still looking at Starks] Sean, why don't you wait for me by the car
'll be there in a minute
[Turning to the kid] Ok
His grandson, momentarily appeased, heads for the car
[To Starks] Can  help you
don't know, Dr
Becker
Can you
102
That's enough to confirm for  who  is
All around them, people leaving Church socialize routinely -- unaware of the haunted history being made between them
Who are you
think you know
Your eyes say you do
[Beat] You're his son
No
'm not his son
'm him
[Beat] What
You look like you've seen a ghost
You can come here and touch me, old man
'm the real thing
How
how are you here
looks at Becker -- each a terrifying reminder of the other's past
You died, Starks
Years ago, in the hospital
know
[Beat] You killed me, didn't you
No
didn't
swear  didn't probably helped push you to kill yourself, but  didn't do it
didn't kill myself
died from a blow to the head
How'd it happen have to know
looks at him, nearly too stunned to speak
don't know how you died
The last time  put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer
103
didn't say  remembered killing him
just repeated some words to get myself back in there
know
[Beat]  knew that when you came out
How
Because
because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known
You came back and repeated three names
falters as he recalls his offenses
Of people like you
People  was just trying to help
They couldn't get worse so  thought, with medication, they might get
Medication
What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer
It was part of the treatment intended
didn't know what the effects would be
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out
The three of you weren't regular patients
You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove
No, we were patients
concedes after all this time
You and the others didn't seem that way then
104
is quiet as he comes to understand how it's about to work out: if Becker tells him those names now, he essentially indicts himself
Who were the others
remembers with a hint of remorse
[Racked with remorse] Nathan Piechowski, Jackson MacGregor, and Ted Casey
[Beat] didn't ask for you -- for any of you
You were all sent to me
looks at Becker, in astonishment
What is it
just stares at Becker, waiting for the realization to hit him, too
How did you come to know their names
You just told me
The last time was with you was when  was in the Jacket
'm in it right now, Dr
Becker
don't understand
'm in it as we speak
[Beat] You're haunting yourself right now
[Beat] guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does
You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr
Becker
It turned out different, didn't it
didn't put you in Alpine Grove
No
[Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket
105
[Stoically] was sorry when  heard you died
was, but
how was  to know you didn't shoot that police officer
The same way you just said  didn't without my ever telling you
[Beat] And that still doesn't excuse what you did
Just because you had keys to a cage didn't mean you had animals inside
[Beat] You've earned your guilt, Becker
shares a last look with Becker before he walks away towards the car
' , , 2004 and  sit inside the parked car as  touches his head
That's all you got from him
That bastard helped take your life away from you
No, he didn't
What
How can you say that
He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval
Jacket
He's probably the one who killed you
And with those words,  starts to break down
No one's killing anyone
takes her hand and runs it over his head
Touch me
'm okay
looks at her with love, understanding and, for the first time, a sense of peace
He strokes her hair to calm her down
106
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then  wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face
Why are you saying that
[Beat] We don't have long, do we
looks at her without answering
wipes her eyes, fastens ' seat belt, and seeing that Starks'  have started to flutter, starts driving
In the distance, the barely audible sound of the  opening, and their time ending, is heard
Where are we going
To the hospital

As  sleeps, keeps looking over at him like it's a way to make sure he stays with her
, , , 2004 helps  -- who's severely weakened at this point -- to the nurse's station
is there
Claire,  need help
helps , and they take him into a room
From afar, we hear  asking about him
What's happening to me
Why am getting so much weaker
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through
Jesus, what's happened to him
107
, , , , 2004 helps  do for  what they can; it doesn't seem like much at this point
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there
need something to persuade her that  was there
Get me something to take to her
Ok
Ssh
Rest

Lorenson

She  with the printer as if it were responsible for what's happening
Then she realizes she's not alone
She looks back and sees , watching from the doorway, with a sympathetic look in her eyes
[In a panic] He's not
No, no
[Beat] Not yet
But he doesn't have long
Are you sure you don't want a doctor to look at him
No
It won't do any good

This time we see a  stop for him from a much closer distance
pulls up towards  and rolls down the window on the passenger side
bends down to be able to see the driver
Hey, Mister, you need a ride
Where are you going
'm going to Canada but  can let you ride with me up to the border

Can you drive
Sure
Great, get in
We'll switch off in a bit

We catch one glimpse of  in the moonlight, standing naked in the doorway, before he turns and then
disappears -- having been taken out of the Jacket at that point

William, please, honey, wake up
For me

Can you hear me

He's the key
That's who you have to tell her about when you get back there

He sees the  this has taken on her, just as he senses he is about to be taken out of the Jacket
He nudges her gently
Jackie
stirs her eyes to look at him
[Somewhat urgently] Where do you live
What
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother
Do you remember your address
110
112 Orchard Way
[Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you
, faint, struggles to get out of the bed
You gotta stop thinking like that
Then, where are you going
Nowhere
[Beat]  just think 'm gonna be sick
moves towards the bathroom of the hospital room
moves to help him and he motions for her to stop
falters in the doorway when he turns to look back at Jackie   -- like it might be for the last time
[In a whisper] You come back to me
nods, then goes in and closes the door behind him
stares after him -- alone in the total silence of the room
She listens for the slightest noise and that's when she actually hears the sound of the  being opened for herself
She realizes he's gone
She  after him, opens the door in a fit, and then, sees what she feared most: no sign of Starks
falls to her knees, right there, on the bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to realize how unfathomably deep her heart is
, 2004 is suddenly in the waiting area outside Lorenson's office -- still severely weakened
He walks slowly to the   and feebly knocks
answers and  falls into her arms
[Stunned] Oh dear God
' has laid  down on the  in her office

He spews as much of it as he can out in his feverish state

How
how do you know
You told me this was how it happened

Yeah

Who
who kills me
You have nothing to fear, William

He takes off his coat and his gloves, but not his , and walks out of his office with a decided urgency

You killed them
momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien
After some seconds,  passes out and  -- hands trembling -- looks as though he might stick him back in when, instead, he starts to remove him from the Jacket himself
He silently and carefully unties each of the straps -- taking unusual care for Starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a stretcher
' , ,  , As the  starts to rise, we see  -- now cleaned up -- recovering in his bed
He is unconscious

You're going to be ok, William
We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you
Who are you kidding, Doc
You or me
doesn't answer
Can  get some paper and something to write with
What for
[Solemnly] 'm starting to think 'm really gonna die soon
So 'd like to write some things down
'm not gonna let that happen
You still don't believe me, do you
do believe you
No
Listen to me
the kid, Eugene
still gets taken aback by Starks' knowledge of Eugene
No one knows you're working with him so how would  have found out
He's your friend's son, right
114
It's true; no one could have known about Lorenson's private life
coughs, clearly in great pain
William,  can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state
Listen to me
That's all  ask
has no choice
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does
He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly
Who told you this
You did, in the future
You figured it out because a part of you already knows this
That's how it works
[Beat] 'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it
closes his eyes, gathering what strength he can
don't know when it'll happen but soon  think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up
What are you talking about
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him
That's all  can manage before  sees he's about to pass out again

answers the  at her door
It's  and Hey
What is it
[Finding it hard to explain] Nothing
[Beat]  don't know thought of something  could try

nods and leads Eugene inside

Come on Eugene, try to say it with me
This is a ""
--d---d----
But Eugene can't hold the sound of the letter long enough to make the word
An absence seizure takes hold of him as he looks out unconsciously into space
moves closer to him
[Softly] What's happening to you
checks Eugene's pulse and leans in close to the boy's unconscious face like the answer is there if she just looks hard enough
Are you having a seizure
Is that really what's going on
spots a corner of Eugene's  twitching slightly, and, rushing to get a better look, takes the shade off of the nearby  and holds it above his head so she can get a better look at him
116
Just then,  opens the door, startling Lorenson
She knocks over the  and, as it spills on the   -- now on Eugene's lap -- it causes an
Eugene catches it
gasps and Lorenson watches the boy in fear
The moment passes and Eugene -- more responsive than he has ever been before -- looks at his mother and Lorenson
He doesn't know what's happened but he is aware, and awake, like never before
picks right up where he and Lorenson left off
Dog
[To Talia] Hi
and  look at him and each other at shock
[
, distantly] You're going to
shock the boy and then things will change for him
You ok, Eugene
holds Lorenson's gaze steadily for a few moments
[Stunned himself] Yeah, you are ok
What's happening
[Putting the pieces together] He got a little shock
[To himself] And it's reset him
Not permanently probably
but at least for a little while
They use it on epileptic patients sometimes
But he's not epileptic
No, but he is having seizures

's merely surprised
' ,  ,  , 1992 looks up from his  -- now covered in  -- to see Dr
Lorenson in the doorway
still looks weak but much better than before
117
It worked, didn't it
nods
This is really happening, isn't it
[Beat] What do you need me to do
[Beat] Thank you
folds the
need to get this letter to someone
can't take you out of here in your condition
And  can't stay here in my condition
am going to die tonight
It's already been decided
No, it hasn't
Yes
[Beat] It has
Everything up 'till today is done
Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs
,  , 1992 helps  into the parking lot as it snows
' , , 1992 and  are driving on the same, now familiar highway
You know how to get there
118
Sure
It's an easy address little far out there, but easy enough
Good

You want me to come with you
No, 'll be ok
slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on it as best as he can
The sound, however, is still understandably soft
waits and then reaches for the knob on the door
He opens it and looks inside
We first see his face, and the devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on
is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years old
Though  expected it, he falters under the disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman he loved
As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to break down
Hi
[Surprised] Hey
[Beat]  remember you
remember you, too
shakes his head, looking at her
She looks beautiful, and still hopeful
Her life lays ahead of her and her fate -- when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible from this innocent, still promising image
Jackie, how have you been
119
smiles; she doesn't get asked that often
've been ok
Good
How's your mom
Ok,  guess
nods
smiles
It's all he can do not to crumble
Do you think  could see her
She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in his eyes
Sure
calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get her
has gotten out of the car and is waiting outside on the porch
remains in the doorway
Some seconds later,  appears -- gaunt but in a slightly better state than we saw her before
Can  help you
Hey, Jean
Nice to see you
looks a little confused
'm sorry
Your face looks awfully familiar,  just can't quite place it
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway
The guy you yelled at for no good reason
Oh, yeah
120
She gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks, decides intuitively he can't be much harm
She also notices waiting by the car
There something you need
You could say that
looks at , hesitating because of her
Sensing this,  asks Jackie to leave
Jackie, go play in the snow
Why
Just do it
leaves and walks to the yard
watches
can't stay long
[Motioning to Lorenson] That's my doctor and gotta get back to the hospital
Everything  want to say is in this letter
[Beat] You can check as much of it as you can
hands her the
won't be around when you read it
but  hope you believe it
It'd be a real shame if you didn't
looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods
[Beat]  should be on my way
has been watching this exchange from the shed
When he looks over there, he catches her eye and  , with what strength he has left
Bye, Jackie
121
These are the hardest words  has probably ever had to say
just stares after him, as does , as he shows himself out
Happy New Year to both of you
Thanks
You, too
' , , 1992 As  is walking away, we see his eyes begin to tear in the cold -- but not from it
' , , 1992 abruptly runs after him
Hey, wait
stops in his tracks; he clears as much sadness from his face as he can before he turns around to face her
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie
Ok
Then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly in the cold
takes '  and holds it in his own softly and affectionately
and
look on curiously as looks in her face, at her hand in his, and then to the heavens for the means to get through this
As  lets go at last,  looks back at him, sensing the connection even if she doesn't know it yet
turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car
moves to help him, but  tells her not to with his eyes
He makes his way to the car on his own

Starks' voice, as we hear it now, is presumably from parts of the he's written to her

They drive on in silence

) was 25 years old the first time died
It didn't end anything though
[Beat] Sometimes  think we live through things only to be able to tell them, to bear witness, to say this happened
,  ' , 1992-1993 walks back through the gates of the hospital, despondently returning inside, with  at his side
(
) And it wasn't to someone else
It was to me
And  lived despite it
Sometimes  think we live to beat the odds
And sometimes  agree that life can only begin with the knowledge of death
That it can all end, even when you least want it to
,  , looks up from his game of solitaire as helps  down the hall
He holds up his hand in the gesture of hello, or goodbye
raises his hand back with an earnest smile
'm telling you my story because it's the only way  can try to help your daughter, and you, have a better one of your own

(
) It's scary
and lucky
how much we can forget
Scary because we think the past gives us our bearing, and lucky because in those moments 'm talking about, you realize it doesn't
And it never had to
, , , 1992 (Officer Harrison's murderer) is at the bar ordering a drink from the
As he gets his , he slaps a down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar
' ,   ' , , 1992 rummages in a box of her personal belongings, looking for something specific in them
She stops finally when she finds '
She takes them out slowly and puts them around her neck
(
) am not a crazy man, even though they mistook me for one
live in the same world as the rest of you
Only  saw more of it
Then, after a moment of staring down at them, she tucks them under her sweater
' , , 1992 holds a beer as he stares blankly at a broadcasting news about  '
Medley's barely watching the footage
' ,  , 1992 Dr
Lorenson helps Starks back to bed
looks up at Lorenson, thanking her without words but with his eyes
smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks' even more weakened self
(
) And the seeing is the only way you can hear what the truth around you is saying: you can always start believing in things you don't already believing in
And, while you're alive, it's never too late
124
Then he turns and walks out, closing the door so that Starks' room and the screen darken at the same time
,  ,  ' , 1992 of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the night, through the now familiar passage to the basement
is not restrained this time though we don't see who is walking down the hall with him
He runs his hand over his forehead and looks at it when he's done
They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as appears dizzier and dizzier
He doesn't stop and the beside him doesn't see how weak he is
until
In slow motion, we hear a ,
No
Wa

But ' head hits the   of the on the wall, as it was destined to
In the terrific , one  cuts a neat, deep, fatal  in Starks' head
starts to flow
As ' eyes struggle to regain their focus, we see the , indiscernible  of the leaning over him to see if he's all right
The details start to make sense, even to Starks
This is the they said he died from

pours from his head onto the floor
The  with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight onto the metal slab
She's doing it as carefully, and gently, as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the , almost as if the act itself is a humane one
When the  finally reach the straps around his neck and the hardest part of the struggle has passed,  smiles kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead  in the room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in
As the drawer is pushed in, one of the  gets caught on the side,  '
We hear a small  in the room
Then the  adjust the strap and slowly push in
125
/ It's more beautiful and serene inside than it's ever been before
This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as though he's traveling in a heaven of his own
The  he sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest  has finally retrieved his memory without it haunting him
(
) promise you, Jean
No matter how bad the days and things around you look, they look better awake than they do asleep
can offer you some proof: when you die, there's only one thing you want to have happen
sometimes so badly it comes true,  guess
[Beat] You want to come back

6)

who put Starks in
Exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there, she stares at the closed drawer, like looking at it is one way to look after Starks

puts down '  and walks out of the kitchen and watches  sitting absently on the couch, looking past the
kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her daughter in the eye
looks back curiously as wraps her arms around Jackie's  and rests her head in her lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly missed a tragedy
,   , 2005 Over the sounds of  slushing in the snow, an  fades up slowly on the screen, until we see it's , standing in the parking lot outside the diner once more
This time he seems situated, and hopeful
After a slightly longer wait than the first time,  walks out -- in the same way as before except that she wears a ' and an unmistakable air of vitality
Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same attraction between them teeming even more than before
Even as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a on his head and no coat in the cold,  is someone we see she wants to be near
Then we see  as  does: she looks beautiful, alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to leave
She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her being
Hey there
[Beat] You ok
revels in the moment
In their reunion
think so
You're bleeding pretty bad there
touches his  in a panic and, seeing the on his hands, looks up at her, terrified
Sensing this, she moves closer to calm him
It's ok
It's ok
Relax
It's just a cut
We can get it fixed
() 127
(cont'd) But we need to get you to the hospital now
How'd you get that
fell down
[Beat] But 'm alive
looks at her -- immensely relieved and grateful
[Laughing a little] Yes, you are alive
But, listen, it's New Year's Day
You're not going to get a cab
Especially not here
And you're gonna freeze if you stand out here in the snow much longer
'm on my way back to my shift at the hospital
You work there
[Gesturing to her uniform] Yeah, 'm a nurse
Why don't you let me give you a ride
falters slightly as he walks
helps him make it to the car, much like before
Thanks
' , 2005 can hardly keep his eyes off her when her suddenly rings
Sorry, one sec
answers it, smiling
Hey
How are you
[Beat] Thanks was just thinking about you, too
listens nervously to her conversation and the affection in her voice
Listen,  gotta go, mom, 'cause 'm late
but, thanks
Happy New Year to you, too
'll call you later
[Beat] Ok, bye
128
hangs up and looks at Starks -- feeling a little awkward after the call
Sorry about that
It was my mom
smiles back warmly at her; he gets it more than she knows
Nothin' to worry about there
,  , 2005 Jackie's car pulls onto the highway, alongside the other, more modern cars on the highway
(
) How you doin'
'm doing fine
The happy sound of their engine on the highway continues, uninterrupted, for some seconds, before, first faintly then louder, we hear a racking, all too familiar sound: the creaking as it's opened once more
