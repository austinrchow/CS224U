: -  - Framed in the large picture window stands  , alone, looking out at the night
He turns away as the heavy satin curtains close, wiping him from view
'  - blinding beam of light cuts across the room
One pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the opposite end of the room
They show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual orgy
is slumped on a sofa
His young wife, , is curled up beside him
, operating the projector's remote-control, has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother
Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair
Clunk
Another slide hits the screen
Gerald is getting turned on
He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged leg
Anna shudders momentarily
She obviously finds his touch repulsive
Carter watches Gerald's hand
(removing the cigar from his mouth) Bollock naked with his socks still on
(thoughtfully) They do that up North
What for
Protective purposes
He laughs
Ask me
Ask Jack
It's his old stamping ground
Carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet
Lights and sweet music happen when he opens it
Clunk
The slide changes
Must be a bloody contortionist Still looking at the screen, Gerald continues
We don't want you to go up the North, Jack
Jack and Anna look at each other momentarily
There is definitely something between them
No
Clunk
The slide changes
(groans) Not suede boots
Knock it off, Gerald
What
And get the clap
Clunk
The slide changes
You work for us, Jack
We have connections in those parts
'd hate you to screw 'em up
Clunk
The slide changes
What's that
python
Sid laughs raucously
Clunk
The slide changes
What are you going for
To find out what happened
Clunk
The slide changes
Some hard nuts operate up there, Jack
They won't take kindly to someone from London poking his bugle in
Too bad
smell trouble, boy
Clunk
The slide changes
The law was satisfied
Since when was that good enough
Clunk
The slide changes
Think again, Jack
will
- Express train plunges into a tunnel Blackness
: - The compartment is full
Jack Carter sits in one corner, reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely
- The train speeds northwards
In the distance the stacks of a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown smoke
- Carter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor
- massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past
Its mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect
- Carter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his nose
- The train breaks from another tunnel
Evening light cuts across the track as the train hurtles on
- Carter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small phial of brown pills
He swallows one
- chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the outskirts of the city appear
- The train moves slowly along the platform and stops
Carter collects his coat and briefcase from the rack
- The street is fairly deserted
Carter exits with other passengers from the train
He pauses and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite
- couple of youths are playing records on the juke box
An old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper
Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy comes to serve him
Pint of bitter
The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the beer
Carter snaps his fingers at him
In a thin glass
The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a thin glass and puts it on the counter
telephone rings
The second barman answers it
Is there a Mr Carter in the room
Yes
Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the receiver
Hello
(pause) Margaret
(pause) Why the hell aren't you here
(he lights a cigarette
) What time
(pause) Is Doreen at the house
(pause) Who's with him then
(pause) When can  see you
Will you be there tomorrow
(pause) Now listen, Margaret
The line goes dead
Carter hangs up
'  -  - key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards and out through the flap
moment later, the door opens
Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in a worker's terraced house
He closes the door and climbs the stairs
'  -  - Carter moves cautiously
His eyes scan the peeling wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters
roof leak hits an unseen bucket with depressing regularity
'  -  - An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a dressing table and chair are about it
Carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below
He eases back the ancient net curtain
Two men in a Land Rover are looking up
They see him and quickly drive off
Carter looks around the room
On top of the wardrobe there's an old shotgun
He reaches up and brings it down
Memories flood back
He reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges
More memories, jack and Frank grew up here
He leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing
'  -   - Pitch black
An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man He is lying in a coffin
His eyes are closed, his skin made-up, like porcelain
Carter stands over the coffin
He gently touches his brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face
He exits, turning out the light and closing the door
Darkness returns
' '   -   - The landlady,  , is climbing the stairs
She's well built, sexy, experienced
Carter follows with his baggage
He watches her appreciatively from behind
won't be using the room tonight
(stops and turns) see
'm staying with a friend
(continuing up the stairs) Her husband docks tomorrow, does he
(smiles) It's not like that, luv
It never is
-  - The door opens and the light goes on
It's a big room overlooking the road, furnished cheaply but comfortably
Edna and Carter enter, talking
Are you a traveller
(smiling) Definitely
(surveying the room) Will this do
(looking around) Very nice
(He takes his wallet out
) 'll pay you for tonight as well
Don't be bloody silly
You're the first since Monday
You sure
Carter gives her the money
Ta
(feeling the mattress) 'll bet this one's seen some action
Carter smiles and looks straight at her
Edna returns his look, dead pan
'll give you the key when you come down
She closes the door
'  -   - Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves
His electric razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother
'  -   - The coffin lid is being screwed down
Carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the undertakers at work
Was he in bad shape
They come worse
- The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses youthful  is minding it
He turns and looks through the back window as a young girl walks up the street
is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, tries to look older
She wears all the right gear but it's cheap and doesn't fit properly
Her long hair is lank
There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance
The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house
'  -   - The door opens slowly
Doreen stands there looking at the coffin
Carter sees her
Doreen
She seems mesmerized by what's going on
All right, are you
Doreen doesn 't answer
Been staying with a friend
Doreen nods
The undertaker coughs and thrusts another screw into the coffin
Sorry about your father
(pause) Yeah
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything
(dazed) They said he was drunk
- The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to the radio
In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover moving slowly tip the road
It stops by the house
Two men suss the scene and drive off
'  -   - How's school
left last year
Oh, what you doing now
Working at Woolworths
That must be interesting
Yes
Carter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly
What you going to do
Live with Margaret
Doreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles in her bag for a cigarette
Carter continues, slightly indignant
Well, why won't you come with us to South America
My fiancee won't mind, (pause) Your dad would have wanted it
The undertaker puts the final screw in
(to colleague) Get Hughbert up, will you
(to Carter) We're ready now, sir
'  - The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow staircase into the street
Outside Carter and Doreen wait with two men
, a middle-aged man, is wearing a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie
is a young barman who worked with Frank
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like
Nice of you to come
No
Frank was a good bloke
He was that
One of the best
- Through the windscreen of the following limousine Carter can see his brother's coffin in the hearse as it moves slowly through the streets of the city
Sitting in front on fold-out seats are Eddie and Keith
couldn't believe it when  heard
Carter is suddenly attentive
What
mean,  was surprised when he didn't turn up for work
He was always on time
Did you work with him, Keith
At the Half Moon
(not to be left out) It's a bloody funny thing
You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus
(pause) then he goes and does a thing like that
(he shakes his head
) It's a bloody funny thing
(quietly) Yeah
bloody funny thing
- As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the Land Rover parked outside
The same two men who passed Frank's house are in it
long and expensive-looking funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway
- Carter, Doreen, Eddie and Keith are in the front pews facing the catafalque on which Frank's coffin rests
The vicar is already midway through the solemn words of the 'committal' when a woman enters
The clunk of her high heels cuts through the silence
Everybody looks round
(whispering to Doreen) Is that Margaret
Doreen nods
Frank's coffin sinks out of sight
- Two men in long grey coats wait in silence
The coffin appears
Expertly, they take it and swing it on to a trolley
They push it up the wide corridor towards the furnace
One of the men starts whistling cheerfully
- is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind of way
Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap pair of sunglasses
She walks quickly away, down the cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns
Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her
Margaret
Margaret stops and looks round
Carter joins her
thought you weren't coming
Changed me mind
They face each other in silence
Margaret looks past Carter and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters
She turns away and starts walking slowly
Carter moves with her
Margaret continues nervously
Everyhing go off all right
Fine
(pause) want to talk to you
What about
Doreen
Margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at Doreen
She's still watching them
(adamantly) She's nothing to do with me
(puzzled) What do you mean
You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off
You're closer to her than anyone
(shaking her head) No
No
It's not like that
've got a husband, you know
Margaret starts walking again, fast
Carter catches hold of her arm and stops her
Hold it
Hold it
(looking her in the eye) Who killed Frank, Margaret
(nervously) Killed
don't know anything about it
She moves off rapidly
Carter catches up with her
Really
must go
'm in a hurry
want to talk to you later
can't
Tomorrow morning, then
Margaret dithers
Well, all right then
Twelve o'clock on the Iron Bridge
Margaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels clicking as she goes
Carter watches her disappear
Doreen watches too
- Frank's coffin is slid inside the furnace
Flames start to lick it as the steel trap closes
- It's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a real boozer
handful of hard drinkers are already in position
Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone
Their table is already covered with glasses
Doreen appears to be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith on beer
Carter is stone-cold sober
Absent friends
(He raises his glass and drinks, then continues thoughtfully
) You don't think he might have done it on purpose
What
You mean, like, kill himself
Eddie and Keith look at each other
Doreen watches them
She is getting very upset by the conversation
Naw
Frank
Kill himself
You what
Carter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable
mean, what for
That's what  was wondering
Come off it
Frank was
well
straight
He had no worries  know
Hell, we worked together every day for a year
It would have showed
Why would it
It just would
He was always the same
Since when did he drink whisky
Don't know
Nobody seems to know
Doreen is now crying openly
(finishing off his drink) Bloody good bloke
One of the best
(blurts out) How would you know
(She suddenly jumps up and empties her glass in Eddie's face
) Or you
Or you
None of you knew
knew
He was me dad
She runs off out of the door crying
Keith goes to follow
Carter puts his hand out to restrain him
Let her go
She'll be
(to Eddie) Sorry about that
(wiping his face with a handkerchief) Don't worry
She's bound to be upset
(to Eddie) Have another
No
'll be off now
should be at work
Eddie stands up, cap in hand
Carter pulls out a wad of money
Look, look
(He peels off a note
) Get your suit cleaned
No
It's all right
(standing, pushes the note in his top pocket) Thanks for coming
Frank was a good bloke
It's the least  could have done
Eddie leaves
You work here, Keith
Yes
Carter thinks for a moment, then leans forward to Keith
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know
Right
Right
'm at the Las Vegas
Behind the dance hall
(He casts an eye around the bar
) Do you know a man called Albert Swift
Yeah
He comes in here a bit
Where would  find him
Today
At the races
He always goes
Carter takes out his phial of pills
How'd you know Albert
Went to school with him
(smiles) He was leader of our gang
He'll know what's going on in this town
- The rain has just stopped
Bookies and punters lower their umbrellas
Horses thunder towards the finishing post
Turf flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars
- Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race card with a biro
hot dog is sticking out of his mouth, like a cigar
man of about thirty-five, be appears much older, probably from an excess of booze and women
He looks up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the ground
He has seen Carter
- Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all the time looking about him
The track loudspeaker announces the winner of the last race
- Albert pales
He holds his race card in front of his face and disappears into the crowd
As he moves off, his foot steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out
- Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters
His eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap, dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks
Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure
Carter approaches from behind
He looks at Eric closely before speaking
Grey suits you, Eric
Eric swings round, startled
Good God
Carter smiles
Is he
Jack Carter
(amused) Eric
Eric Paice
What you doing around here then
Didn't you know this is my home town
No,  didn't know that
Funny, that
Carter takes out his cigarettes
Eric takes one
Thanks
So what're you doing
On your holidays
No
'm visiting relatives
Oh, that's nice
It would be
If they were still living
Meaning what
bereavement
death in the family
Oh, 'm sorry to hear that
That's all right, Eric
Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light
Well, well
Small world, isn't it
Very
(pause) So, who you working for these days Eric
Oh, 'm straight
(indicating uniform) Respectable
(smiling) What are you doing
Advertising Martini
Oh, you've been watching television
Yeah, (pause) Come off it, Eric
Who is it
Eric smiles back
Brumby
Eric shakes his head
Kinnear
Eric shakes his head What's it to you anyway
've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric
Besides which, 'm nosy
That's not always a healthy way to be
And you should know, if  remember rightly
track announcement interrupts them
So you're doing all right then, Eric
You're making good
Making a living
Good prospects for advancement, is there
pension
(He can't resist it any longer
He lifts the sunglasses off Eric's nose and looks into his eyes
) Do you know, 'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like
Eric stares back
They're still the same
Piss holes in the snow
Still got a sense of humour
Yes,  retained that, Eric
(He moves towards the saddling ring and turns to Eric
) Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric
Can't say  do
Carter looks across at the track
Don't miss the start on my account
- Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out
- Carter is driving along a country road
Ahead, two cars are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows
The Cadillac turns on to a minor road
Carter follows
- Eric Paice is driving
In the back sit the three men seen with him at the race track
The drinks compartment is open and they are helping themselves to champagne
Racing results come over the car radio
- Carter follows the Cadillac at a safe distance
It turns into a driveway
Carter slows down and reads a sign by the entrance: The Heights
He drives on and parks
- Carter comes through a wooded area
He pauses by a lake, now overgrown with weeds
big man stands tossing stones into the water
Carter silently picks up a dead branch then runs at the man
Carter whacks him on the head and he collapses unconscious into the lake
Carter moves on towards the house
and  the two men previously seen in the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious lawn fronting the house
It's a Victorian building surrounded by acres of woodland
Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door
One of the men notices and shouts after him
- Carter runs into the house and slips into a small service room
Ray and then Marty charge inside but miss seeing Carter
-   - game of poker is in progress
Seated around the table are the three men with Eric at the race track
With them is an elegant man,
On the sofa are , a sexy-looking young woman, and Eric Paice
Ray bursts in
Carter's here
Eric jumps up
Where
don't know
You stupid shit
Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss
Kinnear watches with some amusement
You see what it's like these days, Jack
You can't get the material
Carter looks at Eric
Yes,  can see your problem, Mr Kinnear
Sit down, Jack, (pause) could weep
really could
Sometimes  think 'll retire
Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them, (to girl) Glenda, get Jack a drink
What is it, Jack
(to Glenda) Scotch, please
(to bouncer) Piss off, Ray
Ray closes the door behind him
Glenda brings Carter his Scotch
He looks at her as she sits beside him
Eric told me of your bereavement
Yep
Do you know,  never knew he worked in one of my places
No
Funny that
Neither did
If 'd known, 'd have fixed him up with something better
Yeah
Nasty way to go
Yes
One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear gets impatient
,    are well-heeled, middle- aged, northern businessmen
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days
Harry
Jack,  don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them
Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses
Give him the bloody bottle
(He picks up his cards
) Now, where are we
Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him
Oh
think 'll stay as  am
(shaken) You're bluffing, you bastard
That's what you pay to find out
Right, Jack
Right
If you can afford it
(to Carter) Thought you were going soon
Soon
When you've lost your money
Won't take long
Clever sod, aren't you
Only comparatively
Harry,  don't like to push, but could you let us know how much your hand's worth
Harry looks at his cards
Glenda tucks her legs up, making sure that Carter gets an eyeful
You know Sid Fletcher
What
You know Sid Fletcher
work for him
Do you
(amused) Yes,  do
Carter looks back at the table
Kinnear pushes in some money
What's that
hundred
That's right, Harry
Your hundred, and another hundred
Kinnear lays more cash on the table
What's that
That, Harry
That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm
Three hundred altogether
Three hundred altogether, Harry
Glenda attracts Carter's attention again
know him too
Who
Sid Fletcher
(sending her up) Oh, do you
(dumb) Yes
No, do you really
Carter turns to the table yet again
Harry nervously puts another hundred on the table
Kinnear purses his lips
'll follow that and go two hundred
Harry looks sick
You can always see me, Harry
Harry sweats and then smiles nervously
All right
Two hundred
(raises an eyebrow) Ha
Kinnear takes a wad of notes out of his pocket
Glenda, shifts herself on the sofa
Yes
met him last year
Go on
Oh yes
When he came up on business
Really
He came to see Mr Kinnear
No
Carter, getting bored, looks back at the game
(panicking) What's that
That's six hundred pounds, Harry
Two hundred to follow you, and 've raised it four hundred
Harry sweats some more
Four hundred
That's right
You're not seeing me
No
Harry smiles nervously
He counts some money out
'll see you, then
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry
Harry nods
Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the table
Kinnear lays out his hand  a hearts flush, queen high
We went about together
Really
Yes, while he was here
While he was here
You went about together
He was here for four days
Was he
Could you do me a favour
Yeah, 'll do you a favour
Could you please put my glass on the table
Carter smiles and does just that
Oh, come on, Harry
haven't won, have
Go on, you're pulling my leg
Kinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards
Harry grabs them and puts them in the pack
Kinnear turns to Carter
How about that, Jack
Old Harry thought  was having him on
Shut up
Carter gets up from the sofa
Not going, Jack
have to
Things to see to
Of course, of course
Well, any time, just drop by
Yeah, 'll do that
(He points at Harry
) Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't
Eric opens the door and follows him out
-  - Carter moves towards the front door
Jack
didn't like that
You should have told me who you were working for
Cyril didn't like it, either
Oh, Cyril, eh
So it's all girls together, is it
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in
Carter carries on walking to the front door
He opens it
He's right
Tell him to save the cost of the phone call
Carter leaves
Eric signals Ray to follow him
- Huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it like it was a toy
The yard is beside the River Tyne
In the distance a train crosses the Iron Bridge
Carter is examining a beaten-up Hillman when the yard owner, , approaches
(suspicious) What do you want
What happened to this car
What's it got to do with you
This is my brother's car
Oh ay
Yeah
Well, he drove it into the river
Was the steering faulty
Billy shakes his head
What about the brakes
Fine
Nowt wrong with them
How'd it happen, then
He was drunk
Drunk as a lord
Was he
- big, busty pub singer is performing on the small stage
trio on her right plays a good, grinding, up-tempo number
Carter comes through the door
He pushes his way through the packed drunken crowd to the bar
Keith serves him
What you having, Jack
Large Scotch
Carter watches the singer
The customers cheer and whistle
Keith returns with the Scotch
He looks nervously around and speaks to Carter quietly
Heard of a man called Thorpe
Old Thorpey
Haven't seen him in a long time
(picking up Carter's money) That's what he was saying about you
Keith takes the money to the till
The music grinds away
Keith returns
Said he'd heard you were up in town
Wondered if  knew where you was staying
Wanted to look you up
Old time's sake
That's nice
What'd you tell him
Nowt
Good lad
Carter watches the singer, then finishes his drink
See you later
Where you off to
(smiling) Las Vegas
Carter makes for the door
The singer is now moving through the tables
She pauses to give some man a kiss
Everybody cheers
The woman sitting with the man snaps
She picks up his glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs her hair and pulls her to the ground
Carter stops to watch
The two women roll on the floor, punching and scratching
Carter smiles and leaves
- On the corner is a neon-lit snack bar
Doreen and another young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes
Somewhere a drunk is singing
His voice echoes up the alley
Carter draws alongside and notices Doreen
He stops and watches her
She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window and knocks on it
She looks up and he beckons her outside
Reluctantly, she comes
(gently) You all right now
Yeah
You coming to South America
No
Carter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection
Where you going to live, then
At me friend's house
Where's that
Wilton Estate
Nice family, are they
Church-goers and all that
Doreen nods
Good
'm off tomorrow, so  don't suppose 'll see you again
(He pulls out a wad of money, and peels off some notes
) There
Go and get your hair done
(Can't believe it) Thanks
He lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her
Be good
And don't trust boys
Doreen blushes and turns away
She rushes back to the snack bar with the money to show her friend
- /  - The front door opens and Carter enters
Standing on the hall table is a small wooden casket with an envelope taped to it
Carter pockets the envelope and picks up the casket
(
) That was left for you this evening
Carter walks past her into the sitting room
What is it
My brother, Frank
Is he staying the night
Funny
(He puts the casket on a side table
) Can  phone London
It'll cost you
'  -  - Anna is undressing
She's alone
Pulling the short black- silk underslip over her head, she stands in front of a long mirror, clad only in black panties, bra and tights
She looks at herself appreciatively
The phone rings
She flops on the bed and picks up the receiver
Hello
voice speaks on the end of the line
How  miss you
(She stretches herself out sexily and smiles
) Stop it, darling
-   - It's a cosy room
Carter is on the telephone
sits in a rocking chair
(looking at Edna) fancy you
wish  was touching you right now
Edna turns towards him
Carter fixes her with his eyes
Edna rocks herself gently
Carter continues softly
making love to you
want to stroke you and kiss you all over
Where are you
'  -  - Anna is lying full-length on the bed
In the bedroom
Carter speaks on the other end
My black underwear
-   - Edna rocks backwards and forwards
(quietly) The sexy, silk ones
Anna replies
He continues softly
Take your bra off
(pause) No, go on
'  -  - Anna unhooks her bra
There's a flash of breasts
-   - The scene as before
Now hold them
Gently
'  -  - Anna's hands cover her breasts
Her head moves slowly from side to side, eyes closed
-   - Scene as before
Slowly
Imagine it's me
'  -  - Anna's hand caresses the inside of her leg
Her head rolls from side to side slowly
She's breathing heavily
- between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards and Anna's head moving from side to side
(
) When we're in South America, we'll make love in the sun
Roll over
and make love again
and again
For me
fancy you
'  -  - Suddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in
He sees Anna groaning on the bed
What's the matter
You got gut trouble or something
Anna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver
No, darling
Just doing some exercises, (into telephone) Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got in, so  must ring off
(pause) Yes
Yes
'll come tomorrow
-   - Scene as before
Save it till Sunday
'll be back then
Carter replaces the receiver
He still holds Edna's eyes
She rocks to and fro
The rocker creaks
The front door bell breaks the mood
That'll be for me
-  - Carter opens the door
Keith is outside
He's sweating
His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his suit is covered with dirt
Thorpey
They were waiting for us in the car park
How many
Four of them
Carter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light
Ford Zodiac comes along the road
It stops
Four faces peer into the darkness where they're standing
Nobody gets out
The back window winds down
Thorpe's nervous voice floats out
Jack
Good evening
'd like a word with you, Jack
That's nice
Confidential, like
You stay in the car
'll come and listen
( (He leaves the darkness and walks to the car
) What you want to tell me, Thorpey
Thorpe holds out his hand
've been asked to give you this
He hands Carter a railway ticket
Carter smiles
Train goes at four minutes past twelve
You've just got time
That's very kind of somebody
Who do  have to thank
(pause) What happens if  miss the train
've been asked to make sure you don't
Oh, really
You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey
One of the men inside mutters
Let's stop pissing about
Are you coming, Jack
It'd be best
Carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter
Right lads
The front passenger door starts to open
Carter grabs it and pulls it wide open
With all his force, he slams it against the man as he gets out
The window shatters over his head
Blood spurts everywhere
The driver panics
He accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out
His foot is trapped in a safety belt
He's upended and dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to the back wheel
His yells make the driver brake
In the confusion Thorpe escapes from the car and makes off
Carter spots him and begins to run
(roars) Thorpe
Thorpe turns into the main road
He makes for the dance hall and disappears inside
Carter follows
- The dance floor is full, mainly with miniskirted girls, their handbags at their feet
rock band play mechanical music to match the dancing
Thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor
Carter arrives
He scans the place, then sees Thorpe as he disappears down into the gents' lavatory
- '  - Carter enters
There's no sign of Thorpe
He checks the cubicles until he finds the one that's occupied, then goes into the next one
He climbs on the seat and looks over the partition
Thorpe is sitting down looking at the door
Carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain
Thorpe jumps up, terrified
Time's up, Thorpey
Carter smiles
- Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits
Edna's next-door neighbour, an  , watches
Carter and Thorpe come down the street
Hello, Keith, (pause) Stay there, Thorpey
He knocks on Edna's door
It flies open
Edna is furious
What the bloody hell do you think you're at
(smiles) 'm sorry
You don't look it
No
Really,  am
Don't come that bloody flannel with me
If you're a traveller, 'm bloody Twiggy
(She points at Thorpe
) And who's he
What's going on
Have you no thought for others
We're going inside
Inside
Why should  give house- room to your sort
Up the stairs, Keith
The door on the right
Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot
Everybody knew there'd be trouble when you moved in
Carter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house
You keep your trap shut, Ma
'll send my old man to see you
And wouldn't he love it
-  - Carter, Thorpe and Keith are climbing the stairs
Carter stops to pick up Frank's casket
Edna rushes in and slams the door
Where do you think you're going
Carter opens the door to his room
Why don't you go and make us all a nice cup of tea
Carter shoves Thorpe into the room
Keith follows
And what you going to do
Make us a nice cup of tea and 'll tell you
might even let you watch
'll call the police
(He knows she fancies him) No, you won't
Carter closes the door
-  - Carter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers
Well now, Thorpey
It seems 've got a secret benefactor
(He moves into the room and opens his briefcase, which is lying on the bed
) It's nice to know that
Isn't it, Keith
(He takes out a bottle of whisky
) There's only one trouble,  don't know who to thank
Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch
Suddenly Carter punches him hard in the stomach
He grunts and collapses into a chair
Now,  want to know who it is, Thorpey
Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues wearily
All right
If you like, Thorpey, we'll stop mucking about
Somebody doesn't want me poking my nose into something and  happen to know what that something is
(pause) Now stand up
Thorpe looks at him, terrified
Slowly he stands
Carter grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure
Thorpe screams
Who paid you to see me off
can't Jack
How can
Yes you can
Carter applies more pressure
Thorpe screams
No, don't Jack, don't
Who sent you, Thorpey
(desperate) Brumby
Carter gives him a final squeeze and lets go
Thorpe groans and slips to the floor, doubled up in agony
There you are, you see
Now you could, couldn't you
(pause) And quickly
There's a knock on the door
Carter lets in Edna, who is carrying the teatray
Ah, Edna, come in
Join the tea set
Who's Brumby
Cliff Brumby
Ever been to Westsea
Keith nods
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine
Yeah
Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well
Right along the coast
Isn't that right, Thorpey
Thorpe drags himself painfully to a chair
Where's he living these days
He's got a new place at Burnham
Address
On the Durham Road
The Pantiles
(furious) Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on
It's my house, you know
Yes, Edna, and  must say you've been great about the
Stick the soft soap
Let's be having it
Thorpe's plaintive voice interrupts
Can  go now
You must be joking, (to Keith) Keep him away from the telephone
'm going out for a bit
Now just a minute
Ta-ra
Don't let on  told you, for God's sake
Carter laughs and closes the door
- It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the road
The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot
Fairy lights hang over everything
There's a party going on
Lights are on in every room and the rock music is loud
The drive is lined with sports cars
Carter parks and gets out
Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond
There, he promptly throws up
Carter watches from behind a tree
His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the drive
It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out
has been to a police ball
He is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf
Now he's hopping mad
Jesus wept
cowers in the passenger seat
Now, Cliff, don't get mad
'll murder the little bitch
Cliff
Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a latecomer, is stunned to see who it is
Daddy
That's right, bloody Daddy
wasn't expecting you until three o'clock
And this is what you call having a few friends back for coffee, is it
Brumby pushes past her into the house
Running bloody riot over my bloody furniture, drinking my bloody booze
The rest is lost as he disappears inside
He then powers out through the side door spewing over my fucking goldfish
He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him face-down into the lily pond
Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment
As she approaches the house, people pour out
Brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers
Cliff
Brumby throws the boy out
Shut up, Phyllis
(He walks back into the house
) Sandra
Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door
Brumby passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a bedroom
Sandra
Unlock the door, you bitch
Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the row going on upstairs
He opens the door and goes in
- Carter passes silently through the hall into the large sitting room
Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair
Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs
Good evening
Mrs Brumby jumps
The front door is open
(standing) Who are you
'm an old friend of Cliff's want to see him
Mrs Brumby looks at her watch irritably
It's urgent
What's it about
Business
know all about Cliff's business
Carter moves further into the room
Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers sent me
Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do
Carter sits in an armchair to make his point
She leaves
moment later Brumby storms into the room
What the bloody hell's all this
Carter doesn't move
You know what the bloody time is
(pause) It's two o'clock in the bloody morning
know
Well
Carter still doesn 't move
The wife says the Fletchers sent you
Carter just looks at him
Weighing him up
What's so bloody important it couldn't wait till the morning
Carter starts to laugh
He realizes Thorpe has lied to him
Brumby isn't his man
Listen, 'm not in the mood for bloody silly buggers
Carter stands
made a mistake
What
made a mistake
What about
Never mind
Brumby looks confused
It's not business
Carter moves to the door
See you
Brumby moves between him and the door
Listen,  don't like it when some hard nut comes pushing his way in and out my house in the middle of the night
Carter again makes to leave
Brumby stops him
Bloody well tell me who sent you
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape
With me, it's a full- time job
Now behave yourself
Brumby swings at him
Carter moves away from the punch, then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck
Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt
Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door
Good night, Mrs Brumby
' '   - Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place
He finds the front door unlocked
-  - Carter enters cautiously
There is no sound
He closes the door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs
Still there is no sound
He waits
sudden rustle attracts his attention
Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door
-   - Carter switches on the light
Edna is pressed against the far wall, holding a poker
Her dress is torn and her hair dishevelled
When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief
You sod
They came back
(sarcastically) No
Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap
Edna looks at her torn dress
Look at this
You bastard
Carter puts the glass on the table
You don't care a stuff, do you
Carter takes out his phial of pills
'll buy you another
Carter swallows a pill
What about the lad
They took him away
Carter shrugs his shoulders
What'll they do to him
Don't ask me
Edna rubs her wrists
They bloody hurt me
You're lucky
They kill as well
(mocking him) And what about you
Did you kill Brumby
Carter shakes his head
Thorpey nearly died laughing
That little shit
What about Keith
What about Keith
What you going to do
Pension him off
You're a bastard
(angry) What am  supposed to do
don't know where they've taken him
Do you
Edna shakes her head
So shut up
What's that gun doing in your room
Suppose  phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody
You wouldn't
How'd you know  wouldn't
(smiling) 'Cos  know you wear purple underwear
What's that supposed to mean
Think about it
Carter takes hold of her torn blouse and rips it open
She is wearing purple underwear
- It's Sunday morning
girls' marching band rehearses on the wasteground in front of the terraced houses
The Pelaw Hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner, led by the drum majorette
- Above the bed hangs a sign 'What would Jesus say
' In the bed lie Carter and Edna
The distant sound of the marching band helps them surface
Are you awake
No
Do you want breakfast
You must be joking
never eat breakfast, (pause) Did you sleep well
Uh-huh
- The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching
The back of their banner a stirring motto For Youth and Valour
- Scene as before
Did you sleep well
Yes, thank you
He puts his arm around her and moves on top
- As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides to a halt outside Edna's house
Two men get out
the Dutchman and   are definitely not local lads
They look, and are, lethal
They try Edna's front door
It opens
- Scene as before
Are you tired
No
Are you tired
No
'm not tired, (pause) Do you eat breakfast
Edna laughs
They start to make love
Gently
Below the undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside it, Carter's shotgun
Beyond is the bedroom door
It opens slowly and the two men enter
Only their legs are visible
(
) Put us in it, Jack
Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash
Edna screams and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to the floor
Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling
Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide- bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf
His hair is bleached blond
Con is more traditional, more butch
He's in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie
Both are in their thirties
Don't let us interrupt you, Jack
might have guessed
Sorry about this
But there you are
Orders are orders
And what orders would they be, Con
Carter's hand runs over the carpet
It's going towards the chamber pot instead of the gun
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself
We've got to take you back to London
He said it'd be doing him a big favour
Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on towards the gun
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid
But they have to be diplomatic
Carter pulls out the gun and jumps up
Right
Now take me back to London
(smiling) It'd be best if you got dressed first
Carter moves around the bed towards them
He's naked
Put it away, Jack
You know you won't use it
The gun he means
Both men are laughing
Out
Peter and Con back down the stairs
Peter looks up at Carter's cock
If Anna could see you now
Out
Now, Jack
Be reasonable
You know we're going to take you back - sooner or later
Out
- Con is the first to emerge from the front door
Mind you don't catch cold
Peter follows
hope she's got understanding neighbours
Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest
See you when you've got your drawers on
The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out for her milk
As she straightens up, she sees Carter
The bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep
Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly backs into the house
-  - Carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket
The gun lies across the armchair
Outside, he can see Peter and Con talking by the Jaguar
Con exits
Edna, now in her dressing gown, enters
Do us a favour
What, and get myself beaten up again
No chance of that
Not much
They're friends of mine
And that'll make me feel better
don't want to get rough, do
Carter picks up the gun
He hands Edna, bis case and the casket
- Edna comes out of the back gate into an alley, carrying the casket and case
Con emerges from his hiding place holding a handgun
Hold it
Where do you think you're going
Carter appears from the gate next door, covering Con with the shotgun
Strawberry Fair
He takes Con's handgun and signals him to go into Edna's yard
In
Turn right
(He points the gun at the coalshed
) Open that door
Con unbolts the door
And go inside
Con goes in
Carter closes and bolts the door
He moves quickly back to Edna and the car
What you going to do
'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'
Carter jumps into the car
You coming back
How could  stay away
The car roars off
- Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see
Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and sheets on the windscreen
'  - The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering
It finally gives and Con bursts out
He runs into the alley, following after Carter
- Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to the road
Peter is leaning against the open door of the Jaguar
When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he scarpers for the pavement
Carter hits the Jaguar's door at speed, tearing it off
It flies up and crashes on to the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground
Soon he is out of sight
Con comes running
Peter is looking at the damage
Where were you, then
Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased
Bollocks
- Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out
He takes the washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected garden
- Carter presses the bell
The door's opened by a young man, Keith in
(shouts) Keith
No answer
Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall
(
) Which is his room
'  - Carter enters and closes the door
Keith is in a had way, his face like a piece of raw steak
He is lying on a bed, still in the clothes of the night before
What happened to you, then
How'd you find me
Keith lifts his head painfully from the pillow
Did they give you a rough time
No
(He lowers his head to the pillow
) You bastard
You knew they'd come back
No,  didn't, (pause) Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry
Get knotted
All right
All right
want to square things with you first
Oh yes
How
Carter takes out of his wad of money
Keith's bloodshot eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh
Stuff it
My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight
Nice surprise, isn't it
'm sorry
Here
This'll pay for a course in karate
He throws some money on the bed
Keith tries to kick it off, but it's too painful
He clutches his testicles
Frank said you were a shit and he was bloody well right
Carter turns to leave
Keith continues, crying and angry
You even screwed his wife, didn't you
Carter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him
The poor bastard didn't even know if the kid was his
He falls back on to the bed, crying out in pain
- wide road runs alongside the Tyne
It passes below the vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'
Carter pulls up and parks
He gets out and moves quickly
- The bridge is a, massive structure
The traffic lanes are flanked each side by pedestrian walkways
It is here that Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet
How were things between you and Frank
He was all right to me
Nothing more
Just another feller
Nicer than most
But he was just another feller, wasn't he
Yes
Though nicer than most
Yes
can't help the way  am
(ignoring the statement) Why'd you see him so regular
Once a week
call that regular
He was gentlemanly
like that
Once a week you like a gentleman
(angrily) Look, 'm me, right
You're not
We are what we are, like it or not
(She turns and walks slowly along the bridge
) Why all the bloody needle
What was bugging Frank
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him
Last Friday  told him it wouldn't work
Dave would have killed us both
(pause) He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, (pause) had to tell Frank  couldn't see him any more
It was getting too dodgy
That was on Sunday
(She stops and looks over the bridge
) He said he'd kill himself
was frightened what you might do
They look at each other for a moment
Carter shakes his head
He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face and folds them up
don't believe you, Margaret
Frank wasn't like that
(pause) 'm the villain in the family, remember
It's the truth
Carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away
It is
Honestly
(shouting) You bloody whore
Frank was too careful to die like that
Who killed him
don't know nothing
Carter holds her arm
She winces like she's been hit before
Listen, the only reason  came back to this craphole was to find out who did it
And  won't leave until  do
You understand
Behind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge
It stops
The passenger side is a gaping hole
Hello, Jack
Carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back to Margaret
You bitch
It was you who told them  was here, wasn't it
He smacks her hard across the face
Margaret cries out
The car draws alongside
steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge
Con leans out, his usual cheery self
Peter's very upset about his car
He's going to shit all over you
'll catch up with you later, Margaret
And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated roof
Con jumps out of the Jaguar
(shouts above the revs) Come on, get in
Con does and they race off
- Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown steps leading down to the river road, where his car is parked
He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to a halt at the top
Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives chase
Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off
- Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind
He arrives at the river road
In the distance, he can see his parked car
As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the hill
It's going to cut Carter off from his car
Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there
Its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park
It reaches him just before the Jaguar and slows down
Over here, Jack
Carter sees that the driver is
The hood is down, so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off
The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming Jaguar, and roars away
Peter hasn't a chance
He's facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre
Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill
- Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual gear changes, steering, even braking
Carter can't take his eyes off her
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you
No
didn't know that
fairy godmother, all of your own
Aren't you lucky
So where are we going, Princess
To the demon king's castle, of course
Of course
Where else
The car screams off the road into a multi-storey carpark
-   - Glenda really puts her foot down
The car hurtles around each deserted floor
How'd you know where 'd be
You were seen parking your car
The demon king waves his wand and was dispatched to bring you to him
Lucky for you  waited
Very lucky,  should think
You're drunk
Nasty
He must have been pretty sure 'd come
Oh, he was
He told me a magic spell that would make you come
(smiling) And what was that
We're there now
She brakes to a split-second stop
- It's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows all the way round
Wires are hanging from the ceiling and walls where the lights will eventually be fixed
tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting sun
He is just a silhouette
Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man
The silhouette turns as he nears it
It's Brumby
new venture of mine
It's going to be a restaurant
(pause) Do you like it
Yes
Last night, after you'd gone, did a little bit of asking around
Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, (pause) It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother
(pause)  got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke  wanted off my back, (pause) You know my life
Machines
The arcades
Nice business
Looks after itself
People put money in take it out
Not much rough stuff
It's a business that makes me very happy
But recently, 've had a spot of bother, (pause) One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some
The upshot is 've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs
(pause) So far as 'm concerned, that's it
Apparently not
These people 've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, (pause) So 'm worried
can't fight them haven't that kind of set-up
But 've got to fix them before they fix me
Trouble is, if  try and they find out, 'm dead
Brumby picks up a black briefcase
He holds it up to Carter
Five grand
It belongs to you
Along with a little name 'm going to give you
What name
Kinnear
Cyril Kinnear
(pause) Kinnear did it
Why
don't know
All  know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday
Your brother's name was mentioned
Next day, he was dead
Why
don't know
That's all  was told
Carter takes a last look at Glenda and walks slowly back towards the entrance
That's not good enough
Christ, what
(shouting) Do me a favour
You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so
(pause) Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick
Stroll on
Jack, you're wrong
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby
Carter exits
Jack
-   - Carter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes down the bottom ramp fast
The car brakes hard and stops
Carter opens the door and gets in
Not a word is said
'  - The apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda has only recently moved in
There is a mattress on the floor
large mirror leans against the wall behind it and a film projector stands close to the window, which has makeshift curtains
Carter and Glenda are on the mattress
The bedding is all over the place
They have just finished fucking
(looking around) Who's setting you up in this place
Brumby
Is he coming here
Don't worry
He's meeting the architects at the restaurant
Carter plays with her hair
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out
He won't
He thinks 'm simple
Carter kisses her neck
What does he want that bloody great country place for
(knowingly) Entertaining
What kind of entertaining
Now you're asking
Carter looks at the film projector by the bed and points
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap
(giggling) Especially when  play the lead
Carter wraps his arms about her
Did Kinnear say anything
After 'd left the other night
Glenda sits up sharply
That's why you waited for me
(kissing her on the neck) Not entirely
No
You sure about that
Sure 'm sure
Glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed
You bastard
Glenda leaves for the bathroom
Carter, curious, looks at the film projector
It's loaded
He switches it on
beam of light hits the opposite wall
He settles down to watch the film
The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'
zoom back reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk
This is followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school uniform, waiting at a bus stop
car approaches and stops
woman driver offers the girl a lift
The woman is Margaret
The identity of the girl not revealed
'  - Glenda is in the bath
Lots of foam
The hot water is still running
She's smoking
She leans forward, turning off the tap
'  - Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him
The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off
The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes in with the girl
Her school hat still hides her identity
Glenda is there to greet them
The girl is very awkward
Glenda tries to make her relax, sitting her down and showing her a magazine
Glenda brings her into a bedroom
She takes her own top off and goes to do the same with the girl
She takes her hat off
close-up shows that it is Doreen
Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in the film
Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock at what she sees
She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, eventually rolling off the bed
The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar comes in
Carter sits up
It's Albert Swift
Albert opens another door, looking for someone
He leaves
Another door opens and he's in the bedroom
He sees the two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his prize Doreen
Carter watches
Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified
Reflected in the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off his trousers
The reel runs out and flaps like a fish
Carter doesn't move
Tears form in his eyes
He looks old and defeated
His is a wasted life
Then the anger that drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes
'  - Carter, now dressed, moves slowly towards her in the bath
want to give you an Oscar
(laughs) You've been watching the film
Tell me about the girl
What girl
The young girl
Who pulled her
don't know
Was it Albert
Shouldn't think so
Is it one of Kinnear's films
Yeah
Who set it up
Eric
Yeah
Then he must have pulled her
Expect so
Did my brother Frank find out
Your brother
What you talking about
Carter's fury bursts
He's out of control
He seizes Glenda and plunges her under the bathwater, holding her there
You're a lying bitch
Carter lifts her up, out of the water
She is spluttering, nearly drowned
Now tell me the truth
The girl's name was Doreen
That's all  know
And you didn't know her last name
No
Well, it's Carter
That's my name, (pause) And her father was my brother
And he was murdered last Sunday
Now get up and get dressed
He pushes her ahead of him
'   - Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam
He opens the boot
Get in
Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut
The car scorches away
- Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks
He moves down the gangway towards it
- girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea
The door slams open
There's Carter
Where's Albert
The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer
Carter grabs her by the throat
Where's Albert
The girl is frozen with terror
He lets go as suddenly as he grabbed her
know where 'll find him
- Carter walks fast
There's the sound of a phone being dialled
It's the  in the cafe
(
) Eric, he's come for Albert, (pause) don't know, (pause) On the ferry, reckon
Carter reaches the front of a betting shop
He walks in
- Carter closes the door
Race results and odds are coming over the Tannoy
He moves into the shop until he reaches Albert is making out a betting slip and doesn't see him
Hello, Albert
Albert looks like he's going to be sick
Hello, Jack, (snivelling) don't know anything, Jack
Yes, you do, Albert
Talk or 'll kill you
know
know
Carter sees a door at the back
There's a sign for the toilets
Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert
At first Albert doesn't understand
Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert
This time it clicks
Albert moves to the door and Carter follows
- Carter turns to close the door
Albert runs for it
He reaches the high double-gate at the end
It's locked and he tries to climb it
No luck
Carter easily pulls him down
Albert faces him
You can't get away from me, Albert
know
He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them
For Christ's sake, give us a fag
Carter takes out his cigarettes
Albert takes one
didn't know who Doreen was
Thought she was just another bird
Did Eric Pake pull her
Yes
How
dunno
He's got his ways
He knows Margaret
When did you find out
couple of weeks back
How
No choice
had a visit from somebody
Who
Cliff Brumby
He'd seen the film
He wanted to meet Doreen
And you told Brumby
Albert nods
Who killed Frank
Albert doesn 't answer
Do you want to be dead, Albert
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled
Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off
They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat
(pause) thought they'd just duff him up a bit
Honest
What did you do
Albert
Nothing
What could  do
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother
Yes
told him
What did he say
'Good
' Albert draws deeply on his cigarette
They drove Frank away in a car
Is that all there is
Albert nods
Then that's it, Albert
Carter takes something from his pocket
There's a loud click
It's a
knife
Jack, for Christ's sake
He falls to his knees
You knew what 'd do
(crying) Yes, but listen
Christ,  didn't kill him
Carter drives the knife into him with all his might
know you didn't kill him
(and again
) know you didn't
ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour
Albert leans back
Blood seeps from his chest
He pitches forward, twitches, and is dead
- Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to the street
blind man is at the counter placing a bet
-   - The Sunbeam waits in the car park
Eric, Con and Peter arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it
They go down the gangplank to the floating jetty
ferry is chugging across the water
- Carter sits, watching the other passengers
mother and two young children take his attention
His look is tinted with regret even remorse
- As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up to the rail
The passengers disembark, leaving Carter standing alone
He's holding Con's handgun
Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters
Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter from under his coat, cocks it and fires
Too late
Carter is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure
Eric shouts
No shooters
Cyril said no shooters, you stupid bastard
Get stuffed
He's reloading
Gerald wants to see him first
Shut up
Carter is listening to all this
(shouting) Are you coming in
Or do we piss about all day
Eric laughs
You're finished, Jack
You know that, don't you
've bloody finished you
Not till 'm dead, Eric
Eric laughs
Oh, you've still got your sense of humour
Tell him how 've fixed him, Con
He's told Gerald about you and Anna
Didn't believe us at first, did he, Con
Then Peter talked to him
Didn't even say goodbye
Just asked us to take you back - alive
He's probably talking to her right now
Are you still going to fancy her when Gerald's finished with her face
Carter shows no emotion
Or are his eyes just that bit sadder
Peter lets rip again
Another window is shattered
Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry
Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the ferry's superstructure to the roof
By the time he heaves himself into position, Carter is waiting
Stay where you are, Peter
Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even raise his shooter
(screaming) Don't
There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he cold-bloodedly shoots
Peter is blown away
By the time he hits the deck, he's dead
Con and Eric panic
They run up the gangplank, safely out of range
Carter, your car needs a wash
Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the Sunbeam into the water
Two hits and the task is done
Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around the sinking car
Carter watches impassively
'   - Carter's hire car corners at speed into the high-rise carpark
- Brumby and two architects in a site meeting
Plans are laid out on a table
don't want them cooking in here
You can put a hatch in that wall
Yes, it's all a question of
The sound of a car screeching up the ramps interrupts him
Who in Christ's name is that
It's a bloody madman
He strides away to investigate
- Brumby comes out to the top tier
On the floor below, Carter, unseen by Brumby, has parked and is now making for the concrete spiral staircase
- Brumby pounds down to the first level
Carter comes around the corner
Jack
Carter slams his fist hard into his gut
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank
had to
It was the only way could get at them
-
It's a combined shop and post office
Carter is on the phone
The guy on the swing-bridge
(pause) Carter hangs up
He takes a can of film from his pocket and slips it into a large envelope
At the counter two women are talking
They don't know how it happened
How far did he fall
What did Betty say
Ninety floors, think it was
Really
Was he dead
Oh, yes
The envelope is passed across to the post office assistant
It is addressed to Vice Squad, Scotland Yard, London Sw1
Better to go quick like that
- - The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made island in the middle of the river
On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from which a man operates the bridge
Carter climbs the outside ladder
man waits for him at the top
The man hands him a small cloth package
Carter opens it
Inside is heroin and a hypodermic
He wraps it up again and hands over an envelope
The man checks the money as Carter disappears down the outside ladder
- The hall is crowded
The compere calls the numbers
The atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards
Someone calls, 'Bingo
'  buzz goes round the hall as everybody starts talking again
Carter enters, surveying the audience
Eventually, his eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret
She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him
The next game starts up
- Crowds of people come pouring out
It's the end of the evening's entertainment
Margaret walks out with her friend
Carter follows them and turns up a side street
- The place is deserted
Margaret and her friend descend the steps
The clop of their high heels is the only sound
Carter follows discreetly
At the bottom, Margaret and her friend chat for a moment and part
Carter follows Margaret
- The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance
She appears
Carter is following behind
He slips into another dark alley to get ahead of her
As she reaches her home Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar
It's holding Con's handgun
've come for you, Margaret
-   - There's a big party going on
The music is loud
It's mainly rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds
Different things are obviously going on in different rooms in the house
Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, etc
Kinnear flits from one to another
Eric Paice is on the phone
He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear
Gerald Fletcher wants a word with you Cyril
Kinnear crosses to the telephone
Hello, Gerald
- Carter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with Margaret
The hire car is parked alongside
It's Carter
Listen carefully, you hairy-faced git
've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time
All it takes is one call to the police
-   - Kinnear listens
Really
(pause) So
- Carter into phone
'll do a simple deal with you
All  want is
-   - Kinnear is still listening to Carter
He looks over at Eric, who's fixing a drink
see
think that can be arranged
Kinnear continues listening
- Carter into phone
but  don't want him there until six in the morning
(pause) Right
Carter hangs up
He pushes Margaret towards the car
-  - The noise of the wild party is heard off
Eric comes into the room
You want something, Cyril
Yes, Eric
word with you
- Headlights, through the thick trees, as Carter's car comes bouncing over rough ground
- Carter stops in a clearing and leaves his headlights on
He turns to Margaret
Get out
Carter and Margaret get out
They appear in the beam of the headlights and move further into the wood
- Carter and Margaret stop
Take your clothes off
Margaret is confused
Take your clothes off
Margaret does just that: coat, blouse, skin
She goes to remove her knickers
Keep your pants on
(pause) Lie down
Again she obeys
He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then stuffs a gag in her mouth
He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm, and injects the heroin into her
She struggles, her eyes moving frantically about
She screams, but its muffled by the gag
Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under
Carter removes the gag
He stands, picks her up and walks into the darkness with Margaret in his arms
-  - Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly
The party is still going on
want you to listen very carefully
Jack Carter, (pause) You know what he looks like
- bedside light is on
man in bed is listening on the phone
Yes
He taps his cigarette against the ashtray
On his middle finger is a large ring with the initial '' on it
He listens until the line goes dead
The woman beside him stirs
He stubs out the cigarette and switches off the light
Darkness
- Eric comes out of the front door
Inside the party is still in progress
He gets into a Cadillac and drives off
- Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's house
The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road
There's the sound of a phone being dialled
(
) Police
- long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, followed by a police bus
They park by the front door and around fifty policemen pour out
They move silently around the building
chief constable opens the front door and walks in
- The police move through the house and grounds
In the bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together
The men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about being identified
The police find evidence of drugs, pornography and so on
Outside, police are combing the grounds
In the long grass leading down to the lake they find women's clothes
They follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, face downwards, in the lake
policeman with waders goes in and pulls her to the side
As others heave her out, we see that it's Margaret
- The house is surrounded by police measuring and photographing, and outside the house are police cars and ambulances
The lawn is crowded with the party crowd
In the early-morning light, they look like dolls
Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes officers and gets in a police car
Sirens going, it comes down the short drive to the gate
- Carter is driving along a coast road
The sea and a wide beach lie on his right
Long rows of houses are to his left
The sun is still low
It's very quiet
He arrives at a harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast wooden jetty running out into the estuary
It's a coal loader for tankers
This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways
On its top tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal chutes
- Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle of Scotch off the back seat
He get out and walks over to the jetty and along a lower gangway
At the far end, a man is standing
It's Eric Paice
Eric turns around abruptly
He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway
Carter follows
At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only the harbour waters lapping below
Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see Eric scamper down to the level below
Eric sprints for the roadway
Carter waits and then starts running directly above him
Eric keeps running
Carter stays always overhead
He's playing cat and mouse with Eric
(calling out) You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric
(wheezing) Sod off
Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and makes for the roadway
Carter stops above the roadway
Below, Paice makes for the parked car
Carter holds the gun up
Eric stops and looks up
Stay away from the car or 'll blow you apart
Eric darts under the jetty
Carter runs on down the steps
He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards the beach
Carter starts after him
- Eric runs out on to the beach
The only sounds are his feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting
In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke
Carter appears
For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at the far end of the beach
He climbs down to the beach and starts running
- Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly
Eric looks round and panics
He stumbles and falls over
He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the headland
Carter follows
- On the other side of the headland, the scene is extraordinary
The deserted beach is like the edge of the world
The sand is black as far as the eye can see
It's littered with rubbish
Several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand
High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the left
It's deserted
In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again
The coal mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs
The sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore
Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud
Carter closes on him
- Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine
Carter has nearly caught up
The buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable
Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels
He is panting horribly
Carter is close on his heels
Near the top, where the buckets are practically at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls
He is too exhausted to get up
Carter stands over him
(panting slightly) Stand up, Eric
Stand up
Eric just manages it
Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch out of his pocket
bet you could use a drink, could you, Eric
He throws the bottle to Eric
Eh
Have a drink
Still got your sense of humour
Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter
He's in a terrible state
Drink up, Eric
Drink up
want you to drink all of that
Do you understand
Drink up
Just like it was with my brother, Frank
Go on, son
Drink up
Eric pours the whisky into his month
It spills over and runs down his face
Drink up, Eric
Eric begins to stagger about
It was you who poured it down him
Eh, Eric
Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter
No mercy there
Did you all have a good laugh, eh
Did you have a good laugh when he was spewing it up
The whisky is pouring all over Eric's face and suit
It's disgusting to watch
Suddenly, he retches, but nothing comes up
Drink it
Drink it
Did you all pass the bottle round after the car went over the top
Eric is choking
Don't stop, Eric
Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle up to Eric's mouth again
In the other, he holds the shotgun
Eric chokes and retches
Carter has seen enough
Goodbye, Eric
Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on Eric's head
- Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on it's final journey
Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun riding on his shoulder
The bucket shudders and grinds as it moves along the cable
Eric's body moves of on its final journey
It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic catch tilts it
Eric's body drops into the sea
The coal slag follows in a cloud of black dust
The waves pass over and everything is gone
Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the beach
He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get rid of it
- Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea
He raises the shotgun to throw it away
High on the clifftop a rifle and telescopic lens line up on Carter
finger curls around the trigger
On the middle finger of the same hand is a large gold ring with the letter '' engraved upon it
It is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his death
The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it
There's a quiet, whooshing sound
Carter drops to the ground
- Carter lies on the beach
The waves lap around his head small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple
He's dead
- Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle
He carefully wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier
He walks off and is soon lost as he drops out of sight
