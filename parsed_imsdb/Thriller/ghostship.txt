She stands in a great hollow cavern, oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel and      on the other side
-  - Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead
She kneels
As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull
-  - Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below
She stands on a rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable
It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north- west
She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way forward
-  -   - Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel smoke rising from its massive turbine vents
Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and professional
The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her true calling now
And under some grime, several polypro shirts and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be considered pretty
She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow
She climbs onto the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the bow beneath her
She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward the tug at the other end
-  - and  look on from the stern, where the boat's name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom
Dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate Texan and former merchant marine
(42), is the boat's first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north
They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it
Epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor
It's a slow leak
She unclips and drops to the deck
What's slow
Maybe twenty gallons an hour
Where from
Amidships starboard at the beam
Just under the waterline
don't think it's a problem
Hear that, Dodge
Epps don't think it's a problem
'll sleep good tonight knowing that
-  -  - The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar and  navigation displays glow
, the ship's master, pilots the boat
He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to bet his life on
walkie-talkie
(
) Greer to Murphy
(lifting the radio) Go
Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up at him from the stern
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded
Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour
They must've pumped it before we left Sitka
Of course they did
Let the buyer beware
What do you say, Dodge
(
) (taking the radio) If it started out at twenty an hour the piece of shit'd be at the bottom of the Gulf by now
Whether it'll make St
Lawrence is anybody's guess
- as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky
: -
- The shores of St
Lawrence Island open into a small port town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one side as it moves into the harbor
-  -  - smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie her up
-  -   - Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the turbines
-  - Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat Russian man, Vasili (60) and a  in grease-covered orange coveralls approach from the dock
thought you say Tuesday
Better late than never
(seeing the listing barge) What's this
You got a leak in the number nine compartment
No, no
You got leak
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new
That cost me twenty grand at least
Fifteen, at the most
Twenty
You knock off twenty and then we see
After my guy looks at it
'  - In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts a check as Murphy and Greer look on
He tears it out of the book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it
You're kidding, right
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey
Otherwise, please to sign
Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him
Murphy signs
- Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid
must be in the wrong business
You got that right
(imitating Vasili) Better than "making hamburger for Mickey
" - typical port town bar
Except this one is on an island in the middle of the Bering Sea
Epps lines up a shot at the pool table as a couple of  check out her ass and a tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants
Greer reads a paper near-by
Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer and a cigarette
Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's name on it
Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack of hundreds
Much obliged, skipper
-  - The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth
She buys two beers and pays the  from her envelope of cash
She takes the beers back to the far wall where a young off-duty  stands
He takes one, they laugh
Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight
With that coxswain dickhead
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge
Are you kidding me
Jealous
Epps
Gimme a break
Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer
What a laugh
can be heard as they sit there
'  (
) 'll show you, bitch
They look over to see the coastguardsman's , late 20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair
You want to mess with me, 'll kick your bitch ass, girl
Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight
don't know what you're talking about
just bought this guy a beer
This "guy" is my man, honey
Darlene -- You, shut up
(starting off) Listen,  don't want any trouble, okay --
(stopping Epps) Uh-uh
No
We're gonna fix this right now
(stepping up) What seems to be the trouble, ladies
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief
Murphy turns to see a shipyard , a big man holding a beer, still wearing his welding leathers
Murphy turns back to Epps and the Girlfriend
As  said, what seems to be the trouble
Didn't you hear me, grandpa
Or you got your hearing aid turned down
heard you
But 'm choosing to ignore you
Epps, let's go
Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking Murphy by the collar
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan
Or what
Or
Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks in two over the Riveter's head
Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half he still holds, shaking his head
The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs buckle
Some of his  hold him up as Greer reminds some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own
Epps
He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here
She grabs her coat
Wait
Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his girlfriend
Darlene
It's over
He gives her the ring from his finger
Murphy rolls his eyes as the others look on
don't love you anymore
Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her on the back
(to Epps) Come on, Candy
Let's get out of here
The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand
Epps looks to Murphy and the others as he leads her out
- Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps approaches on the dock
She jumps down onto the deck, a spring in her step and a song in her heart
Morning everybody
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that
bet you did
Candy
It's my pen name
-  - Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky
Red sky at night, sailor's delight
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning
-  -  - As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange
: -   - Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table
Fuck it
He puts down his hand
Epps takes another drag from her cigarette, collecting her winnings
One more
Why not
She gathers the cards, shuffles
What is your first name
What
It just occurred to me  don't know your first name
All this time and don't know it
She deals the cards in silence
(finally) Maureen
What
Maureen
Maureen
She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards
What's yours
Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it
Roger
Roger
Yeah
She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards
You think that's funny (lying) No
She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand
-   - ""    as the tug plows westward through a steady chop and a mild swell
-  - The
Greer has the  player cranked as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse
He checks the radar, holds there a beat
He turns the   and picks up a walkie-talkie
(into walkie) Greer to Murphy
Greer studies the radar display as he waits
(
) Yeah
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west
- '  -  - Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his radio
been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved
can't raise it on the radio either
Makes me think it might be in trouble
Alright
'll be right up
-  -  - as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright point of light in the middle of nowhere
(
) Merchant vessel at position one seven four one five west, five seven seven five north
Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge standing back
This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
Over
Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen
(to radio) Merchant vessel at one seven four one five west, five seven seven five north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
Over
Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on the screen
Too deep to anchor out there
Looks like it's adrift
Could be a fishing boat
Too big
More like a freighter
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here
It's way out of the lanes
There's not a port for 800 miles
Smugglers maybe
Smuggling what
Tundra grass
beat as Murphy holds there
He raises the radio mic
Merchant vessel at position one seven four one five west, five seven seven five north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior
Do you copy
Over
Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back
Call the Coastguard
Steer to one eight five
Let's check her out
- The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water
-  - as the phantom point flashes closer
Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching
Alright
Back it off
Greer throttles back and the boat slows
Hit the lights
-  - The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly illuminating the water in front of the boat
-  -  - The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the light
Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad beam of light with a joy stick
-  - As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight over the bow of the boat and into the darkness
-  - They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, when a shadow looms into view
Whoa, whoa
Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow looms bigger before them in the light from the boat
As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness above them
Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of what appears to be a large, darkened ship
As they come around, the name "" can be seen above the anchor alleys
"Chimera
" Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the
Chimera
-  - The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera rising above it
(
) This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior
Is there anyone aboard
The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound
-  -  - Murphy raises the mic again
Chimera,  am hove to at your port bow
Is there anyone aboard
They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the glare of their lights
Epps, come with me
You guys sit tight
-  - Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against the movement of the water
-  - Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen making their way up under the floodlights
-   -   - Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck
Epps jumps down behind him
Murphy throws his light up on the superstructure
All remnants of paint have been rusted over, lending a still darker ominousness to it
-   -   - Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights as they go
Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything seems to be in order
The decks are clear and there is no apparent damage
They come to a hatchway
Epps shines her light down the darkened passage
Murphy moves in
-  -  - Murphy and Epps move down the passageway
Even the walls in here are rusted
They come to a flight of stairs
-  -  - Greer and Dodge wait
Greer reaches for his radio
(into radio) Talk to me, skipper
After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio
We're in a stairwell just under the main superstructure
-  -  - Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway
This is definitely an old boat, maybe sixty years old
She hasn't been in service for at least twenty years
Probably a lot longer
They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which takes them into an open area
Their lights shine around them, revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen equipment, a few pots still hanging
They move through the galley and into another, narrower, passageway
-  -  - Greer and Dodge look on
It's funny
How's that
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved
Greer and Dodge look at each other
How she got out here is one hell of a good question
(a long beat, then) Jesus
Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting
Only silence from the other end
What is it
No answer
Murphy
No answer
Murphy, goddamit
(finally) Sorry
Another beat in silence
What is it
-  -  - Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over an immense ballroom
Murphy raises his radio
It's a passenger ship
It's a damn passenger ship
Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier hanging over it all
-  - Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge meet them at the bottom
(jumping down) There's nobody on that boat
-   - Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current
Out here
What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned
We've got every right to salvage her
You mean tow her back
That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about
We've done it before
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other
But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage
The fittings alone could go for a few million
If you get it back in one piece
It's a risk 'm willing to take
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it
So we cut her loose and wait it out
little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before
It's a bloody navigation hazard
One boat can't control a ship that size
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet
So we take it easy
little of the old push pull
long beat as they hold there
Listen
Forget this job's just a pay check for a minute
You know 've been good to you
But 'm prepared to offer you something better now
(a beat) If we do this right, it's worth a lot of money
lot of money
They hold there looking on at him, waiting
Go on
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks
At least
Who knows, could be more
Could be a lot more
(a beat) What 'm proposing is
we split it four ways
beat
Dodge looks to Epps and Greer
Think about it
million bucks a piece
(a beat) You want to spend the rest of your days drag-assing tank barges on the gulf coast, fine
Otherwise, let's get to work
- The tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of day
-  - Murphy brings up the radio mic as Greer and the others look on

Arctic Warrior over and out
-   - Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of the boat under the power winch
Okay
We're gonna use a heavier than usual twin cable rig this time, consisting of a pair of number three gauge braided wire tows
(a beat) We'll tie off through the anchor alleys
And come down to the aft port and starboard pins
Here
Thus, we need to get two of these
(indicating the cable) Up there
He indicates the bow of the Chimera
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy
(a beat) Any questions
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow
Then we'll all be doomed
Any other questions
- Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera
Greer operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables dangling from it down to the winch on the stern
Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera
Dodge pokes his face out from the other side
Ready
Bring it on, dude
Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through the loop at the end of the tow cable
She places the end of the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten it down, with the effect of joining the two cables
Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable through the anchor alleys
(
) (finally) Hit it
Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's hull with a shower of black rust
-   -  - Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor alley
It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks it
He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the deck
-   -  - The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills out of the anchor alley before Epps
-   -  - Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek dangerously close to his face, until
-   -  - The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below beat as she holds there
Dodge
You alright
-   -  - Dodge lies tangled in the winch
Yes
- Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down into the water and come up again from the water to the tow anchor on the tug's stern
Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by
He raises his walkie
Alright, skipper, real easy
-  -  - Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward
He turns to see as the Chimera drops back behind them
-  - The tug moves slowly away from the Chimera as Epps, Greer and Dodge look on
As the tug widens the distance, leaving the Chimera in place
-  -  - Murphy holds the helm steady as the Chimera recedes
Steady as she goes
-  - Dodge, Epps and Greer look on as the tow cables begin to rise in their wake
(into radio) Throttle back
The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water
More
The tug slows still more
More
It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water, straightening as the slack is pulled out
-  - Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught in the anchor alleys of the Chimera
-  -  - Murphy holds the throttle
Right there, skipper
Right there
Murphy eases forward on the throttle and the turbines rise in pitch
-  - As the tow cables stretch and the bow of the Chimera inches forward
-  - The turbines grow louder as Greer, Epps, and Dodge look on at the Chimera behind them, the massive tow cables bowing under their own weight
-  -  - Murphy eases forward on the throttle, picking up speed
-  - The giant ship    as it starts forward, a small bow break forming on its hull
-  - The tug is kicking up a foaming wake as it pulls the Chimera along behind it
Dodge lets out a hoot, exchanging high fives with Epps and Greer
-  -  - Murphy smiles as he looks back at the Chimera following behind
-  - The south Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska

(
) figure we go through at the Unimak Pass here
Refuel at Sanak Island
Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand over the map table
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop
Sounds reasonable
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size
The law's on our side
If they want to challenge it, let them try
They must've scuttled it
Nobody just lets a ship float away
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either
Ever heard of insurance, big boy
Either way, we found it
It's ours now --
An   shudders the boat
They look to each other
(moving for the door) What the
-   - Dodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another ,
(shouting up to the pilothouse) -  -  - Greer shoves the throttle back
-  - The boat goes dead in the water, thick black smoke billowing from the turbine vents
-  - as the bow slows in the water, the tow cables coming slack
-   -  - Dodge pulls open the door
The place is thick with smoke as he makes his way to the turbine gauges, Epps and Murphy behind
Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks inside
Mother fucker
What is it
Threw a turbine blade
Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum intake blade, hot to the touch
Son of a bitch
-  - Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed
Number two runs, but it's way underpowered
How long to fix
Hard to say
gotta get in there and have a look
At least a couple days
Depending
You think the extra strain caused it
Nah
Everything was cool
It's just one of those things
- The Arctic Warrior floats tied to the side of the Chimera
-   - Dodge has both turbines opened up as he works
-   - Lights shine on what was once an elegant interior promenade
Murphy and Greer stand looking on at it
Some classy tub in it's day, huh
Yeah

- ""  - Murphy, Epps, and Greer top a staircase out onto a long, darkened corridor
They move down
Some of the doors are open, faint light from port holes showing small cabins with beds, desks, a few chairs
-   -   - Murphy, Epps, and Greer come to a hatchway marked "
" -  -   - The forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before them and the rusting foredeck about 150 feet below
Light from the windows illuminates the bridge as Murphy, Greer and Epps look around
Despite a little corrosion and a layer of dirt, everything seems in its place
(looking through scattered charts and papers) 'd sure like to get my hands on the general log
Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang
That must be the old man right there
The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man from another century, with dark, hollow eyes
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure
- dimming purple horizon is giving way to night as the tug floats under the bow of the Chimera
-   - Dodge works up to his elbows in turbine 1 as Greer monitors a pressure gauge
How about now
Sixty pounds
What
You sure
That's what it says
(geting up to have a look) Lemme see
-  - Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights
Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in
Coffee
(sitting up) Yeah
Thanks
She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back from the Chimera
(taking a seat) What'd you find up there
Some charts
crew manifest
(looking them over) Looks like her last voyage was January 1953
The question is where the hell's she been since
She was sailing up north, right
Her destination was Halifax, yeah
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have
Got stuck in the ice
The passengers and crew evacuated
She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid
They write it off
Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens
The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her
Murphy nods, considering it
As reasonable an explanation as any, guess
Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste
Nope
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872
One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia
As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste
On boarding, they found her completely deserted
The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone
The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble
The table was even set for dinner
And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard
So what did happen
Nobody knows
There've been a lot of theories, of course
But we'll never really know for sure
You think she's sailing without a crew
Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow
think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current
You're more practical than superstitious
Only way to be
Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light
-  - Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him
The crane hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck
Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily
What's this
Turbine rotor's shot
thought you said it was just a blade
Metal's crystallized
Gotta replace the whole deal
How much longer's that gonna take
Like  always say -- know  know, two ways to do anything -- The right way and the wrong way
But how long
Hard to say
We gotta get outa here, Dodge storm blows up and we're history
'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is
What about running number two by itself
It's a full 2500 horses down
We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it
How long, then
gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor --
How long
Three, four days
Goddamit, Dodge
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened
Can't do it, skipper

Another beat as Murphy holds there, as the others look on
North Island, have you got any additional information
Over
(
) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior
The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax

long beat as the static of the open channel comes back
Roger, North Island
am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera
And she is afloat
Repeat, she is afloat

say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea

Roger, North Island
Please advise pending further information
Over
(
) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior
This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station
Over and out
beat as they hold there, thinking about it
Obviously it's some kind of screw up
The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate
Man, it gives me the creeps
We got no business towing a ship that size anyway
say we fix the turbines and hit the highway
Are you crazy
Do you realize we got ourselves a ship
We own a ship, Dodge
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago
You don't think that's just a little freaky
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong
That's a damn big boat
It's either sunk or it ain't
We all want to get outa here, Dodge
Especially me
With that boat in tow
You got three days
Make the most of it
beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera
- '  - pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates to Dubayy
Murphy sits at his desk over the map
His pencil point follows the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman
Murphy marks an "" there
beat as he looks on at it
He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera
He empties it on the desk
He looks through it, docking receipts from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc
He looks over the passenger manifest
-   - Murphy wakes
He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of the papers inside
-  -   - Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads in the shade of the deck house
Dodge's hand slips and he skins his knuckles
Fucker
Take it easy, Dodge
It's only a piece of metal
(inspecting his skinned knuckles) Damn mind of it's own
(seeing Murphy) Morning, skipper
Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight
Morning
You're up late
Guess  must've fallen back to sleep
Where's Epps
Went aboard
She take a radio
Yeah
Murphy nods
beat
-   - Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room
Tables and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang
She walks on
pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry decanter beside them
An ashtray sits beside that
Epps stops, reaching down
She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time
And, as she stands there, we see a , ,
In an instant it is there and gone
She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence
She turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing to be seen now
-   -   - doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance
It lies on a love seat as Epps steps up
She lifts it
Several other toys lie scattered about as she studies it, when the sound of a beat as Epps holds there
She turns, trying to locate the sound
From across the room, Epps stands, listening
As the sounds from here
She turns, putting down the doll, holding a beat
She approaches, crossing the room, coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see is an ancient grandfather clock
All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, but from inside it emits a weak though steady
Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the beat as she holds there, as the clock faces her, now silent
-  -  - Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door where daylight falls from a small port
She looks through it
-   -   - Epps stands in a white tiled room
Light falls from port holes high in the wall
Running its length is a small swimming pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating bizarre patterns
-   -   - Epps comes to a row of changing stalls
Old clothing hangs there, unused for fifty years
pair of woman's shoes lie on the floor
-   -  - Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into -  -  - Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine ball
She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang
The Chimera can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm sea
- - -  - Epps jumps down to a lower deck
She shines her light up to see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive diesel burner
She passes through into another compartment where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to the ceiling
- - -  -   - Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over her in the cavernous space
She moves into a narrowing passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into the depths of the ship
Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, apparently a cargo hold
Crates and boxes are stacked on loading palettes
In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something
Epps comes to it
She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster
For the exception of a coat of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly preserved
Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' eye
heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, as though blown back from some terrific explosive force
Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door
She shines her light inside
clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the shadows, when her light catches a glint of something
She swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object between broken wood slats
Epps steps in
She kneels, shining the light closer
The yellow glint is metal
Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram ingot of gold
She reaches out
She raises it, completely untouched by the years
She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side
She slides away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high and five feet across
beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in gold
-   - The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 4' stack of gold ingots
(
) What the fuck we gonna do with it
Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on
What the fuck you think we gonna do with it
It's ours, baby
It's all ours
Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it
How much you figure that's worth, skipper
(still looking it over) Hard to say
Maybe forty, fifty million
Ho, baby
That's a lot of money for somebody to just let float away
Murphy looks up at her from the gold
Yes, it is
beat as they all hold there
It's a hell of a lot of money
What, you think there's something funny about it
ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift
And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off
Not for fifty million
An ocean liner maybe
But fifty million in gold, they come looking for
Maybe they didn't want it back
Maybe the whole fat deal was insured
Maybe
But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake
All  gotta say is it looks like that somebody's us right now
Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge
And it looks like somebody got here before us too
The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it back from the wall
(inspecting it) Didn't happen yesterday, 'll tell you that
Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat
Then it happened before they scuttled her
You mean, before she sank
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice
That it could
beat, as they all look on at the gold
-   - After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the galley table
Then why didn't they take it
Probably didn't have time
Or somebody stopped them
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason
Must be a damn good reason to jump ship and leave fifty million dollars aboard
beat as they consider it
So what're we gonna do
That's the big question, right
salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself
It's ours
Then we're rich
We're damn, filthy stinking rich
It looks like it
beat as they let this sink in
So what
We gonna unload the gold and get a move on
We leave it where it is
Stick to the plan
You gotta be kidding
What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks
So we get a little more for the boat
Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka
It's worth the effort
Believe me
Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage
Why not call for help
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this
Last thing we want is extra partners
Or uninvited guests
heard that
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs
Yeah, yeah
'm on it
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours
-   - Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum fitting over one of the open turbines
- -   - Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space beyond the twisted hatch
Two hundred twenty
Two twenty one
(as Epps stacks the last one) Two twenty two
Greer makes a note
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold
That's what  call a payday
Hell yeah
They slap hands
-   -  - Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door marked "
" The door is ajar
He pushes it open
- '  -  - Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in dark wood
large desk occupies a corner of the room by the windows
Though dirty and worn with time, everything is ordered and in its place
Murphy comes to the desk
He sits down in the chair behind it
The surface is clear and uncluttered
He pulls out the drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and protractor amidst other sundry items
- '  -  -   - Murphy steps in
The room is undisturbed, light falling in on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered curtains
robe hangs on the back of a chair
pair of slippers lie beneath it
- '  -  -   - Murphy stands in the bathroom
The tile has yellowed with time, but everything is exactly as it was left
Even the shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on at it
He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an -   -   - Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior is tied
-   -   - Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to the deck
-  - Murphy jumps down to the deck
Flames belch from an open hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, coming to the engine room door
-   -  - Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and black smoke
He finds Dodge spraying at it with an extinguisher of his own
The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, the heat searing paint on the metal covers
Murphy sprays a cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment
Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and hands singed
An     and molten flames hurl through the air, catching Murphy's pant leg
He's so engrossed in fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire
(over the roar) Murphy
Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out
Propane tanks're gonna go
Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to the most intense part of the flames
He turns the extinguisher into them, holding it there
The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning his extinguisher on it too
The fire seems to dim yet again as clouds of halon rise up
Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling
Dodge fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the wall again
Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the deck, and finally out
They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with smoke
fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, but the fire is out
-  - Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on
One minute 'm minding my own business, the next thing  know the whole place is burning up
(taking a drag) An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder
Started an oil fire
Looks like it took out the backup genny too
Terrific
Epps arrives with a first aid kit
How's that leg
Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn
Seen better -- Ow
Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide
This's gonna hurt a little
Thanks for the warning -- Ow
Damn
Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it
What now
We could call for help
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here
What other choices have we got
tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now
-   - gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as he holds the radio mic
(to radio) United States Coastguard, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
Radio check
Over
moment, then: (
) Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior
This is United States Coastguard Station North Island
Your radio check is affirmative
Over
Roger that, North Island
Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
Over and out
-   - Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under the stark light of a gas lantern
Fifty million four ways
That's twelve million and change a piece
What you gonna do with your share, skipper
Not much at all,  guess
Retire
Live out my golden years and all that
'm buyin' me a nice outrigger
Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget
How about you Epps
Guess 'll just keep working
What're you crazy
like my job
Greer
Moving to Sweden
What's so great about Sweden
It's a beautiful country
Very clean
Very civilized
And cold
That's a good thing
Hell, yeah
like it cold
Colder the better
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running
Yeah, yeah
, ,   ,
What the hell is that
The  ,
-  -   - Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck
The     , as they stand facing it on the bow
It's coming from inside
They hold there listening as the
Sounds like the hull
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand
That shit is seriously bizarre
The    continues as they hold there
-  - The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in halon powder
Dodge stands there looking at it
He sighs
-  - Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of sterno cans and warming candles
He throws them into a wooden crate of other supplies he's gathered
-    - Epps slowly pushes open the door
She holds a sack with a few items she's managed to scavenge
Light falls from curtained windows onto the room
divan sits against the wall
table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top
Two twin beds stand on either side
They are covered in dust and are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten up, fifty years ago
In one corner is an armoire
Epps steps up to it, pulling back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging there undisturbed
-  -   - pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over which is draped a woman's robe
Epps lifts it, the material crumbling in her hands
-  -   - drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket watch and fob, and a room key
Epps pulls back the billfold
She opens it
Inside she finds a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950
In the folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars
An insert holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, presumably his wife
- ""   -  - Epps steps from the room
She turns to close the door, but stops, holding there, strongly sensing something
, revealing the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in the foggy light from a porthole, a  in dark clothing
Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her beat as they hold there
The man only stares back at her, then turns to walk away
Hey
Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner
Hey, wait a minute
Hey
Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the passageway
She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto another passageway
The man is nowhere to be seen
Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway
She turns back, running right into Murphy
Take it easy, you'll live longer
Did you see him
Who
The guy
He just came this way
What guy
There's somebody else on this boat
What
What the hell're you talking about
saw him
Just a minute ago
Some guy
Are you sure
Of course 'm sure
saw him
You sure it wasn't me
It wasn't you
It was somebody else
There's somebody else aboard
beat as Murphy looks back at her
-   - Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light
Light in those passages ain't so good
'm telling you,  saw somebody don't know who it was
But  saw somebody
What'd he look like
Maybe six feet
Lanky
didn't get a good look
He was far away
But saw him
saw him as sure as you're standing there
Where's his boat, then
Where's his crew
He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it
Maybe that is his boat
Gimme a break
beat as they sit in silence
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours
She's theirs
Bullshit
That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years
We found her
She's ours
Not in the eyes of the law
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position
say fuck the motherfucker
We're a professional salvage crew going about our business
What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway
And what do you propose
That we knock this guy off
Why not
Why the fuck not
beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks
Fifty million dollars
Fifty million
We gonna let this guy just take it from us
One guy
So we kill him
'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest
don't know
Let's just take it easy here, alright
Nobody's gonna kill anybody
Supposing he wants to get bad with us
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid
Maybe he isn't alone
They consider this a moment
say we off-load some of that gold now
Would you hold on just a minute here, please
Look, there's no reason to panic now
Epps saw somebody
Fine
It's a big boat
Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold
If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser
(a beat) The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go
Like  said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go
We'll stand a watch
Four on, eight off
Low man first
Guess that'd be me
Again
Dodge, get on that turbine
don't care if you don't sleep for a week
The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here
How's the food situation
Pretty low all around
We'll have to take it easy then don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around
Say we run into this guy again
beat as they consider this
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal
If not
We'll have to re-consider our options
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up
-   - Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun
Epps pulls back the shotgun and a box of shells
-  - Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge
She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand
Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from the deck house
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps
You raised on a farm
(setting the safety) Seen a lota movies
No cowboy shit up there, understand
No cowboy shit
Right
Greer extends a thermos to Epps
Coffee
(pocketing it in her coat) You're a pal
She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too
Got your light
Yup
Smokes
Oh yeah
Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings the shotgun on her back
See you boys later
(to Greer) Don't be late,  need my beauty rest
She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened ship above them
-  - flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps approaches
If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is terrifying now
She comes to a ladder and climbs down
-   -  - Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the cargo hold
She crosses in the darkness, her light catching the tarnished glint of the gold
She comes up to it, stopping there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune
She looks around for a place to sit
She drags a palette to the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment
She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos to pour herself a cup of coffee
-   -  - Epps has dozed off when a somewhere in the ship
Epps wakes
It is silent, as she holds there, not sure she heard anything, when a She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening
As Epps holds there, another deep  sounds distantly somewhere
Epps turns, her blood running cold
-   -   - Epps moves along in the darkness when the She stops, holding there, in the silence
-   -   - Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive propeller shaft hangs suspended above her
Epps moves along
Finally she comes out into
-   -  - Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine
She continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing into the darkness above her, when
She turns, shinning her light back from where she came
Nothing moves
Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe her heart pounding in her chest
, again echoing distantly in the silence
She shines her light through the line of burners
Nothing moves
Epps moves quietly between the burners
She comes to a massive watertight door at the bulkhead
She steps through, finding herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks
, closer, as suddenly stopping
She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding her light out before her
She comes to the end of the compartment and another bulkhead
The  , still closer
She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting machinery and a stack of oil drums
She approaches, holding the shotgun up
As she nears, the She stops
It is coming from here
She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady as she can manage
The
It is metallic and staccato
She stops in the corner beside an oil drum
Several drums have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs her hair
She shines her light up to see that she stands at the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that betrays a throughway to the outside
The   , this time coming from the pile of oil drums
She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to fire
beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to push a drum with her foot, when
She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top of the ship and freedom
Murphy to Epps
She settles back, exhausted
Murphy to Epps
(taking her radio) Epps
You just shoot at something
Yeah
Just a bird
Just a stupid bird
She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, when she smells something really awful
She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam of her flashlight
She steps still closer, training her light on the form to see that it is a human torso
large gash runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by scavenging birds
She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on something
She starts, then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with wide, unseeing eyes
It takes everything she has just to hold there
She shines her light back to the headless torso
She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her
She spins around to see another body above her
Except this one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam pipe
It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum to mouth
One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below it
few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another bent pipe
-   -  - lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various rotting parts
(
) Ho-ly shit
(
) Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago
Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the remains of the headless torso
Bodies're too fresh
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind
Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet
He looks through it
Greek citizen
Merchant navy
(standing) Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship
They probably stumbled across it just like we did
And look what happened
Damn barbaric is what it is
Could be meant as a warning
Stay away
Or else
Because of the gold
That'd be my guess
So whoever did this might still be around
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it
Maybe
beat as they consider the implications of this
So, what
We report this
Call the Coastguard
Another beat as they hold there
Let's not be too hasty
Yeah
Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later
We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, , who knows who, all over the place
beat as nobody's too sure about this
Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough to fix that boat,  don't know what is
: -   - Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of smoke
All the seals and gaskets're shot
Anything that was rubber burned up
Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on
Can't you use something else
might be able to find something on the ship
But it's gonna take time
Do what you need to do
Just do it fast
Right
-   - Epps sleeps in her bunk
-   - Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness
need lag bolts, especially one inch standard
And sheet metal
Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch
Aluminium, even tin'll do
ain't no mechanic, just so you know
You find anything that even looks like a compressor
don't care what, grab it

He looks through the shelves and cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book
He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call log
He takes a seat, paging through it

He has difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when he slips
Dammit
beat as he inspects his hand
In the silence , maybe metal against metal or maybe human, somewhere in the ship

The  ,   , as it echoes through the ship
He stops, holding there to listen

He looks down the passageway a beat, then moves on
He passes through a hatchway in a bulkhead when He stops
The song is "" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
'm half crazy, oh for the love of you

He holds there, listening intently
door stands open at the other end of the passage

) "Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster to the crow
"Where are you now know, but won't say so

He hits the talk button
Who is this

Only silence comes back from the radio when  ' sounds from somewhere in the ship

Dodge to Murphy
(taking radio) Murphy
You better get down here quick, skipper
'm on "" deck
Cabin 400
What is it
think you better see this for yourself
- / -   - Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw Greer in earlier
At the end, the light from the cabin falls from the open door as he approaches
400 As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the middle of the cabin
found him like this
Greer is lying supine on the floor
His legs are rigid and his trunk is extended
His arms are flexed and twisted so that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other
Murphy kneels beside him
Greer's eyelids are half closed, his eyes rolled up into his head
His jaw is clenched, face contorted in a bizarre grimace
And he speaks, uttering nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in tongues

-   - - As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated
(
) Hard to say
Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy looking on
She turns it off, standing upright
'm no doctor
But 'd say he's in a coma
what
don't know what else you'd call it
He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out
He's totally unresponsive to pain
(a beat) What happened up there
heard a scream
When  got there found him on the floor
He was having some kind of seizure
didn't see anybody else
He must've seen something
beat as they consider this
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that  can see, not on the outside
Then what the hell happened to him
Another beat as they hold there
Just before  heard him yell there was somebody on the radio
Greer
don't know
No
Not Greer
Somebody
Another long beat as they think about this
It was a man's voice
Repeating some sort of children's rhyme
don't know, it didn't make any sense
You didn't hear it
Not me
Another beat as this sinks in
(looking to Greer) He needs a doctor
'll call us in
Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up
(to Epps, meaning Dodge) Keep an eye on him

The door comes open and Murphy steps in
How's he doing
Same
Any luck
No
'll try again later
beat as they look on at Greer
-   - Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table
Epps reads the log book Murphy found in the radio room
(reading it) They're dead in the water that morning
Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command
And that evening they issue a general Possibly false
Hence the  record of being lost at sea
don't think mutiny's out of the question here
(taking a seat) On a passenger ship in 1953
If they knew what they were carrying
You're saying they mutinied for the gold
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
Only something must've gone wrong
Yeah, way wrong
beat as they consider it
So
got a question
Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint
We call the Coastguard
Coastguard shows up
What exactly is the plan
How do you mean
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions
About us
About those bodies
About the gold
Seems like we oughta be prepared is all
guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth
Yeah, well
The truth is one thing
When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal
What do you propose
For starters, getting that gold off the ship
What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them
beat as Murphy holds there
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here
Besides, it'll be safer where it is
With all due respect, skipper
(a beat) Part of that up there's mine
'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it
beat as Murphy looks on
Tell you what, Dodge
Once we get back to shore, you can do whatever you want with your share
But until then, the gold stays right where it is
Dodge holds there
He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of coffee
- The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera
- Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs
-  -  - Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks
beat
He steps forward, crossing to the corner
The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it
-   -   - Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from behind and shoved into the wall
Murphy holds him fast
Just what the hell do you think you're doing
don't know what you're talking about
think you know
Maybe you can tell me then
Murphy shoves him hard into the wall
The radio
(not having a clue) The radio
Oh, yeah, the radio
Murphy tightens his grip
Take it easy, willya
What about the radio
You smashed it
What
Don't lie to me
What the fuck --
You didn't want us calling anybody
Too liable to ruin your big payday
didn't touch the fucking radio
Murphy tightens his grip still more
didn't touch the fucking radio
(a beat) Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper
Conveniently enough for you
Look,  didn't touch it
Alright
Murphy holds there a beat longer
He shoves Dodge back letting him go
Jesus
Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on
(
) Murphy
They turn to see Epps in the hatchway
It's Greer
-   -   - Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a jug of water as Murphy and the others step in
He turns to see them
Never been more thirsty in my life
Drink up then
Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a seat, looking on at him
How're you feeling
Lost my sea legs
Any dizziness
No
Headache, nausea, lights
Lights
Sudden flashes of light
feel fine
What day is it
don't know
Tuesday
Wrong
It's Friday
Try Wednesday
Right
Wednesday
beat as they all hold there
Greer takes a seat
What happened
You don't remember
Last thing  remember  was aboard the Chimera
Down somewhere in there scavenging around
You've been out for about a day
Say what
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins
Greer only holds there
Oh, man
We heard you scream
Any idea what you might've seen
wish  could tell you
'd be real interested to know myself
Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink of water
The ah
the radio's out
What
Somebody took it out of commission last night
beat as they all hold there
Smashed it up pretty bad
But, who --
The skipper seems to think  did it
That 'm more interested in that gold than my own safety or the safety of my fellow shipmates
beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back
Did you
Hell no
You think 'm crazy
Another beat as they hold there
Regardless of how it happened, there isn't much of a chance to fix it
The odds of another vessel in range of the walkie-talkies are almost astronomical
So, as of today, we're pretty much on our own out here
-  - Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the ship
-  '  - Greer stops before a mirror to see himself
He finds an aspirin bottle, goes to open it
And as he does so, he sees that his hand is shaking uncontrollably
-   - Dodge works over the turbine
He stops, holding there
He looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses
beat
He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, yanking them loose, breaking them off
-   - The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty assortment of tubes and condensers
Murphy looks on at it
tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten corner
Epps picks it up
The cover has been ripped off and the pages are torn
But, as she looks through it, she sees that it is the ship's log
Murphy
Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the very end
The last pages have been ripped out
Looks like part of the general log
Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill
" February first
The same day she supposedly went down
Must not've been the captain's entry
He was probably out of the picture by then
Epps continues to read
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision
Distress calls have been made
" Collision
With what
The page's missing
Then their was real
But where's the damage
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it
If it was a ship she hit
beat as they hold there, when his radio
Dodge to Murphy
Murphy reaches down for his radio
(to radio) Yeah
You better get down here right now
We're taking water
Big time
- Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is starting to list to one side
He crosses to the deck house and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a pump hose over the
What the hell happened
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown
Took out part of the hull
We're not gonna be able to pump it
Alright
Everybody grab your gear
This' is where we get off
-   - The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their gear to the crane
Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs precariously at the bow of the Chimera
Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse
Dodge
-   -  - Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to one side
Dodge wades through toward the door
-   -  - Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, then Murphy
Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, which now lists at a near 45 degree angle
Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck
He goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the starboard rail
He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off
deck locker opens and the contents tumble around him
He struggles to pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse
He climbs up and edges his way toward the bow
Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the skewed deck crane
The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera
Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it sinks lower and lower
They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship
Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing
As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water
Above, Greer casts a line
It falls near, but out of reach as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and fro
Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming close but not close enough
The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, coaxing it into his grasp
He pulls it back and hangs on, as the crane sways back with the foundering boat
The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space by the line from the bow of the Chimera
Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves
Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, slipping lower and lower
As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of Dodge's hand
and they turn to see the twin tow cables coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight
With a  , one cable is freed, snapping against the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string
It starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air
Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short
and Dodge turns to see misty air escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water forces it out of the tug below decks
The tow cable     in a shower of rust, as Dodge struggles to pull himself up
Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their hands barely reaching
The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand
Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation of misty air
The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally disappearing altogether into the depths
long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood
-   - boot punches through a rotten wood hull
(
) That just about says it all
Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards above the deck
Rotten stem to stern
Guess you couldn't expect much else
Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either
The coast guard has our last position
They'll send somebody out soon enough
ship this size you can't exactly miss
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too
Let 'em ask
This ship's legally ours now
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat
Dodge turns to see Greer
beat
The turbine blew
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire
beat
Dodge takes a swing at Greer
(grabbing Dodge) Easy, easy
Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 'd say
Shut up
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge
Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on
said, shut the hell up
Murphy shoves Dodge back
Both of you
don't want to hear it again
beat as Greer and Murphy hold there
So just stow it
You understand
(a beat) We don't need this right now
-  - fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer sit around it in silence
- 4TH '  - Epps steps in
She shines her light on the room
It is exactly as it was left
She crosses to the bed, shining her light under it
She sits down, trying it
-   - Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the stacked gold ingots rest
He looks on at them
(
) You shouldn't be down here alone
Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there
Just wanted to check on our little baby
beat as they look on at the gold
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants
If money can buy what he wants
don't figure there's much  want money can't buy
Then you're a lucky man
Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight
You're up first
Right
Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge looks after him
- grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the top deck
-   - Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke
-  - Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, scavenging for food
-  - Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, open galley, when a separating the galley from the outer passageway
Murphy
No one answers
She looks off across the stillness of the galley
Nothing
-  -   - Epps steps into the passageway
Directly across is the entry to the swimming pool
She walks on
-   - Epps steps in
Light falls in from the dirty port holes at the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls
She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool
Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back
She is porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her clothing hanging loosely from a frail body
You must leave
beat as Epps stands there
(finally) Who are you
From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully discern the girl's features
There's great evil here, more than you can know
Leave now or you may never leave
But -- Epps turns to look
When she turns back the girl is gone
quiet "" in the pool
She looks down to see that the pool is now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the depths
And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising up from the bottom
She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the top
It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching the surface
Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles
As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity
The glow spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear that the water is not water at all but blood
And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up
Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light
It is a , fighting desperately to reach the surface
The bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams
Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same point, a , also struggling
Another  floats up, then another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood
My God
Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far apart
She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the surface
The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches out, near tears, helpless to do anything
No
Everything suddenly stops
beat as Epps only holds there
The blood is gone, as are the people
The pool is back to its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking on in disbelief
(
) You okay
Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door
Yeah
(looking back to the pool) Yeah, fine
beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool
-   - Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle
Use some of those bodies below decks for bait
There's a charming thought
We can always start shooting birds
Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette
What say, Epps
You up for some roasted albatross
(snuffing it out) Why not
- 1ST '  - The         in the dark room
As the      , we see that it is Greer, lying on the bed
His body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest
His jaw is clenched and he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure
-  - Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of morning
Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming down when Greer steps in
Looks like we're in a strong current
(closing the door) Must be making almost five knots full on ass backwards
Greer crosses to the window, stepping up
Nasty little swell outa the north west too
Murphy nods as he looks out
Let's just hope somebody sees us first out here
-   - file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts
Epps looks on at it
The receipts are labeled " " and are divided by first, second, and third class
She goes through them, coming to a section that says "
" She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening it
The first page is a receipt for a single passage to Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14
She pulls it back to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4
Another, Vitti, Angela age: 17
She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 11, 1, until coming across a 9
She looks to the name, Klein, David, a boy
She continues paging through the receipts coming to another 9
She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, Katherine age: 16
girl
She looks to the cabin assignment: "400
" She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was found, when a
-   -  - Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as the ship drifts into it
They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright orange letters "" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as the ship drifts by
It's a Noaa buoy
what
Government weather
It's got a transmitter aboard
-   -   - Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat
As it drifts along the side of the Chimera
Murphy drops the line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell
Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook it on its wind gauge
The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell
Murphy corrects
Higher
You're gonna miss it
Murphy holds the loop steady
The loop is too low
It's going to miss the mark as the buoy drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes down
Murphy yanks on the line
And the loop catches on the wind gauge
As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, the line snapping hard against the rail
Below, the buoy heels over as it's pulled
It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with a huge
The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing bowing a little with the weight as they look on
We're still drifting
The mooring hasn't come taught
It's not gonna hold us
Doesn't matter
As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side of the ship
The water returns, lifting it high
The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its mooring comes taught
The line rises with it and soon the buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water
The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own mooring
The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend
As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable
No fucking way
The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain of spray, whipping wildly from side to side
The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera
Damn it
They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the ship drifts away
-  - Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him
Hey
Hey
Couldn't sleep
Wish  could say the same
They watch the fire in silence for a moment
What do you think happened on this boat
guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it
The what
Never mind
Before your time
(a beat) think at least some of the crew went a little nuts
The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune
Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide
What happened after that is anybody's guess
But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time
Are we smart enough to avoid that
don't know, are we
beat as she looks back at him
She looks back to the fire, watching it
When you found me yesterday, at the pool
'd seen
something
Someone
Not our mystery guest again
No
Someone else
girl
(hesitating, a beat) 'm not sure she was
real
She looks up to Murphy
Not real
beat as she only looks back
What, like some kind of ghost
don't know what else you'd call her
One second she was there, the next she was gone
Another beat as he looks on at her
And  had a kind of hallucination
(a beat) There were others
saw them in the pool
Drowning
beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word
It was more than that
As though they were showing me
Showing you what
What happened
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks
No
think they are, were, just passengers
Innocent victims
Victims of what
Something bad happened here, Murphy
That much  think we've already established
More than just a mutiny
More than just the gold
beat as he holds there
She said the ship was evil
That we had to leave right away
That if we didn't, we might never leave
What's that supposed to mean
don't know
beat as she looks back
Why you
How come the rest of us haven't seen these people
Just lucky  guess
Another beat as he holds on her
Well
Getting off this ship's exactly what we're trying to do
Short of that,  don't know what else to tell you
She only looks back at him, then into the fire
Do me a favor and wake up Dodge
He's next on
She starts to get up
And Epps
She stands, looking back at him
You can tell the others about this
But, for my money,  think it's best you keep it to yourself
She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off
-  -  - Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks
Dodge
(no answer, knocking again) Dodge
(
) (finally, from inside) What
Get up
(
) Yeah, yeah
- 4TH   - Epps sits down on the bed
She lies back, not sleepy
beat as she holds there in the darkness
-  - Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of water
You're late
Sorry
(handing him the shotgun) Don't fall asleep
(laying out his blanket) Right
- 1ST '  - Greer lies asleep on the bed
But his sleep is fitful, increasingly agitated, tormented
It is as if he tries to speak, but cannot
As     , his words are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start
-  - Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when Dodge wakes
It is "Daisy" playing on a music box somewhere in the ship
-  -   - Dodge moves along as the
- / -   - Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another passageway
He approaches from the other end
He passes the open doors of stateroom after stateroom
The
It stops
He holds there in the darkness
He turns, shining his light back down the passageway
beat
It is silent, when the He raises his radio
But no one says anything, the , a discernible presence on the other end
Dodge
'  - as he can be seen from the other end of the passageway
He gets no response, then presses the talk button
This is Dodge
Over
He is answered by silence, the   , : "Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster to the crow
"Where are you now know but won't say so
" Dodge hits the talk button
Who is this
The   , but only silence comes back
Identify yourself, motherfucker
'  - as he can be seen from the far end of the passageway
Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then: Penny whistle toy
Penny whistle toy
as he listens
Penny whistle toy
Penny whistle toy -- Dodge senses something behind him
He turns, and before he can draw a breath to shout, , his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle of light
As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in frame as the radio falls a few feet away
beat
The shotgun muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing pulls it away
- grey overcast stretches to the horizon
-  - Murphy comes out onto the deck
Dodge is nowhere to be seen
Dodge
-    - Epps shines her light on something
Check it out
Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods
They are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s
Greer takes one
don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now
Better than starving to death
Epps' radio
Murphy to Epps
(raising the radio) Epps, over
Either of you seen Dodge
She looks to Greer who shakes his head
Nope
He's not on deck and  can't raise him on the radio
-  -  - Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it
blanket, a pillow and a plastic jug of water are all that remain
He took the shotgun and a light
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out
beat as they hold there
Alright
We stay together
Nobody goes any further than earshot

Murphy to Dodge
Over

Murphy to Dodge
Do you copy

You there
Right here
As he moves along as well, eyes open
Greer
As Greer moves along too
Yeah, yeah
-   -  - Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across bulkheads when a     somewhere
She holds there, listening
It is echoey, distant
Murphy
No response as Epps holds there
The   , far off, unintelligible
It stops
She moves on, shinning her light
-   -   - Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight before her, when the
Epps stops, holding there in the silence
She reaches for her radio
The
Epps turns to pinpoint it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space
-   -   - Epps passes under a catwalk
She moves on, passing a row of standpipes
Epps stops, listening
Somewhere, the , then stops
It is absolutely silent
In the darkness behind her, the ()
Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with a start
Sorry
Didn't mean to scare you
She holds there a beat, looking around
You okay
Yeah
Fine
just thought  heard something is all
What
Nothing
Let's get outa here
They start to leave, when Epps notices something
She stops
Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the darkness
Epps steps forward, crossing to it
Greer follows
As Epps approaches, Greer behind her
The light is dim and low to the deck
She stops
As Epps starts toward it again
She and Greer come up to it, stopping there
She kneels, the dim glow shining on her
She reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still on
She turns it off, standing
She shines her light into the darkness and starts off, Greer following
-   -   - Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight
It is Dodge's radio
They stop over it
Epps picks it up, inspecting it
She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek
It begins to run, a crimson tear
She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to see that it is blood
She looks to Greer
They both look up to see, hanging suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them from the darkness
He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging limp beside it
-   -  - Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides it to the deck
They stand looking on at it a moment
Can't find the shotgun
So whoever did this now has our shotgun
Doesn't look like it much matters
What do we do with him
Leave him till we can get some help
(a beat) From now on, nobody comes down here
What about the gold
Leave it
Now hold up just a minute
Let's be reasonable here
You think whoever did this is reasonable
All 'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was
can't believe you
Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share
didn't sign up to go home empty handed
And  sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now
Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it
(a beat) You can do what you want, Greer
But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that
Fine with me
-  - Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight
She moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where Greer was found, room 400
She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating
She opens it
-  -  - The door comes open and Epps steps in
It is dark, though spacious
It is divided into two rooms
Beyond the sitting room in the front, is a bedroom
Epps steps in
dressing table sits against the far wall
large bed is unmade
Suitcases lie open on stands at the foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the process of being unpacked
From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse
The other contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear
Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on an Ottoman in the corner
Epps crosses to it
She finds a few shirts, and a red print dress, some books
She takes one of the books, opening it
Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols
" page is marked with a purple ribbon
She opens it to see a children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle doo,' said the rooster to the crow
'Where are you now know, but won't say so
'" She puts it down
tin penny whistle sits on the table
She picks it up, examining it
She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, Epps holds on this picture, when
She looks up to the dressing table
On it a music box slowly plays "Daisy
" Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly winds down, then finally stops
beat
She picks it up, looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there
beat
The dirty white light falling into the room through the windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot see
His expression is empty, hollow
Greer
He does not hear her as he stands there
She approaches, stepping up
You okay
Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly turns to see her
long beat as she looks back
He holds there, the same empty look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes hard
She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his wrists, fighting him
Greer
His grip tightens
He is much stronger and her efforts make little difference
Let go
She hangs on, starting to choke
She drops one hand, searching with it
Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska getofedobrodijotosiantosg
He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still choking her
He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe the rest of the way
Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a basket, some books
It comes to a brass desk lamp
It falls, a little out of reach
She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles her
Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it
She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting with Greer's head
He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks
She fumbles her radio up
(into radio) Murphy
'm on  deck, cabin 400
Get down here now
Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again
She throws down the radio
bed stands between them
She feints right, then left
He's dazed and has blood in his eyes
She manages to slip by, but he dives, taking her down
He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around
He raises a fist to ram into her face when
Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch and he comes up
He grabs her face, striking her with his other hand
She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the head
He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across the floor
She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and bleeding
He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his waist to do God knows what
Epps looks around to see him approaching
And we see that she has unhinged her gill knife
As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through his foot and into the floor
He
After a moment he stops, looks to her
He is a bloody, wretched, enraged mess
He starts toward her as Murphy appears in the doorway
Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from behind at full speed, knocking him down
Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her feet
She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over Greer, bringing it down on his head
-  -  - Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body
-   -  - Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium
He stops at the bottom, now starting to come to
Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on
She puts a steel pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened
-   -  - Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral
He sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language
(
) Must've been him all along
Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade
Smashed the radio
Scuttled the boat
Killed Dodge
Would've killed you
He's off his nut, no doubt there
They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs
What do you think
Could be a stroke
Who knows
(a beat) The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves
"Like wild dogs
" Over the gold
Maybe it was more than that
Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them
He presses his face to the glass
They went crazy
Crazy with greed
Not crazy
Not like him
beat as Epps looks off
In the window Greer drags his hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his wounds smearing in broad red streaks
-   - partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame
Epps and Murphy stand over it
We lash a few of these together it might get us far enough into the shipping lanes to be rescued
beat as they look on at the rotting hull
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water
If the weather holds it might not be so bad
It's not the weather 'm worried about
The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat
-   - Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into a single usable raft
-   - Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white light from the skylight falling on him from above
-   - Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making her way into the darkness, when her radio
The channel remains silent a moment, then closes
She stops, raises the radio
(holding down talk button) Murphy
She waits, holding there as only silence comes back
Murphy, this is Epps
Do you copy
Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the channel opens again
No one speaks, though there is a palpable presence on the other end
(raising the radio) Who is this
The channel opens again, only silence returning
The sound of the     , "" -  -   - Epps walks along in the darkness She comes to the end of the corridor, stopping there
At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400
The     , leaving in its absence the -  -   - Epps approaches the other end, from where the  , coming to a stop at room 400
beat as she holds there
-  400 -  - Epps steps in as
The sitting room is dark as she holds there
After a moment, she continues on, coming to the bedroom
Epps steps in
Across the room the
She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio The channel remains silent a moment, then: "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the crow
Where are you now know but won't say so
" She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find the book of nursery rhymes
She opens it to the nursery rhyme "The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the page, when the radio
Penny whistle toy
Penny whistle toy
Penny whistle toy
Penny whistle toy
On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier
She takes it, holding on it a moment
She raises it and as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows a -    -     across the room
"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the crow
Where are you now know but won't say so
" On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the photo plays the penny whistle
She is sitting on the floor with the  who reads from the book we saw earlier
"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the crow
Where are you now know but won't say so
" Cassandra, if you insist on playing that while read 'll just stop right now
Sorry
The room is warm with light, restored to its original condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, no longer holding the whistle
man, the  from the photos, steps from the bathroom wearing a new coat
What do you think
He certainly did shorten it, didn't he
thought this was all the rage
Maybe last year
Katie joins them from the outer room
What about this year
It's not your color anyway
like it, daddy
Well thank you
Daddy, how much longer before we start moving again
They're working on the engines, honey
As soon as they fix them we'll be on our way
-  -   - Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway
It is lit with sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their original condition as Epps stands there
She moves along
-  -   - Epps walks in the passageway
Doors are open and she looks in to see people doing various things, some packing and putting their things in order
-  -   - Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three fighting with a fourth  in a tuxedo
They lift him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and protests
She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into -   -  - Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the galley
group of  stand around at the other end and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen among them
They are four men, , swaying gently from the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their neck, dead
Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other end
-  -   - commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway as Epps keeps moving
, and is cut off when a door slams shut
The , as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere As she walks, she passes an open door where several fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering the contents
-  -   - Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a takes money from a wallet
The steward looks up, reaches over and slams the door shut
She continues on
Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 400
She stops
, coming from inside
-  400 -  - Epps steps in as the
She crosses the sitting room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several , some in stewards attire, others wearing ships officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners
The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs
And, from between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, the bed rocking, the others looking on
Epps turns to see the father
He is on his knees, hands tied behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of the bed
' a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her feet
When she looks up again she sees what the father sees
The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman
Another of the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, but Katie
The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of the other mutineers steps up to Epps
You like that, daddy
'll show you something else now
The mutineer steps back to the bed
He sits Katie down so that she faces us on the end of the bed
He raises an axe over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling blur -- (
) The     standing on the other side of the room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned state
It isn't real
Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where she stands
Many bad things have happened here
But you mustn't allow the evil inside
tell you this because you can see me
The others can't
But you must leave
You must leave
When Epps turns back Katie is gone
-  -   - Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio
Epps to Murphy
Only
Epps to Murphy
Only     as she rounds the corner out onto the promenade
At the other end, the aquarium can be seen
As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty
Greer is nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken out
rocks the ship follows it
-  - The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across
The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a mine field for a drifting ship
-  -   - Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas duffle
What happened
We hit land
What
We're in an island chain
It's only a matter of time before we hit another one
Greer's gone
He broke out of the tank
-  -   - Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another shudders the ship and the    follows
-  - The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull precariously
-  -  - Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship
As they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the passage some distance down
Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face down in the passage
They step up
Epps kneels as Murphy looks on
She rolls the body over
It is Greer, dead
He's been shot
Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes
Let's get the hell out of here
- / -   - Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors
-   -  - As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft
It should be enough to get us to one of those islands
Gimme a hand, wouldya
She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to the rail
Prop it here
We need to pull these braces off
There's a hammer on the stand
There
Epps crosses back to the stands
Epps kneels
No hammer
She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge had when he died
beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it
'll take that
beat as she looks to Murphy
It was you
He only looks back at her as she stands there
You killed them
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody
(a beat) You saw it coming as well as  did
Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat
And Greer too, except he went nuts
Couldn't take it,  guess
Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage
But did it make him any less dangerous
don't think so
So you killed them
The way  figure it, it was them or me
thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch
Bought a little time
Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around
But it's just us on this ship
Us and your
spirit friends
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it
didn't want it to turn out this way
Murphy, don't you see what's happening
think  see it pretty well
It's the ship
The ship's making you think this way
know a little bit about human nature and what 've seen only confirms that
It's a trap
There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold
Nobody ever does
It's just the bait
This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out
think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo
There's nothing supernatural about greed
And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple
don't give a damn about the gold
wish  could believe that
Either way, you know what 've done
've got no choice
He raises the shotgun
'm sorry
He prepares to fire, when a
Epps ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the vent behind her as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun again
Epps scrambles behind a deck vent
-  - The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek
-   -  - Murphy crosses toward the deck vent
There's no reason to make this any more difficult than it has to be
As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening
She pulls herself up and climbs inside
-   -  - Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its width
She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down where several vent ducts lead in different directions below it
-   -  - Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down
-   -  - Epps crawls through
She comes to a vent that leads out to a passageway
-  -  - Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready
-  -  - The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk
-  -  - The       and Murphy stops
-  -  - Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage
-  -  - Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck
-  -  - Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when something can be heard ahead of her
She stops
at the end of the passage
Epps pulls back into the shadows, holding there
The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the other end, when the
Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at the other end,     , as from a hatch slowly opening, can be heard
It stops
All is silent, at the other end
She begins moving toward it
As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship
behind her
She turns, just as Murphy steps into view
She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot ricochets off the metal around her
She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again
She swings down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck
Epps gets up, runs
Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks
-     -  - Epps moves quickly along
-     -  - Murphy follows, when
-     -  - Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking on at the massive hull rising above her as the Though it seems to resonate throughout the ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom
She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it becomes absolutely deafening
The ship begins to shudder
The steel bulkheads visibly move and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back and forth
-     -  - Murphy slows and finally stops
-     -  - few rivets pop in the hull
Then a few more, as the Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, when the
The rivets are springing out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate of the hull gives way, Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a -  - The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious rock promontory of a small island
-     -  - The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, water pouring in behind it
-  - The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a huge gash rising on its port side
-     -  - massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in through the breach
-     -  - Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end of the passage
He begins backing away
-     -  - Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already half way up the side, the ship listing -     -  - Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo compartment
-     -  - Epps comes up for air
clatter of all manner of debris, tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead as the ship eases over
boiler breaks loose of its stays
Epps looks up to see it coming right for her
She ducks under the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she was
Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and the bulkhead
-   -  - The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall
Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in his pockets
-   -  - Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her
The level of the water has now almost completely reached the deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks
-   -  - The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last ingot and makes his way for the exit
-   -  - Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck
She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the murky water
Several more forms appear
They are human, suspended in the water
As Epps looks, the several forms have become many
They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before
As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges
It is Katie
She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her hand from the other side
Epps raises her hand, taking it
The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she finds a way out
She takes her back further, coming to the breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water
Katie stops at the breach
Epps turns to her
She only looks back at Epps
Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the light of the surface
-   - Epps breaks through, gasping for air
She looks to see the Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully awash
-  -  - Murphy staggers through the flooded passage
-  - The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged and the stern beginning to rise
Epps sees another small island some distance off
She begins swimming toward it
-  -  - Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the top
-  - Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance
-  -  - river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with difficulty
-  - Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island
She pulls herself up
-   -  - Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top deck
He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft portion rising above him as the bow sinks
-  - Epps collapses on the rocks
-   -  - As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off
He bobs under momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty
The forward smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the current from the rushing water pulling him toward it
-  - Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher
-   -  - As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that pulls at Murphy
Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the smokestack's opening
The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of the stack
He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing water
-  - Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she goes down, when the
She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts and waves her arms
-  - The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time dropping a survival pack
The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical now, slipping further and further under
Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down
-   -  - The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the "" as the name comes to the water, then slips slowly beneath the surface
And   , to reveal that, beneath the surface, there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the ocean
