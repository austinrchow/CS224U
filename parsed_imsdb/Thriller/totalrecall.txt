- All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange sky
almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in "Gone with the Wind"

lower and lower until we see the terrain below
the desert
There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and odd-shaped rock formations
The air is filled with red dust, which alternately obscures and then reveals the image
optically - enlarging the film grain in the process
of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre rocks
Dust
Sound of wind

, but this time, in the distance are some enormous plastic domes
Sunlight striking them and reflect- ing causes brilliant rainbows
optically tracks toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion through the red dust

)  There are some large pyramids not far from the sphinx optically
is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front
It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move) towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems
As   one of the eyes, it appears to be stained red glass, as in a temple
Suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the camera

The   under him, as if in an earthquake
We cannot clearly make out his face, especially since he wears some kind of over a portion of it
The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material and red quartz, which glistens like crystal
The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear- fully, as he runs

- and his wife , are asleep in bed
Gradually the room lights
The   and begins  in a soft, feminine voice
(sweetly) Tick, tock, seven o'clock
Time to rise and open your eyes
They don't budge
Shortly, the clock  again
(continuing) Tick, tock, seven-oh-one
Time to get up, the day had begun
Quail's wife stirs
Maddeningly, the clock  a third time
(continuing) Tick, tock -- Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off
Then he sits up in bed
He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the edge of the bed
He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in thought
He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early thirties
He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is attractive and rather off-hand towards him
Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing for her slippers
dreamed about Mars again
it was bizarre, yet is was so real
(casual) It's your time of the month again
Quail looks at her quizzically
(continuing; world-weary air) At least once a month
Douglas Quail's obsession
For twelve years you've been talking about Mars
People do go to Mars, you know
That's right, Douglas
But not you
Not us
Quail looks crestfallen
(continuing; disdainful) As it is, we can barely scrape by on your lousy ten thousand a week
She leaves the room
He meditates on what she said, depressed
4
- Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast
On the  is projected the front page of a
Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring his wife
The newspaper headline reads:  " " His wife is reading a different article:  "Four Women Rape Man in Park
" (mumbling) What do they expect
the way men dress these days
then they scream rape
Quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesn't hear her
You know -- let's really do it
Rape men in the park
No
Go to Mars
(withering) Go to hell
We can pool our savings and 've got some sick leave coming, besides my regular vacation
(interrupting; corrects herself) more of a half-wit
For a start a war could break out there any day
She gestures toward the  screen where Martian police are keeping protesters behind a barrier
Some have signs reading "  ", "  ", " - " etc
That's just media talk
They're
(indicating the protesters) just a minority
They're powerless
Well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to Mars
We're broke
'm just a slave around this dump
Now if you were capable of finding a better job
The kitchen clock chimes and talks
It's now eight
You'll be late
'll be late
He jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and briefcase, kisses 's perfunctorily offered cheek and leaves
4A
- with Quail as he walks along the busy modern street towards a subway station
Modern cars (out of focus) pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail
There is a plaintive tune being played on violin
Quail pauses and gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on briskly
5
- Quail enters the station
Everybody must pass through a weapons check before proceeding to the platforms
stand at either side, as commuters pass through an electronic beam
On a screen, the entire body of each person is seen in -ray
All of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket
No weapon again, Mr
Quail
keep forgetting, Herb
They frighten me
Yeah
Well, it's the law, Mr
Quail
Has been since 1990 they tell me
Tomorrow - ya carry ya gun or ya get reported
gestures to his associate
They've obviously been through this with Quail before
Okay
Herb, okay
Quail walks on to the track area
The train arrives
Signs above each approaching car say " ", " 10 ", etc
Quail goes to a carriage marked " "
6
- The doors open and the crowd surges on
Quail grabs a seat
At intervals throughout the car are on which a   is showing
(
) -- more violence today from Mars's strike-torn ore colonies -- Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks instantly at the word "Mars
" The  is a young black man
(continuing) but Earth Intelligence Operations Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to Mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups
scene switches to a press conference
, sur- rounded by , steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones and cameras
Cohaagen is a striking, intense man with an obvious air of power
We're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics
Mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of Earth
and will remain so
The train stops at another station and more people pile on
Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the image
(
) There have been some criticisms, sir
have no further comment
The news conference ends and a bright looking young man comes on the screen
Quail continues to watch, though not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story
Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen
Good morning, commuters
This portion of your trip is brought to you by Rekall, Inc
Do you have a dream that never came true
Do you aspire - but only perspire
Has the great adventure passed you by
Then come to
, where what might have been will have been
For the memories of a lifetime
Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't seem to take it very seriously
He glances away as a card comes on the screen with 's numbers
6B
'  - Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive of a room
Numerous people are typing information onto the screens
Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful
He then types in a little more information, then pauses again
On the screen, a sentence types itself
Quail read it and continues
9
McCLANE'  -  - Scene opens on a  of McCLANE, a genial, bubbling, enthus- iastic man
McCLANE We're all dreamers, Douglas
But here at Rekall, dreams are our business
He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which they are seated appear to be in outer space
Countless stars glitter all around
Startlingly, a comet whizzes by
Quail is amazed
McClane grins and presses the button again
The scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral reef
Multi-colored fish swim around the chairs and desk
But
is the process really that effective
false memory
McCLANE (shaking his head; smiling) We prefer the term "extra- factual implant"
Your memory will be complete in every way
You will have gone to Mars
We guarantee that
Is it in any way dangerous
mean, the medical techniques
McCLANE Not when you deal with qualified operators - like us
He presses the button again and the normal office returns
Quail looks around, impressed
It's just - incredible
McCLANE And look at our follow-up program
He puts items on the desk as he talks
McCLANE (continuing) Space-flight ticket stub
passport
vaccination certificates
matchbooks from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine Restaurants, souvenirs, post cards
even names of people you met - now back there - who you can call and discuss your trip with
by the way, we plant these things where you'll come across them at random in the future
But
'll know  hired you
That'll destroy the whole illusion
McCLANE (smiling; self- satisfied) But you won't remember me, or having been here
won't
McCLANE Your money back if you do
We've never paid out yet
Quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed
McCLANE (continuing) And we have a special this month, for only two-hundred thousand dollars more
At the press of a button, a list appears on the wall
A14 A15 A16 A17 McCLANE (continuing) You can have a new identity for the duration of the trip
Pick one
Quail's eyes linger on "Intelligence Agent
" "Intelligence Agent"
wouldn't that be dangerous
might attack
McCLANE (airily) No
No
You're a retired agent
Mars was your last mission and you're never to break your cover
But you'll have got the girl, killed the baddies, and saved the Universe
Not bad, eh
don't know
about the whole thing
it's all such a fake
won't really have gone
won't really
McCLANE (kind but firm) Let's face it, Douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to Mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for
This - - is the only way to achieve your dream
He gets up and walks around to Quail's chair
McCLANE (continuing) Think about it, Douglas
Think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is
Lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather
Rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories
Quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced
9A
'  - Quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern chair
Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on She casually lights a cigarette
You know that's illegal
Yeah
Who's going to report me
You
wimp
She watches a torrid love scene on the video
(continuing) Screwing around's illegal, too
But just give me half a chance
Quail looks at her with distaste
His expression changes to one of resolve
10
- Quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type smock
In the b
g
hovers a , adjusting some instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc
) -- that apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail
The room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting
Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the dentist's, looking at the drills
The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking , wearing a
(  -
) Hi, 'm Doctor Sophie Lull
Sorry 'm late
(walks toward coat closet) 'll be right with you
She dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging suit, then slings on heavy, lead-lined protective vest
(looking at instrument console) This really going to work
It the Pope Martian
Lull's assistant, the  in b
g
, who had been steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over at Lull
() (at machine) Okay -- that's it
Now, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle attached to it
Quail eyes it warily
She swabs the back of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension
Now, just relax, kid
This ain't gonna hurt
Just a controlled drip of Narkadine
When you're under, 'll just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish-fulfillment program to your needs
She injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes it down
(continuing) See
Painless
didn't feel a thing
Hey, you're a nice kid
you like a little somethin' extra
Quail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods
(continuing; pleased) Good
Kid -- have  got a girl for you
She's gonna like you
You're good-lookin'
(beat) Gettin' sleepy
(he nods) Good
Now, what's the first thing you think of when you're thinkin' about Mars
(wistfully) Well
'd like to see the Martian Sphinx
Okay -- you will, Dougle want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me
(sleepily) One hundred
ninety-nine
ninety-eight
ninety-seven
ninety-six
ninety-five
His voice drops off; his eyes close
Lull studies him, adjusts some instruments, then turns to Ernie, glancing briefly at a typed sheet in front of her
Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars; number sixty-two
and throw in that blonde
We'll give him a real good time
Sixty-two
and
the blonde
He takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine
Boy, is this one wild
He won't want to come back
Ernie inserts the second disk
Dougie
This Sophie Lull
Can ya hear me
Sophie
Good
'm gonna ask ya a few more questions now
Ya think you'll be able to answer 'em
Yes
Attaboy
To begin with, wanna ask ya; -- You sex life
How many orgasms a week
11
McCLANE'  - McClane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse objects and placing them on his desk
These items apparently are objects Rekall, Inc
intends to "plant" for some client of theirs to find (perhaps even Quail) -- as part of his fantasy
While he is putting these things on his desk, the He answers it
McCLANE Yes
(
) (filtered; tense) Howie
Listen, you'd better get in here
McCLANE (not too concerned) Not another schizoid embolism
(
) (filtered) You'd better get in here
12
- McClane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open
Lull and Ernie look up as he enters
Quail lies on the couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed
McClane looks queryingly at Lull, who motions him to silence
(bends over Quail) Quail
Dougie, can you hear me
Yes
Tell McClane what you told us
McClane glances sharply at Lull, then turns to Quail
Quail's eyes open and scan the room
They settle on McClane
These eyes have changed:  they have become cold and steely
In fact, Quail's entire personality seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint- edged hardness
He is chillingly menacing
(a deadly voice) All of you in this room are dead
McCLANE (not quite taking it seriously) What's he talking about
You've broken my cover
McCLANE What is this
McClane's eyes flash angrily at Lull
The Narkadine cracked a memory cap
Mars -- (she's scared) He's really been there
There is a chilly silence in the room as McClane digests this
McCLANE Forced suppression
With spontaneous breakthrough
McCLANE Holy shit
They stare at Quail as if he's a ticking bomb
(coldly) You've compromised the Sphinx Project
You'll have to be silenced
Now they're all panicked
McCLANE Wait a minute
Quail -- My name isn't Quail
McCLANE Listen
whoever you are
sir
(almost pleading) This is all an accident
We'll destroy all the records
No one will know
swear it
Believe me
believe you, but that won't stop
from killing you
The Rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror
(continuing) Killing you
killing you
killing you
His voice trails off, his eyes close
(intensely) He wants a false memory implanted -- of a trip he really took
(pause) Someone at Earth Intelligence Operations erased his memory
All he know was going to Mars meant something special to him
What do we do
Graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing
(shaking her head) Uh-uh
That could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip
McCLANE (overlapping) Revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here
Why don't we just wipe out the memory of his visit here
McCLANE (nodding; relieved) Yes
Good
'll destroy his file and cancel his fee
have a feeling that the longer he doesn't know who he is, where he's been, where he's going and who we are, the better off we'll all be
'm taking a holiday
real one
He leaves
The others stare after him, looking very grim
12A
- dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit door
An attractive , her bare breasts visible through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view Quail's progress
12B
- Quail travels down
Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at the city
12C
- Quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious to anything around him
red-headed man may or may not be watching him
He makes a phone call from a pocket phone
12D
- Scene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks around, slowly coming to his senses
Where am
Travelling south along Third Avenue, passing Fourty-third street
Although the driver's voice is a little mechanical (flat in tone) he is filmed from Quail's , and it isn't obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver
Where am  going
Thirty-three thirteen "" Street, Sector "", Twin Towers, Apartment six-thirty- five
How did  get here
Camera now cuts to a shot in front of the driver
He is a fairly human-like robot
don not understand the question, sir or madam
How did  get into this cab
You stepped into it in the normal manner, sir or madam
15
'  - The reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is smart and clean, though not lavish
uniformed and armed is standing by the entrance door
Filmed from the elevator end of the area, we see the cab pull up and Quail alight and enter the building
He nods to the doorman and approaches the elevators
As he reaches them a  steps out from behind the camera
2ND enters from a door opposite the elevators
Quail looks at them and becomes quite panicky
1ST Aren't you the man from Mars
He takes a modern, lethal gun from his pocket
Quail turns, but the other man is behind him
2ND Don't give us a reason to kill you
Quail looks toward the doorman, who is paying little attention to the events
As the two men edge Quail towards the door, he call out
Mr
Zimmer
Mr
Zimmer
help me
they're
But the doorman turns calmly away
16
- The two men lead Quail past a number of cars to their own vehicle
Where are you taking me
1ST You told everyone at Rekall about you trip to Mars
Where you went, who you worked for, what you did -- But  didn't
Are you telling me
did go to Mars don't remember
1ST You've remembered too much
The Sphinx Project, for a start
(confused; remembers only fragments) Sphinx
No, no,  don't, What about the people at Rekall
don't recall Rekall but you said if they know what  did
Why don't you ask them
They'll tell you  didn't
1ST They've been taken care of
What do you mean
Neither man bothers answering
They arrive at their car and open the door for Quail
He hesitates
(continuing) What are you going to do with me
1ST Get in the car
He slaps Quail hard across the face
Quail is terrified
He is tearful with fear
My God
No
You're going to kill me
He cringes
His hands across his face
1ST No one's going to kill you if [you do what you're told
] We're visiting
for some new tests
Now get in, or do we start playing rough
No
It's not my fault
You can't do it
They start to force him into the car physically
Suddenly, Quail stops cringing
the , and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression
(continuing) Wait a minute,  remember -- 1ST What, Quail
What do you remember
On Mars
they tried to kill me
And
In an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the windpipe, and they crumple to the ground
Quail steps back
He stares at the two bodies, incredulous; then stares at his own deadly
It is as though they belong to someone else
Then, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he races back into the basement door of his building
18
'  - Kirsten is watching another pornographic video when Quail bursts in
He is still disoriented
Did you know 've been to Mars
Kirsten gets up and turns off the movie
What
This stupid obsess
(interrupting) think 've been
vaguely recall
Doug, you've got to forget
(interrupting) Forget
Remembering is the problem  must've been to one of those artificial memory places
Oh my God
But something went wrong
something about a real memory
and then those men
tried to kill me
What men
Doug, you're crazy
She starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet
(continuing) You're here now
They didn't kill you
No
That's what's so amazing
killed them
think
Kirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply
Where
Where are they
Quail points down with his finger
(continuing) Doug
It's something they put into your mind at the memory place
Fantasies
That's their business
She sips her drink
(continuing) You're a computer operator
You're a bore
You're a wimp
You're not a killer
'm involved somehow with It's true
It's no fantasy
He walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting out the lights
Doug,  want you to see a doctor
Now Alec and Shirley Turnbull have a good man
He helped Alec through his breakdown
For fuck's sake, this is no breakdown
Kirsten is taken aback at his use of language
He strides into the bathroom and slams the door
She turns on one lamp, goes to a telephone and dials
19
- Quail takes a washcloth, turns the hot water up full and soaks the cloth under the steaming water
Using it as a compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to drain off some of the tension
He turns off the water
Towelling his head dry, he opens the bathroom door
The instant he does this, a blinding white comes arcing into the bathroom, and the back wall crinkles and  into a swatch of blackness
, just as   incinerates the spot where he was standing
20
- The only thing visible is the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains drawn over it
and his  cannot be seen -- but they can be There is the sound of a  -- the meaty of a     -- and a painful  as someone's breath whooshes out
The
Quail is standing with one hand on the lamp, and the other twisting 's arm up behind her back
pistol lies on the floor
Quail is totally stunned
He releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same time scooping up the pistol
My God
Did you say  need a psychiatrist
(coolly) haven't seen you move that fast since 've known you
(outraged) How could you do it
After eight years
'm not your wife, Quail
Not my wife
You are out of your mind
(indifferent; nursing her arm) It's a false memory implant
never saw you before six weeks ago
Quail is totally disoriented
Why are you lying like this
No, Quail
It's true
You work for
So do
As she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from behind it pulls out a small wallet
She flips it open to show him her
badge
He looks down uncomprehendingly at the holographic lettering "Earth Intelligence Organisation"
(indicating their surroundings) But why all of this
(shrugging) We had to watchdog you
make sure the erasure took
wife seemed like a good idea
But  remember it
All of it
Us
All implanted
Our friends
my work
eight years
The job's real -- you've had is six weeks -- since you got back from Mars
He sits down, holds his hand to his head
(continuing) It's all a fabrication, Quail
Everything you know
This is crazy
If all my memories are false, who am What am
Jesus
it's like  don't exist
You exist, all right
(very cold) That's the problem
pause as Quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to do next
Why did you try to kill me
Why does
want me dead
They don't particularly
That was my idea
This assignment was boring me to death
The personality they gave you wasn't too thrilling
Well, what did  do on Mars that they have to keep me from telling
've no idea
just work here
All right
'm leaving
Don't try and follow me -- don't have to follow you
You can't get away from
Nobody does
Quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time
No wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife -- type casting
He leaves
Kirsten smiles secretively
She goes to a drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks like a  channel-changer
There is a very small light on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as the instrument  begins to make
21
'  - Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his paces, trying not to look suspicious
After a beat, he heads for the nearest subway entrance
22
- Now underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other subway people
He heads toward the weapons check
23
- An   slams to a halt next to the subway entrance and a whole load of   pours out of it
24
- Quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting to get through the
He tries to control his nervousness
He passes
The guard smiles at him, pleased to see he has remembered his gun
25
- All the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway stairs
The   and   are stunned to see four large men brandishing guns push their way through the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them
One gunman flashes a      at them
The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer to the subway train, which is just departing
The men halt abruptly
Fuck it
The second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver - in his ear
( ) We won't be able to track him again until he comes up above ground
26
- Quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the night, not knowing exactly where he will go
He is confused, distraught
commercial comes onto the video
Tired
Exhausted
Need a vacation
Don't settle for memories, experience the real thing
Daily departures on the space shuttle to Mars
Visit the wonders of
27
- Quail emerges from underground and looks around
The streets are almost deserted
28
- The one with the ear plug [suddenly talks
] Coming in again
Loud and clear
He looks down at an illuminated street map built into the car's dashboard
28A
- cab comes into view
Quail quickly hails it and jumps in
Cab moves off
28B
- Quail is still pondering what to do next
He glances out one window, though not at anything in particular
Suddenly, the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window on the other side
Quail ducks to the floor
28C
- wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle
He is aiming at the tires and driver, rather than directly at Quail
28D
- Bullets are still pouring in
(unemotionally) You are being fired on, sir or madam, please leave the cab at once
From the floor, Quail pushes the door handle and rolls out onto the street
The pursuing car occupants fail to notice his exit
28E
- Cars continue, as Quail picks himself up from the gutter and moves off down a narrow side street
28F
- [Please
] Bullets rip into the robot driver's neck, severing the head from the body
The head hits the window then bounces back onto the front seat
It continues talking
(continuing) leave the cab as bullets are hitting the vehicle in considerable quantities
28G
- The taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display window of a store
Clothes models are scattered and broken
When the noise abates, the severed head of the robot driver is lying among the dummies
This company, sir or madam, will institute legal action for damages
29
- "   "  - Quail emerges from the side street and sees "End of the Line" Hotel
It is clean, bland, middle class
He quickly crosses the road and enters
29A
"   "   - The foyer is brightly lit and empty
Quail approaches the , who is reading a book
"Dr
No", marked, in flowing script, "from the classic series"
(without looking up) Help you, sir
(handing over money) room for the night
(reluctantly putting down the book) (handing over money) Here's ten thousand
Forget the
looks up at him, with interest
His hand hovers over the money
(continuing) have a liaison with a lady
and 'm married
understand, sir
Nothing like a bit on the side, eh
Bit of fugitive flesh
The greatest aphrodisiac is a new body, wouldn't you say, sir
Quail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to be given the key to his room
He says nothing
30
"   "   - Quail unlocks the door and enters
No sooner does he relock the door then
He freezes, stares at it for three rings, then picks it up
(into receiver) told you,  don't want to be disturbed
(filtered) If you want to live, don't hand up
Quail is stunned
He says nothing, but doesn't hang up
(continuing; filtered) They've got you bugged
They're gonna find you
Faster than you can say "Back Rodgers"
(quickly) And don't bother shaking down your clothes -- the monitor is embedded in your skull
(reeling) Who are you
What the hell is this
30A
- The man telephoning Quail is calling from a bar
Occasion- ally people pass him on their way to the toilets
He is youngish and conservatively dressed
He speaks rapidly and urgently
Take a wet towel and wrap it around your head
That will deaden the signal
It'll take longer for them to pinpoint you
30B      '  - Why should  trust you
(filtered) There's a real old saying - "Beggars can't be choosers"
Go and soak your head
Quail puts the phone down and rushes to the bathroom
30B1
- The earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal generated by Quail's bug
Suddenly, the small illuminated cross on the dashboard map cuts out
Shit
Cut the language, will ya
It's gone
Some
malfunction
Unscientifically, he prod the screen
(world-weary air) Toldya the Martian assembled [stuff don't work
] 30B2
'  - Quail rushes back into the room with a wet towel, turban-like, wrapped around his head
He rapidly picks up the phone
Keep talking
(filtered) Head over to Skid Row -- to the Lucky Stub Pawnshop -- corner of Park Avenue and Fifty-eighth
Tell the man you're Mr
Hotchkiss; you came for your Grecian candlesticks
(infuriated) What do  want with Grecian candlesticks
30C
- The man on the phone looks around anxiously
Just do it
This is no time for small talk
(
) (filtered; not quite convinced) How did you know where to find me
've been tailing you since you get back from Mars
30D
'  - You're
You're on the other team
(filtered) 'm
But  was your best friend
Scott Stevens - we arranged this
(trying to recall) can't remember - only bits
(filtered; overlapping) was your fail-safe -- if and when the shooting started
Good luck
Look me up if you remember me
30E
- Scott Stevens hangs up the phone
He looks around cautiously, then walks a few steps to the mens room
30F
- Scott Stevens walks to the row of troughs and begins to urinate
The room is empty
He hears a noise and looks around
Two  men are standing there aiming lethal-looking high-velocity weapons at him
One of them is the red-headed man we've already seen
1ST  (-) Well, look at that
He's really got his hands full
2ND Not so full, so 've heard
Still urinating, the frustrated Scott Stevens can only look back over his shoulder
Laughing, both men open fire, riddling him with bullets
He collapses in an undignified heap, his head in the water at the base of the trough
31
"   "  - Quail, with towel around his head, glances up and down the corridor -- spots a sign that says " "
He races towards it
32
"   "   - The  slams up in front of the hotel and a carload of tear out of it and barge into the hotel
32A
"   "   - The startled clerk jumps to his feet as the group of armed men enter rapidly
Quick
The guy who checked in fifteen minutes ago
(nervous) Room
thirty-six
Most of the armed men instantly head off up the stairs, their weapons at the ready
Clerk watches, astonished
(continuing) He was only meeting a lady
Aren't you guys overdoing it a bit
32B
- Quail is walking along briskly, still with the towel around his head
few passers-by look at him curiously
He puts his hand together and greets them Indian-style
33
-  - which reads: "  / 58TH "
to reveal "The Lucky Stub Pawnshop" lurk on the corner
Park Avenue has deteriorated into a slum
, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping over a  in a doorway
34
- Quail is just entering; an old-fashioned  overhead, tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance
At once, an immense   emerges from the back room
You wanta camera
got some good, top-quality ones
You want silk rugs
Handmade last century in Iran
all perfect
You want videos
Old movies
classics
all those Vietnam war ones
real quaint stuff
you want
(interrupting; awkwardly) 'm Hotchkiss
came for the
Grecian candlesticks
The Fat Man studies him warily for a long moment; then he disappears through the curtain
In a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small, "makeup-sized" case, as well as two large candelabra
The Pawnbroker puts the case on the counter
Quail looks at the case with curiosity
(continuing) wonder if you could tell me
They both look around as someone enters
trust these will look well in you
mosque
35
-  - Opening up the small case
to reveal they are Quail's hands
The hotel room he's now in is obviously a different one than the last one we saw him in
The room is large but run-down, the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older, etc
Quail examines the contents of the case:  there are and also , several stacks of bills, neatly tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of it red
On the face of it is printed:  "  "
(mutters) Martian money
Quail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to himself as he sees how much there is
Also in the case are:   ;  a small ;  a rolled-up   and a spray can of some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver mask
He examines the face mask, studies (which we are not close enough to read) and then puts it aside
Another item now catches  his eye:  a wristwatch
He sees a conspicuous red button on the side of the watch, and
, , :  he's an    of Quail -- down to the clothes Quail is wearing now
The image stands and watches Quail
(continuing) What the hell
Quail smiles, presses the red button again
There is a -- and the man     -- like a television set being turned off
Quail looks bemused
Now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside
There he finds what look like  ;  a sponge, a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments and a tiny   on one end, and some tubes of salve
He turns on the cassette recorder
The  he hears on the cassette  is
(
) (Quail's voice) "Hauser, this is Hauser -- or whatever you think your name is now
If you're listening to this, 'm talking to myself
Your memory's been erased and you've got a wet towel around your head
(he does) "The first thing you've got to do is get rid of that bug in your head
" 36
- The sound of the tape continues as Quail follows instructions - pushing the wire up into a bloody portion of his neck, just below the ear
(
) The monitoring device is located in your left maxillary sinus cavity
Make a small incision in your neck just below the left ear, and insert the wire up into the sinus
The head is self-guiding
Just shove
Quail makes a face
(
) (continuing) You won't feel a thing
The spray cartridge contains a local anesthetic and a blood coagulant
Careful, it's my neck, too
Holding the wet towel against his neck, Quail slowly withdraws the wire
On the end of it is a tiny, metal bead, the Transmitter
37
- The man with the ear plug suddenly reacts
It's come on again
Where
The 1st man quickly check the map-grid in the dashboard
small bright 'x' is flashing
He's in that old flophouse
Plaza Hotel
Central Park South
37A
- Quail is anxious to get rid of the transmitter
He looks around and notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the skirting board
He carefully - avoiding springing the trap - removes the piece of cheese and pushes the transmitter inside
He then throws the cheese into the rat hole
38
- The car is moving swiftly through the streets
Boy, he's really moving around
of the screen shows the small 'x' moving in circles
38A
- The car pulls up
Another follows it
Armed men leap out from both
The   indicates they should go down an alley at the side of a service door
They advance cautiously, guns at the ready
They see no one
The   indicates another, even narrower, alley leading off to one side
Two of the men sneak cautiously up to it, their guns at the ready
large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage bins
Furious, they fire
The bullets rip the bins to shreds, scattering refuse everywhere
The rat is killed
They all stare in disbelief
Ya dirty rat
40
-   - on a   slated "/" followed by a serial number and some dates
The slate vanishes, replaced by a scene of Quail -- undergoing some
to  , all depicting Quail in other action scenes -- on some kind of mission, driving a car, etc
man the monitors, scrolling through them in fast-forward and fast reverse as if searching files
The technicians turn as Cohaagen and his aides enter
(demands) Anything
We're running every one of his memory tapes for the past fifteen years
Nothing yet, sir
There must be something -- some place he would go, some friend he would run to
The red-haired
man joins them
- (to Cohaagen; quietly) They lost him
Again
The red-headed man nods
(continuing) Are you sure the original suppression took
Absolutely, sir
He thinks he's Quail, a computer
(interrupting) Then how do you explain what he's doing
Just his instincts
He was well trained by
Maybe the memory cap's fractured
Portions of his prior identity could be leaking through
(very anxious) He'll remember Mars
The Sphinx Project
Fragments
Nothing more
Nothing he could piece together
did advise terminating him, rather than implanting an identify alternative
What do you think  am barbarian
We're not living in the twentieth century
He looks at the video screen again
An image has flashed onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl
(continuing) Hold it there
He studies the picture, which changes to show the same girl from different angles

- Passengers are boarding a
In addition to the  checking their tickets, there are two   checking every passenger
They carry some kind of small, portable   that they shine in the face of each passenger going through
(It gives off a   and
) The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials, government people, etc
There is also a large tour group consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags
They are being marshaled by an harassed  , who is carrying aloft a hand-painted sign
"  "
The last of the passengers board the spacecraft
The chief   nods to an official and the door begins to close
#1 If he had to travel to Mars with that bunch, 'd be sorry for him
#2 We couldn't have missed him
#1 No way
Let's get a coffee before the next shuttle
43
- One of the  -- a middle-aged  - unbuckles her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her handbag, and some clothes on a hanger
44
- The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror
She opens her bag, takes out a spray container, with it, and takes out -- the    we saw in Quail's emergency kit
She holds the mask to her face
There is a , and  rises from behind the mask
She lowers the mask
Her face is now that of
He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute
He reaches inside his dress, starts to  his "
" We can read the   written across it now: " "
45
- Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the ebullient tour crowd
He turns and looks in the other direction and sees a video theater advertising " 36" with Sylvester Stallone , Jnr
He isn't too excited, but heads towards it
He pauses a little when an announcement comes over the intercom
sounds, followed by
Quail looks up
'  (
) Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll glance out the starboard viewports, you'll behold an indeed awesome sight -- Quail goes to a viewport and , transfixed
He is seeing
at last
the object of his obsession
46
- The  -- which we have deliberately not seen before this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly bringing into view --
-- so close it looks like it's going to fall on us
It dwarfs the spaceliner
'  (
) Those long gorges you see, clearly are the legendary canals of Mars
The liner drops toward the surface of Mars
Below:  a crisscross the planet
'  (
) (continuing) Of course, they are not manmade canals, but vast natural chasms many deeper and larger than the Grand Canyon
Though utterly without moisture now, scientists have determined that they were formed by massive flooding millions of years ago
47 Quail stares, his brow furrowing as if with some deep hidden memory he can't quite recall
'  (
) (continuing) Surface temperatures at the Martian equator is minus one-hundred and twenty degrees Centigrade -- in winter
Fortunately, this time of year it's slightly more seasonable: Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit, outside the domes
(beat) Please remember, folks, that outside the domes you'll need to carry your own personal oxygen supply at all times
The atmosphere of Mars is almost a vacuum
Thank you for flying with Interstellar and we hope your stay will be a pleasant one
48
- follows the spaceliner until the   is filled with the - sands of
49
- An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under a red-orange sky
The desert is cut by a , which snakes across the rocky terrain
Some surface  moves along the road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the - In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten , its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage
Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with a tough town carved out of the wilderness
50
- Quail is looking out at the desolate landscape
The , an amiable middle-aged man sits beside him
It is possible he is not a married man
It's no Garden of Eden
No
Quite a bit to see, though
The canyons, the old Sphinx
What do you know about that
Not much, really
Millions of years old
Bit like the one that used to be in Egypt, you know
Yeah
Got destroyed in the Arab wars
What about this independence movement
(dismissive) Not worth worrying about
Mostly descendants of the original colonists from Earth
Now they want self-rule so they can sell us all the minerals
don't think we've met
You with our group
Takes me a while to know everyone
Sure
Douglas Quail
Richard Toltz
(they shake hands) Well, Doug,  hope we'll see a lot more of each other
55
(  ) - The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel
The buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised, temporary look
Most are pre-fabricated structures
The streets are crowded and there is a "frontier-town" atmosphere
Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water and air containers
lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the dome
Some small, ragged boys look at  as he looks around before going inside the hotel
Suddenly, one of them throws a small sack at him
It hits his chest and leaves a yellow stain
The hotel  chases the boys away
Smogpsucker
From the other side of the street, a gang of  with a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant You know how it is, sir
Some of these red-asses are a bit prejudiced
Prejudiced
Against what
Earthmen
The street song has swelled, adult  and joining the belligerent chorus
What are they singing
The Martian National Anthem
Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel
57
- Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand looks up at Quail
Quail walks past, enters the main lobby
The atrium entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the dirty, Casbah-like streets
-  in spotless linen fill the lobby
Quail stops to examine a large   sitting on a table in the middle of the lobby
It is a stand-up model of a
Across the top is written " "
recorded  repeats a canned speech -- "
the Martian Sphinx
only evidence of non-human civilization ever discovered age estimated at over eighteen million years
- He stares at Quail
Quail approaches the Registration Desk
Nice to have you back with us, Mr
Hauser
Quail is startled to be recognized -- particularly by this name
He tries to stay casual
Nice to be back
(pick up pen) 'm flattered you remember me
Part of my job, sir
(starts to sign; hesitates) Do you remember my first name, too
Charles
Charles Hauser, right
'm impressed
(now he signs) Listen
need transportation to the
uh
the Sphinx
Can you arrange it for me
'm sorry, sir
But Earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely
No one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles
The Clerk taps a few keys on a computer
Oh
(spots something on the computer) Do you want the item you left with us
What item
Oh
yes, please
The Clerk turns to the safe, retrieves an envelope
He hands it -- and an    -- to Quail
58
-   - Far in the distance, a dusty red structure squats amid barren dunes
We see vehicles, scaffolding, a fortified perimeter
59
'   - Quail stands at the window, looking through binoculars
He lowers them irritably, tosses them on the bed
Quail tugs the envelope from his pocket, tears it open
Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written in longhand: " Last Chance Air Station Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9" 60
- It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly beauty
The sun is bold and blood red;  the foggy, drip- ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors
Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand
Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine Boy
He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing Quail
As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is approached by an amiable-looking   wearing a West Indian shirt and bright straw hat
() Need a cab, boss mon
Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol
(continuing) Mine's right around the corner
(indicating first cab in line) That one's closer
But  out-hustle him, right
(smiling) Right
exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar car
62
-   - An   whooshes open underneath a Checker Cab sign
Bennie and Quail emerge in the solar-powered car -- set off into the desert
63
- The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed a few hours ago
Only now is looks completely different
The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting
68
- Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in the middle of the desert
There's a cafe, repair facilities and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign: "      -     "
Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks
In the lot is a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:  huge ore trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps, Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies
Quail and Bennie disembark, wear- ing breathing masks, and enter the main building
69
- The joint is a combination saloon/cathouse/casino
There are slot machines, ,  and ; it is like a Nevada brothel -- packed with wild and woolly indi- vidualists, the equivalent of Old West trappers, prospectors and cowboys -- but with a space-age look
Quail and Bennie elbow their way to the bar
Fragments of conversation are overheard
#1 if that intergalactic little Napoleon thinks 'm sellin' and clearin' outta here, he can think again
#2 (with a laugh) watcha gonna do when he cuts off the air, Luke
#3 you'll be breathin' red dust and shittin' bricks
Bennie and Quail pass another group
#4 my wife ain't goin' on one of those space shuttles
she hates flyin'
#5 aw, come on
flyin's safer'n crossin' the road
#6 yeah, there ain't been a real disaster since that collision off Phobos, nigh on twenty years ago
#4 (alarmed) well, that killed twelve thousand
What is this, Bennie
Tombstone
Sorta
Bunch of miners out here got their own claims, from way back
Cohaagen's buyin' em all up, says he's gonna cut off the air an' water if they won't sell
Quail attracts the attention of the
'm looking for Melina Noel
You've found her
His nod indicates an area behind Quail
He turns to see an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables
She doesn't notice Quail
He walks toward her through the crowd
Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away
turns to return to the bar and runs straight into Quail
She stops, obviously astonished to see him
You bastard
Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by swinging doors
There are no occupants and it is almost in darkness
Quail, bewildered, follows her
Inside the billiard room he turns on the lights which illuminates the area of the table
(:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors
) Melina is still fighting back tears
Quail stops in front of her, unsure about what to do
He has no recollection of how well he might have known this woman
Suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face
(quietly) You bastard
He rubs his painful cheek
(continuing) That's new -- the innocent look
(bitter sarcasm) You didn't have that one before
(beat) Well
Quail is speechless
Well, uh
All right, 'll say it for you
He looks relieved (but tries to cover)
(continuing) Don't worry
got the note
You discharged your obligation
What note
Oh, the usual one
"Must return immediately to Earth
the wife needs me
" don't have a wife
Well, do - but not a real wife
(getting desperate) Hell
look
someone else sent that note
Someone who -- What are you here for
For you
don't even know why -- Melina bursts into tears
Quail rather tentatively puts his arms around her
She welcomes this at first, but then pushes him away
(continuing) Whoever  was,  must have been a helluva guy
"Whoever you were"
Listen
've for to tell  you something
beg you to believe me
help me -- All Melina's suspicions come rushing back
(continuing) Something happened to my mind
Memory suppression, false implant,  don't know what -- Melina backs off
Quail grows more desperate
(continuing) What 'm saying is
don't remember you
don't remember us
don't remember me -- Melina's expression grows dead hard
[And  thought
] Who is us
(ignoring the question) Memory erasure is what they use on agents
Go away
Wait
was an agent -- 'm not now -- just tell me who am
How did we know each other
Why are they trying to kill me
He takes a step toward her, nearly frantic
'm not trusting you again
You loved me once, you must have -- That you was a liar
Who you are now  don't even know
Please, Melina -- (tears starting) Get out
need your help -- (crying quietly) Get out
Get the hell away from me
Quail gives up; goes through the doors and leaves
Melina slumps her shoulder against the table and cries
77
- Quail enters from the cafe
Bennie is kneeling beside his taxi, repairing a tire
He look up, sees Quail approach
On his right hand, Bennie has a mechanical device capable of spinning 360 degrees
He uses it to twirl a lug nut tight on his tire
As Quail approaches, Bennie removes the   from his , tosses it into a kit beside the taxi
You don't look so good, boss
All over the Universe, women is an awful curse
He opens the door for Quail, beams
80
-  -  -  - Quail still broods, Bennie tries to cheer him up
It's a tough planet, boss
Yeah, right
Some guy really screwed her - screwed her up real good
Some Earthman
Just hopped on a space shuttle
Bennie bright tone isn't improving Quail's mood
Listen, Bennie
You're pretty well informed
If that means  know it all, you're right, boss
What do you know about the Sphinx
don't know nothin'
Not about the Sphinx
That's out of the ball park
have to get there
Can't you help me
No can do, mon
You want women, cigarettes, red-market money, booze, even air or water
Bennie's your man
But the Sphinx
that's -- 80A
- The solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly approach on a cross street
Bennie brakes and stops
He and Quail watch as   clear a path for a huge, -
on the sidewalks shout ,  -- Well
look at that one, eh
What
Big cheese in town
Big smelly cheese
Cohaagen
But isn't he often here
No way
That cat just cheat the Martian workers without ever leavin' his place in Beverly Hills
Somethin' must be cookin'
Quail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with curiosity as he passes
Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a street lamp
His face makes an impression on Quail, who perhaps faintly remembers him in the past
82
'   - Quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door
He checks all the rooms
Then he crosses to the dresser, studies himself in the mirror
He looks haggard
Quail opens a drawer, takes out his "emergency case," sets it on top and opens it
He removes a shoulder holster and pistol, sets them aside
He takes out a tape recorder
He sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in there were contained the answers to all his questions
He's just about to activate it, when he hears a  at the door
Quail freezes
Another
(
) (through door) Mr
Hauser
Who is it
(
) Mr
Hauser,  want to talk to you
about Douglas Quail
Quail ditches the recorder and the "emergency case" into the drawer -- everything except the
Quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side -- out of the line of fire)
(tensely) Who are you
(
) My name is George Edgemar
work for Rekall, Incorporated
(stunned; incredulous) Rekall
(
) Yes
It's difficult to explain
Could you open the door, please
'm not armed
Quail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out of view of the person at the door
dignified-looking  stands there, calm and pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit
Hello, Mr
Quail
May  come in
won't be offended if you prefer to keep the gun you're holding trained on me
He can't see the gun, but somehow knows
All right
come in
Quail does keep his gun trained on the man
The man enters, holding in his outstretched hand -- a business card
My card, Mr
Quail
Quail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it
Okay -- so you're Doctor George Edgemar of 'Rekall, Inc
'  So
As  said
this is going to be very difficult -- for both of us
'm listening
Mr
Quail
'm afraid you're not really standing here at this moment
Sat that again
said, you're not really here
Neither am
We're both in the Memory Studio -- in the offices of Rekall, Inc
On Earth
Long pause
Are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some
artificially injected fantasy
That  never really left Earth
No, not quite
We didn't give you this
You're creating it yourself -- (pauses, choosing his words) Remember the option we offered you
Intelligence agent
Something inside you liked that idea, fastened on it
What you're experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating
What is this shit you're giving me
This is not -- shit, Mr
Quail
It's the truth
(beat) know it's very hard for you to accept, but you're having a schizophrenic reaction
we can't snap you out of the Narkadine
You're in a world of your own fantasy
Then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it's just a dream
've been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy
'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console
This is a last resort
When somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy, we send in someone after them specialist, like myself
don't believe a word you're saying
was afraid you'd think that
'm sorry to have to do this, but you really are stuck
(calls out) Doctor Noel, would you come in now please
The door starts to open
Quail pivots and points his gun at the opening door
walks in, carrying a
She looks at Quail with professional detachment
Yes, Mr
Quail, 'm afraid it's all true
Quail is staggered
(continuing) tried to break through to you earlier, but you just molded me into your fantasy
Sometimes it takes Dr
Edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you
(wavering) So what's supposed to happen now
Just do exactly as we tell you
(stares at him coldly) Somehow that doesn't appeal to me
Please, Mr
Quail
try to cooperate
You're having a schizophrenic embolism
If we can't get you out now
you may never come out of it
Your wife calls every day -- - Even more suspicious
- If this is a fantasy, there'll be no real consequences when pull this trigger
But there will by consequences inside your mind
Consequences that won't hurt me
but could be fatal to you
(beat) If you shoot me, you'll wipe me out of your fantasy -- can't come back again
Because to you, 'll be dead
can't help you get back to reality
You'll be stuck in permanent psychosis
- Trembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face
- Showing no fear of tension whatever
You're going to lower the gun, Mr
Quail
You're going to hand it to me -- - Straining desperately to find the true "reality
" - Quail's finger on it
- You're going to do exactly what  tell you -- Quail
-   ' We  the results of the gunshot from this angle only, and so  as to produce an almost  effect: the back of Edgemar's head blows off -- He collapses to the floor
Melina  at Edgemar's falling form and over Edgemar's
Watch out, Charles
There's more of them in the hall
Quail spins toward the door just as it
man enters, firing, but Quail has fallen to the floor and returns the fire
He staggers back out into the corridor and slams against the wall, dead
(
) (from hall) You've had it, Hauser
Throw out your weapon if you want a past
Melina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his for some reason
Her  dangles by her side
(whispering) There's an explosive in the clipboard
He has a dead-man switch in his hand
Squeezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds up her other wrist -- to show that the (

We haven't got all night
Hauser
Quail (Hauser)   the chain
What happens it  come out
Quail takes the  from Melina and eases himself to the side of the doorway
(
) We'll put in a word with the big boys
Maybe you'll just get exile to Venus
All right
Here comes the weapon
Quail reaches around the corner and    into the hallway
Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand -- There is a   in the hallway, 83
- Quail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot
On the floor lies a   and the body of the Shoeshine Boy, sprawled grotesquely
The hallway is filled with smoke
The floor covered with debris
Plaster falling from the ceiling
All over the hotel,  begin

'  - Quail strides back in, icy-furious
He seizes Melina by the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor
84A
- Two more
men appear but Quail shoots them while dragging Melina down the hall in the opposite direction
He pushes open the door leading to the staircase
84B
- Quail and Melina run down the stairs
On the next landing is a service elevator, from which a waiter is emerging carefully carrying a tray with hors d'oeuvres and champagne
Back in, quick
Wouldn't you prefer your order in your room, sir
In
Quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the elevator
84C
- Quail presses the basement button
As he talks to Melina he opens the champagne and pours two glasses
The waiter is too frightened to protest
Okay
Answers
Now
They kidnapped me
Said they'd kill you if  didn't cooperate
told them didn't care, but then when realized they meant it
don't know why they're after me, but what's your connection with all this
We were together before
Believe me, 'm really sorry can't recall the details of that encounter
The elevator has reached the basement
They rush out
85
- Quail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley
solar car whips out in front of them
Quail and Melina leap aboard
Go, Bennie, for God's sake
86
'   - Bennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic, Quail and Melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat
(glances in mirror) Bad news, boss lady
What
Black cruiser just pull out behind us
86A
- large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way through the crowds and traffic behind them
86B
'  - Quail is aiming his gun at the following car
Forget the shooter, boss lose 'em for you
Lose them
In this
Hang on
Bennie reaches down, grasps a
He yanks it, like someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting roars to life
Bennie opens the throttle and the solar car Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat
87
- blazes all around the car
Quail  back at the pursuing car
(shouts over ) You're gonna get a ticket for that engine, Bennie -- Yutani 650 -- you like it, boss
Nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of speed
from the cruiser rip through the car
You better have two aces, Bennie
(glances behind) There's a second cruiser -- and it's gaining -- 87A
- Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official car gaining on it
Bennie takes a corner sharply near a huge water selling stand
The official car brakes to make the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand
The water container tips and empties water through the open roof (i
e
through which one of the Agents has been firing) so that the car completely fills
The driver continues the chase, but the occupants are now submerged
They frantic- ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's car
88
- The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of the windows) in pursuit
At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but continues going into a large opening
It is an abandoned mine
The bigger car follows him, but won't fit
The roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into the narrow opening
The second official car pulls up behind
chauffeur jumps out and opens the rear door
Cohaagen steps out
He sur- veys the scene
The four men in the wrecked car clamber their way backwards out of the wreckage
They are covered in blood and their clothes are in shreds
take it, then, you've failed to get him again
Cohaagen turns to an associate, , a youngish, well-dressed executive type
(continuing) Proceed with Operation Sphinx
But, sir
With him
(gestures toward the mine) on the lose, 'm not taking any more chances
Operation Sphinx will flush him out
93
- The solar car proceeds along the tunnel
It enters an area full of smoke
Dozens of men are sitting around smoking cigarettes, pipes and cigars
Quail looks at them in amazement
What's all this
Nothin', boss
Just old smokies
Only place they can come for a puff
It's all banned topside
They have now climbed out of the car
Quail looks searchingly at Melina and Bennie
So you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business
That's right, boss
He unzips his jacket to reveal a -shirt with " " (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned on it
My God
-shirts
They died out on Earth years ago
(hurt) Well, maybe we ain't fashion leaders, boss
No
But we still believe in a free Mars
They walk as they talk - into a room off the main tunnel
It is adorned with " " and " " posters
group of people are printing -shirts and leaflets
They exchange greetings with Melina and Bennie
So where did  fit into all this
You - when you were Charles Hauser with
- infiltrated our group guess Cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and Her gesture suggests their liaison
Yeah
And  can't even remember it
We'll have to arrange a return bout
so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity
But - the Sphinx
Why is that stuck in my mind
Why's it so important
don't know
Just an ole heap o' stone, boss
It's more than that, Bennie, know it's more
Somehow it's connected
He slumps into a chair with frustration
(reflecting) Maybe there's a way  you can get your memory back
How
What
Where
When
bit of Martian Wisdom
We're not all stupid colonists
99
- Bennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area of town
Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere
An    appears, broadcasting to the crowd
It is also swinging a powerful searchlight along the footpaths and streets
all residents are to report to their nearest space-travel agent within twelve hours, all residents will be departing on shuttles within twenty-four hours
Air and water supplies will be cut off at that time
repeat
He's doing it
What
Why
Clearing everyone out
It's been rumored for months
The searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina
Bennie ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses her passionately
The light sees only the back of his head
She responds warmly to his kiss
Wow
can see why  was willing to betray
though you believed in our cause
Yes
Of course
That, too
They move into the crowd
The message on the loudspeaker is repeated
101
'  - The interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its ghetto exterior
The decor is a baroque combination of Middle Eastern opulence and 21st century flash
It looks like something out of "The Arabian Nights"
man enters from another room
Although the man's features are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl draped around the back of his neck
(nodding to Quail) Your servant, Fahreem Kuato
greet you by the twenty-seven names that still remain, praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life
As Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce, to Melina
What use is this weirdo
Ssssh
there are skills on mars that Earth has forgotten
No need to introduce yourself, Mr
Quail
(smiles at Quail's surprise) Tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought-after man on two worlds
From the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information about Quail and Co
can be heard
Searchlight beams occasionally sweep past the windows
(continuing) This way, my dear man
We have much to accomplish -- (ominously) -- and very little time
102
'   - Bysantine salon filled with enormous Oriental pillows
(:  In the scenes inside Kuato's sanctum, the loudspeaker vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to to time
They are repeating the evacuation message from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the apprehension of Quail and Melina
for information leading to these arrests, first-class travel to Earth will be provided plus a weekend at the Leningrad Disneyworld, all expenses paid
repeat, an Oriental girl and Earthman, possibly to be found in the company of a black taxi driver
These are dangerous subversives and sworn enemies of the glorious Peoples Republic of Mars
) The turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you
You have brought it to Mars in your search for yourself
Kuato takes a seat on the pillows, invites the others to join him
Quail hesitates
And you're going to help me by reading my mind
Indubitably
There is only small matter of a fee
fee
Naturally
This is for our cause
(soothingly) Income before ideals
Shall we say five-hundred-thousand dollars
(appalled) Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars, that's
(think, calculating the exchange rate) Not Martian dollars, Mr
Quail - Earth dollars
That's interplanetary robbery
With today's exchange rate
that's over two million Martian dollars
(suave) What price do you put, Mr
Quail, on the future of the solar system
Aw, come off it, man
Just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball
(his manner slipping) Listen, buster, we're talking heavy stuff here
You try and work out what's with this guy
He jerks his thumb toward Quail
Okay
Okay
'll pay it, but the Interstellar Trade Practices Commission might be interested in this
Everyone calms down
Kuato smiles
He extinguishes all the lights save one small blue one, which illuminates the room eerily, like a seance
Retrieving the past is like walking backwards along a perilous road
The half-recalled, the half-forgotten, the repressed, the fantasies, the triumphs, joys, failures, betrayals
He closes his eyes and concentrates
(continuing) Yes
can feel it

Erasure techniques are so brutal
(frowns; scans harder) Blocks
Side channels
Future and past all jumbled

Kauto turns around and sits down with back toward Quail
He reaches up and lowers his cowl, : The head's eyes are closed in sleep
It is utterly hairless and looks like one of those dolls made from dried apples; a shriveled, ancient-looking yellow little ball

We see its face, shoulders and behind it the red Martian sky -- 103A to reveal the Sphinx is a  on a screen in a windowless briefing room
Quail is seated across from Cohaagen and other
On the walls are numerous satellite photos, recon maps and excavation drawings -- all relating to the Sphinx

- Scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the Sphinx; the Sphinx's huge   visible in the background
Quail and several other
agents stand poised, wearing breathing masks and protective gear, as a powerful excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing an
The other agents are fearful, don't want to proceed
Quail ignores them, enters the chamber -- 107A     - ' As he enters
We read awe, shock and fascination on his features
He approaches something we can't see
His hand reaches out
Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out, striking Quail like a bolt of lightning
105
- Quail and Melina are dancing
The faceted mirror ball on the ceiling become the -- 106
- Melina watches from the bed as Quail dresses
She rises, with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make Quail stay
Plainly he wants to, but he can't
They kiss lingeringly;  then Quail, as if "called to duty," exits

- Quail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber
Suddenly, the door opens and

They grab Quail to haul him out
Quail battles them with amazing skill and resourcefulness

Cohaagen
Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to already inserted into Quail's brain
As they turn up the power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony -- ' You have seen your past
Now read the future

White as a sheet
sweating like he's just run ten miles
Then:  a transformation seems to come over him
He  -- and : slumped across the cushions --  beside Kuato -- standing holding a smoking  trained on Kuato
(rushes to Quail) Charles
Are you all right
Quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories were suddenly clicking back into place -- (continuing) He kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance
We couldn't wake either of you
You stopped breathing
Quail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine
Why did you kill him
It was the next bit  really
No choice, boss
It was him or you
Quail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing form
Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a last flicker of life
Kuato's body is dead white
Quail releases his grip; he about to give up when -- comes from behind Kuato's neck
It's the Oracle Head
Quail instantly rolls Kuato's body over
The Head is still alive
Quail bends closer, kneeling
(whispers) -- the vengence you seek
and the salvation of Mars
are waiting for you in the crown of the Sphinx
(sags, gasping) The Oracle Head lets out a   and goes limp, a small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its mouth
Phobos and Demos
What was that all about
Quail ignores him, still kneeling -- deep in thought -- over the Oracle Head
Are you okay
Charles
Doug
Whoever
Quail reaches out and closes the Oracle Head's tiny eyelids
Melina and Bennie exchange a glance
Then: Stands
For a moment his back is to Melina and Bennie
Then he turns
He has become a different man
His eyes gleam
He is forceful, purposeful, contained
Once again the ace
agent
Melina senses immediately that this is the man she knew before (even his voice has changed) 'm fine
only 'm not Doug -- 'm Charles Hauser
and  know everything Hauser knew
He turns to Bennie (continuing) Bennie, where's your depot
(working it out) Well
you go outta here
take a left, then down past the first
no second
water bureau you
(briskly) Can you get us there
No problem
But why
We're going to the Sphinx
He strides off
The others follow, still full of questions
Impossible, man
Guards everywhere
The Oracle
what did you learn
Only everything
've got total recall
They are now heading down the stairs toward the street
114
- Quail, Melina and Bennie make their way through the crowds to Bennie's depot
The streets are even busier then before - people are now beginning to evacuate the city
Everyone is carrying their possessions - bundles, suitcases, pets, etc
, etc
The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad- casting the same message
Bennie indicates a building on their left
115
- Bennie and Melina follow Quail as he walks up and down the rows of vehicles in the vast building
There are bull- dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis
We'll never get near the Sphinx
They'll blow us apart
Quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself
He rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they pass
Camera tracks rapidly with them
What are we doing, Charles
For God's sake, tell us
The Sphinx
it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago
The same race that built the on one Earth
for the same purpose
He stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a large scoop or propeller on the front
(continuing) This is what we need
He begins to climb in;  the others follow
(referring to the Sphinx) It's a hunk of old stone, man
(ditto) Purpose
What purpose
Bennie starts the engine
Come on, Bennie, move it
(then, to Melina) Have you heard the word, "terriform"
Melina shakes her head
The vehicle moves off
115A
- are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports
The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives
115B
-   - Bennie is nervous
Melina and Quail are in the back, but cannot be seen
Guards are checking all vehicles exiting, looking for Quail and Melina
(calling to Guards) Just deliverin' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia
Got them people you're lookin' for in the back as well
The Guards laugh and signal him on
Once through the second door of the air lock (i
e
to the area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit up on the rear seats
The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet
There are tunnels and ducts everywhere, all powered by fusion generators
You sure the little man didn't fry your brain, Quail
(overlapping) For what
To do what
To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen
That's air
116B
- In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert
The domed city is some distance in the background
Voices are heard in false perspective
Emphasis is on the dry and hostile natural landscape of Mars
That's right
Air and water
Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars
No more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert
There'll be rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth
(baffled) So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out
Don't you see
From being a pile of red dirt with minerals, Mars is going to change into  a chunk of priceless real estate
And Cohaagen's going to own it all
Right
He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth
Beach condos, ski resorts, you name it
No wonder he wanted you to
penetrate
out group
(nods) Once word of this gets out, the whole planet will support you
117
- The vehicle is now approaching the Sphinx
Both it and the pyramids can be seen some distance away
Voice are heard in  perspective
So what can we do
Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here
Melina is amazed
But who'll work the machine
Do you know how
'm the only one who does
Why do you think Cohaagen's left me alone all this time
118
- The vehicle is even closer to the Sphinx
was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the Sphinx
It must've been programmed
Some kind of
force
shot into me
But Cohaagen wiped your memory
(smoothly) Just a way of putting me on ice
He'd of reversed it once the planet was evacuated
Man
This is real complicated
Go over it again, real slow
119
- (ignoring Bennie's aside) What he hadn't counted on was your effect on me
(smiling) And all without the marvels of modern science
Quail looks out the back window, his attention attracted by two patrol vehicles
They are some distance away, but approaching steadily
119A
- wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach- ing the vehicle with Quail, Melina and Bennie
Suddenly, it stops moving
120
- The vehicle had just stopped
Bennie, don't stop now, take it
He turns to see Bennie is covering him and Melina with a pistol
You bastard
Like  said
It's a tough planet
'm a baddie, not a goodie
should have known, you were just too helpful
Rule One, man
Trust Nobody
Now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone
But what about the Martian people
Out cause
thought you believed in it
Your cause
That bunch of dead beat radicals
When hand in this little number
(flicks his gun in Quail's face) 'll get real estate rights on the whole of Chryse Planitia
At that instant, Melina lunges, The  beside Bennie's hand  , [causing] a powerful suction caused by Mars's vacuum atmosphere
Bennie's gun hand is     [
] Simultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out
All three parties begin choking
As Bennie's mechanical hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has a moment to jump him
He pounds Bennie's gun hand, the , ,
Quail delivers a roundhouse punch to Bennie, knocking him clear across the bus
Melina seals the vent,
Bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch-- 121
- The
vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in
122
- Quail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready to jump him
But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing
Bennie is clipping on his
It sprouts several rows of vicious-looking   -- This makes Bennie a cut above anyone else
Bennie presses another button and the
Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a
The fight begins
Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw arm;  Quail dodges
Bennie's arm shreds various articles in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed swipes
Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to Quail's jaw with his real hand
Quail sprawls, dazed
Now Bennie goes for the kill
But Melina leaps onto him
Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his in for the quick kill
Melina clutches the terrifying appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay
But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when -- Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to Bennie's spine
Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and -- The      '
Alarms sound as a ' Now no one can breathe
They all claw for their masks, [still] in place
Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges with his   for Quail
Quail barely dodges, grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie -- The    '
Gasp- ing, he falters
Quail aims a titanic blow, out through the hole in the mole's wall
Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws desperately at his severed air line
The Martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers -- 122AA
- Bennie is beside the vehicle
He implodes like a balloon with all its air gone
122AB   /
- Melina hides her face in horror
At that instant -- 122A
- Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle
The patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away
Loud- speakers call for Quail's surrender
122B
- Quail lunges for the vehicle controls
Presses a button marked "Dive"
The vehicle tilts
122C
- The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand
As the patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire, the vehicle vanishes from sight
In the distance, the Sphinx looms ominously
driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone
He can't be heard but can only be radioing a report
123
-  - The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by its
Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up the gaping hole in the side, into which  is as the mole moves forward
Quail looks at a compass in the control panel
He makes a correction
(shouts over engine noise) Hope 've got this direction right
Sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the encounter with patrol cars
speedometer:  22
Every other gauge is overheating, flashing   -- 124
- Cohaagen and a number of his associates, plus scientists and heavily arms troops are present
The air supply is off under the domes
Yes, sir
In a couple of hours it'll be all gone
Any trouble with the rabble
Not much, sir
lot of complaining
But they're all heading towards the shuttle areas
On some of the video screens a number of space shuttles can be seen, ready for departure to Earth
123 The Mole bores through a sand wall, emerges into a cramped horizontal tunnel
Quail and Melina leap out
The poor Mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit
Its nose is worn to a nub
We got in with this thing, but we'll never get back out
shame
Such a pleasant trip
There's a lighted area at the end of the tunnel
Quail and Melina hurry toward it, moving silently, close to the wall
126B They draw up an abyss -- where their tunnel intersects the Melina gasps at the colossal scale of the drilling, hundreds of yards across, deeper than the eye can see, and crisscrossed by catwalks, buttresses and super-sophisticated technology
Quail and Melina are forty feet below the upper end of the main downshaft
They can look up the shaft and see the first interior level of the Sphinx itself
(points down shaft) This is the main tap -- straight down to the core of Mars
When we trigger the mechanism, fusion reactors will detonate down there -- four hundred miles deep
Remind me not to slip
The new elements will come booming up through this shaft -- and six thousand others all around the planet
He's right at home -- and full of confidence
Quail climbs onto the ladder, which links various top levels
He starts to climb
Melina follows him
They are tiny figures
The space around them plummets down to infinity
127
-    ( ) patrol of  -  appear from a corridor in Level One -- directly above where Quail and Melina are climbing
128 Quail and Melina's heads inch into view at floor level
They take one peek at these formidable warriors and duck back swiftly out of sight
129
-    ( ) (to two of his men) Stay in contact
want to hear from this checkpoint every four minutes
Seven of the Guards move off, two remain in position
We  the  of the seven guards recede
The two remaining guards realize their isolation; they glance tensely to one another
#1 Did you hear something
#2 No
Where
#1 Over there
The First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft -- right where Quail and Melina are hiding
The Guards cock their weapons, start cautiously forward
Just as they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the ready: '  (
) (from behind the guards) 'm not there, boys
'm here
The guards spin around, weapons poised
Standing in the shadows, near the corridor, is Quail
(Still with no gun) Both guards walk quickly toward Quail, covering him with their weapons
#1 (to Guard #2) Watch him
He was  trained
They're all full of tricks
#2 Yeah
Like
who was that guy
-- Fred Bond
(to Quail) Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em up
Quail has his arms raised high
Just as the Guards reach him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound, then disappears
#1 hologram
Before either Guard can react, the real Quail appears -- one foot behind them
With two  , he dispatches the Guards
(Apparently Quail has climbed out of the shaft while the Guards were distracted
) Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo belts
Melina climbs out of the shaft
Quail tosses her one of the Guard's guns
130
- go off everywhere
Quail -- carrying a gun and all the grenades and ammo belts -- and Melina (just carrying a gun) bolt down a corridor past a sign: " "
(running) Where'd you get that little trick
(running) Mail-order company
It's a great one for fooling the wife
131
( ) Cohaagen and his Aides hear the , see Quail and Melina on  as they race down the corridor on Level One
How the hell did they get in
Up the fusion core
Up the fusion core
He exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail
(studies monitor more carefully) They're on Level One
wall sign behind Cohaagen reads:  " "
Seal all upper levels
button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front of the formidable doors already closing the Control Room off from the outside corridors
133 Quail and Melina are still racing through the corridors
He passes her a fresh ammo belt
(indicates weapons) Know how to use one of these
Melina expertly ejects her spent clip (that Guards fired at Quail), slams in a fresh clip and cocks the gun
Quail has a half-second to react, impressed, then -- pound into view at the end of the corridor
Melina opens fire, nails two
Quail heaves a grenade; as it , he and Melina bolt down a side corridor -- 134
, , continue as Quail and Melina dash down the side passageway
cut them off;  Melina's machine gun sends them scattering -- Quail pauses at a corner
He looks around quickly and sees that an elevator is arriving
He motions Melina back
The doors of the elevator begin to open
Very quickly, Quail bobs his head and arm around the corner
He calls out, loudly
Catch
He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator
Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object
It is an explosive device of some sort
Quail and Melina press themselves against the wall just around a corner from the elevator
There is a tremendous explosion
Quail, followed by Melina, rounds a corner
The elevator is in ruins; bodies are scattered everywhere
Great stuff, but how do we get up
She points toward the upper levels
135
( ) Melina and Quail can be seen on the security monitor from a high angle
Quail looks up, spots the monitor, and shoots is to pieces
The image on the screen goes black
Forget them
We'll pick up Quail once the shuttles have left for Earth
137 Quail spots a large    at the end of the corridor
He and Melina race to it
Quail starts to open the inner door of the air lock
If you're afraid of the heights, you better get over it real quick
He is pulling Melina through the inner air lock door just as -- stampede around the corner of the corridor toward them
Quail is out of sight, but they see Melina poised near the window
She waves and smiles to them, hiding her gun behind her body
They slow down and approach less cautiously, beguiled by her manner and attractiveness
As they get close, she suddenly lifts her gun and opens fire, mowing them down
140
'  - Quail and Melina climb through the outer air lock door
They are at the Sphinx's shoulder, with a dizzying drop beneath them
Melina looks down
She's sorry she did: the fall is at least 200 feet
(Both are wearing their breathing apparatus
) Quail and Melina start to climb
Up the Sphinx's shoulder, along its Egyptian-like headdress -- 141
- Cohaagen's chief aide, Emile, addresses him quietly
If Quail's the only one who can operate all this
(gestures toward Sphinx's controls) then he can call all the shots
We'll tell him the computer's worked out the operational details so we don't really need him
We're just doing him a favor
And if that doesn't work
We offer him rewards
What if that doesn't work
We'll torture him
You don't think  got this far by being a nice guy

'  - Quail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes -- 142A
- The video monitors show the space shuttles
An operator, with earphones, turns to Cohaagen
First of the shuttles ready for departure, sir
Two minute countdown
142B
- Quail jams   against the glass of the eyes, pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks -- 143 (due to the thin Martian atmosphere) detonates overhead
'     a storm of shards and shrapnell
Instantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian vacuum sucks out all air
Everyone panics, grabbing their Seal the breach

But now -- Quail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto an overhead catwalk
They   on the Guards, who are choking, struggling with their masks

comes up, the internal atmosphere stabilizes -- None of the men inside the control room still moves
The victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level
Melina hurries to the main control panel
Melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure
Those shuttles are starting up any minute
If you know how to work this thing, you better do it now
Quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex machinery
Yes
He hesitates
Don't you know how
Transfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control panel
Yes
there's a vital connection missing
He approaches even closer
He begins to raise his arm towards a blank area a little above his head
(continuing) me
Wait
Don't wait
If you activate the mechanism you'll die
there were glimpses of it in your memory
Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a long tunnel, a brilliant white light, hands reaching for me
(assured) That's your death
That's what it looks like
That's what is always looks like
Quail looks around him, half-convinced
(looking toward space shuttles on video screens) Charles - for Mars's sake
Quail hesitates
He looks from Melina to Cohaagen
It's not too late
Join us again
've a lot to offer
whole world
Quail continues to look at him, thoughtfully
You don't deserve a new world, you and people like you made too big a mess of the old one
Time someone else had a chance
He turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm again
His fingers reach towards the blank section on the panel
Slowly, through the panel, a luminous hand reaches toward Quail's fingers
Gently, the fingers of the two hands touch
The entire control room begins to rumble and shudder
As Quail reaches for Melina, Cohaagen suddenly dives on him
They grapple amid the shuddering Sphinx and can be seen only intermittently as debris crashes around them
The fight ends as Cohaagen is hurled backwards and disappears when a section of floor collapses underneath him
144 reprise of the sequence that opened the movie
Quail We hear an  and  and , each one   than the last -- Quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs
Is this his own death
Where is Melina
The tunnel walls are just like the ones in Quail's original nightmare -- bright reddish-orange, clay and quartz
Quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder
The  are closer
Suddenly -- Up ahead appears a
Quail sees it, but it only terrifies him more
Is it death he's running to
He hurries on with all his strength, but -- Just as he nears the white light,
On his knees, too weak to move
He struggles -- , from out of the brilliant light
Quail stretches for them, just as -- blows him forward -- straight into the The   , pull him upward to -- 145
- The hands belong to breather-masked , dismounting rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was taking them to the Space Port
Quail looks from them to Melina, who is walking towards the group
'
- ' The miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add to the surreal nightmare quality of Quail's tortured perspective -- In terror, lost, disoriented totally
Am  dying
won't lie to you, pal
You are
(from Melina's bar) 'd say in about forty years
(he and others help Quail to his feet) come on, we've gotta get to the Space Port
That Intergalactic Napoleon's switched off the air
2ND Shippin' us all out
Mars is finished
'  watches them
She is crying
Quail looks up at the sky
Melina follows his glance
So do the others
Slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow to blue
It's happening
What is it
All the miners are puzzled, apprehensive
Quail reaches toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his breathing apparatus
At first the man is shocked, then realizes he can breathe without it
Quail takes off his own, then Melina's All the miners watch in amazement
They all remove their breathing masks
That's just the start
Next there'll be rain and growth and
life
Melina embraces him
(continuing) Rekall could never have come up with anything like this
Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious
As the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the Miners descend from the bus
Softly at first, then with more and more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National Anthem
The music swells
Quail puts his arm around Melina
They both join in the chorus
It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the and the     the screen
