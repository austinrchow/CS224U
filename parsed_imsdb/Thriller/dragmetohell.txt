Written by Ivan Raimi & Sam Raimi September, 2007 - 22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep as the alarm clock
She hits the snooze button and plops back down onto the pillow
After a few seconds of pure sleeping bliss, she wills herself up
She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom, past a "Hang in there, baby" poster and into the bathroom
- Stephanie turns on the shower
While waiting for the water to heat up, she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated pronunciation, recites: There is no friction, with proper diction
Good sounds abound, when the mouth is round
She catches herself on the last word, a hint of "Missouri twang" slipping through
Round
Yawn
She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the steaming shower
-- She opens the refrigerator:  half grapefruit sits next to an inviting slice of chocolate cake
She's tempted, but chooses the grapefruit
- sunny Southern California day
Commuters speed by

She steps from the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward the intersection
The traffic signal changes to "Don't Walk"
next to her, sprints across the street
Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign
She looks down to see a little
It rubs against her ankles and
Well, you're a little cutie

car's  blares, spooking the kitten
It darts into the intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming
Stephanie races into the intersection, snatches up the kitten and places it safely down on the other side of the street
Hey
Slow down
The Van roars past
She pets the Kitten
It  and licks Stephanie's face
She sets it down
Go on home
Shoo now
She heads for the Bank
The kitten follows
She turns back, frowning

We keep getting the same thing
Because 'm not employed by an American company, they won't take my application until they get my solvency statement
And the Mexican Treasury Department says that's going to take at least four more weeks
And the house will be gone by then
It says, here your employed by Pemex
That's right
Isn't Pemex a subsidiary of Union Oil

a Yes
So
0 So technically, your employer is an American company

'll call you this afternoon and let you know
The happy couple shake Stephanie's hand and exit

need clarification on the shoe issue
Okay
First of all-- you know you've got the only perfect pair of black dress shoes in
So was that a definite, irrevocable, "no way" or t just a rather not at this time, "no way"
It's an absolutely, positively, forget about the shoes already, "no way"
They're my only good pair and need them in good shape for tomorrow
What's Up
Dinner with Ray's parents
Ellen picks up a desktop photo:  shot of Stephanie and her handsome boyfriend, Ray, locked in an embrace, standing in the spray of a waterfall
Ray's got a nice butt
Really tight --- Stephanie takes back her photo

1 -- know
Thanks
He's a keeper
But  told you about his mom, she's another story used to waitress at her country club, and with her, it's all about what private school you went to and who you know
You still up for that promotion
That would help
Stephanie looks longingly to
of the former Assistant Manager
The large oak desk
The executive chair
Waiting to be filled
Stephanie turns back, pushing the thought away
'm not putting on a show
She'll either accept me for who  am or not
Are you reading self help books again
The Kitten peers out through Stephanie's partially opened desk drawer
Hello there
Ellen reaches for the Kitty but Stephanie waves her off
--Shhhl  can't let my boss see him
Stephanie glances to her manager,
, a heavyset man sitting behind a large desk
What about the shoes
told you
No
Now beat it
5
Mr
Jacks sneezes, rubs his nose
He looks suspiciously about the bank for the source of his allergy
0 Uh Oh
You better bring the kitty home for me
Sure
If  can take the shoes
told you, no
Mr
Jacks sneezes again, his eyes water
He turns to his Has someone brought a damned animal into my bank
Mr
Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading him toward Stephanie's desk
Okay, fine
Take the shoes
Hidden from Mr
Jack's view, Ellen quickly scoops up the Kitten and places it into her purse
As Mr
Jacks arrives at Stephanie's desk, he overhears: Just don't expect me to take care of it
This catches Mr
Jack's Attention
He turns to the ladies, wondering what they're talking about
Stephanie takes Ellen's hand and vigorously shakes it goodbye
Of course not
'll take care of everything
And thanks for choosing Bank of California
Ellen plays along
6
Okay
Then 'll see you later mean--- whenever the next time 'm in the bank
You know-- for a loan
-- Goodbye
As Ellen passes, Mr
Jacks sneezes again, harder
Someone has definitely brought an animal in here
He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits
don't see any cats
Or any animals
Hope to hell, not
By the way,  put the paperwork for the Mcpherson loan on your desk
Mcpherson
That big corporate loan 've been trying to set up
It's just preliminary but-- Oh, right
'll look it over when get the chance
Mr
Jacks,  was wondering it you had made any decision regarding the Assistant Manager's position yet
'm still deciding
Right now it's between Stu and yourself
7
Stu
The trainee
Stephanie turns to see Stu, the balding loan officer who sits at his desk, watching, trying to figure out what Jacks is saying to her
know he's new but he's also quite aggressive and we like that
Don't get me wrong, you're well liked here, but we're also looking for someone who's not afraid to crunch the numbers and make the tough decisions
Mr
Jacks,  feel that 'm perfectly capable of-- --'ll let you know as soon as, decide
In the meantime, take him through our loan qualifying procedures
just in case
Oh
okay
And would you mind taking your lunch now
Sure
And on your way back, maybe you could bring me a turkey club
Stu overhears them as he passes by
Turkey club
Excellent choice,
Then to Stephanie: Mind picking one up for me
8
No problem
Jacks heads back toward his desk
Stephanie grabs her purse and keys and as she heads out, Stu calls after her: On toasted rye
And spicy mustard
Stephanie doesn't like fetching lunch for the trainee but hides her displeasure
Sure
-   - Stephanie enters the Ivy-covered red bricked Department of Psychology Building
- , a handsome twenty-nine year old man is lecturing before a class of  students
They listen attentively
The conscious mind abhors uncertainty
It seeks a pattern or reason for everything
When we can't find that pattern or reason, we sometimes ascribe it's cause to the world of the supernatural
The spiritual world is created by the human mind to conveniently explain everything we can't
So when does a belief in the supernatural cross into the field of abnormal behavior
Where do you, the Psychologist, come in
When these beliefs negatively affect our patients activities of daily living
Their jobs, their friends, their sense of well being-- The class bell
Tomorrow we'll be covering the clinical manifestations of psychosis
You'll find it all t referenced in the text
9
The students pack up their books
Ray smiles as he sees Stephanie enter the lecture hall, holding a bag of deli food
'   - Stephanie eats a salad as she goes over a financial statement of the Mcpherson Corporation
Ray grades papers
How're things at the bank
How's that new position looking
don't know
Really
You sounded so sure
Well, now there's this new guy
they're considering him too
Ray sees how bummed out she is
He moves close, taking her in his arms
That job needs somebody with your experience
They know that
Stephanie nods
Oh, 've got something for you
She rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope
He removes a coin
An old nickle
1925 Indian head
Hey, good find
Where'd you get it
One of the tellers found it for me
Ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into his pocket
10
Thanks
'd better get back to work
She quickly gathers her things
Ray returns to grading his student's exams
The telephone
Ray hits the speakerphone
Doctor Dalton
It's the voice of an older woman,
Hello dear
Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec
He turns from the phone, whispering to Stephanie: 'll call you tonight
She kisses Ray and exits
'  - Stephanie stops at the water fountain for a drink
' Nothing much
Just had lunch with Stephanie
And trying to get these midterms graded-- She halts as she hears her name mentioned on Ray's speakerphone
She moves closer to Ray's office to eavesdrop: ' --Stephanie
The one from the farm
' You know who she is
She's coming over for dinner tomorrow night to meet you and dad
11
' Ray, 'm sure she's sweet, but she doesn't sound
' What
' mean she's just a teller at some bank right
Raymond there's a reason that your father and raised you in a certain way
We have expectations
' Please, mom, not this again-- ' heard that Julie Kulick is looking for someone to play tennis with
You know she graduated Yale law with honors
'm told she's quite a successful attorney now gave you her number but her mother says you never called
' Because 'm with Stephanie
'm not looking for anybody else
' Would it kill you to-- ' --Mom
have to go
See you tomorrow night
Okay
Bye
downhearted Stephanie quietly exits
-   - As Stephanie pours herself a cup of coffee, Stu and Mr
Jacks take the first bites of their sandwiches
Stu makes a face
He inspects the sandwich, shakes his head
(quietly to Mr
Jacks) She messed up my order
Stephanie heard that
12
No  didn't, Stu
Steph,  said "no mayo"
You never said that
Stu rolls his eyes to Mr
Jacks
Stephanie caught Stu's look, but what can she do
She exits
- Stephanie sits at her desk, entering data into her computer
She glances across the bank to see Stu and Mr
Jacks emerging from the break room
Stu is about to return to his desk when he remembers something: he's got two tickets to a Dodger game that he can't use
Mr
Jacks happily accepts the tickets
Stephanie looks to the vacant office of the Assistant Manager
She can feel her promotion slipping away
Stephanie looks to the source of the sound
withered hand
An involuntary tremor causes it's yellowed fingernails to  across the surface of Stephanie's desk
The hand belongs to
, the aged woman who site across from Stephanie
She wears a
formal dress and hat from another era
The outfit is threadbare in spots but great care has been taken to maintain it
(Hungarian accent) Will you help me
Of course
What can  do for you
Mrs
Ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen handkerchief, which she tucks back into her puree
She hands Stephanie a bunch of crumpled papers
Stephanie reviews them
13
Mrs
"Ganush"
The old woman nods
This is a delinquency notice
it says that the payment on your loan was due a number of months ago
And this other document
is a court order for repossession
The bank is informing you of their intent to repossess-your property at 325 Brandon street, tomorrow
, The trucks are there now
The men are packing all my things
Private things
Please, make them stop
This is my home for twenty years
And  make every payment until the sickness took my eye
Mrs
Ganush turns her head to reveal a milky white eye
Stephanie hides her revulsion
Well
do you have the payment with you now
hope to get it soon
just need a little more time
don't think my manager is going to extend you anymore credit
'd like to help but
Please
Won't you try
Okay
Wait here
Stephanie stands and moves off
The Old Woman picks through a bowl of hard candies on Stephanie's desk
Stephanie stands before Mr
Jacks
He acknowledges her without looking up from his work
1B 14
What's up
've got an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment
They're in the process of repossessing her home
She's on a fixed income and she's had some medical problems
was wondering if we could give her a break
Stephanie hands Mr
Jacks the loan file
He puts on his bifocals, studies it
Stephanie glances over her shoulder
'
- Mrs
Ganush looks around to
make sure no one's watching, then tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse
She reaches
into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that she wraps in her linen handkerchief
She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it with a wet  sound
The Old Woman's one good eye, wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat
Apparently, we've already granted her two extensions
And you know on this type of foreclosure, the bank makes a sizable amount in fees
He hands her back the file
It would mean 'd have to throw her out of her house
Tough decision
Your call
He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies her
Stephanie glances to the vacant office of the Assistant Manager
The large oak desk
The thick carpet
She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his workstation
15
'll take care of it
Stephanie returns to her desk
Mrs
Ganush, another extension on the loan is out of the question
What
'm sorry
No
Please, it's my home
'm begging you
tried to talk my boss into it but he just wouldn't approve
But where will  live
Stephanie leafs through the loan documents
She finds a name
Mrs
Ganush, you've given your granddaughter as a reference
It says here, she lives nearby
Wouldn't you be better off living with her
would not burden her
Okay well, there's several fine "assisted living" facilities for the elderly
nursing home
No
will never live in one of those places1 Well, of course, that's your choice
16
It's yours
'm sorry there's nothing  can do
Mrs
Ganush begins to sob
am proud woman, Miss Brown, and never have  begged for anything
But  will beg for you now
This one time
humble myself before you
That isn't necessary, please
Let's not make this personal
It's just the bank's policy
'm really sorry Mrs
Ganush
Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly into a manila folder
she glances up but Mrs
Ganush is gone
Stephanie turns in her chair and is startled to see the old woman, kneeling before her
She clutches Stephanie's leg with her gnarled hands
Have mercy on me
Stephanie stands, tries to pull free, but the old woman will not release her leg
Please, let go
Customers turn to look
Mr
Jacks glances up from his desk
What the hell
, Sylvia Ganush, beg
On my mother's grave,  beg you
Please, take your hands off me
But the old woman only clutches tighter
17
'm calling security
She picks up the phone and presses a button
(into the phone) Could you please come over
Mrs
Ganush finally releases her grip and bows her head in humiliation
You shame me
She composes herself
Then, slowly stands, puffing up her chest
Mu3tering her damaged pride
begged you
Her one
good eye fixes it's hardened gaze upon Stephanie
and you shame me
Mrs
Ganush suddenly grasps Stephanie's arm
Stephanie tries to pull away but the old lady's grip is strong
Mrs
Ganush reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from Stephanie's wrist-- but the Security Guard intervenes
think your business here is finished, ma'am
The Guard escorts Mrs
Ganush from the bank
Through the banks's window, Stephanie watches the Guard lead Mrs
Ganush to a old, Chevy Cavalier on the street
Stephanie composes herself and when she again looks up, the old woman's car is gone
: - 16 The bank is closing
Stephanie is finishing some paper work when Mr
Jacks stops by her desk
0 18
That was one nutty old lady
You okay
Stephanie nods
You handled that just right
And by the way, as far as the Assistant Manager's position
You're at the top of the list
Thanks
Mr
Jacks nods, heads for home
Stephanie loads a pile of contracts, a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box and exits the bank
The Security guard locks up behind her
-   - Stephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off
It's then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler
It's parked in the structure
Stephanie looks closer
There's no one behind the wheel
She nervously glances about
No sign of Mrs
Ganush
Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car
Her  echo in the deserted structure, more loudly than she would like
She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the doors behind her
She places the box of contracts on the seat next to her
As she starts the engine, she notices a strange sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the lot
It's Mrs
Ganush's linen handkerchief
It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer
Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her car
It dips beneath her hood and is gone
It suddenly sweeps up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is carried off by the wind
Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled hands come up around her face
Mrs Ganush sits up in the back seat of her car
with rage at Stephanie
19
(In Hungarian) You bitch
pluck out your fucking eyes
Mrs
Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards Stephanie's eyes
But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists, halting her
The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's throat
Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically searches for a weapon
Her hand finds the box on the seat next to her
She grabs a handful of colored push pins and jams them into the old woman's arm
Mrs
Ganush releases her grip
Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before Mrs
Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair
The old woman yanks upon it
Stephanie's head is pulled back, over the edge of the seat
Ganush braces her feet against the back of the front seat to pull even harder
Stephanie's neck is now bent so far back it's about to snap
Stephanie's hand finds the stapler, trips the release
It springs open
She swings it back over her shoulder
Ka-Thunk
Ka-Thunk
Ka-Thunk
With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs
Ganush's forehead
Ka-Thunk
lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled shut
The old woman , but her grip on Stephanie's hair only tightens
Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and hits the gas
As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her shoulder harness with the last of her strength
The old woman's stapled eyelid  open just in time for her to see
an oncoming concrete column
Stephanie's car slams into it
Stephanie is held fast by her shoulder harness
But Mrs
Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat, impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force
Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash
In a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her mouth
20
Both women are dazed from the impact
Stephanie regains her wits first
She reaches across Mrs
Ganush and opens the passenger door
Mrs
Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's foot shoves her out
The old woman hits the ground hard but she sits up suddenly with a  and starts to climb back in
Stephanie shifts the car into reverse
The opened passenger door knocks Mrs
Ganush back down to the pavement
The car's rear bumper slams into a concrete column
Stephanie is dazed
Mrs
Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the car
Stephanie tries to focus
blurred image in the rear view mirror: Mrs
Ganush running closer,' with old world rage
The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time
Mrs
Ganush furiously pulls on the door handle to no,avail
beat you, you old bitch
Next time take your Geretol
The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view
Stephanie looks about
Where'd she go
The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete and
Stephanie  as the window shatters
The old woman's head juts into the cart She clamps her toothless maw down upon Stephanie
's chin
Suckling it, gumming
The old woman's good eye rolls about in ecstacy
Stephanie  as she pushes the slobbering head away
Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old woman's mouth to Ste phanie's jaw
The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat
She finds her dentures, now damaged from the fight
She as she jams them back into her mouth
She comes at Stephanie, mouth wide open and
Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and shoves it down the old lady's throat
Mrs
Ganush gags, trying to retch up the ruler
21
Then Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself, as the old 1 Woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the car
Stephanie hits the pavement
She shields her face with her hands, waiting, but the blow never comes
The old woman standing above her,
You shamed me
The Old Woman reaches down
Stephanie flinches
Mrs
'Ganush's gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of Stephanie's coat
She waves the button through the air, and breathes out a single word: Lamia
Clouds move past the setting Sun
shadow falls over Stephanie
cold wind makes her shiver
What--
What are you doing
Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button
But the old woman 1 moves it out of reach
You want it
Stephanie snatches the button back
Mrs
Ganush smiles cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat pocket
Soon it will be you, who comes begging to me
It begins tonight when you hear the cry
What cry
The Lamia
It's coming for you
large black,  fly lands on Stephanie's face
She swats it away
Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy
She leans against the car for support
When she finally looks up, Mrs
Ganush is gone
22
- '  - Stephanie and Ray have just finished filing a report with What about a restraining order
Well that's usually only something we do if there's a pattern of harassment
But like  said, we'll file a report and keep it on record in case you do have a continuing problem
But once we send an officer around to have a word with, her,  don't think she'll be bothering you again
Thank you, you've been very helpful
- Stephanie and Ray eat ice cream cones as they walk past the shops
just thank God you're okay
You are okay, right
'm fine
Ray waits, sensing that there's more to it
Your fine, but
-- It's just that  could have gotten her another extension
But didn't
Loo]
You said the bank had already granted her two extensions

breeze
She shivers
He wraps his arms around her protectively and after a moment, they walk on
Stephanie watches wistfully as a   coo over their
Behind the couple, Stephanie notices a neon sign in a storefront window
It reads:
Let's get our fortune's read
You're kidding right
She cajoles a protesting Ray through the front door of the establishment
- tiny waiting room
poster on the wall indicating the energy meridians of the human body
just hope to God none of my students see me here
Five bucks says he's wearing a turban
beaded curtain parts, revealing
Rham Jas, a small, dark skinned, fifty year old Indian man
He wears a plain black suit and a white turban
His inquisitive eyes evaluate the couple
am Rham Jas
Seer
How do you do
'm Stephanie Brown and this is Ray
But you probably already knew that
Just kidding
Rham Jas gives Ray a tight smile
24
How can  help you
We'd like to have our fortunes read
Can you do that
Read the future
have the ability to see certain energies
Sometimes these ' energies are a foretoken of things to come
Sometimes not
Sixty dollars, please
Sixty dollars
Isn't that a little steep for this kind of thing
Then go
There are many who would claim to be seers
But they are not
Although you would pay them little
you would receive nothing
If you
are not serious, go
Rham Jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain
Wait
She removes some bills from her purse but Ray waves her off, handing Rham Jas a credit card
Platinum card
Very good
He swipes Ray's card through the credit card machine
Rham Jas'   - sparsely furnished, dimly lit room
The walls are lined with old books
Rham Jas stands before Stephanie and Ray, who sit at a card table
Stephanie giggles with excitement
Sorry
Rham Jas smiles back
25
That's quite all right
So, you wish to know something of your destiny
Very good
We shall see what the fates have in store
Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains
Freud said destiny was not an act of fate but rather something created by our subconscious to control our conscious choices
That is true
But
"We should not pretend to understand the world only by intellect
" Carl Jung
Yes
From his treatise "Psychological types"
Ray studies this strange man as he strikes a match and lights a candle
There's more to him than meets the eye
Ray brushes it off
Jung-- the New Agers' favorite psychologist
Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation
Rham Jas takes a seat at the table, across from Stephanie
Your hand, please
Stephanie extends her hand to Rham Jas
He closes his eyes and concentrates
Stephanie smiles excitedly to Ray, who raises a skeptical eyebrow
You,work with money
26
That's right
4 But
you've lost something
No
don't think so
No
No, you're right
Something's been taken from you
No, - Rham Jas grabs her arm and turns it, revealing the threads
that once held the button on her coat sleeve
button
Well, yes
Some Old Woman
Well anyone can see she lost a button
So what
But Ray, it was very strange
At the bank today
The old woman
the one  told you about
she plucked the button right from my sleeve
Why would she do that
If you would please, both be quiet
Rham Jae concentrates, his eyelids flutter
Stephanie appears uneasy
The flame of the candle begins to flicker as a breeze sweeps through the room
The wind chimes
Ray pulls his collar closed against the sudden chill in the air
Rham Jas's back stiffens
27
He releases Stephanie's hand and stands
He moves away from the table, uncomfortable
With a handkerchief,' he dabs perspiration from his brow
think that is enough for now
Wait
You saw something
What
'm sorry
'm tired and  see it's become quite late
Of course  will refund your money
Tell me
Please
Rham Jas hesitates, then
bad spirit has come upon you
How
Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a grave site
No
Do you play with Ouija board or confer with those who practice the black arts
What is this
No
No,  didn't
Then perhaps someone has cursed you
Who
0 28
Rham Jas turns her wrist, exposing the loose threads on her coat sleeve
where the brass button once was
-- Ray and Stephanie cruise along the dark, winding hills
Ray looks over at Stephanie
How did he know all that
Know what
That you lost,a button
1 He makes some good guesses, stirs you up, leaving you with a lot of questions
And conveniently, his business card
'mon, he's a scam artist
He didn't want the money
He tried to give the money back
In the end, he took it, didn't he
guess so
'  - Ray and Stephanie step from the car
They open a rusting iron gate, and walk up the hilly path to Stephanie's slightly funky Silver Lake rental house
'  -  - Ray and Stephanie step inside
The kitten  around Stephanie's feet
Ray picks it up
So this is him
Got a name
Uh
just "Kitty" so far
29
She takes the cat from Ray, cuddles it
Sure you don't want me to spend the night
Don't tempt me
've got to prep a presentation for the morning
okay
Ray kisses her, opens the front door and exits
He calls back to her from his car: Remember, dinner at my folk's house, tomorrow night
We're supposed to bring desert
could pick something up
No
'm planning on baking my special cake
Sounds good
Try not to stay up too late
Ray waves and steps into his car
Stephanie watches him drive off
'  -  - Stephanie site at the kitchen table in her flannel pajamas, entering financial data into her laptop
An episode of "Desperate Housewives" plays in the background on baking timer
Stephanie removes a beautifully browned cake from the oven and sets it on the counter to cool
Her roommate, , comes down the stairs, snuggling the kitten
Isn't he adorable
Let's hope the landlord thinks so
She sets down,the kitten and picks up her overnight bag
0 30
What about you
You going to be okay
You know,  don't have to go out tonight
No, 'm fine
Have a good time
Do  look great
Be honest
You look great
Ellen smiles, grabs her car keys and heads for the door
But
Isn't that Marci's dress
Yeah
And if she calls, tell her not to go bi-polar on me, 'll'get it back to her by tomorrow
Or the next day
Bye
Ellen exits
Stephanie places butter into a mixer for the cake frosting
Through the kitchen window we can see Ellen walking down the path, toward the street
She steps through the iron gate, latching it closed behind her
'  - Ellen's car pulls away
The wind kicks up, whisking leaves about, as though something where moving up the path and toward the front gate of the house
'  -  - An unsettling
what the hell was that
Stephanie sets down the measuring cup
She moves to the front door
Locks it
She looks out the kitchen window
The iron
gate is now open
It  as it swings back and forth in the wind
31
Suddenly, the latch gives way and the windows swing open
1 Wind sweeps through the kitchen, whipping dead leaves about
The hanging pans bang together
Stephanie forces the windows closed
The wind dies
The room grows eerily quiet
car passes in the street below
It's headlights sweep across the house
The headlight beams throw moving shadows on the wall
Stephanie notices that one particular shadow is darker than the others
It becomes the silhouette of Mrs
Ganush, but there's no one in the room with her
The car passes and the shadows vanish
Sensing something, the Kitten arches it's back
Now Stephanie feels it
presence
The light bulb begins to sputter
She holds her breath, listens
The floorboards
Something is walking towards her
She spins around, but there's nothing there
The  of footsteps drawing closer
She backs against the wall, trembling
Suddenly Stephanie's face is struck by an invisible hand
She cries out
Her mouth is bleeding
She runs for the door
She's almost there
Her hand reaches for the knob, when something unseen picks her up
She as she is thrown against the wall
She falls to the floor
Lifting her head, she catches her own reflection in the : In the reflection, as the light bulb flickers, we see a flash of ghostly hands that grope at her body
They reach up through the floor, and clutch at her legs, buttocks and breasts
Get off me
Get off
The phantom hands vanish
Stephanie looks about, eyes wild
'  - 32
Stephanie is wearing Ray's overcoat atop her pajamas
She nervously paces the room
Ray hurries in, handing her a pack of frozen peas that she presses against her bloody lip
So she came to your house
This is crazy
'm calling that police officer
He begins to dial but Stephanie stops him
Ray, you're not listening
It wasn't her
It was something that she sicked on me
don't understand
didn't tell you the whole story
That old woman
after she knocked me down, and pulled the button from my coat, she told me that
What
She said that something was coming for me
and it did
Ray stares at her with concern
'  - , wearing jeans and a  basketball sweatshirt, concludes his interview with Stephanie
He carries a small black medical bag as he steps from the living room to speak with Ray
Ray, you were right to call me
Never a good idea to be personally involved with your patient
What do you think
33
1b Medically, she's fine
She's just very distraught
She's displaying some paranoia and a sense of panic
Classic symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder
Probably a result of being assaulted by that old woman
Doctor Rangavertz scribbles out a prescription and hands it to Ray
How worried should  be
We'll have to wait and see
'  - 'Stephanie lays peacefully in bed, almost asleep
bottle of sedatives on the bedside table
Ray pulls up the blanket around her exposed shoulder
Stephanie sighs, turns to him
How you doing
Better now
At the time it just seemed so real
'm so embarrassed
Don't be, you had a terrible day and you
got a little wigged out
It happens
po, what now, Doc
was gonna surprise you, but what the hell
've been planning a little trip for us this week end
Saturday morning we're taking a train to Santa Barbara
Really
34
My family owns a cabin up there
In, the hills
Overlooking this little river
We'll light a fire, drink some champagne and screw our brains out
You sure know how to talk to a girl
It's a chance to just be together
Undisturbed
There's a lot of stuff want to talk to you abqut but it never seems to be the right time
Sounds nice
She draws in a deep breath and for the first time that evening, she looks at peace
Ray watches, her as she closes her eyes and drifts off to sleep
'  - Tweeting birds and filtered sunlight streaming in through the window, awaken Stephanie
She stretches and looks to the empty pillow next to her
Ray is gone
She tries to fall back asleep, but the sound of a dripping faucet keeps her awake
Frustrated, she gets out of bed and steps into the bathroom
clamp around Stephanie's throat, violently her
You shamed mel to: Ray  her
Steph
Wake Upl 35
She awakens in her bed,
10 40 Oh my God: Oh Godl It was just a dream
It's okay
She gets control
Ray smooths out the tangled hair from her sweaty face
He looks deeply into her eyes, afraid of what's happening to her
The phone in the next room,
'Ray looks over, decides to ignore it
It keeps
Go ahead
'll be right back
He steps into the next room and we hear him answer the phone
Stephanie sighs and lays back down
next to Mrs
Ganush
The Old Woman is covered in
a swarm of
Stephanie The Old Woman opens her maw, exposing sharp broken teeth
She lunges for Stephanie
Stephanie grabs the old woman by her hair, halting the chomping teeth inches from her face
She tries to push Mrs
Ganush away
But the Old Woman's yellowed teeth  and press ever closer
The muscles in Stephanie's arms are trembling
She is weakening
Mrs
Ganush, closes in, about to clamp her teeth down upon Stephanie's face when-- Stephanie suddenly awakens with a
It was all a dream within a dream
She bolts up out of bed
Takes her bearings
She's alone in Ray's bedroom
She checks the bathroom
Under the bed
All normal
Ray enters
You, okay
36
No
No-- Oh my God
had some 4 dreams
Awful
Want to tell me about them
The old lady
She was here couldn't wake up
Stephanie shakes her head
She can't finish
Ray pulls back the drapes
Sunlight pours into the room
Stephanie tries to put the dream out of her mind
Ray sits next to her, strokes her hair
Doctor Rangervertz said you could stop by his office during your lunch hour
Stephanie nods
- Ray's car stops in front of the Bank
' Stephanie looks across the street to the parking structure
Her car is there
The window has been replaced
had them replace the window last night
Still needs some body work
- Thank you, Ray
She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath
We've got to be prepared that it might take some time for you to get over this
She nods
--  4 37
Stephanie enters the bank
She guilty glancep to the clock
It's 9:40
She's late
She tries to be discreet as she moves to her desk, hoping Mr
Jacks won't notice
She's almost there when Stu Rubin "accidently" knocks a note book off his desk
Mr
Jacks glances up and notes Stephanie's tardiness
Stu approaches Stephanie's desk
Hi Steph
Just getting here
What are you, the hall monitor
Ha ha
You're funny, Steph
What do you want
need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures
've got a lot on my mind
Let's do it tomorrow
Sure
'll just tell Mr
Jacks that you don't have the time right now
Maybe he can show me
She glances up
Mr
Jacks'is still watching her
No, no, that's all right
'll do it
Where were we
We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines
Right
Okay
Let's say your client is a company that can't get traditional bank financing but 10 needs a secured loan
We offer-- 38
Stephanie looks around for the source of the sound, but can't find it
Yeah
uh, we offer several types of asset-based lending which consist of revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivables, their inventory, machinery-- , Stephanie sees
That Stu's hand has been replaced by
'
it's yellowed fingernails  across her desk
She looks again, and Stu's hand has returned to normal
---and
(in her full Missouri twang) --And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk
Stu is taken aback by Stephanie's outburst
He retreats to his desk in confusion
Stephanie sits, rattled
drop of blood falls onto a piece of paper on her desk
The blood is trickling from her nose
Stephanie grabs a tissue to halt the bleeding
She looks down to see a large black fly land upon the drop of blood
She gasps and stands, her mind racing
She knows what she must do
She finds Mrs
Ganush's loan documents
She stuffs them into a folder, grabs her purse and bolts for the exit
Mr
Jacks engaged with a customer, calls after her: Stephanie
Where are you going
She moves quickly out the door, pretending not to hear him
39
Stu watches Stephanie go and gets up from his desk
She's left some files behind
He snoops around his desk
He notices a folder marked
It's the McPherson loan file
Interesting
He picks it up
'  - An old, wood bungalow that has seen better days in the driveway
Stephanie's car pulls up
she steps out, carrying Mrs
Ganush's loan documents
She passes the   who load the last of Mrs
Ganush's things
She arrives at the opened front door, gathers her courage and No answer
She calls out: Mrs
Ganush
No answer
She steps inside
5 5 '  - It's dark and musty here
The place is barren but for some flattened cardboard boxes
Stephanie tries the light switch
No Power
Mrs
Ganush
' She moves forward into the living room
'   - Its too dark to see much of anything
Stephanie stumbles over something left on the floor
voice: knew you'd come
Stephanie almost jumps out of her skin
As her eyes adjust she sees Mrs
Ganush sitting on a crate in the corner of the room
Her arthritic hands clutching a yellowed photograph
40
Hi
'm here because  think  can help you
can get your house back for you
It's so empty now
can arrange for all your furniture to be brought back
Would that be okay
Mrs Ganush does not look up from the photograph
So
on behalf of the bank  just want to resolve this to your satisfaction
This whole thing got personal and there was really no reason for that
The bank made a mistake and  can fix it for you and in return 'd like you to- cancel or call off, whatever you
you know-- that thing you did to me
Okay
No hard feelings
So
My mother was a proud woman
Dignity
That's what she had
Stephanie nods
Waits an appropriate moment, then: places the document gently down on the floor next to Mrs
Ganush
All you need to do is
sign here
Stephanie offers her a pen
and 'll take care of the rest
Mrs
Ganush's hard eyes find Stephanie's
They bore in
No
41
No
But
'm saying 'll make things right
Just sign this and you can keep the house
Isn't that what you wanted
It was what  wanted before you shamed me
Now  want to see you suffer
Please
've suffered enough
Not yet
Mrs
Ganush suddenly erupts in a broken toothed
You're insane
Just
just a crazy old woman
don't even know why came here
1 You know why
Terrified, Stephanie runs from the place
'  - The Old Woman's  can still be heard as Stephanie hurries to her car and drives off
- Stephanie site in her parked car
' Stephanie is eating from a package of   , joylessly jamming one after another into her mouth
Her eyes dart about: Who could help her
Then she remembers something
She sets down the cookies and rummages through her purse
She finds the business card of Rham Jas
She starts the car and drives off
- 42
Stephanie halts at a red light
out of the corner of her eye she sees something odd
'  - Stu Rubin walking with two well dressed executives
Stu
The men warmly escort into the First National Bank
What's he doing at First National
The car behind her
She drives on
'  - Stephanie's car is parked in the street
- Stephanie stands before a counter facing Rham Jas
He swipes her credit card through the machine
She signs the receipt
He motions for her to follow him through the beaded curtain
Jas'  - on a plain wooden table
a samovar brews a musty tea
Rham Jas is reading from an ancient text
He looks up from the book,- solemn
What did it sound like
Like
shrieking
It was awful
He nods
Closes the book
That would be the Lamia
The "Black Goat"
43
Lamia
Right
That's the word the old woman used
It is a nasty spirit
taker of souls
creature of misfortune for you and those around you
It is often summoned by the Gypsies for their dour deeds
On the third day the Lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object
Accursed object
What object
Something that the old woman took from you, cursed, then gave back
Now it dawns on Stephanie
She looks to the threads on her coat
The button
Stephanie's hand slowly emerges from her coat pocket
The thin brass button in her palm
this
She holds the button up for him to inspect
But it's presence makes him uneasy
He wags his finger back and forth
She lowers it
What if  just burn the thing
No matter what condition the button is in, you would still be the owner
The Lamia would still come to take you
Take me where
44
Rham Jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text
She knows where
Stymied, she tucks the button back into her coat pocket
There's got to be something  can do
Yes
There are many ways to appease a spirit
The simplest is a blood offering
An animal sacrifice small creature would do
You could sacrifice a chicken
It's all in here
Rham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he sets before her
No way
'm a vegetarian
'm a member of , for Christ's sake
don't go around killing animals
You will be surprised what you will be willing to do when the Lamia comes for you
She considers his words, looks down to the book
-  creature's heart being cut from it's body
pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her kitchen table, reading the book
We see other diagrams: The heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire
The burial of the smoking heart
Stephanie's kitten , as it rubs against her leg
Stephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing images
She hears the  of the rusty gate outside
She moves to the window and peers out
The rusting iron gate is open
Stephanie senses a change in the room
Shadows shift and grow deeper
The air is suddenly oppressive
Something is coming
45
She moves to the front door and puts her ear to it
Quiet
1b But then-- She runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door
' She can hear the sound of the , even here
, She rushes to the phone picks it up: No dial tone, only high pitched static, the sounds of the Lamia buried within
She sets the phone down
For a moment all is quiet
Should she go back down
Then she hears a tiny
The knob on the front door, turning
Then the  of the lock, followed by the  of rusty hinges as the front door swings open
She calls through her bedroom door
Ellen
But it's not Ellen
Stephanie puts her,ear to the door
The sound of an animal's hooves on wood
Something is climbing the stairs
It stops outside her bedroom door
Stephanie holds her breath, listening
She sees a shadow beneath the crack in the door
know that you're there
The window behind her explodes into the room with a deafening She ducks for cover
Another window is blown inward and the glass sent her way
She  and runs toward the bathroom door
It  shut in her face
Another window is  by the angry, unseen thing
The force knocks her to the bed
The blankets are torn from the mattress, throwing Stephanie to the floor
The bedsheets whisk around the room, flapping and twisting about like 1b drunken ghosts
46
She tries to run but they tangle around her legs and yank her into the air, suspending her upside down, taking her on a wild and harrowing ride about the room
Abruptly all the madness halts: She drops to the floor
The bedsheet wafts to the ground beside her
Whatever it was, it's gone
It's quiet now
terrified Stephanie sits, shaking, in the wreckage of her room
'  - With a trembling hand, she jams a   into her mouth, and drops the wrapper onto a pile of others on the floor
She chases it with a double shot of Maker's Mark Whiskey
She removes a knife from the butcher block and hefts
it's weight
She sings out, in a sweet but trembling voice
Here kitty-kitty
Here, kitty- kitty-kitty
She moves closer until her face fills the screen
'  - The distant  of the kitten is heard
We hear it again and again until it is finally silenced
4 - Stephanie having been sick, emerges from the bathroom, wiping her mouth
'  - Stephanie throws something small and bloody inside the microwave oven and turns it on
' She buries the heart in a corner of her garden
She turns on the garden hose, washing the cat's blood from the knife
' Steph
Stephanie quickly tosses the knife into the bushes
Ellen appears
47
Didn't you hear me calling
was looking all over for you
Are you power eating Clark bars again
'Cause there's about ten thousand wrappers all over the-- Oh my God, is that blood
1 Stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden
But no blood shows
No
Why would there be blood
Right there, on your sleeve
Stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve
That's just tomato juice
was inside making a salad and
cut a tomato and  must have gotten it on my sleeve
Ellen gives her roommate a worried look
Look, Steph, we're friends so if something's wrong
had some problems
situation
But  think everything is going to be good now
Ellen isn't so sure
'  - Stephanie closes her bedroom door so Ellen can't see the damage
Stephanie cleans up the place
As she picks up some of her things, she comes across an old photograph
: It's a photo of 16 year old Stephanie
She was obese
Her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a "4- " tee shirt
She stands before some barnyard animals, a bucket of feed in her hand
48
Stephanie looks distastefully down at her former self
She tears up the photo and dumps it in the waste basket
-- The music grows lighter as Stephanie models a couple of dresses in front of Ellen, who's helping decide on the evening's wardrobe
Go with the short skirt
What about this one
She hold up a longer, more formal dress
Uh uh
That one's saying "'m trying to impress you with my conservative taste
" But that's what  want it to say
Ellen shakes her head, no
Stephanie takes a last look in the mirror, decides to go with the short skirt
Okay
This is it
Tell me again
the exact words he used
Just that this little cabin would be a great place for us to really connect and that there was something he'd been meaning to talk about with me
Oh my god, you are so engaged
Ellen's smile fades
She shakes her head despondently
What's wrong 49
just know that Rob's never going to ask me
But  thought you said that relationship was only physical
Oh, 'd never marry a guy like that
but 'd still like him to ask me
Huh
- Stephanie's car pulling up in front of Ray's hillside house
The convertible top is down and Stephanie looks radiant in the golden sunlight
' Let's get a look at that dress
She steps from the car and models the dress You like like
'  - drive through the streets of Bel Air, Stephanie at the wheel
She tunes in a rock station and turns it up loud
She smiles at Ray and takes his hand
She hits the gas and her Ford Focus opens up, accelerating down a long, tree lined street, the wind blowing through their hair
- Stephanie and Ray approach the front door
Stephanie carries her home made cake
They ring the bell
Stephanie suddenly seems apprehensive
50
Something wrong
It's just that 'm not, some ivy leaguer with an impressive resume
have a feeling that's what your folks really want
Maybe
But in the end, it's about what you and  want
Is that so
Ray gives her a reassuring nod
The front door opens revealing Ray's parents, Behind them we glimpse an exquisitely furnished foyer
She kisses her son
Stephanie, this is my mother, Trudy, and my Father, George
Trudy glances at Stephanie's revealing cocktail dress with thinly veiled disapproval
Stephanie self-consciously tugs it lower
How do you do
Nice tp meet you, Stephanie
It's very nice to meet you, too
Please, come in
Thank you
'51
She steps inside
' You have a lovely home
Thanks
'll get us something to drink
As George exits, Stephanie presents her home made cake to Trudy
hope you don't mind
baked something for you
Trudy hesitates, then takes the cake from Stephanie
It's lovely
Homemade
It's a harvest cake
Harvest cake
Is'that some kind of cake you make on a
farm
We used to, yeah, when you have a lot of extra duck eggs
Especially right before spring; that's when you get a real dense yolk
Makes for, rich cake
The mother forces a smile
You must give me the recipe sometime
Sure
It's easy
The real secret's in the milk
You want it unpasteurized
52
Unclean
Uh
mean "unpasteurized"
Is that safe
Uh huh
And you want that milk still warm
Straight from the cow
Trudy has to stifle her gag reflex
George returns and hands Ray and Stephanie a cocktail
Excuse me while  go find someplace to put this
As Trudy takes away the cake, a cat rounds the corner
It at Stephanie
She takes a step back
Never could understand that damned animal
Hate cats
Trudy returns from the kitchen
That's strange
Hecuba's usually very sweet
That's okay
had a cat understand
What do you mean "had a cat"
What happened to him
How would  know what happened
Probably nothing
You know how cats are
They come and they go
Ray nods slowly
About to say something but let's it go
-   - Stephanie, Ray, George and Trudy are finishing dinner
53
Still keeping up with your coin collection, Ray
try to
In fact Stephanie just found me a 1925 Indian Head nickel at her bank
Really
So, how long have you been working there, Stephanie
Almost two years now
The job of a bank teller must be so difficult
'd think with all the counting and the repetition, it'd become so tedious
Yes, you're right
But 'm not a teller
Oh
Stephanie's a loan officer in charge of small business and home loans
And she's on a fast track for a promotion
Right, Steph
'd like to think so
actually, It depends
If  could close this big account that 'm working on, it would really help
Must be a very important loan
It would be the biggest that my branch has ever handled
How''d it come to you
54
Well,  was reading the Wall Street Journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was interested in expanding but didn't have the liquidity
met with their  and presented a formula for restructuring-some of their long term debt
It created an environment where  was able to offer them a rather attractive loan You sure sound like you've got a lot going for you, Stephanie
Your mother must be very proud
suppose
don't see her much
Why is that
Well, ever since my dad died she doesn't talk much
She mostly stays on the farm and
keeps to herself
Because
There is an awkward silence
Does your mother have a drinking problem
Cut her some slack, mom, she-- Yes
'm afraid she does
'm sorry
It's nothing to be ashamed of
And  find your honesty refreshing
Thank you
5
5
You've got back bone
Not like that other girl Ray brought by
What was her name
Alicia
She was dreadful
So ill-mannered
And no ambition
- (stage whisper to ) He found her through the,internet
Mors, please
Stephanie, am  being too tough on Ray
Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at Ray
No
Not at all
That's what mom's are for
Thank you, Stephanie
Maybe  will try that Harvest cake of yours, after all
Trudy cuts herself a piece
Stephanie tastes the cake and emits a tiny cough
Excuse me
She clears her throat
But the cough returns, grows larger
Just a little tickle in my-- She stands and takes a few steps away from the table
Ray looks on concerned
Are you okay
56
She waves him off, clearing her throat
Tries to smile demurely, but erupts with a harsh cough
She's choking on something and is trying to bring it up from deep within her throat
With all her might she emits a  and a large black fly buzzes out of her mouth
Oh
The fly lazily  across the table, slowly circling Trudy's head
Trudy spits out a mouthful of harvest cake into her napkin
George lowers his fork and pushes away his plate of unclean farm cake
Ray is baffled, too stunned to speak
Stephanie's gaze shifts to the kitchen door
From The other side, she hears the sound of a hoofs
Ray tries to cover for Stephanie: 'm so sorry, Stephanie
don't know how that fly got
into your-- --Wait
What's that sound
What sound-
Listen
Trudy listens along with the others
They can't hear anything
But Stephanie hears the  drawing closer
'm sorry,  can't hear anything
(mutters under her breath) Must be deafer than a post
But Trudy heard that and takes offense
But before she can say anything, a  appears at the base of the door
Stephanie stands and shouts at it: 57
Leave me alone
Just leave me the fuck alone
Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past Trudy's head
It shatters against the base of the door, spraying everyone with bits of broken china and fish
The shadow and  are gone
Ray rushes to her side
Steph, it's okay
There's nothing there
She looks about
George and Trudy regard Stephanie as if she were mad
think 'd better go
think that's best, dear
She heads for the door
Ray starts to go after her but his mother stops him
Let her go, Ray
She's a sick girl
She needs me
Trudy grabs Ray's arm
'm telling you not to go after her
Ray gently pulls free of his mother's grasp and chases after Stephanie
- Ray rushes outside stopping Stephanie as she is about to get into her car
What did you see in there
58
You don't want to know
Ray pulls her close
Tell me
The thing that's coming for me
What the old woman sent
Listen to me
What you're going through right now-- It's like the doctor said, it's a stress reaction and -- No
wanted to believe that-- but it's real, Ray
You just don't want to open your eyes to it because it threatens you
Because if 'm right and there is something out there, then you'd have to throw out everything you teach
And where'd that leave you
Like a plow without a mule
Ray just stares at her
long moment passes as he wonders if maybe she isn't right
Unless you're willing to take a chance and believe in me,  can't be with you any more
She steps into the car and drives off
Ray watches her tail lights, as they vanish into the night
- An older home with bars on the front windows
Stephanie knocks at the front door
She turns toward a distant sound:  chilling, high-pitched Was it just a bus's air brakes
or something more
When Stephanie turns back, the door has been opened a crack
An  peers out at her
59
What is it
Hi
Yes
came to see Sylvia Ganush
Is she here
The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old Gypsy girl
Bottle of beer in her hand, long black hair, earrings and a snake tatoo on'her neck
She wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts
and  are heard from within the house
'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter
Who are you
Stephanie Brown
'm
sort of
a friend of hers
Actually, 've been trying to help her with a loan - Wait
know who you are
Grandma told me you'd come
You're the woman from the bank
The one who took her house
It was really the bank that took the house
just work there
In fact,  tried to help your grandma get-the house back, but my boss wouldn't let me
Ilenka knows she's lying
Stephanie knows that she knows
That's not what happened, is it
Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face
no
You used to be a real fat girl, to didn't you
60
Yes
can tell
You know, you caused my grandma a lot of pain
That house was her pride
When you took that from her, she had nothing left
You're not welcome here
She starts to close the door
Stephanie halts her
Desperate now, no where else to turn
Okay
did it
It was me who denied her the loan
was trying, to get ahead at work and shouldn't have done it
It was wrong
Damn straight it was wrong
And 'm ashamed about it
And 'm going to get down on my hands and knees and beg her to forgive me
She said-that  hadn't suffered enough
But now  think she'll see that  have and then maybe she'll let me
make everything all right for her, is that it
Yes
Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic smile
She motions for Stephanie to follow
They enter a room filled with young Gypsies drinking, smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic tongue
shouts as she throws a pair of dice Hungarian man with a long, braided ponytail, curses his bad luck as he pays cash to the woman
' Where is she
61
Ilenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers
Stephanie t pushes her way through the crowd
She stumbles and falls atop the Corpse of Mrs
Ganush
As per the custom of the Gypsy wake, there is no coffin, just her dead body that rests atop a coffee table
Stephanie has landed atop the corpse
The leg of the coffee table breaks under the weight of the two women
Stephanie tumbles to the ground, the corpse landing atop her
The crowd of mourners
The dead woman's opened mouth bobs up and down upon Stephanie's chin, as through it were once again suckling it
Stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in revulsion
Still going to make everything all right
The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table
Ilenka addresses the crowd in Hungarian
She tells them that it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother t from her home and that she now bears the curse of Lamia
mother shields her daughter's eyes from the sight of Stephanie, the cursed one, then hurriedly kisses her crucifix
man spits at her feet then walks off
No, please--  needed her to take this thing off me
It will never come off
You know about it
Then, please help me
'm begging you
She said you'd come begging
only wish she could have lived to see it
The blood drains from Stephanie's face
62
maybe she can
Stephanie glances down to the corpse
It's head is now facing her
It's dead eyes,
'  -- Stephanie puts her foot through  Jas'  set
Shattering the tube, commanding his
attention
Fuck that
paid you a hundred and seventy nine dollars for that book
It was a limited printing
Please control yourself
did what you said- that blood offering
killed that little kitty deader than Hogan's goat
Lotta good that did me
We are dealing with elusive and powerful forces
There are no guarantees
She wants to shout, but instead, closes her eyes and sits
Just tell me what to do
Rham Jas considers
dark look crosses his face
Stephanie tries to read his expression
' It's run through the carbon paper
Rham Jas hand her a receipt
She signs it
He sits
We must somehow dissuade the spirit from taking your soul
How
63
1  seance
And it should be soon
For tomorrow will be the third night
Have you done this before
No
But  know someone
can arrange what is necessary, but you must understand that everyone involved in this would be taking a great risk with their lives
What would you need from me
Rham Jas thinks for a moment, weighing the dangers
He pulls out a pipe and packs it with tobacco
He tamps it down and lights up
Twenty thousand dollars
Cash
By tomorrow
5 '  - Stephanie is hastily piling all her valuables atop her bed: sporting equipment, , / ,  player, , Etc
Ellen enters, rattled
need to talk to you
Ellen
'm sorry
This a bad time right now
got a little emergency and
say you got any cash  can borrow
She starts stuffing the valuables into a large duffle bag
No,  don't
But Steph -- --what about your credit cards
What's your cash advance limit
() 64
(cont'd) 'll pay you back
You know 'm good for it
Steph, we need to talk about the cat
Where has that little rascal been
He's always running off, have you noticed that
Stephanie
was in the back yard and  saw where the ground was dug up
started digging and
You buried that little kitty in our backyard
What happened
didn't want to tell you
It fell out the window and died
It's sad, -- found the bloody knife in the bushes
What are you, a cat detective
Steph
'm going to tell you this as your friend
There is something seriously wrong with you
Stephanie looks up from,her frantic panting
Uh
Duhi 'm moving out
can't live like this
Fine
Ellen exits
Stephanie angrily calls after her: 65
An' don't let the barn door hit you on your ass on yer way out
- Stephanie is speaking into a pay phone
can't get the twenty thousand
You're gonna have to help me with what 've got
' What do you have
She covers the mouthpiece, speaking to someone off camera
How much
to reveal that we are'in a
Men haggle loudly in Arabic over the price of a gold chain
The stands before-all of Stephanie's worldly belongings:  toaster oven, computer, racing bike, stereo, microwave oven, necklaces, jewelry
Thirty-eight hundred for everything
Including my jewlery
Including
Stephanie curses under her breath, checks the balance on her checkbook, does the math, speaks into the phone; Six thousand
'm sorry
Not possible
Look, 'll give you six now and-- 66
No
There will be others involved and  cannot-ask them to accept such a risk for less
Good night
He hangs up
The line goes dead
She tries to throw the phone but it's attached with a short metal cord
She turns to the Pawn Broker
'll take it
Stephanie thinks about how she'll get the extra cash
She hesitantly dials a number on the pay phone
It rings and rings as she glances to a picture buried deep in her wallet: photo of
The younger, obese Stephanie and her stern looking Mother
Both stand before a bleak snow covered, mid-western farm
Mom
Hi, it's me
Did you get,the Christmas card
Yeah,  guess it has been a while
Listen, 'm in kind of a fix, here
've been pretty sick and  need to borrow some money for an operation
need fourteen thousand dollars right away
Now  know you still have that pension fund at the credit Union so-- yeah, but
okay
Okay, it's just that---  understand
Okay, mom
Bye
The line goes dead
She slumps down against the pay phone
- She pouts her lips in the mirror, carefully applying lipstick
Looking good
To reveal we are in the employee bathroom at the bank
She fixes her hair so it's just right
She
straightens out a tiny wrinkle in her business suit, smiles her best upbeat smile and exits the bathroom
67
- Stephanie approaches Mr
Jacks
Mr
Jacks, this is kind of awkward for me
know it's not official yet, but  was wondering if  could get a copy of the employment contract for the new position you offered me
The assistant manager's position
Yes
See, one of my family members is having a little emergency which requires me to get them an immediate loan-- --Stephanie
There's a problem
The McPherson deal was cancelled last night
What
1 Yeah, right after  informed the main branch that we had this big loan pending,, find out that they just made their deal over at First National
got a call in to see, what exactly happened but right now this doesn't look too good for you or me
So this assistant manager promotion has been delayed
In fact,  think that with everything that's been happening, 'm gonna have to give that job to Stu
Stephanie is devastated
Stu
see
Mr
Jacks sees tears begin to well up in her eyes
68
'm sorry
Look
If you've got family problems
Maybe you should take the day off and sort them out
Stephanie node and exits the bank
'  - - As it  away the seconds
-  Inadequate That site atop Stephanie's Kitchen table
- stares down at the cash
Her mouth mechanically opens to accept a large serving spoon of Rocky Road ice cream which she eats directly from the one gallon tub
The door bell rings
moment later Ray walks in
Stephanie stands, surprised
paid Rham Jas But  thought you didn't believe
' don't
But you do
know this is important for, you
she embraces him
- An old Pasadena home site alone atop a hill
Ray's car drives up, parks
Are you coming in
69
wanted to but Rham Jas said non believers weren't welcome
still don't like this
know how crazy this must seem
But it will all be over after this swear to you
He nods
She kisses him
'll call you when it's done
'll be waiting
We'll laugh about it on the train, tomorrow
t Yeah
Stephanie steps from the car
Ray drives off
She turns to face the old house
-  - Milos, a thirty year old, Hungarian Man, leads Stephanie into a large room with-tall, teak bookshelves and Indian tapestries that adorn the walls
Rham Jas is seated in a wicker chair,' speaking with someone obscured by shadows
Miss Brown
Allow me the pleasure of an introduction
woman rises from the shadows
Shaun San Dena The eighty year old woman smiles a toothless smile to Stephanie
70
Shaun San Dena is an experienced 41 medium
Furthermore, she has a personal knowledge of the Lamia
first encountered this spirit forty years ago in a small village outside of Bucharest
And
lost a young boy's soul to the beast
That's reassuring
was an
inexperienced seer then
've learned much since that woeful day
have waited these long years for a chance at redeeming myself chance to destroy the foul thing
Tonight my chance will come
But to summon it,  will need your help
'll do whatever it takes
And the sooner the better
Our business must wait till darkness falls
Enough time for tea
- ceiling twenty feet high, with massive windows covered by dark burgundy drapes
An ornate crystal chandelier hangs above a round table in the room's center
Stephanie, Rham Jas, Shaun San Dena and Milos, are finishing their tea
My late husband, Sandor, was also a medium
He chose this site to build the'house upon because he sensed certain energies that intersected here
() 71
(cont'd) He knew  would sense his spirit in this place as  have sensed others
It was to be our way of being together after he died
In earlier times it was a sacred place to the Tuanteteck indians
And their stories told that the place was a burial ground of the "old ones" that inhabited the earth before them
Here, there is a particular alignment of energies confluence, that allows doorways to be opened
Through which, we might pass
' And through which, others might pass into our world
Milos removes the tea
It is time for us to begin
Shaun San Dena turns out the electric lights, leaving only the tables' candlelight for illumination
We hear the  of a goat
Stephanie startles
Milos reenters the room pulling a black goat along by a chain
The goat catches sight of Stephanie
It  in fear and attempts to run
But Milos holds it fast and tethers it to a post
He moves to the table and lifts a velvet cloth revealing a large cattle slaughtering blade
Lord Jesus bless this knife and allow it to do your holy work
She makes the sign of the cross
she pours a
vial of holy water over the blade
She turns to Stephanie
Once the spirit has entered me, place my hand upon the animal
Do you understand
Yes
72
will force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat
Milos, that's when you strike
Stephanie blanches but remains silent
We must all
be receptive
Shaun San Dena begins to intone a Romanian Gypsy chant
Stephanie leans close to speak quietly with Rham Jae
What do  have to do
You must allow the darkness in
You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit
'm scared
Yes
Now repeat these words welcome the dead into my soul
Rham Jae waits for Stephanie's response
She's shifts in her seat uncomfortably
welcome the dead into my soul
You must believe it
Stephanie takes a deep breath and they begin the chant again
This time,, together
welcome the dead into my  welcome the dead into my soul
soul
Stephanie looks around the darkened room
Shadows from the candles dance upon the walls
73
sense something here with us
Yes
The parlor's crystal chandeleir tinkles
tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment
Stephanie's eyes search the room
emits a wheezing breath
We hear  as something walks on the ceiling above them
' echoes about the room
It is not the Lamia
It is the spirit of some unsettled soul from years ago
The unsettled ones wait near the door
upon the table is drained
Then the water is spat out in a stream at Milos' face
The '  again
Be gone, foolish spirit
There is a    and the room is again quiet
Show yourself Lamia
We invite you into our circle
Quiet
Stephanie looks about
Nothing seems to be happening
He's coming
74
faint sound
The    on wood
sound that Stephanie's heard before
It grows louder, more distorted
Stephanie grips the table
And just when the   is deafening
All becomes silent
Stephanie holds her breath
wind whips up in the room sending papers whirling about,
yet all the windows are closed
Shaun San Dena's eyes roll up into her head
She emits a low and powerful
Her head slumps onto her shoulders
Then she straightens with a new vigor
Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as her lips move rapidly and a garbled sound comes out of her throat
she speaks in a strange and incomprehensible tongue
Who now inhabits the body of Shaun San Dena
(demonic voice) Lamia
Rham Jas nods discreetly to Milos who quietly uncovers the slaughtering blade
Lamia, what is it that you desire
Shaun San Dena's chair abruptly spins about to face Stephanie
The mouth jerks opened and closed as if controlled by a bad puppeteer
Then, out of
sync, the demonic voice is : (demonic voice) The soul of Stephanie Brownl We will feast upon it, as she festers in the gravel 75
It was my manager, Jim Jacks
He was the one
He-- Silence
Lamia, please, surely we can dissuade you from taking this insignificant woman
Surely she's not worthy of your greatness
The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs
(demonic voice) No
will enjoy watching her skin blister and pop in hell's flame come for her
Stephanie quickly grabs Shaun San Derna's hand and places it on the goat's head
Shaun San Dena's eyes clear for a moment as she struggles to regain control
Now there are two spirits battling within her
She attempts t to force the spirit of the Lamia from her body and into the goat
The Goat  and bucks wildly as the spirit is transferred
Milos raises up the slaughtering blade
(demonic voice) No
You-- (demonic voice) --tricked me
The possessed goat emits a terrible cry
The bone chilling of Lamia
It's oval eye reflects the blade as it descends toward it
The possessed Goat jerks aside and the blade misses, slicing into the chair
As Milos raises the blade for another blow, the goat bites his hand
In that moment, the spirit of the Lamia is transferred to him
Possessed Milos  and spins toward Stephanie, glaring at her with black goat eyes
He  at her in a gibberish of tongues
His body jerks up into the air
He dances a jig atop the table, now laughing uncontrollably
76
Stephanie watches in horror
Lamial  command you to leave this-- chair sails through the air and shatters across Rham Jas' back, knocking him to the ground
Milos' body is hurled up against the chandelier, shattering it
Glass rains down upon Stephanie
on the ceiling, Milos is spun
about like a pin wheel
Stephanie races for the door but a huge bureau lurches in front of her, blocking her path
Rham Jas rouses a stunned Shaun San Dena
You must banish the spirit
Shaun San Dena places her hands on her ayes, then over her heart and chants an ancient Gypsy incantation up toward Milos
Milos
white vapor streams from his body as the Lamia is torn from him
(in his normal voice) Stop the chanting
beg you
But Shaun San Dena only chants louder
Milos  grow more intense as-his body spasms in pain
Stephanie grasps at Shaun San Dena
For god's sake, stop the chanting, it's killing him
Rham Jas pushes her aside
You must not stop
withered pair of hands reach down from above and clutch at Stephanie's face
It is Mrs
Ganush that now floats above her
Her long yellowed fingernails scratching at Stephanie's skin
77
/ Make her stop, you dirty pork queen
No
Get her off
Mrs
Ganush grabs at Stephanie's head
Stephanie pulls away but it costs her a clump of hair that Mrs
Ganush rips from her head
Mrs
Ganush opens her mouth
wide
wider still
she vomits out Stephanie's dead cat
It lands atop the table
Stephanie screams uncontrollably
Shaun San Dena, is trembling as her chanting comes to a climax
Mrs
Ganush changes back to the possessed Milo
The last of the white vapor is torn from Milos body as the spirit of the Lamia leaves him
Milos falls to the floor and all is quiet
An ashen faced Shaun San Dena halts her chant
10 Is it gone
Stephanie notices that the cat has vanished
Was it ever there
Rham Jae kneels at Milos' side
He's starting to come around
Milos stands, shaken
The Lamia is gone
Shaun San Dena grabs at her chest, struggles for breath
Stephanie rushes over to steady her
Let me help you
My heart
Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanie's arms
Rham Jas moves to assist her
They lower Shaun San Dana to the floor
Milos, call an ambulance
78
Milos rushes from the room to call for help
Rham Jas checks for a pulse
She's not breathing
Rham Jas attempts to administer  to no avail
My God
My God
He checks her pulse one last time
The  is finally halted
Rham Jas closes her eyes, then touches her forehead, praying: Gata, gata, para gata
bodhi suaha
Gone, gone, gone beyond
Gone beyond the beyond
Hail the goer
-  - Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as  load the covered body of Shaun San Dena into the ambulance
They close the doors and drive away
It's sad: Yes
Strange how things work out
She waited years for another chance to overcome the lamia
and finally she did
No
'm afraid you misunderstand
Rham Jas looks at her with pity
What
The,Lamia can not'be banished by a medium
This was our lesson tonight
'm sorry
79
But  saw her get rid of the thing
No
You saw her drive the Lamia from the seance
That is all
It will be back
But then, what am  supposed to do
Rham Jas shrugs
He fishes in his pocket for his car keys
Perhaps on this final evening, you should finish up the business of this world
For before the night is through, the Lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object
' Slowly emerges from her coat pocket
She studies the thin brass button in her palm
0 Unless, of course
you were no longer the owner
No longer the owner
don't understand
Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank envelope
He places the button within and seals it
The Lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object
Just make a gift of it
To demonstrate, he hands the envelope to Stephanie
and you've given away the curse
80
Why didn't you tell me this before
Because we are speaking of murder
Stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to Rham Jas
She places the envelope carefully into the side 'pocket of her purse
Rham Jas tries to conceal the sadness and fear he feels for her
Whatever you decide, you have until sunrise
' She nods goodbye as Ray's car pulls up
Ray opens the door
for her and she gets in
'  - Ray and Stephanie drive through the quiet Pasadena neighborhood
Is it over
Stephanie, stares at her envelope, thinks about telling him, then
Yes
It's all over
Ray squeezes her hand
Appreciating the two of them now more than ever
Stephanie  as
appears in the headlights, standing on the road before them
Ray hits the breaks
The car  to a halt
Stephanie's purse with the envelope and
some of Ray's papers fall to the floor
Are you okay
Stephanie nods, catching her breath
81
That guy came out of nowhere
Stephanie looks to the figure in the road
Mrs
Ganush is gone
In her place is an old man who mutters angrily at them and moves on
'  -  -- '  pulls up and Stephanie gets out
Are you'still okay about the Santa Barbara trip
Yes, everything's fine
Okay
Our train leaves tomorrow morning
Seven
When do you want me to pick you up
It's better if we meet at the station
There's something 've got to do on the way
Stephanie suddenly' clutches at her purse
The envelope is gone
Wait
Where's my envelope
What envelope
She opens the car door and frantically rummages around the floor, through Ray's papers
It's got to be here
Then, Stephanie comes upon something under the seat
She smiles and stands
white envelope held tightly in her hand
Got , it
82
Tomorrow's gonna be a new start for, us
Don't be late
They kiss and Ray drives off
'  - The time is 1:30
drinks coffee and stares at the white envelope that's tucked into the side pocket of her purse
She scans the patrons and considers giving it to each of them, then one by one, rejects the idea
Comes by, removes a dirty dish and refills her coffee
Banana Boat Sundae
Another one
Stephanie nods absently
The waitress exits
The time is now 2:15
site alone at a table in a wheelchair
portable oxygen cylinder, supplying him with air
takes a deep breath, stands and walks to his table
wonder if you could help me out
The Old Man looks up, sees her desperation
83
0 Yeah
just need you to hang on to this envelope for me
Just until tomorrow
She extends the envelope to him
He hesitates
What's this all about
Just take the envelope and 'll explain
Please
The Old Man considers
He reaches for the envelope when an , his wife, hobbles toward the table
The Old Man helps her sit and puts away her cane
They turn to Stephanie who withdraws the envelope
Never mind
Stephanie returns to her seat, ashamed at what she almost did
She returns the envelope to the purse pocket, racking her brains, trying to think of some way out of this
Her gaze lands upon a stack of newspapers on the next table
She grabs the paper and finds the
: ' :  photo of the old woman
The location of the burial is listed: Oakwood Cemetary
Stephanie rips the listing from the paper and rushes from the restaurant
'  -   - Stephanie, lit by a barren light bulb, paces the room
Rham Jas in his pajamas, studies an old leather bound text
Well
Is it possible
0 84
He closes the book and gives it some thought
There are Gypsy blessings that are bestowed upon the dead
And the Gypsies give gifts to their departed to curry favor with the deceased soul
Yes
do believe you could give the curse to someone who has passed on
for truly, the soul never dies
'  - As she drives we hear the voice over from the preceding : (
0
) but you must make a formal gift of the cursed object to the deceased
(
0
) Formal gift
Car headlights sweep over her grim face
She fingers the envelope, then glances to the seat next to her
a
(
0
) Give it to the corpse personally
Put it in their hand
their' pocket
(
0
) Oh, 'll do better than that
moves in tight
'll shove it down her goddamn throat
She zips up her raincoat
flits past the window
Too
quick to
see
Then it reappears
It's Mrs
Ganush's hankie
It
flies against Stephanie's windshield and gets caught on the wiper blade
Stephanie
It flaps in the wind, blocking her view
Stephanie hits the wiper button
The hankie is yanked-back and forth across the windshield
85
She turns up the wiper speed
No sooner is it knocked loose than it's whisked into the driver's side window
It slaps over Stephanie's eyes, plastered there by the'wind
The car swerves
Her car crashes into a tree
- Stephanie pulls herself from the crash
She glances up to a flash of lightning
It illuminates: The wrought iron gates of the
hill of tombstones beyond
- light drizzle falls as Stephanie'searches the graveyard for the burial place of Mrs
Ganush
She carries the shovel defensively, ready to swat at anything that might leap out at her
She stops before a freshly dug grave
temporary marker reads the name
"Sylvia Ganush"
She's scared now, not sure if she can really go through with it
church bell  five times
There's no time to think about it
Stephanie looks around to make sure no one is watching, then starts to dig
: - It's raining harder
The hole Stephanie digs is now several feet deep
: The shovel has hit the buried coffin
The rain intensifies
: - Mud is pouring down the sides of the grave
In the bottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the simple pine casket
She jams the shovel blade between two boards and pries off the coffin's top and shoves it aside
lightning flash illuminates the corpse
Mrs
Ganush's white eye is open and staring at Stephanie
Stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from her coat
16 40 86
'm giving it back to you
She grabs Mrs
Ganush's hand and tries to get her clenched fist to open, but rigor morris has locked it shut
Stephanie pulls with all her might, causing
' to lurch up and out of the coffin
Her dead arms, thrown forward from the momentum, wrap around Stephanie
Stephanie The withered face leers
Stephanie pushes the corpse away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud
You'll take it, all right
She picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old woman's mouth, wedging it between her teeth
She pries the jaw open
Mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into the grave from all sides
The body of Mrs
Ganush is quickly being re-buried
, Stephanie Brown, do hereby make a formal gift of this button to you, Sylvia Ganush
She jams the white envelope down the old woman's throat
Choke on it, bitch
She kicks the old woman's jaw
It  shut, trapping the envelope between her broken teeth
Muddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs
Ganush's face
It covers everything, except the jutting envelope and a single, staring white eye
Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick
She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it tears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up to her armpits
Bobs up, through the mud
The Old Woman is grinning, with the envelope still jammed between her teeth
87
- Rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction
It has become the drain hole of the cemetery
pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie
Her grinning face led mashed against Stephanie's cheek
Stephanie's is cut short as she and Mrs
Ganush disappear beneath the mud
The only sound is the - of rain when
' rips up through the mud, grasping the tree root
' Breaks the surface of the mud, sucking in air
She claws her way out, then staggers away, through the pouring rain
: '  --  - - steps from the shower, quickly towels her hair
She stops for a moment and studies herself in the mirror
She has survived
The phone  in the bedroom; the machine picks up
' Stephanie
It's Jim
Jim Jacks
Sorry 'm calling so early-- but Last night  found some troubling information about our friend Stu Rubin
: - cleaned up Stephanie, her hair still wet from the shower, drives the empty morning streets
smile slowly comes to her face as we hear the rest of Mr
Jack's message: 88
' Apparently he stole your file on 4 the Mcpherson loan and then tried to broker his own deal at First Federal
guess he thought we wouldn't find out
When confronted him he broke down crying and well, we won't be seeing him around anymore
-   - The Eastern sky is growing brighter
Stephanie's car pulls into the lot
She removes a week end bag from her trunk and walks briskly toward the station
(
) It looks like the loan's coming back to us
And  just wanted you to know that come Monday morning, that assistant manager's position will be waiting for you
-   - Stephanie is smiling as she enters the station
holds a platter of freshly baked cookies and offers free samples to passersby
One is offered to Stephanie
She politely declines as she walks past with a bounce in her step
- She stops at the window, admiring a coat on display
She glances down at her own coat
Notes the missing button
with distaste
Inside, a  is preparing to open the shop
Stephanie taps on the window, shouts through the glass: Hey
Good morning
4 89
The Saleswoman opens the door a crack
'm sorry, we're not open yet
Please
know what  want
That coat in the window
The Saleswoman considers
My boyfriend and  are taking a very special trip this morning
Stephanie's smile is bright
Her joy is contagious
The Saleswoman relents and lets Stephanie in
-   - Moments before sunrise, the sky is streaked red
Ray waits on the train platform, clutching two tickets and a small garment bag
Behind him, other Passengers arrive
From his pocket, he removes a velvet case
He opens it and peeks t inside  diamond ring
He stows it back in his pocket
He looks for Stephanie
Then, his face brightens as Stephanie emerges from the crowd, radiant in her, new coat
Ray
Ray embraces her and grabs her luggage sounds as the train approaches
Is everything okay
Great
'm so glad you're here
There's so much 've been meaning to tell you
0 She takes his hand
0 90
But let me say this first while have it straight in my head
You never stopped believing in me
'll try and live up to that
They share an intimate moment
romantic kiss
He breaks off and smiles
Did  tell you, you look great
Thanks
Stephanie models her new coat
You like it
It's brand new
What'd you do with your old coat
Just the mention of it, makes her face darken
got rid of it
never want to see it again
Too bad,'cause  just found this
Ray produces the envelope
And from it, withdraws with a terrible  of symbols
Stephanie can't breathe
Yeah, it was in my car
Hey, have you seen my Indian Head nickel put it in an envelope just like this one
Stephanie stares at the button, shaking her head in disbelief
The  of the approaching train builds on the sound track
91
What
What is it
She backs away in horror, but Ray follows her with the button still in his hand
The  grows louder
She's backing up toward the edge of the platform
Stephanie
Stop
Ray steps forward, still holding out the button
Stephanie as she falls backwards, off the platform and onto the tracks
In her last moment of life, she turns her head to see
Racing at her
Through the swirling smoke, the engine's mechanical face, resembles the goat like face of the demon Lamia
It   as it angrily bares down upon her
Stephanie recognizes the sound
It's a cry she's heard before
In every door creak
in every cold night wind
a haunting, soulless sound
the cry of Lamia
Ray races to the edge of the platform
The two lover's eyes find each other one last time
Stephanie  as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her down into hell
Believe they have witnessed a train accident but Ray knows the truth
He looks to
still in his hand
92
look of dread
Finally, he believes
