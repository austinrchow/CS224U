Believe it or not,  remember that hit

Just to see that smile

There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win and they're shoving cameras in your faces,  don't want to hear any "Hi moms

See you in the end zone

Loud  roar

Set high school records
Won state championships

That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu
Gruden put that Tampa Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right
He knows every weakness of that team and every strength
He knows Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double-teamed to the right
He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field
Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday

Answering: Hello
' Brandon
Yeah
Congratulations
You went 9-2 last Sunday
20-4 college
Picking 77 percent winners since opening weekend
've been following you
'm a big fan, Brandon
big fan
How'd you get this number
If you want picks, call my 900 line
What  want, Brandon, is for you to come to New York and work for me
Who is this
This is Walter Abrams
don't know if you know me but  run the biggest sports service in the country
Hell,  started the industry
Ask around
Ask anyone, even that reprobate boss of yours
It's my job to keep track of who's doing what and what you're doing should be rewarded
Focus, Brandon
Focus
One day you'll look back, see this was one of life's defining moments
Allow me to paint a picture for you
Right now 'm getting a massage, looking out my window at the greatest city in the world and all 'm asking you to do is come up with a number
Write down what you make now, cross it out and write what you should be making and then toss in how much it'll take to get you to fly here first class and come work for me -- did  mention free room and board -- and speak up when you've got something to share
(aside to ) Right there
Yeah

Yes
Fuck that hurts
Do me a favor and lose my number,  gotta go to work

It's me again
This is a joke, right
joke can be the ultimate intellectual pursuit sometimes
This
This is just a job offer
In your top drawer there's an envelope with your name on it
opens the drawer, pulls an envelope and a ticket
That's travel cash and an airline ticket
It's not a magic trick, Brandon
paid someone to put it there, who incidentally said the place reminded him of a Turkish prison
don't have to tell you you're wasting your time there, Brandon, unless this is a part time gig -- unless you're planning some kinda "comeback," in which case  request you use a fraction of your talents and weigh the odds of that dream becoming reality
Two leg fractures
Passed on by every conceivable team in the league
Any chump can make that call, and anyone who clears the boards the way you do week in and week out should live in a penthouse on Park Avenue -- which is not for you to construe 'm offering that to start, but keep these stats up working for me and 'll have you in one in less than a year

Pay Walter

'm Milton,  drive for him
thought it was a service
(moving to the jump seat, seeing  is driving very fast) So what's the deal with this guy
You work for him a long time
Oh yeah, going on two weeks
(off ' look) was bike messenger
Walter's driver hit me with his car
lie on ground, make it look worse than is, big car, you know maybe get some money
Driver call me name,  call him name, he take swing -- big son of a bitch -- so  kick his ass
(slicing the air with his hands) Walter get out

He ask if  can,  say hell yeah

There are rules to success, Brandon, and this is rule number one, know what you know and know what you don't know and know  gotta know  everything you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner

What the hell is that

Division one
know, 'm talking about not in uniform
used to sing at church
Oh really
So you're religious
don't know
guess
Certain things, you either are or you aren't
Which is it
When  was a kid  thought  wanted to be a pastor
obviously not now
mean, yeah,  believe in God
Relax
What do  care
Besides, it's against the law to hire based on religious orientation
You're not a republican are you
Just kidding
(silent beat, staring at him) You're scaring me son
What's with the deer-caught-in-headlights vibe
You were a quarterback for God's sake
leader
That was six years ago
'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university
You think  went to college
'm autodidactic
Big word, huh
Know what it means
Self-taught
Partially by reading, sure, but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking questions
swear to God 'm looking at myself 30 years ago
taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance is remarkable
crushes out the cigarette, sprays air freshener
'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things
It's bad for my condition
So before  die, did you do anything other than the sports phone in Vegas
Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time,  mean we got 10 bucks a call
Chump change, Brandon
We're angling for bigger fish here
You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business
These gamblers have needs, Brandon
Come Monday morning, after a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs
presses a button and the  fill with football games
That's every pro game played last Sunday
Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week
It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday
Sports betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet
We make the big money off our client list
You see, when a client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they gladly give to keep getting our picks
When they lose we get zip
So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend -- is to win
clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs
Phone numbers and messages ("
" "  "
") flash on the screens
It's a high-octane infomercial for sports gamblers
Hello -- this is Walter Abrams and welcome to The Sports Advisors and week three in professional football
After a nice five day vacation on my yacht  can't be any more ready than  am right now
Studying the mismatches this weekend  can only conclude they're giving my handicappers a license to steal
want you to take out a blank Tv walter con'd check right now -- go on, do it -- and write in as much you want to cash it for on Tuesday, that's how much money we're making for you this weekend
Year in, year out, no stock matches our return, and for the first time in the history of the company 'm releasing our three-team college and pro parlays absolutely free
That's right
This is why in a business with a higher turnover rate than Leona Helmsley's maid staff we're still going strong after 28 years

Look at my hair in the back
How'd you afford that yacht if the picks are free
There is no yacht
Good, keep asking question
Next
You didn't answer about the free picks

Because you need one

Beautiful, you'll like her-- (answering the phone) --This Barnum or Bailey

Tighten it up a bit
lift here, look, see these lines
see a beautiful woman
What are you --all of 35
have a girlfriend, she was stunning, went in to "tighten it up a bit" and came out with a permanent smile
Even when she cries she looks like she's laughing
Another, she's on her third eye lift
Her skin's so tight,  swear, if you put an egg shell on her butt she'd look like a baby bird
'm just thinking of a tune-up
Oh yeah, first it's a tune-up, then it's something else, and one day you'll come teetering in with your new 36Cs and a stretched face and you won't be able to say how unhappy you are because of all the collagen they shot in your lips
Do youself a favor
Skip the surgery and get a shrink, work on the inside
Easy for you to say
You used to model
The other   listening nearby nod in agreement
Oh yeah, that's true
Those were the good days
Sometimes like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab

Why don't you gamble
Well 'll tell you, Toni
bet on something once
Risked everything had and lost
So
swore 'd never do it again
Toni You're sticking to that story
Brandon Hey, we just met
sure wouldn't want to start our relationship off by lying
Well Walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve in his life
(leaning in) Ya know, Toni, this is my first time in town
'm not used to how fast things run around here
'm wondering if you'd  like to have dinner tonight
Let's get to know each other without so many people around
He didn't tell you
What
Brandon, Walter and  are married
What
Walter just said  was meeting a woman
He acted like
Walter's got a weird sense of humor
Look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working for him, but he's held together by meetings
If it has "anonymous" at the end, Walter goes
He has to
He also has to be very careful who he let's into his life
In  most ways, Walter's brilliant -- but he can be bullshitted and  can't
So he sends 'em over to me before he hires 'em
You're kidding me

It's a celebration
Just because he's out with a couple of reformed drunks doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself

Actually, truth be told, 've never had a 12 dollar bottle of water either
He thinks we're fighting
No

Neither should you, Walter

Look at that
Beauty and the beasts
What do you think of her, Brandon
She's cute
Cute doesn't half cover it
The girl's gorgeous
And bored out of her mind
Waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas
Check it out
She's eyeing you again, Brandon
So are the two guys she's with

Toni 'mon Walter
You might as well go to Atlantic City and open a house account
You know you can't gamble
Who's gambling
It's a challenge
If Brandon leaves with her give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he made last year
If not, he gives me a grand, which 'll give to you
don't bet, Walter
(glancing over, look from the ) But  do love a challenge
All right
Before you bust a move, just one thing
(talks across the table, addressing the  and the two ) Excuse me,  don't mean to interrupt but Walter con'd have to know what's going on here
You're drop dead gorgeous and your dates look like they haven't missed a meal since Christ died
Seriously, you two are eating like you have a date with the electric chair

Trust me, we're going to turn all this around

Well of course  do, that's a substantial sum-- (cupping the phone, to ) --He's a bit miffed about our picks Fuck him if he can't take a joke
You're telling me that all this is legal
It better be
Five of these guys are off-duty cops
We're just advising people how to bet, not making the bets for 'em
'mon,  want you to hear our best salesman, Reggie Hawks
/ --It says here your minimum bet's five grand, so let's be honest now, can you move 50 large on this game or not
don't have time for this shit, Jimmy know you're a loser, because if you were such a big winner you wouldn't have paid money to call me today
Vegas is calling, 'm putting you on hold
(pressing hold) What's up big Wally, you slummin' today
This the new kid
Brandon Lang, meet Reggie
You're the  that went off on the refs
( shamefully nods) --Yeah, but you covered
Shit, as much money as the refs cost us every year, that was pure

One office is crammed with clutter, bears a prominent sign on the door
Inside, a big, bearded  wolfs a breakfast burrito, scours the sports pages
In the other office sits a suited, studious-looking  in his 30s, talking on a headset-- -   - types stats into a computer as he fields a call
Three other computer screens flash football info and data

Fast glance at , attention to  -- The Miami/New York point spread shifted a half tick up to 10
What do you think
Miami's still a lock
The win/loss ratios and  ratings are off the charts

Jerry's our top handicapper, came to me straight out of grad school
Jerry, meet the new kid in town
Whoa, phone guy makes good
Big jump from the 900 numbers
Watch out you don't get a nose bleed
Just kidding, best of luck,  gotta get back to work
Pleasure meeting you
By the way, Jerry, New York's gonna win straight up
They always play the fish tight
Tonight it's foregone, they win outright
Really
Listen up, stick to college, sonny
You have to work up to pro ball around here
Nice try though

Not you
John Anthony
John Anthony doesn't exist
That's a shock 'cause 'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair
Look, making predictions is one thing -- but pushing people to bet, it's not me
Pushing people
Get real, this country was built on gambling
Look at Wall Street -- one big casino
The state spends millions hawking the lottery
If people want to pay for advice on who to bet, who are we to say no
Stop being selfish, spread the word
Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive
You got a whole room full of salesmen
Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent winners
' What's the matter
Gonna lose your purity
'mon, what do you think selling is
We're just talking a few well-timed phrases
Let's start with an easy one
throw-away
" don't want your money,  want your bookie's fucking money
" don't want your money -- --Jesus, don't start that shit again
Sell me
don't want your money,  want your bookie's money
What happened to the fuck
Nothing,  just don't talk like that
can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck
It's not that  can't
Why do  have to
Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can
Fuck is your friend
Fuck can be your best friend
'm happy for you and your friend, Walter, but 'm not using it
Chaucer used it 600 years ago
It was good enough for him
'mon-- (calling out to the ) --this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck
chorus of "Fuck yous" fill the air
'mon, repeat after me -- fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me -- try it
It's not me
Let it go
Backbone
Almost as good
We'll keep working on the other thing
So, you really like New York in tonight's game

mean you'd think with two mortgages out, repo guys staking out my car, my job on the line and my wife threatening to leave, you'd think 'd have the goddamn brains to stop, instead of staying in the chase, doubling down, which of course is what  did
know 'm sick because  keep thinking if  just pulled that game out then  got a lock on the parlay and 'm flush going into Monday night and-- (breaking down, unable to continue) #1 It's a disease, Leon
#2 Admitting you have a problem is the first step
/ Then  guess 'm doing pretty good because  got one big fucking problem
Someone claps
Everyone joins in
smiles
Warm beat
suddenly stands
watches, concerned
My name's Walter
'm new to the group
(various "hellos") Hi
've been going to meetings like this for 18 years
Once a week, every Friday night, for 18 years
This, my friends, is my 936th consecutive meeting
(enthusiastic applause) Thank you
Thanks
And my hand to God,  haven't been to a track, casino or bet a game that whole time
Not a cent
(murmurs of approval) 've listened to thousands of sob stories by people like Leon here, and  gotta say, Leon -- if  learned one thing it's that gambling is not your problem
It's not
Not even close
You're a lemon
Like a bad car, there's something inherently defective in you
And you
And me
All of us here -- we're lemons
Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons
We look like everyone else but we're defective because when most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose
All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into the void
And we like doing it so much we do it time after time after time
Me
always felt most alive when they were raking away the chips, and every one here knows what 'm talking about
People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time before we give it all back
But when we lose, and  mean the kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly realize -- hey, 'm still here, 'm still breathing, 'm still alive
In order to really live you have to be aware of your own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of the best ways ' know of getting that feeling
When you win, you defy death, but when you lose, you survive it, and that's remarkable
Us lemons, we fuck shit up on purpose
We need to constantly remind ourselves that we're alive
Gambling's not the problem, Leon, your fucked up need to feel something, to convince yourself you exist, to test what's really real, that's the problem
Hey
You're the guy  see on tv every weekend selling betting picks
Yeah
So
This guy peddles a tout service on tv
Check the charter, buddy, we all left our jobs at the door
You gonna toss an ex-alcoholic bartender out of an  meeting
(to ) Hey, didn't you come with this jerk
No,  mean, we walked in together -- (handing out business cards) -- My card -- we're topping 80 percent this season -- put it in your wallet, in case you fall off the wagon -- - and  riding down in silence
Finally -- What the fuck was that
What'd you just say
You heard me
said what was that
No, you said "What the fuck
"  That's what you said
So
That was great
It was all worth it
Don't you see
felt your anger because of that one word
Well done
'm proud of you
The progress you're making Brandon,  gotta say, it's exhilerating

Building buzz

We got him for the subscription
He's on line three

Go get 'em tiger
(picking up) Amir, my man, John Anthony here

Yes, hello
Today's your day, Amir
It's a Pamplona thing, 'm running wild in the streets this weekend
Starting with the hottest Saturday of my life
How much can you lay with your bookie
20 large
Amir You crazy
No way
was betting a thousand a game but
Look, saw an ad
was just calling to see-- --Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime
Texas plus the six points
They win by two touchdowns
Amir Really
like Oklahoma in that game
(looks up, sees  watching) Oklahoma huh
Okay
well considering that,  like Texas even more now
Amir shouldn't have called
Thank you for-- --Amir, buddy, 'm talking about banging out the biggest win of your life
crosses, whispers to
Into the phone: Hold on,  got Vegas on the line
(pressing ) There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients -- they're all in the hole
The second they pick up the phone, wham
Right to the point
You're above them
Let 'em feel it
More confidence
More John Anthony
(punches speaker phone) /into phone Amir, what's your favorite drink
Favorite drink
dunno, Pina Colada
Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink
But for now, this is what you're gonna do
First, you're going to bet 20 large on Texas, then you're going to put on a Hawaiian shirt, whip up your sweet little rum concoction with the orange slice and the cherry, turn on the game and play with the little umbrella while you sit back and watch Texas tear those Okies a new asshole -- and when you call me back after winning 20 's the first thing out out of your mouth will be words every fratboy knows -- "Thank you, sir, may  have another
" What about payment
Good question
What about it
Amir Well how much is this going to cost me
We take a percentage if  win, Amir -- not exactly your problem of late, is it
Amir What if  don't pay
It's simple, you don't get any more picks
Comprende
So make the bet, make the drink and let's roll this into something big
'  - jamming, using a phone headset
To hell with power ratings -- McNab lost his dog yesterday
Hunting accident
Everyone knows you don't mess with a man who just lost his dog
Take Atlanta plus the points and send me ten thou Western Union by tomorrow, Stan -- let's ride this wave into Sunday
(punching a new call) Denny
Sorry to keep you on hold, bro
Hell yeah it takes pictures, bitchen little phone, huh
Now  got something else for ya, Green Bay against Minnesota, take the Cheesheads
That's right -- go to a sports book and put 500 hundred on 'em
So 'll send you the money to bet
Don't worry about it, just  your big brother a smile when you win
- paces like a hyped-up Ahab as his  jam
Billy, thanks for the 15,000 Fed Ex
What're you up, 160 or something
Did you ever go 12-2 betting college football before
Didn't think so
Now, Greenbay--Dallas--Cleveland--100,000 across the board, got it
The fuck do you care how he does it
And where the hell's our 30 grand for hitting that 3-team college parlay last night
(sipping a cup of tea) Do this, call your off-shore sports book right now and put the whole 100,000 on Green Bay-Dallas-Cleveland, it's called a three-team parlay and pays 6-1
do appreciate the 40,000 you sent us today, but let me assure you we've only just begun to make serious money

(grabbing a pot about to boil over) What's all the commotion
The doctor, thank God, put Walter,on an exercise program want to be there the first time he goes
Make sure the trainer understands Walter's aversion to consistency
Aversion to consistency
He's always been that way
Well that's consistent

Life is fucking

That's me
You mean me

You, John Anthony
You're one in the same
Go on -- get to the good part, Walter
Hold on
Before  say another word, understand -- you do this thing, Brandon, and from here out you gotta eat, sleep, shit, breathe, walk, talk and fart John Anthony
It's not just a new persona
You can't play it
You gotta live it
That's how this works
The only way it works
You have to sell it all the way
Think it over, Brandon, don't decide now
It sounds like a promotion
Bet your ass it is
Five-star
--'m in
Well that's a thoughtful response
Here  was, worried you'd rush your decision
It's the only move
For six years 've been living on Ramen noodles
For the first time in a long time 've got something going
If that means  gotta do a little acting, fine
Living, not acting
You understand that as of right now Brandon Lang with his fettucini knee and his self-fucking pity is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair and John "-can-walk-on-fucking-water" Anthony has taken his place
Listen to what he's asking you, Brandon
She's right
There's no going back

This is gonna cost me

America's premier sports information program with myself, Walter Abrams, Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler  and a truly gifted newcomer to the Sports Advisor panel, a substantial find -- John Anthony
We're entering week six in pro football
This is when the cream rises to the top
This is when things get hot
It's oven mitt time
This is big-time ball season so let's get right into it with the Wizard of Odds -- Jerry "The Source" Sykes
Jerry, what's the Sykes System predicting for this weekend
Walter, my patented computer models tell me we're looking at nothing less than the perfect storm of betting opportunities
But first, last week  cashed in a big-time call on on Chicago as an outright winner over Indianapolis -- making it my 8th straight top selection winner right here on this tv show
This Sunday have 5 match-ups  absolutely love, including Miami at New York
Stats, rankings, records, weather, the Sykes System uses 42 proven indexs to eliminate the guesswork from sports wagering
Without my patented, computer-based picks you have a better chance of seeing God knocking on your door with five strippers and a bag of Bolivian cocaine than winning on your own
Call me for my five games
Absolutely free -- 800-238-6648
Our experts know how to read between the lines, we know how to analyze a point spread, we're not pulling rabbits out of a hat here
Certainly not Chuck Adler -- (turning to ) Chuck, you'd probably eat that rabbit if you got your hands on it
(coming suddenly, wildly alive) Hell yes -- with a side order of fried bookmaker
'm the grim reaper of bookmakers
've put more bookies out of business than the
How many gamblers did  bail out last weekend with my game of the year
Denver, a 10- point underdog beating Cincinatti by two touchdowns

' $500 bettor made $50,000
've got six games on Sunday 'm releasing absolutely free
These games are a burial
blow-out
human lock
You can bet your children's unborn children's children on these six games --
(finger in his ear) Holy Christ,  forgot my earplugs
Take a break before you blow a gasket, we'll get back to you after my hearing returns
Saturday comes before Sunday and looking at this Saturday's college match-ups is the last but certainly not least member of The Sports Advisors -- John Anthony
(reading off the teleprompter) --John Anthony here, the Million Dollar Man with the billion dollar plan
From Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money stays and plays with me
(beat, processing this, suddenly going off the teleprompter script) --Someone wrote some great stuff for me here but the "Million Dollar Man,"  dunno, it sounds kinda small somehow
mean maybe if you change that  in million to a   could get behind it
They tried all sorts of names, wanted to call me the Magic Man -- but picking 80 percent winners sounds pretty scientific to me
So let's just call me John
was a quarterback
And every  knows the key to victory is anticipating -- the ability to see the future and react to it
That is what  do, that's the truth, and what do they say about the truth, Walter
It bites you on the ass
Not in my case
You tell us, Jerry
It sets you free
That's right, but with me it makes you ---
'm picking 80 percent, is that unbelievable
Well it used to be
know the leagues
know the players ' know the game
'm your friend on the field
Your insider on the outside
You can't do what  do if you haven't been there
Played at the level  have
Maybe you'll get lucky -- guess right once in a while -- but these match- ups won't be called consistently by anything other than experience
Forget trends
Throw out every system you possess
Keep your friends but toss their opinions out the window
It's time to change -would-if--could to -can-and--am
You wanna know who  like -- call that little number at the bottom of your screen
continues
on , watching proudly and -- '  - walks down the dim hall, looks in on , sleeping
'  - Dim darkness
Silence
Then someone bumps into something
Muffled curse
light goes on
sits up in bed, sees fully dressed, across the room, holding his shoes
'm not here
Go back to sleep
It's four in the morning
(continues to his dresser, manic) What a show
You should have seen him
'm sitting there watching him roll and  swear he made me want to grab a phone and call
took the sales boys out to Smith and Wo's
Get 'em primed for the weekend
Chuck got drunk, took a swing at one of the deer heads on the wall
Just blowing off steam
'm gonna hire more guys Monday
Put in more phones
Everything's amping up
It's okay
There's room
'll tear down a few walls, fit another 10 desks down there easy
'm gonna do a whole dot-com thing around him
Oh shit, if  had me when  was his age
never had a protege
Someone you hand it all down to
Anything happens to me, he steps in
Just knowing that, with the thing mean that's just beautiful
(changing into workout clothes) Just beautiful
What are you doing
Going for a run
See the sunrise
We're doubling volume this week
And doubling it again after that
He can pick, he can sell, he's gonna change things around here
He's the real deal
Knows sports from the inside
That's how he picks
Guy like him comes along once in a -- a -- -- 100 years
Yeah, a lifetime
Walter, come to bed
Not tired
You're exhausted
'm just gonna run the bridge, up Fifth, circle Central Park, be back in no time
Get in bed
Lie down next to me
Come on
Come here, Walter
Just a quick once-around
Roll on your stomach for a minute
Just for a sec
've gotta meet the trainer tomorrow
Told me to run
Run in place, or from one place to another
lays down
gently massages his back
She leans in, whispers to him
We sense she's done this before
-- know
Of course you do
This is no time to sleep, Walter
Can't sleep now
Just because you're so tired
Completely, totally, utterly exhausted
'll be here when you get back from your ' run
Right beside you
You go on now, baby, 'll stay right here
It's okay
Close your eyes
Just for a second before you leave
'm not going anywhere
'll just hold you-- (quietly crying) 'll wait right here for you
' whisperings become a constant, soothing, mantra
' eyes close
Dressed in sweats and sneakers
Gone
loosens his laces, covers him with a blanket, slides under the covers
kills the light
Seen in darkness
Holding  close, draping a protective arm around and -- - smashes through a wall
dolly in new desks and chairs to accomodate more salesmen
and at the water fountain, watch the room expand
You see him this morning
Wearing those suits to work now
He keeps picking 90 percent 'll press the fuckers for him
walks in, stops at the front desk, speaks to
What a weekened
Helluva Christmas bonus if this keeps up
Where'd you hide the phone sheet
locates the sheet, hands it to him
studies it, starts away
He sees something, stops
Walking back -- (to , pointing on the sheet) Who's this
This guy here -- Lang
dunno, he said it was personal
Did Brandon take the call
Tammy He wasn't in
Don't mention it to him
And don't patch the guy through
Say Brandon doesn't work here, you can't reach him
'  - at his desk, reading The New York Post
enters
You know anything about Stokley being out this weekend against the New York
knock would be nice, Jerry
'm underwater here, man
Yes or no
No
You know something
You hear anything, let me know
That's how this works
'll rush right over
Stat
All inside information gets shared
Inside
've got nothing inside
-- we work as a team here, that's the way we do it
'll do the same for you
So stop holding out on me, babe
This wouldn't have anything to do with you going 30 percent this weekend, would it
Listen you little shit, 've been doing this six years to your one
(entering, to --) What are you doing in here
Hit the phones and do some damage control -- re-write your frigging computer program
Hey, it was a fucked weekend
For some people
(to ) There's a 50-dime bettor on line three
Wants to talk to John Anthony
Who
His name's Carl
Carl owns a couple dozen McDonalds franchises
Guy's a gazillionaire
That sign out front might as well be his bank account
No no no no no
What'd you mean
landed that lead
That's my guy
Was
He's raiding my fucking lists
Your clients are jumping ship you lactose intolerant fuck
Get outta my sight
leaves
picks up the phone -- Carl, John Anthony here, how's the fast-food king
Good-- '  - The door opens
, carrying groceries, and , dressed in ballerina clothes enter, walk into the kitchen
Can we play
Okay, let me just put the groceries away
want to play princess
So do
Go put your dress on
runs off to her room when  suddenly spies a tacky, woman's jacket draped on a chair
regards it and -- The  tracks  through the apartment
Down the hall
Voices heard
man and woman as --  emerges from his office with a
He's pulling bills from his wallet
Easy 200, huh
Here's something extra for a cab
Thanks, Walter
Talk to ya
(seeing ) can explain
The   slides by, shows herself out
staring
No, no, you think she was for me
Are you crazy
No
just had her come up to pay her
got her for John
don't give a damn who you got her for
We have a 6-year-old in the house, Walter
What the hell is going on here
(looking in, checking the made bed) Don't bullshit me
You think  slept with her
'mon
Who the hell's John
Brandon, we all call him John now
You got Brandon a hooker
New city, no friends, working all hours
What the hell are you creating here, Walter
don't understand this
was helping him out, that's all
Helping him
Really
Like the others before him
This kid's different, he's different -- wait a minute
This has nothing to do with you, you know  do business up here
Why are you so angry
Are we actually going to have this conversation
Are you completely clueless
You're jealous
Look at you
Of what
Gee,  don't know -- Brandon screwing someone
You really are fucking crazy, Walter
That never entered my mind
That's not where those thoughts enter
Fuck you
goes into the kitchen, slams the door
Calling to her -- You'll be happy to know he didn't sleep with her
paid her off just for coming
No pun intended
grimaces, clutches his side
pops one, two -- three pills from a vial, let's them settle as , princess clothes, runs down the hall, leaps in his arms
stifles the pain of her embrace
Carries her down the hall
Julia my jewel, you're getting big angel
Can we play princess, Daddy
Course we can
Who am  gonna be
You're the king, daddy, like always
- practicing John Anthony expressions
pretty - finishes touching him up
- made 500 bucks off your picks last week
was thinking maybe we could go out later and get a little wild
you can help me blow some
Let's get really wild and you can blow mine
The  laughs
crosses the stage, takes his place on the set between  and
sits off to the side, eating a muffin
looks voer at  -- Look at you
like the tan
Toni put one of those lamps down in my room
The ladies do love it
60 seconds
John's up first tonight, Jerry
What
John Anthony's leading off tonight
John Anthony's leading
Somebody tell the engineer there's an echo in here
Two years  lead and you bury me in the deck over a few lousy fucking weekends
The Sykes System's based on percentages -- the long haul
No, that's called a mutual fund, Jerry
(to ) You gonna sit for this shit
shrugs, finishes his muffin
turns to  -- He leads, 'm walking
He's leading
unclips his microphone, stands
That's baby talk
You need a fucking rattle
Sit down
(staring him down) You probably think you know what 'm gonna say
how everything you got  pay for
Your apartment, your car, your kid's school -- and it's true
You'd be right
do
Now  don't know, Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course maybe you don't
don't see you taking that chance
My gut says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not on a gamble, a hunch yet
And if you do, fuck it
give a shit
The only reason  keep you around is it makes me look loyal and him-- (pointing at ) --look good
Now you got three fucking seconds to stop standing there like dog shit on my porch and sit down and shut the fuck up or you can kiss everything you have goodbye
The clock's started
Beat
sinks into his seat
turns to
See that
He made the safe play
Me,  would've walked, but 'm a fucked-up human being
That's the difference between us
Right there
Jerry's a statistician, 'm a gambler
And you're not a gambler, not really -- until you bet more than you can afford to lose
Five, four, three, two, one -- Welcome to week 7 of pro football
-   - done taping, wiping off make-up, talking on his cell -- Denny, it's me
What'd  tell ya
Hey, it's your money, dude, you won it
Well did you hook it up yet
Hell yeah, crank it, let me hear-- -
- Denny on his cell, crouched under the dash of his car, wiring a new stereo
He touches two wires and the sound system to life, deafening hip-hop before Denny disconnects the wires
It's the bomb,
Sure sounds like it
'm heading out with some people, everything else cool
Everything's great
Did dad reach you
Dad
No, why
He keeps calling
He saw you on tv, wants to talk to you gave him your work number but he says they won't put him through
Really
' eye catches  across the set, watching a playback of the show
enters the studio, kisses  hello and -- - ,  and  exit the stage, enter into the lobby
'm starved, there's a new steak house around the corner
You two split a prime rib, 'll get the porterhouse, we'll whack it up
Let's walk, you could use the exercise
Stop worrying
We're set-- (arm around ) -- got the next Jimmy the Greek here
'm serious
Nostra-fucking-damus was a novelty act next to this guy
Let me ask you something, Walter
Shoot
Have you been blocking any of my calls
Of course
You don't need distractions, there's a lot of crazies out there
Does that include my father
You're asking, 'll tell you
Yeah
(striding outside) Son of a bitch -- for how long
(following) Week or so
Walter
- and  trail  down the lamp-lit sidewalk
Hold on, Brandon, if  didn't block his calls would you've talked to him
Honestly
That's not the point
Then what exactly is the point, Brandon
What's the full story here
What's the deal with your old man
You tell it, you seem to know
-- only know pieces
was trying to spare you from something
(stopping under a street light) Spare me
By blocking my calls
There's nothing you can spare me from
He's a drunk
Left when  was 9
couldn't t compete with a bottle
End of story
That's it
That's the best you can do
Hell, Toni and 'll match our dysfunctional childhoods against yours any day of the week
My father, 5-foot- arms like this, cock the size of a hebrew national -- if  even looked at him wrong he knocked me across the room like LaMotta
He yelled so much, until  was five  thought my name was asshole
Tell him about you, Toni
Well go on -- didn't have a great home-life either
"Great
"  Tell him about the uncle-- --He gets the idea
Don't sugarcoat this shit, you were abused by everybody but the family pet, isn't that right, honey
Walter, please
(to ) Your father was a drunk, a jerk -- so what
It happens
'm glad  blew him off
Know why
Because what you need is a new image of a man
How 'bout me
That's a really scary thought
If not me, then pick someone else
It's all in your head
The shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me -- you know what it is
Just that, shit that happened
' It's not who we are
After Walter con'd all the therapy and the analysis and the meetings and the -- aaahhhh
-- the one thing  know-- (yelling to the sky) --'
We are all just so fucked up
(to ) Say it
Shout it
Come on, you two -- wallow with me here
sticks his head out a window down the street, yells -- 'm trying to sleep, asshole
Dad
Is that you
'll crush you like a beetle
How's Mom
Fucking freak
love you too
Don't wait up
,  and  all laugh
The three of them doubled over on the dark, deserted street
screaming from above
The ring of a phone begins bleeding in and -- '  - New furniture and sports photos on the walls suggest the passage of time
stands before a mirror, being fitted for a suit by a
He has a cigar in one hand, Coke in the other, talks into a headset as he watches the  work
Are you serious, Amir
You gonna fucking haggle with me over a measly 50 thousand on the 250 grand  won you this weekend
'   - (sharply attired) stands outside his business, leaning against a brand new, red Ferrari as he talks on the phone
Don't get me wrong, John
'm thankful, very much, you're amazing, it's just that 50 thousand seems slightly steep-- --The first time you call me you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon, you're crying about hocking your fiance's ring and this weekend you're phoning me from a suite at the Bellagio that  put you in -- you know what -- 'm cutting you off
You want to continue with me, 'm tagging on a 10 percent aggravation tax
Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight and we'll kiss and make up
(hanging up, to the ) No cuff
(the phone rings, picking up--) John Fucking Anthony, talk to me
This is
May  please speak to a Brandon Lang
Mom
'   - '  drinking coffee, talking on the phone ' Brandon, is that you
That's me
' Are you okay
Never better
Kicking ass and taking names
Did you get the money  sent
' Well that's why 'm calling, honey
Good good good
talked to Denny
Next month 'm flying you and him out here
First class
'll put you up at The Plaza
You'll love this joint
' It sounds great, Brandon, but the money -- it's too much
Where did you get it
made it
Earned it
Every fucking cent
Put it in Denny's college fund
' Listen to you
It's just how people talk here
(looking down at the , edge) How many times  gotta say no cuff
' Who's this John Anthony person
He's me
'm him
' And he talks like that
He's pretty fucking salty -- geez, 'm sorry, Mom --  mean yeah
Look, the main point is 'm learning a lot here
' Then you should know you can't be two people, Brandon
appreciate the concern, Ma, but the checks 've been sending -- the checks you've been cashing -- those are from John Anthony
' Funny,  thought they were from my son
enters, slaps an airline ticket on his desk
We're going to Puerto Rico
Gotta put you on hold, Ma
(pressing a button on the headset) What's in Puerto Rico
Since Ricky Martin moved out, all that's left are tourists, cruise ships and
Novian -- one of the biggest sports bettors in the world
He just called
Wants to meet you in person
To-day
Flight leaves Laguardia in 45 minutes
(activating the headset) gotta go, Ma
Ma
Son of a bitch --  my own fucking mother hung up on me
- An  roars in for landing
- and  pass through
What do you know about him
Not much, 'cept for the fact he's a world class prick
Bastard treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor
Never once returned a call
've been trying to bag this guy for years
Do you have any idea what this is worth
No, but  want a bonus if we pull it off
Look at me
There is no if -- it's only when
This time he called us, remember
You hooked him
Know that
Sweat that
Relax, 'll get in character in the car
suddenly slows, winces
He angles toward a bathroom
Walter
grabs for a water fountain, misses, suddenly collapses
Your vial -- where's your pills, Walter
finds the vial, pops it, his chest heaves and the pills spill on the floor
looks wide-eyed up at , mouths "Big one
"   frantically loosens ' shirt
crowd gathers
pulls a cell phone, dials 911
Hold on, Walter we're getting help
Oh my God
Listen to me
Walter -- Walter
You're gonna be fine
Hold on
(to the ) We need a doctor
Is there a doctor
Brandon -- Save your strength
Help's coming
Help's coming
Do you love me
Of course  do
Uh-huh
do
really do love you
How much
lot
Now don't talk
(turning to the ) We need a doctor
Several stunned  run for help
fading fast
believe you
believe you love me
love you too
Just one thing -- Save your strength, Walter
Would you love me if this was a joke
What
'm fine
Just practicing
smiles
Stands
Brushes himself off
To the  -- 'm okay
Little gas
Must've had too many peanuts on the plane
The confused  drift away
You sick fucking fuck
That was too goddamn fucking far
You weren't listening
You're not paying attention to me
There's no such thing as too far
Push everything as far as you can
Push it until it starts pushing back and then push some goddamn more
Remember that when you're with this guy today
- Palatial
Drapes dance before the open doors
Music plays
and  sit in the living room
Peaceful beat
start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit me down,  wanna kack here
beefy  enters followed by a tan, broad shouldered of 50
extends his hand
Mr
Novian
What can  say
An honor
This is my associate, John Anthony
nods, settles in a chair
and  sit
You should know  think that most sports services are a complete scam
However,  hear your boy here's having quite a season
What's your system
(looking around) Our system
Fuck that, what's your system
Walter laughs
Novian stone-faced, glances at his watch when-- It's a privilege to meet you, Mr
Novian
You have a beautiful home
Let's start with how much you bet
million a game, across the board
Nice round number, is that our ceiling here
Is that the most we're working with
"We're" not doing anything until  hear how you feel about this weekend
Do you rent that yacht out there
own it
Well, sir, that's how  feel about this weekend
That may sound cocky,  don't care
didn't come down here to lie
Do you have inside information
If  did  wouldn't share that with you
My record speaks for itself
The truth is  know these teams better than they know themselves
'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes the Monday Night parlay
Why should  believe you
With all due respect, Mr
Novian, you can't afford not to
can afford to do any damn thing  please
Can you
What 'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win
Winning's a funny thing, Mr
Novian
it's one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy
Or was, until you called me
Charged beat
tight grin's glued to ' face
The price is a quarter million, Mr
Novian -- up-front -- in addition to a percentage of every game you win
Fuck you
never pay anything up front
And we've never charged it before
But with what you're betting, 250 up front's a bargain
You want this weekend's winners, that's my offer
Take it or leave it
(standing) Step outside
and  exchange looks, unsure where this is going
'  - and  regard a group of  lounging topless by a pool
Ever pick oranges, Mr
Anthony
Nope
have, in fact it's how  started
Builds character
See those girls down there
Pretend they're oranges and pick some ripe ones
Take 'em upstairs and build some character
Mr
Abrams and  need to refine the terms
goes to an ice-filled cooler by the door, pulls a bottle of champagne, carries it dripping down to the pool and-- '  - fills
Two columns of teams seen
Point spreads penciled in between them
11 of 12 games checked off
Monday Night the last to be decided
--  in his office, the unfinished form before him
young  appears at the door
They need it, Mr
Anthony
picks up his pen, regards the box for Monday Night -- Seattle or New Orleans
The point spread is Seattle minus 3
box beside it is for the over/under
That number is 34
about to pick when he stops, looks up, smiles -- Three questions
What's your mother's name
Shelia
What street did you grow up on
Atlantic Avenue
Who do you like Monday night
don't know
Pick one
That's your job
'll do your job tomorrow, today you do mine
What are you talking about
Pick one
Stop stalling
You know who's playing
Seattle versus New Orleans
dunno
guess  like Seattle giving the two points
(writing on the form) Over or under
You can't do that
Sure  can
Over 34 points or under
Over
checks it off, gives him the finished form
'm not handing that in
Like a million dollars is going on that game
Like a lot more than that
Relax
think we know  can pick
Today 'm picking you
The outcome'll be the same
What if 'm wrong
Didn't they tell you
There is no if
'  - Final seconds of a hard-fought game
The Seattle ' driving, completes a long pass to a who's brought down at the New Orleans 10-yard line
They score, we win
/vo from tv --Kuhn's stopped at the 10
Seattle down by three
Two seconds on the clock
Kuhn suffered a concussion last week and with that foot injury in the first quarter he has no mobility -- Hanratty drops back, he's out of the pocket, breaks one tackle, throws downfield, it's tipped
Raymond's got it
Breaks the plane
Touch down
Seattle takes it 20 to 17
They win by three
What a game
The buzz in the  explodes as we see -- every  is packed into ' office
Riot of celebration all around
100 fucking percent
Champagne corks start popping
Someone hits the remote and the wall of screens fill with a jamming  video
The lights dim
People start dancing
Cell phones start ringing and -- /into phones -- Call back tomorrow
-- Who knows who he likes next week you   fucking degenerate
--  don't have anything yet
The   who made the Monday night and over/under picks talks excitedly to  and
He kinda mesmerized me, see, and like Spock or something  visualized Seattle and the over and he wrote it down
Said picking me was the same as him doing it
What kinda power is that
Who fucking cares
He's money
stands nearby, listening
Whoops of excitement as jumps up on his desk, starts throwing cash
moves through the raucous , finds  against a wall, out of the fray, watching  hurl money in the air
Congratulations, Brandon
Or should  say John
Either way it's amazing
must say  am impressed
Letting salesmen make your picks
That's balls
(watching  hurl money) Best get in there and collect some of this, Jerry
The way you're picking, you're gonna need some for a rainy day
Keep talking, sugarmouth
Must feel pretty good to be that plugged in
You got a good streak going
Well enjoy it while it lasts
The gambling Gods are a fickle bunch, sooooo easily offended
makes his way through the room, reaches
Here, get you teeth fixed
There might be some other businesses you can make two mill in one weekend, but tell me, someone please tell me -- where else are you gonna have this much fun
How much of that big stack's mine
one with five zeros behind it
100 fucking thou
On two million
You're working out of my shop
was thinking of ten percent
Really
Is that what you were thinking
got you Novian
Nice job, now don't blow it by getting ahead of yourself
'm looking beyond the money
You can afford to, you're holding it all
'mon,  only want what's fair, Walter
smiles
Wraps an arm around
Puts him in a headlock
"Fair
"  Honey, you don't know what fair is
What's fair is not giving you the money
Now 'm only gonna say this once
If you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a sneeze you have to do more than think about it
Or ask for it
You gotta earn it
You gotta fight for it
You gotta rip it out of my fucking talons
John Anthony would know that
That's what he'd do
As a matter of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as John Anthony
'Cause from now on 'm not talking to you about money
pulls free
Stunned
Seething
pounds from the TVs, people dancing all around
walks up
The big winner
How are you doing
'm winning
'm winning
leaves
pulls her close, moves with the music
Dance with me
Close, that's it
gotta dance with you more
Listen, 'm thinking of buying a plane
Big one
-something
We can just get on it and go, you and me, anywhere in the world, any time we want
There's a house for sale in the Bahamas with a runway right beside it
Comes with its own 50-foot boat
Two for one
What an investment
Anything happens, you and Jules always have it
Let's go down and check it out
Next week, just us, barefoot in the sand
( watching him) Well say something
Are you gambling again, Walter
What
Oh, c'mon -- hell no
Look me in the eye and say it
am not gambling
Not now, not ever
18 years clean
That shit's over
It's never over, Walter
You know that
Get a lie detector if you don't believe me
Shoot me with truth serum
Baby -- we just made two-million dollars
'm working miracles here
Now can  enjoy a dance with my wife
Huh
swear, it's a shame you can't drink, we need something to kill that bug up your ass
smiles
holds her close, kisses her and -- - ' Mercedes speeds into the city
- Big breasts, -strings, testosterone
in a booth with a topless
We can see from his moves it's the Million Dollar Man talking
Drinking Dom
Flashing cash
He whispers something to her
She reaches for her top as he grabs the hand of her topless  and -- -    - light goes on, illuminates a cave-like bedroom
from the club rumbles through the space, reduced to a driving bass beat
The   pulls an outrageous wad of cash from ' pocket, tosses it confetti-like in the air as -- , the   and the   fall on the gold lame sheets
Clothes are peeled off, money sticking to their bodies,  clawing the cash from ' skin -- Black girL (kissing his neck, hands roving) What's it feel like to do what you do
To win like that
flips her over, leans in from behind
It's just like sex
You start by massaging the numbers, very relaxed, getting a feel, see how they move
Then there's a shift, a plan forms and you connect to your teams
(the  moans, reacting to something unseen) Sunday's like penetration and the games have started and teams are scoring and you're inside and you're doing it and it's doing you, feeling every shift, every score, every trickle of sweat -- the giving, taking, the long, the short, excitement growing bigger and bigger-- ( cupping her breasts) And it's not an idea or part of you anymore -- it is you, all of you -- and the crowd's roaring and the clock's ticking and you know everything except how it'll end and and then you've won -- over and over and over and it's like one, big, huge, insane, weekend-long orgasm
(totally turned on, kissing him) Nice job description

Only it's John Anthony who's strutting through the room, high-fiving , kissing the , a tanned, tailored, magnetic presence and -- - '  - waits within, standing at the window overlooking the sales room as  enters
Know what time it is
(glance at his watch) Yeah, it's-- --Wrong
It's time to press, my friend
We're yanking out all the stops
When you're winning -- you press
rummaging a closet, produces a set of golf clubs
What are you doing
have a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot with a client, that Howell guy
Don't call me unless the lines change
The salmon are running
You're staying right here and fielding calls
You're not going off to play golf and have fun
Fun
Senor, you have obviously never played Wingfoot
Stop screwing around, you got a lot to do before this weekend
'm not asking you if  can leave, Walter -- 'm telling you that's how it is, understood
You want my picks, hell 'll make 'em now
sits, starts filling out the week's betting form
Whoa -- hold on -- slow down -- today's only Tuesday, you have all week
don't need it
Hey -- we're gonna be advising somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars this week
Nice neighborhood
You're really gonna make your picks now
No study
No analysis
Just like that
'm in the zone, Walter
Locked in
You want my picks,  might as well do it now
Washington at Miami giving 8, Washington
Saint Louis at
getting 12 --
by three touchdowns
Pittsburgh at Philly giving 3 -- Philly, another blow out
(handing  the finished form) Brandon con'd There they are, unless you want next weekend's picks too
You're welcome to join me, Walter, it's a beautiful track
Okay, fine
Take a break
Go play golf
We'll put the picks on ice and look 'em over tomorrow
(walking out) won't be in tomorrow
Then the next day
But ' gone

Where're you headed
Some of us have to work
Come on, get in
'll give you a lift
-- upper brownstone window
looks down
Watches ' legs swing into ' sports car and -- - speeds fast down a street
Uncomfortable beat
Some ride, huh
Feel that
Feel that
Slow down, Brandon
Why
This car was made to go fast
Not with me in it
'mon, Toni, loosen up
(goosing the gas, laughing) Let me ask you something
When you're not at the shop, or running Julia to play dates or keeping Walter from losing his mind, which know is a full-time job, what do you do for you, Toni
stay busy
That's not what  asked
Yes it is
What do you do for you, Toni, for yourself
"What do  do for myself
"  If you drove past my salon and went two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years ago with a needle in my arm
was a 5-bag a day junkie would have sold Julia to get high
Keeping it all on track, that's what  do for myself
That's not living, Toni
That's just maintaining
You cashed in
What the hell does that mean
Are we talking perfection here
Well, nobody's perfect
except me last weekend going 14 and 0

Yeah, that's living
Hell yeah
You oughta try it some time
(stepping from the car) Thanks for the ride, John

It's obvious they're getting killed

Sit down
You're watching every game
Every second of every minute of every game
Don't even think of leaving

No one else in the room

How do you go 3 and 11
Wanna know how -- you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday
It rained in Cincinatti
Two starting QBs didn't play
You're a handicapper, not a psychic
There's still Monday night and the parlay
Fuck Monday night
Fuck the parlay
You were pissed at me, right
The commission thing
don't know
You fucked with me, right
Joke's on me, right
The money thing
Okay,  think we're on dangerous ground here but 'm giving you a bump, 10 percent
Now what about Monday night's game
You want to look over that pick
Because everyone's gonna double down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in
Monday night's fine
You'd bet your mother's house on it
don't bet
If you did
like the pick, Walter
On your mother's house or not
With my mother in it

Monday Night Football's on
His glazed expression suggests it's been a long three hours
around him socialize, laugh, enjoy the bar's oasis-like vibe
But for , it's just him and the game as -- a  approaches, big smile
Oh my God -- Brandon
glances up, quickly goes back to watching the game
Girl Oh come on,  know you remember -- two weeks ago, Aqua -- 'm Heather
(eyes glued to the game) Uh-huh
Heather This is like such a concidence

This is my neighborhood bar
She sits beside him, signals the bartender

Final seconds lasered on the screen

His beeper suddenly sounds
He looks and -- '  scrolls across the screen

Mind racing
Trying to understand

He checks the number, picks up -- Denny
Hey -- yeah, 'm in a bar
Of course in New York, own this town
What's going on -- you okay
Tonight's game
You took my picks
How much
All of it
That was for your college you dumb ass
Denny, gave you one game -- goddamn it you should have told me you were following my picks
(pacing the rail) All right, listen
Does Mom know
Okay, good
Don't say anything
've got next weekend wired
'll win it all back for you and more
Understand
Now 'll call you Friday with who to take
It's all gonna work out

The office is filled with sports pages from every newspaper in the country
Injury reports
Power ratings
studying everything and -- --  dozen rapid-fire kick-offs fill the  -- catch passes,  drop them spectacularly -- brilliantly juke tackles, score --  are slammed from behind, stripped of the ball -- kicks miss goal posts by inches --  are carried off on stretchers -- footballs sail through ' hands, their fingers clawing empty air -- scoreboards blink outcomes, stadium lights flare and -- -  - Similar lights illuminate a driving range on the Hudson River
--   - smacks one to the 250 sign, about to hit another and -- Helluva swing
Great game
Sport of kings, right
Or is that horse racing
What are you doing here
Southie told me where you were
had to get out
Clear my head
(teeing one up) Well talk to me
How'd we do
You haven't seen the scores
Nope
That's how  wanted it
Just make the picks and get the results later
Highest sales volume ever
Take a guess
think we kicked ass
It was amazing
told you
Last week was nothing
smacks a drive, watches it soar -- You're right, nothing compared to how much we lost today
What'd  go
have an idea
give you a few glimpses of what happened here today and you take a stab
Just give me the numbers, Walter
You don't like that game
Too bad
Woulda been fun
Grown men crying on the phone
Wives screaming in the background
Three salespeople quit 'cause they couldn't take the pressure
Fuck
No
When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it
What would be more appropriate is something like "Holy Fucking Shit
" Or "My Fucking God
"  Or "Jesus Fucking Christ
" Enough
get the idea, Walter
You're right
mean 2 for 12 on our biggest volume weekend -- what the hell's left to say
Except maybe keep the phone number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline
hefts the golf bag, walks away
Yelling after him -- Tomorrow morning, Brandon
Bright and early
We start in all over again
No getting off
'm gonna ride you until you're more sick of me than losing
Turn it around and we avoid a lot of pain
Omit Omit Omit - Gloomy fog

What the fuck-- Mr
Novian wants to see you
Now
(seeing a gun in his waistband) Tell him to call
You tell him
looks, sees  nearby
didn't recognize you without the suit, John
This is my time off
It's how  clear my head
You want to talk, pick a time
Or should  call you Brandon
Someone costs you 18 mill, you do some research
know more than your name, Brandon
know where you're from
Where your family lives

Your Mom, sweet lady

Winter's coming
Water's getting rough

If you don't like my picks, use someone else
Oh, 'm not using you again
That's already decided
And can't get my money back
It's gone
No,  came for an apology
The  holds him tight
Light fading
No one around
Look me in the eye and say you're sorry
Say it so as to make me believe you mean it

You flew to New York for-- --That's right

don't accept it
Not good enough
Try again

'm sorry

No wires to mess with

Listen,  think  should lead off

You got a good hole, Jerry
Stay in it

60 seconds
What am , wood
You got one good weekend under your belt, don't push it
One weekend
The Sykes System revolutionized this industry

Take a hike
What
You heard me
You're fired
Goodbye
'm not fired, you need me more than ever
Beat it, you cut-rate parasite
In six years my worst weekend was never as bad as any of his last three weeks
Get out
You don't work for me anymore
What the hell are you doing, Walter
'mon, man -- it's me, Jerry
These other guys come and go
(pointing at ) Not this one
That's true talent
'm firing your ass 'cause you don't see it and  can't explain it to you

The sports wrap-up comes on, scores flashing on the screen
No clue how he did until his phone rings
Then his cell vibrates
gets out of bed
Fully dressed
Buries the phone under the mattress
He turns off the cell, but within seconds it starts vibrating again
sinks into a corner
Knock at the door
doesn't move
Another knock and -- Intercut -- toni in the hall, talking through the door It's me, Brandon
Can  come in
No
It's not a good time
What do you need
need to talk to you, it's important
lost, doesn't answer
You need to get out, Brandon
You need to go
gotta pick a winner is what  gotta do
gotta get back on track
It won't matter
You could go 100-and-0 and it won't be enough -- it'll never be enough
He'll ride you into the ground
gotta figure this out
Please, Brandon
'll figure it out

An unsmiling  watches nearby
Alex, it's Brandon
Hey, it's been awhile but  never got your number that night
was in the neighborhood so  thought 'd take a chance and stop by
-   -  - The  stands at the entrance, watches  wait appears, beautiful as the night  picked her up in the restaurant
Her demeanor, however, is far from friendly as she exits the elevator
Man, you got a Doberman for a doorman
What are you doing here
came by to take you out for a late dinner and a couple of killer bottles of wine
'mon
We'll go back to that place where we met
Are you out of your fucking mind
(stepping close for emphasis) live in this building, asshole
It's home
don't like creeps coming around unannounced
Lurking around outside
What the hell's gotten into you
What about that night
Let me make this real clear so this shit doesn't happen again
You mean nothing to me
Oh wait,  take that back -- you meant 5000 bucks
Your friend set it up
(already heading back inside) Don't fucking bother me again
- Pale sunrise over the East River

Staring out at the city
His phone rings
Again
Again
Finally pressing speaker phone -- Hello
Intercut - amir in payphone beside
Turnpike - dawn Amir (dishevelled, distraught) 'm wiped out, John
Amir
Amir My business
My house
My credit
No, now listen to me -- we got a big weekend coming up, buddy -- Still you talk like this
Who the fuck are you, like this is some kind of game
was betting a few thousand a Sunday when called you
You pushed me
Every call
All the time with your talk
lost $380,000 this weekend
was going to get married
had a life
staring at the phone, barely holding it together, sees standing there -- holding the day's newspapers, hearing the conversation on speaker
No words now, huh
No more money to squeeze so you shut up
How do you fucking live with yourself
Click
Amir hangs up
Crushing beat
staring at him
What
(face hardening) Fuck him if he can't take a joke
puts the day's newspapers on his desk, leaves glances down, something catches his eye
pulls a newspaper from the pile -- finds himself staring at a full-page ad for Big smile
Copy advertising "The Million Dollar Man
" and -- '  - paces the dim space
Sits on the bench press
Leans back on the board
He stares up at the weights
Moves the weight pin to 250
and slowly starts to lift
One rep
Two
Three
Four
bad of sweat forms
throws off the jacket
Pulls off the tie
Removes his shirt and shoes
He resumes lifting, grim determination -- the weights rising over and over and over -- faster and faster and -- '  - , t-shirt and sweats, approaches ' office, bursts through the door -- know what the problem is
freezes
watches two  unload stacks of money from a briefcase, pile them on his desk
'll come back later
No
'mon in
We're done here
Right fellas
All through
You want a bite before you go
Something to drink
The two  leave
lights a cigarette
Who were they
We need a bat light or something, you know a signal  can shoot up at the Walter con'd clouds and no matter where you are you can look up and you'll know  need you
Maybe that would work
'Cause last night  must've beeped you a hundred times
Who were they
They're from the Salvation Army
How the hell does someone go 1-for-8
fucking monkey tossing darts could do better
What's with the money, Walter
1-for-fucking-8
(coming around the desk) have a plan
From now on we take your picks and reverse everything
Like a Twilight Zone episode where everything's the opposite
You say black we go white
is
Lose becomes win
(staring at the pile of cash) How much is that
(sweeping the pile to the floor) How much is what
Oh, that -- 275,000 dollars
What happened to the two mill, all the other money
was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up
The last few weeks  thought keep the pressure off
He'll come around
Climb out on his own
Now  figure fuck it
Time to turn on the lights
Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in
Maybe that'll shake him up
So what do you want to know got three mortgages on this house, 'm gambling again and to cover my losses  just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway
All this -- everything you see around you -- is smoke and mirrors
shoulda been a magician
' What'd you say when you came in
You    were in a good mood when you walked through the door and you said something
You're betting my picks
You went 82 and 11
You were picking 80 percent -- how could fucking not
Trouble is  bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet
One decent weekend and  would have been set for life
One decent weekend
stares at him, stunned
" know what the problem is
"  That's it
You came in with a big smile and said, " know what the problem is
" 'm Brandon Lang, Walter
Brandon's the one who played sports
Brandon's the one who can pick games
lost touch with him -- myself
It wasn't an act, man
became John Anthony
But he's not me
If  go back to being Brandon-- --You can pick again
Of course
All you gotta do is go back to being Brandon
Talk like Brandon
Eat like Brandon
Forget John Anthony
Burn the suits
It's all my fault
see that now
pushed you into something you weren't
took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a duck
We're winding down the season
There's only two games this weekend
Two winners and two over/unders
That's all we need
You crunch the numbers, sprinkle in a little Brandon magic, we get the sales people burning up the phones and come Monday we go four for four going into the big game
Right
Huh
Let's get something to eat
Go to Smith and Wo's
No thanks
'll stay here
Eat light
(kneeling down, stacking the cash) The Brandon thing
What am  thinking trying to get you to go out
What would Brandon eat for lunch
Peanut butter and jelly
Ramen noodles
What
(on the floor, helping him) 'll get something
You want anything shipped from home
Your bed
Clothes
Porno collection
No, 'm fine
Blow job
Thanks anyway
Maybe later
Because it's important
Pressure doesn't help
God forgive me, you're an artist
fucked with that
Two little winners and a couple of over/unders
That's all we need
You could phone it in
Two's nothing
Not for you
Not for Brandon
Right, Brandon
Isn't that right
stands
Looks down at , unable to hide the desperation behind his frozen smile and -- WEEk -- closes the blinds in his office, blocks the view -- works out, watching  -- the   sit idle at their desks, playing cards -- a pick sheet fills ,  shows New York versus Atlanta, Tenessee versus Kansas City and an over/under beneath each game --  waits in the  , edgy, pacing when  emerges holding the sheet -- all eyes on him -- approaches -- These are the winners
That's who  like
Brandon made these picks
You're looking at him
(regarding the picks, to the room) New York and the under, Tenessee and the under
Sell 'em hard
'  - crowd into the room
and  sit side-by-side
Seconds before kickoff of the New York/Atlanta game climbs into ' lap, holding her puppy
Julia Can  watch, daddy
Sure, Angel
need you to root for me
(pointing at ) They're the bad guys
Atlanta
We want the blue team
New York
They have to win by more than five points
And root for a low score
Both teams have to make less than 42 points total
New York and under 42 points
Why do we like the blue team
Because Brandon likes them
looks at , smiles
' barely holding up here, forces himself to find a smile in return
New York kicks off
An Atlanta takes it back for a 60 yard return
We start cutting from the game to , to , the , , all reacting as the betting Gods raise hopes one play, dash them the next
Play after play
Tide going for New York one minute, Atlanta the next
Tension in the room building
Everyone crowds the TVs as New York defends a 10 point lead with a minute left
37 points on the board
Only an Atlanta  can lose the two bets and they're 80 yards from scoring
few high fives as Atlanta fumbles on a run, recover the ball for a five yard loss
Backed up to their own end zone
Two plays left
excited, things going their way and -- starting to breath again and -- Atlanta tries a final hail mary, ball coming down into a crowd -- time runs out as a New York  swats it and an Atlanta  pulls it down -- running hard -- open to the end zone -- the room freezes -- a New York  grabs hold -- trying to bring him the bastard down but the Atlanta  is strong and just makes it in for the score -- game over -- and Atlanta hasn't won but they've killed the point spread and pushed the game over -- nobody speaks -- the second game comes on right on the heels of the first and now Tennessee is kicking off to Kansas City and we're on the roller coaster all over again --   start drifting from the room and they've pushed their clients huge on these games and their cell phones are ringing and ' just staring at the screens and ' dying and -- '  -  - and  alone in the room
Sound of the as Atlanta get trounced by Denver
Not even close
Well over 42 total points scored
The game ends
All four bets lost
commercial comes on
Horrible stillness
'm finished
'm done
That's great
can't do this anymore, Walter
can't sleep at night can't eat
You're not gonna sit there and tell me you're ending this because you have a little indigestion or some insomnia
It's a lot more than that
made it very clear before we started what the stakes were
Walter, it's over
What use could John Anthony be to you now
Only an idiot would follow him after the streak 've been on
Wrong
Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot
Bettors will climb back aboard
' They know you
And when your luck turns they'll remember you went 80 percent for half the season
We'll make it all back on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything
Who said anything about next year
Sports betting's year-round
'm not doing this next year
You made a career choice
bankrolled it
Let him go, Walter
and  turn, see  at the door
Of course you stick up for him
Meaning what
Who's side are you on
didn't realize  had to choose
(to ) Look, you got a magnificent gift
Own that
So you strike out sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences
You're a champion, Brandon
champion goes down 186 times but gets up 187
'm not letting you stay down
This isn't about you or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical, this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God
Besides, we have a contract
Bullshit
You can't own someone, Walter
created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen
plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client  have and  will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him
Why the hell am  even explaining this to you
This is between me and him
Get out
Don't talk to her like that
need you to tell me how to talk to my wife
When 'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet
(to ) Leave
'  - comes down the hall
and  heard yelling through the office door
hesitates, walks out and -- '  - Dim darkness
distant siren bleeds in as -- ' Brandon
Brandon
'
His eyes open
' face fills
Wake up
What time is it
Five in the morning
Listen,  gotta fly to Vegas to meet with some clients
Hand holding thing
Keep 'em on board for the final game
Because you can do this thing, Brandon
End of the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around
'll be back to you out to dinner
Get you back in the groove
9:30
Nobu
Gotta catch my flight
See you tonight
Look sharp
We're turning it around
backs out, kills the lights
Darkness returns and -- - alone at a table, sipping a sake when , evening dress, sits next to him
Hey,  didn't know you were coming
Walter was delayed, he's coming back in the morning
Asked if 'd fill in
(processing this) That's funny, he didn't call me
You look great
silent
BRAndon You okay
Julia did her ballet recital today
God she was beautiful
She is
TONi He's betting again
regards her
can't believe 'm here again
saw it coming
just
just couldn't stop it
Nobody could
He won't stop on his own
He can't
gotta win one more game
You can't fix this, Brandon
BRANDOn After Sunday's game 'm taking off
- cab pulls up
and  emerge
looks around as they start up the steps
Both reach for their keys, regard one another
It's still early
Come in for a while
don't think so
She leans in to kiss him on the cheek and --  suddenly shifts
Their lips meet
casual goodbye suddenly grows in intensity as neither tries to part
Seconds ticking by
Things getting heated
tries to pull away
Brandon-- comes close, whispers something
He unlocks the door
She hesitates before  takes her hand, leads her into his dark apartment and -- - cold wind blows off the river
Whips through the cables of the span
match flares
' face is lit briefly by the flame
He stands on the bridge walkway, looking down at the brownstone and -- '  - Gray, winter day
View of a snow-covered window sill -- '  - '  fills a shaky   , video coming close to show  opening a book-size present -- removing a beautifully framed photo of  and
Look at that
With the leaves and all
This goes on my desk

Happy anniversary

Give Walter a smile
--  staring back at us and -- - loads up on newspapers and sports magazines and -- '  - surrounded by a sea of sports pages, comentary, ratings
He looks up at a blaring  and -- --   as various sports shows come on back-to-back -- each providing a wealth of competing Superbowl predictions and analysis
, for every hopped-up who picks Denver, an equally assured chooses New York
One after another
No consensus at all
Airwaves awash in past-season stats -- regular season stats -- post-season stats -- all of it blending into an overwhelming, mind-numbing, jarring blather of pure disagreement and -- - , suit and tie, splashes water on his face, stares at himself in the mirror
He pulls reams of stats and newspaper reports from his pocket, regards the Superbowl pick sheet
Blank space for the winner
Blank space for the over/under fumbling with his sheets of data, desperately searching for an answer when he suddenly hurls it all in the trash
Kicks the can
Kicks it again
' 60 seconds till we go live, Mr
Anthony
looks over
The unfinished pick sheet lies crumpled by the toilet
He smooths it
Pulls a coin
Heads, New York
Tails Denver
He flips the coin
Palms it
Heads
checks the box
Heads, over
Tails, under
flips again, lets the coin hit the floor, watches it spin, slowly come to a stop, drop to its side and -- - sits at the set
Looks over at , in his own world, working something from his teeth

Between now when they stop -- that's the greatest high in the world

'  - , suit and tie, looks through the glass at the feeding frenzy
He closes the blinds
Goes to the closet
Hangs up his jacket
Removes his tie and -- - Kick-off is seconds away
and the   gather around the set, turn up the sound
1ST New York wins the toss and elects to receive
2ND Some bettor somewhere just made some money
That's it
No more calls

(to , re: ) Look at him
Dead man walking, should be getting last rites
Hours away from losing everything, but Walter -- he's having the time of his life
Maybe he thinks he already did lose everything
, the ball's kicked and the game begins -- the explodes in cheers after a good play --  collide -- a fumble bounces across the field --  clamber atop desks for a better view --  in agony after an interception, a moment later elated when a flag brings the play back -- the score board  , New York trails 14/7 at the half and -- -- the tension level in the room is suddenly suspended
We're in the eye of the storm
like a fighter between rounds
appears
Hold onto that coin you flipped
Game keeps up like this 'll have to borrow it
It's not over yet, Walter
wouldn't change my bet
'  - packs things into a duffel bag
The Superbowl's on tv
The sound's off
Play's resumed
removes the watch
Sets it on a nightstand beside an envelope and the Mercedes keys
Picks up a plane ticket and -- - comes down the steps, carrying his bag, dressed the same as the day he came
starts down the sidewalk
Flags a cab
It stops
He opens the door, about to get in when a cheer from the   makes him look up and -- --  looks down from a window
Frozen beat
She turns away
climbs in the cab, drives off and -- - Fourth quarter
Superbowl blaring from the tv
New York's driving
Minutes left
The   are screaming at the set, climbing over each other to get a better view and New York suddenly scores and the room erupts and ' right in the middle of it, looks around -- Where the hell's Brandon
'  - The door's ajar
rushes in
You're missing the game
We're back in it
New York touchdown and we win both bets
Walter walks back to the bedroom
The tv's on
pauses to watch another play, about to leave when he spies the Rolex on the nightstand, envelope beside it
picks up the letter
Sees his name on the outside
He opens it, reads
appears in the
turns
He left

And you didn't you tell me
He asked me not to
Just like that
No goodbye
'm sure it's in the letter
'm sure it is
wonder what's not in here
What do you mean
What do you mean, what do  mean
When it comes to Brandon you seem to have all the answers
He had enough
He wanted his life back
He said that to you
Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving
think it's something else
Yeah, tell me
You know
No

New York's driving
Game reaching a head clock in the corner counts down the final two minutes
You have no idea, huh
You're missing the game
No 'm not
This is the game
- travels down an escalator and -- '  - at the door
approaches
Something was bothering him
mean sure, maybe he was homesick
Or  was thinking maybe he had such, you know, deep feelings for me he couldn't face saying goodbye
What a minute
just thought of something
Just came to me
Out of the blue
What about this
Maybe Brandon left without telling me because -- (full volume, in her face) You let him fuck you
--
New York  catches a long bomb
Nailed at the 20
Clock down to a minute 30
No time to huddle and -- Do you deny it
Do  have to

Really
Another "lock of the year
" saw you, Toni
saw you go into his room that night
This room
With him
never went to Vegas
- walks through

Don't talk to me about lying
guess you had the whole thing planned
Don't make this about me
Put me out there on a tray
Yeah,  put the tray out there -- but you didn't have to shove an apple in your mouth and jump on it
On him
-- New York throws a pass
Blocked
45 seconds left -- Admit it
You played me
You're damn right  did
Brandon was right
Son of a bitch
You don't deny it
Best pick he ever made

Inches away -- You were gambling with me that night, Walter
Brandon knew it
Knew you
He told me he was sure you were watching somehow
So he asked me in to spend the night, put on a show
didn't believe him --  mean after all we've been through -- but  figured what the hell
Toni con'd He slipped out the back, ' didn't even stay here
And you
you were in such a good mood the next day
figured he must have been wrong
Otherwise why wouldn't you confront us
Confront me

Last play
No time left
The New York drops back, about to be sacked, starts to run -- - The room's at fever pitch, everyone screaming at the  and -- '  - still as a statue

Living with it like that
Looking at me like that
You sick fuck
You wanted to lose
You set us up
Like  was something you just toss on the table
Only we booked your bet, Walter
Brandon and me
The two of us, who evidentally love you more than you love yourself
Your fantasy's to end up alone with nothing
Well  won't let that happen to you
Understand
will never let that happen
This is it
We're all we have, Walter
All we're ever gonna have
You and me, we're all that's real

Tears streaming down his face and -- - on the tv
Blaring the game
Bar going crazy as the New York  runs for the end zone
Juking
Dodging tackles
Nearing the goal
last-second block clears a lane and the  barrels by, dives -- a hit -- a fumble on the goal line -- a beat -- a replay -- a  signaling a touchdown -- and the game's over -- and New York has won, but more importantly they've covered the spread and -- walks down the corridor, his cell rings
Answering -- It's me

She said it's the best
' Where are you headed

' Does your mom know 'm in rehab
Yeah,  told her
' Great pick on New York
It's like  always said, you don't bet quarterbacks and receivers-- (finishing his words) --You bet the offensive line

That's exactly what was thinking about, pop
' (excitement creeping in) No kidding
Wow
Helluva game, huh
Boy, that opening drive was a beaut, the way they drove like that, six first downs -- you shoulda seen me, Brandon -- 'm screaming at the tv
