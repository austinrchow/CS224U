previous revisions by Mark Bomback current revisions by Frank Cappello November 14, 2002 : - Glimpses of an ancient city
Almost motionless against the tide of time
Sea swelled along an endless wall
Billowing silk frozen against the sky
Birds lighting on Byzantine columns
is of an imposing  beyond the trees
Corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite darkness
Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like atomized ether
There is
And tangled
prison cells the size of closets
Brief flashes of carved faces, insanity --     the -- gaunt  kneels on the granite, head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of Christ
But he's not just praying
He's digging
With his arm under the tapestry, he scratches at the stone with a
After only a year, the spoon finally breaks through
Prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door
He nudges a shoulder against it, digs in and pushes open, sucking air into the pitch black
' The tapestry covering the  is pulled against the wall, then billows outward like a sail
- pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air
He scans the musty room
Antique furniture
few empty crates
And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons
() 2
: He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above through the crumbling limestone
way out
Too high to reach, Prisoner pulls an old  out of a cobwebbed corner and slides it under the light
He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his foot crunches through
Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth
He pulls it out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a Nazi flag
At the center is a crudely-shaped
Eight inches long
Stains on the edges
Could be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal
Or maybe an ancient arrowhead
As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face
From
As if he's being watched by someone else
Prisoner spins, looks back  us
Nothing
starts toward the way out
The Guard's flashlight beam probes the cell -- one by one -- falls on the tapestry
Christ billows out from the wall, revealing the hole
- Lights
Guards with weapons rush through
Prisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight
- as  sweep across the ominous structure
Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for the trees on the other side of the wall
() 3
: (in Turkish) Stop
Stop
Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight Bullets streak toward him but never hit their target
Guards check their weapons on the run
- Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road
Headlights wash over him and
Prisoner spins, is right in the path of a car
-- car locks up but too late -- Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap
slides to a stop
jumps out, sees the front end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires
He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is stunned to see him getting to his feet
Uninjured
Prisoner is just as amazed
He glances at the  in his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd has appeared as if embossed in the flesh
Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off
this we hear --  '
- (50), stands over a young teen (13), , splashes holy water on her body
She screams again
Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes
Her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her hands and feet to the bed frame
Notice her fingernails
Drained of color
Almost black
Her  is off to one side, completely hysterical
On the other side is a crowd of bewildered , all crammed into the hallway outside the opened door
() 4
: Nothing can compare with an exorcism
Especially one that's gone bad
The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his heart
It's obvious he's totally out of his league here
lets out another  that   -- Not in a third world country but smack center in one of America's richest cities
Sparkling high-rises tower in the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt liquor
:     - faded yellow taxi   and stops
Someone steps out, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt
- Doors open, flood the musty darkness with a brief relief of sunlight
-- whose face we don't see -- steps inside, his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of a raven
He pauses, pulls an   and lights a cigarette
Takes a puff and pushes on inside
Lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the unexplainable
The Stranger pushes through
Suspicious faces step out of his path
The ones that don't he pushes aside -- even the gangbangers
The man has no patience for politeness, no time for tact, no fear of anything
This man is
He arrives at his destination, barges into -- 5
7B One scan of the situation is all it takes
The bed -- the child -- the panicked priest -- who rushes to John
(whispering) Thank God you're here
John shoots him a disgusted look
Hennessey gives him a wide berth
John walks past the panic-stricken  without a glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing tip drooped over the edge
He puts a gloved hand to the child's face and it burns on contact
His demeanor instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of the little girl and whispers -- This is Constantine
John Constantine, asshole
The girl , bandages on her arms cut into her skin
Eyes snap open -- glare right through him
How ya doing
Vamos juntos a matarla
John whips out a key chain crammed with medallions
Let's see who we got here
He holds them up so they cast shadows across Jeanie's face
He flips through each of these sculptured until the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look away
John stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely puzzled
He turns to the Mother -- very serious
need a mirror
Now
Shaken, the Mother produces a small compact
John pushes it away, turns to the doorway crowd
large mirror
At least -- (sizes up the child) -- three feet high
() 6
: The hallway crowd discusses possibilities
Tenants run to retrieve a mirror
Hennessey looks worried
John grabs the bed -- shoves Hennessey aside as he swings the bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way
Faces it toward the window
-  5G Several of the  from the hallway crowd storm through an  ' stuffy apartment, locate a huge iron- framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the wall
centers on a drapery , pulls hard
Drapery off the curtain rod as he swings open the window, looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is parked
Chaz
(20s) looks up from his cab
Cool
Frustrated
You just know he'd love to be up there, not down here
Move the car
Why
John frees the drapery rope, ducks back into the room
Park the car -- Move the car
Chaz shifts into reverse, moves the car three feet
There,  moved the damn car
7
Four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror
The Old Woman follows, begs them to be gentle
They swing the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister
She freaks
7B Hennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through the window and loops it over the ceiling fan
He climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes have closed and she's shaking badly
Her body seems to be going into shock
Isn't strong enough for this
John has no choice -- slaps her
Eyes pop back open
Dark and dilated
He yells down at her in Aramaic and English
Amar natash bow basar
-- Rescind from the flesh  command thee -- The girl chokes as if ready to spit
That's it -- time to go home
Jeanie  -- Tiempo para morir
Her body suddenly  half again larger
John recoils for a beat
Odd
He continues in Aramaic -- Amar natash bow basar -- Another  and this time a  is clearly seen expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon inside were trying to burst right through
John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh, like fingers caressing from the other side
John glances to Hennessey
What the hell
arrives at the doorway,  against the
John waves them in
The four men heft it into the room
Lift it
Over the bed
Up
() 8
: John ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over him
Hennessey, tie it off -- Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly ties one end of rope to the mirror
John straddles the girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above him
Now close your eyes -- all of you -- and whatever happens -- do not look into the mirror
The men close their eyes
Muscles tense under the weight
Amar natash bow basar
-- rescind from the flesh  command thee
Jeanie reacts -- that  reappears, contorts the young body all out of proportion
John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is reflected inside
It's not just the image of a young girl in there, but something else
The surface of the mirror  in the hands of the men
One starts to look -- No
Jeanie  -- breaks free of the straps
She rises up, grabs John tight around the throat
Nails dig deep
John
(looking into mirror) Not yet
John struggles, puts his hands over her mouth -- cutting off her air supply
Question is, who's going to pass out first
Jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her
She goes into shock, body collapsing -- shaking -- close to death
() 9
: Look
Look at me
But she's passing out first
John quickly takes the medallion that caused the earlier reaction -- Goddamit -- look
-- and presses it against her forehead
Eyes snap wide and John unblocks the mirror
Jeanie locks on her reflection and the image in the mirror changes drastically
Smile pretty you vain prick
The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off One that knows it just got suckered in
wildly in the men's grip
Demon reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into three- space as the girl takes her last breaths -- Now, Hennessey
Now
Hennessey  the rope with all three-hundred-plus pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended For your boss
Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion
Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of wood -- No you don't
John jumps up and helps push the mirror free
- Falls   from the 7th story -- tumbling end over end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, the image of the Demon into the  cityscape buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three hundred pounds of    come  down the taxi's hood
() 10
: Demon's image  on impact -- into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air
The  of something evil reverberates into the city beyond
Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet
- Jeanie  -- takes her first breath as a child again
And
Mother pulls her in, hugs her tight
Note the girl's fingernails
No longer black
John's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still burning
Takes a drag
He pushes past Hennessey who is approaching the mother
Now about the fee
John slips   into the kitchenette, hides the fact that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance
He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge
drawing of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick
This image is repeated over and over
John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away
-  - Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing the gathered tenants
few are freaked, cross themselves
Others horrified
But many want to touch them, shake their hands
shadowy  several floors up stares over the rail at the heroes below
Note the slick suit, the polished veneer
This is  and he definitely does not rent here
He flicks an ancient  between his fingers
pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing something
No one there
Balthazar is gone
() 11
: shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps where Hennessey is shoving his  in front of the tenants
They're gladly giving to the cause
Thank you
Yes
Gracias
Hennessey
Hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the exit
John and Hennessey stop near the front entrance
John rips the white collar from Hennessey's neck
know,  know, but  didn't think she was really possessed, not like that
'm not back an hour and you drag me into -- -- Don't be mad, John, don't be -- John rummages through his coat pockets -- On the left side
John keeps searching
Vest pocket
John rips his smokes from the left vest pocket -- Don't do that shit on me -- Sorry, sorry
Here, you can have half
Hennessey starts to divvy the cash but John snatches the hat
() 12
: should take it all, save you from yourself
He gestures that bagged  in Hennessey's jacket
It keeps them out, so  can sleep
Please, John,  need to sleep
John stares at his pathetic friend, sighs, finally slips a few bills from the wad and hands them over
Hennessey is bubbling with appreciation, starts to follow
John simply holds up a hand
Hennessey stops, watches John walk out
Alone
John turns the corner, spots Chaz punching a dent from the taxi's hood
told you to move it
Well maybe if you had told me you were dropping a three-hundred pound mirror with a pissed-off demon in it  would have moved it further
Chaz slams the hood
They slide into the car
Well
Well what
Chaz reaches back into John's front coat pocket -- pulls out Hennessey's wad of cash -- slips off a few bills
Shouldn't have cut your stay in the land of enlightenment
You were so close to growing a conscience
John grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and sits back
() 13
: Los Angeles
He looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled
Never ceases to entertain
Chaz crams the car in gear as John takes a drag, coughs
One of those perfect days
With perfect clouds
So clear you feel you could reach out and touch Heaven
Two young girls rise   on side-by-side swings
For a moment they're suspended against that incredible sky
Then gravity takes hold and they fall back to Earth
(
) You still with me
- ' (30) weary eyes open
She's on her belly hidden between track ties and shadows even deeper
Grips a police-issue revolver tight
She's pinned down, unable to move
Yeah
The  is thirty feet down the same track
Their off the curved walls, come from everywhere
How either of these two got here isn't important
Who will get out is
(
) So what's next, Detective
We gonna do a full marathon
Intermittent   buzzes from Angela's - You get the sense Angela is not alone in here
Put your weapon on the tracks and step out with your hands above your head
() 14
: (
) Or how 'bout you show yourself and put a bullet in your skull just like  did hers
That's just not going to happen
(
) You sure about that
Angela checks the chamber -- sees she has one bullet left
(almost pleading) Now put down your weapon on the tracks and -- to
Tunnel starts to
(
) Well ain't this a peach
Angela looks back, sees several  of figures waving far off
Her  is flooded with futzed
(
) (over radio) Get off the tracks
Blueline is coming
Clear the tracks
Angela peeks over the track
Still no sign of her perp
The  is coming   and its  shoots through the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova
The  is
(
) 'mon, Detective, step into the light and be saved
Angela looks back, squints into the brilliant
She grips her  and in one burst of flat-out bravado -- rises as she
And there he is -- the Man rising with his own gun
Angela  as both dive off the track
His behind her
Hers finds its mark
Man goes down right in the train's path
() 15
: Angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her breath
She closes her eyes and crosses herself as the train roars past in a staccato blur
20    - Chaz's taxi pulls up, parks
,  suitcases stamped with
John starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells -- There are four bags
have two hands
This give you any ideas
Make two trips
John walks in
Chaz curses under his breath
20 Evening leagues are going strong
John walks in, looks totally out of place
He moves down the   area, runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally stops at a pearl-white dazzler
He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use
Number 13
John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead, scribbles right on the ball -- "
" He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished wood with his well-traveled Oxfords
Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity
An attractive brunette is rather curious
John gives her a wink
Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it
John bowls
Perfect hook ball
Strike
Brunette grins
John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the pool tables
16
' Seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as a bowling lane
Makes that cage enclosed bed at one end seem like it's a mile away
Chaz throws the suitcases on it as John arrives
(yells across room) Simple question
How much longer do  have to be your slave
John pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open
You're not my slave, Chaz
You're my very appreciated assistant
Like Tonto and Robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend
Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon Sparkletts bottles
Each is adorned by a small hand- marked
John takes a moment to adjust one out of place
How much longer
John doesn't like his tone
Well  don't know, what's the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of Hell
So what time you want me back
John gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his pockets
need to make an appearance at Midnite's
Say ten-ish
Chaz sighs, starts out -- Chaz
Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him
() 17
: little something from Delphi
It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow
Chaz tips it
Moooooo
John finds it rather amusing
Gee, thanks
Chaz leaves
John removes a small   from his jacket
He sets it carefully on its own shelf by the window -- stares out
(
) 'Provisions depleted
' John turns to see  waddle in
gave you three months worth
You were gone only one
This diminutive occult version of Bond's "" carries a custom bowling bag and squints in the light like a mole
What can  say, Beeman, India was a real drain
They shake hands
Beeman sets his bowling bag onto the table, unzips it
So what do you need
Everything you got
(pausing) You smell something, John
Maybe
Incubus in this girl just exorcized seemed a bit more spirited than usual
Beeman starts pulling things out
First is a frayed
Then glass containers
() 18
: Well, 've got your stone fragments from the Road to Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea Scrolls -- oh, you'll love this -- Out comes a little  with a smiling bug graphic
Screech beetle from Mount Sinai
He shakes the matchbox and the  flutters inside
It's  create an eerie -
John shrugs
So
Yeah, to you it's nothing but to the Fallen -- like fingernails on a chalkboard
What is it with you and bugs
Beeman pulls out a set of sculptured
Actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings
John takes them, tries them on
Nice fit
Gold was blessed by the Bishop Anicott during the Crusades
John spots a foot-long   in the bag, pulls it out, grips the bicycle handle on one end
Watch it there
With this puny little thing
John gives the handle a squeeze and  -- ten-foot   out
Dragon's breath
thought you couldn't get it anymore
Beeman shrugs, modesty
John starts to put it down on the table and Beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away
() 19
: Whoa, don't want to get a flame near this
(off John's look) Piece of the shroud Moses wore to the mountain
John picks it up -- You're shitting me, right
Nope
Got any callinicus
(intrigued) How spirited was this incubus
(coughs) Like it was trying to come right out through the girl Beeman just stares at him -- is this a joke
know how it sounds
We're finger puppets to them, John, elaborate costumes -- they can work us but don't come through us
They can't
You know that
Check the scrolls anyway
Corinthians
See if there are any precedents
Sure, John
Anything else
(coughs again) Wouldn't happen to have anything for -- Beeman sets down a bottle from the bag -- Vick's 44
On the house
- Lots of blue on blue in this parking lot
20
Locker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the grime of the subway
She's pained as she pulls off her shoulder holster
Looks at herself in the door mirror
Tired, aging eyes stare back
(
) Gutsy move out there, Dodson
Angela glances at   as he opens his locker
Gutsy
Well that's a new one
The two exchange a look
You're alive
Bad guy's dead
No point in using the other words
Thanks
(shuts his locker) Even though it was reckless -- irresponsible -- stupid
knew you still cared
You're good, Angela, real good but one of these days
(heard it before) know, nobody's luck lasts forever
He meets her eyes
Exactly
He really does care
Weiss breaks it off, leaves
Angela turns to close her locker door, notices her reflection does not turn
She grabs the door, looks back in
Reflection is as it should be
She shudders, slams the locker door
- 10 So exclusive there's not even a line out front
Just a pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun
() 21
: Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance Bouncer selects a   from a deck
On the front are
Only we can see the back, which is -- Two frogs on a bench
Yep
They let him pass
Chaz steps up and lucky him -- he gets the same
Two frogs on a bench
But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card shows a  in a dress
What
But 'm with him
Right, John
John
John glances back -- gives him an impassive look
Chaz backs away, stares after him
Someday
this exclusive establishment
It's a clash of cultures and influences not easily dated
retro speakeasy for the new millennium
John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies of a twisted city play out in the shadows
He pauses, sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing off for several ladies
One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water
Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into The ladies are very impressed, drink up
, a young black man, walks past John
Neighborhood's going to Hell
John offers a half smile
He likes this kid, walks on
One of the men in the group turns, watches John
Balthazar
He grins and pockets that odd
John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of two very large doors
() 22
: Their surface is ancient, the wood petrified over countless centuries
John places his fingers into the gnarled folds, closes his eyes -- Numquam leadatur a morsu
living   from the rigid seams but the doors don't budge
Bastard changed the code again
(bangs the doors) Midnite
Come on, do  have to huff and puff here
The doors unlatch
' a meticulously-crafted , a scientific sculpture that normally displays our solar system in relative motion
But the planets here are ancient with symbols and names -- , , , , etc
And the globe at the center -- "
" This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe
And it's not moving
(
) Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes
John steps in through the doors behind
Deciding which color to paint this place again
stands in the jungle he calls an office
Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman full six and half feet of solid contradictions
You're back early
got tired of spending your money
() 23
: But 'm sure you spent enough
Well  do have a certain standard of living
Tell me you found it
found the vault
That's not what  asked
Hey, can  help it if Buddhist monks don't take bribes
Midnite strides toward him when John calmly pulls from his pocket a small ebony and gold
It stops Midnite cold
Gotcha
reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features
He takes the relic in his thick fingers -- stares breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a cosmic wind
Second century depiction of a sephiroth in the 4th realm
Right
So we good here
Midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the Universal orrery
It should counter the iconic plane -- That damn thing's never going to balance
Midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts to move
To turn
() 24
: John is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt
Midnite deflates, stares at John, suspiciously
Must  remind you of what selling fake relics will do to your health
It's authentic, Midnite, you just have the wrong piece
Jesus
The two have a mini stare-down
John's rigid poker face is only broken by a cough
Midnite sighs, breaks it off
What
--  didn't blink -- that was a cough
You never cough
Midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a thick stack of
Better not be any Washingtons in here this time
Why did you cut your trip short
John stops the counting, actually thinks about it
don't know
Just a feeling -- John suddenly spins toward the entrance doors, is stunned to see -- Balthazar
Balthazar is behind him
Utterly confident
Chillingly so
We're not still whining about Manhattan, are we
John's attempt to disguise his anger fails
That expression alone has made my entire night
() 25
: John takes several steps toward him
Grins
Malevolent
There's history here
'll make your night -- 'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand -- John stops in his tracks
It's bad enough that you let these half-breeds in at all but this piece of shit -- Perks of becoming a primary investor
What
Midnite's eyes say it all -- not here, not now
Things change, balances shift
Get used to it, Constantine
Not while 'm still breathing -- John starts to cough again
'm sorry,  didn't catch that
John tries to catch his breath, can't
And that scares him a bit
He tries to hide it, pushes out
John  out the exit -- coughing
He pulls the Vicks 44 from his jacket, struggles with the child protector cap
Hey, John
() 26
: John is surprised to see Hennessey waiting
He chokes, is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle
Hennessey grabs hold, twists off the cap with one flick
John guzzles the syrup
'm real sorry about this morning, John, real sorry
Please don't hate me for draggin' you into that
Please don't
John can finally breathe
don't hate you
That's good to hear
Real good
But could you at least wait until call for you before you show up
You didn't call
Not yet
Jesus, Hennessey, you freak me out sometimes
So you want me to go away and come back
No
've got an assignment for you
Really
What kind of assignment
The kind you'll have to be sober for
Oh God, you want me to surf the ether
He instinctively touches an  around his neck
Four intersecting crosses
Come on, you know that exorcism wasn't right
() 27
: don't have the Sight anymore
Don't have it or don't want to use it
Hennessey vacillates
This is obviously tough for him
Just look around
few days
You spot anything unusual, anything -- you let me know
Okay
John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy, then reaches behind his neck -- It'll be like old times
-- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck
That unnerves the big guy
John drops it in Hennessey's pocket
Just for a few days
Okay, okay
for you, John
Like old times
Right
Hennessey takes one last sip from his drink, hands the bottle over
John downs the rest
Nods
'  -   - Angela sits inside
killed a man today
Another one
sits on the other side of the mesh window
'm sorry, Angela
Most cops go twenty years without firing their gun
Not me always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
28
-    - Angela arrives home
Pours milk for a cat
Lets her hair down
Slips off her shoes
(
) didn't even see his face just pulled the trigger and he went away
Just like all the others
Angela in the  -- trying to wash off the guilt
(
) These feelings are natural in your line of work, Angela
'd be worried if you didn't have them
Angela now in a recliner, cat in her lap
She's tired
Eyes are heavy
(
) But you have to be strong
You can't allow your faith to be overshadowed by guilt
(
) 'm trying
Her eyes close
(
) 'm trying real hard
- Angela's eyes open
An Angela whose frightened features are dripping with a fever sweat
She's in a hospital gown, stares around a corner
Janitor polishes the floor in the distance
nurse checks off charts in the f
g
And right between the two darts Angela, unseen by anyone
- metal fire door swings open and Angela bursts out -- breathing deep
She runs across the tar roof, almost afraid to look back
She gets to the ledge, steps up
in the way fall --     the -- 29
-- where it  -- The sound has drawn the attention of  (10) lying in bed
He moves up and stares out the window -- sees the broken glass in the courtyard
He scans up the building and spots a  standing on the roof
- Chilling April air flutters Angela's gown, vaporizes her breath
Tears stream down her cheeks as she contemplates the unthinkable
Cityscape of lights are spread out below but Angela is seeing something else
-- is a city engulfed in
Follow that tear with the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek and slips into her mouth
shudders, rubs her wrist where we see the skin has swelled and reddened just like the Prisoner's
And there's that same circular symbol in the flesh
She wipes her tears -- tries to be strong
Takes a few breaths for courage, them simply steps off
' '   follow her down
- Barry approaches across the barren courtyard, leans down to Angela's contorted body
But she's still alive
Barry stares into eyes that are fading fast
He reaches out, touches her face
Eyes close
She's gone
' Angela stirs awake
Disturbed
this we hear   -- 30
'  - John switches on the light, leans up from the sink and wipes his mouth with a towel
It's covered with blood
More runs down the drain
He stares at himself in the mirror
John's worried eyes -- : - ' looking equally distraught
(
) It's her, Angela
-  -   - Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several officers and medical personnel
It's Isabel
They arrive at the covered body in the courtyard
Coroner sees Angela approach and lifts the sheet from the face
Angela comes to a dead stop, emotions coming fast and furious
She leans close and we see a mirror of Angela
That's when you realize that wasn't a dream
This is her twin
But that circular symbol is nowhere on her wrist now
Angela's eyes well with tears
It takes everything she has to stay in control
Helps to wrap herself in the job
She steps back, looks up at the tall building
She
she fell from the roof
No
She jumped
Angela gives him an incredulous glare
Shakes her head
know it's hard to accept but -- () 31
: Isabel would never in a million years take her own life
Never
Angela
there was a surveillance camera on the roof
- John marches down a hallway, his trench coat a step behind
He unconsciously rubs his left wrist, coughs
Flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers
John stops at a doctor's office door -- hesitates
- View of the rooftop
There's Isabel in her nightgown, stepping up -- pausing just a second
Then one step and she's gone
So clear
So unrefutable
Angela shudders as a comforting  rests on her shoulder
(
) Take some time
Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the others on the other side of the room
Whose hand was that
' illuminate several  - sinister splotch snakes through both
John stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief
No -- 've beaten things, insurmountable things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think 'm going to be done in by
He raises a puny little cigarette
(50) sighs
delicate bedside manner is not his specialty
() 32
: You wouldn't be the first, John
It can't be that simple
mean come on, Les, you saved me before
You can do it again, right
This is different
This is aggressive
John tries to stay cool -- fails
He  the -ray boxes
Diseased lungs disappear
Doc shakes his head
Twenty years ago you didn't want to be here
Now you don't want to leave
That's because  know exactly where 'm going this time
John steps outside of the Doctor's office, pauses to gather himself
He starts walking
Wants out of here fast
- Angela is on the move
Emotions are coming in strong
She can't get out of here fast enough
She aims for the elevators, sees a  has just entered one
(rushing toward it) Wait, hold the door
Angela, gets to the elevator, looks in
John stands inside alone
This should be the first time we realize they were in the same hospital
Going down
John pauses as the doors start to close
() 33
: Not if  can help it
The doors close right on Angela
- crosses a barren landscape
In the back bed are several goats and one Prisoner
He grips the relic tight in one hand
That anxious fever has returned
Glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising jetliner in the distance -- dart back to the road they're on -- heading the opposite way
Prisoner clamps his eyes tight, grips to the relic tighter
Eyes snap open and he turns, thrusts his elbow through the center window, leans in and grabs the Driver -- jerks his head back against the bulkhead -- cracking it in the process
Prisoner latches onto the wheel, takes control
He swerves the car off the pavement, gets out and takes over as driver
Truck continues on, bouncing through a shallow ditch and into the field beyond, aiming straight for the rising airliners in the distance
- Close to condemned status
floor after floor, a window covered with aluminum foil
' Every wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum foil
sober Hennessey stands surrounded by decades of newspapers and periodicals -- tries to get his breathing in check
He instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet but it's not there
Oh yeah -- in the pocket
Decision made, he reaches up, starts tearing the foil from the walls and the window
34
(
) - John sits at a park bench
Motionless
Taking in the world
Clouds passing the sun
Shadows drifting across the city
Leaves swirling after passing cars
John just sits there,  every breath he takes, wondering which one will be his last
(
) Lung cancer
Lung cancer
John turns to see  (23) strutting up the sidewalk
Uninhibited
Oozing sex appeal
But dangerous
In more ways than you think
That's funny as shit, John
As if you guys didn't have something to do with it
Hey,  think you brought this one on yourself
John stares at her, tries to get a read
Now why wouldn't you trust me
don't know, something in the air -- She sits right on his lap, playfully
Don't worry, John, you'll beat this
You beat everything
Not this time, Ellie
John lifts her off of him, sets her aside
Oh wow, you're serious
No wonder the Boss is in such a good mood
Yeah,  thought maybe you could talk to him for me
You know
() 35
: Ellie jumps off the bench, creates an odd  as she does
What
Dammit, John,  know  owe you but to even  that
All those saints and martyrs slipping through his grasp -- his own foot soldiers sent back to him in chunks
He's going to take all that out on you, John, and he's going to enjoy ripping your soul to shreds until the end of time
So  take that as a 'no
' You're the one soul the man himself would actually come up here to collect
And you know how much he despises this place
'm starting to see his point
Ellie sits back down, strokes his arm
Have you gone to see the Snob
Like scratching fingers across a blackboard
No way
Look, don't let your ego get in the way on this
'd miss having someone up here  can
relate to
She gives him a kiss
And for a second John's leg is brushed by a tail
John doesn't react
Just turns and walks away
/
'  - Seen through a mild rain is the Theological Society building, a foreboding structure that looks out of place for this city
John stares out the back seat window, takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor
He turns to Chaz -- () 36
: 'm sure  can get you in here
Chaz gives the building another glance, shoves the meter flag back down
Tick
tick
tick
Pass
- few bishops talk quietly
cardinal studies Scriptures
Definitely not the place for atheists
John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the -- John stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front of a fireplace
One is a young man of pure class wrapped in Armani's best
The other is Father Garret
John stands to the side and waits for their conversation to end
An  makes the rounds
Can  take your coat, Mr
Constantine
No thanks, 'm not staying long
How about you, ma'am
Attendant turns to Angela standing just a few feet away, her gaze fixed on the same two men
'm not staying long either
John glances over and for the second time they make contact
Something about her eyes
John stares a bit too long
Angela looks back toward the fireplace
My business with him is urgent
First come, first served
() 37
: So you're rude no matter where you are
John gives her a look
The two men shake hands and start to part
John and Angela make their move toward the men
Both are surprised when Angela goes for Father Garret and John goes for -- -- the , officially known as
Yes, that one
and Angela have retreated to another area for privacy
Why is he stalling on this
My sister needs a Catholic funeral
Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin -- She didn't commit suicide
The Bishop has read otherwise
Father
David -- this is Isabel
(meeting his eyes) Please
Father Garret stares at her, tries to be compassionate
'll talk to him again
But Angela has just lost a load of faith
Gabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with unblinking eyes
John approaches from behind and against the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings
The ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat
(without looking back) know what you want, son
() 38
: John sits across from him
Been keeping your all-seeing eye on me, have you
could offer how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous
So you're going to make me beg
Angela pauses on her way out, looks over
It wouldn't help
You've already wasted your chance at redemption
What about the minions 've sent back, the souls that 've saved -- that should guarantee my passage across -- (keeping it private) -- No -- passage requires faith and faith by definition is belief without proof
You have proof
And that means you're not playing by the same rules as everyone else
Your work has mostly been for selfish reasons
'm sorry
This is bullshit -- bullshit
Now he's really got Angela's attention
It's like you've got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do -- help an old lady across the street -- put in a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime -- you're fucking nickel and diming us to death down here
Keep your voice down
() 39
: John jumps up, leans into his face
And you know what, you're the ones with the problem, not us -- You make these impossible rules to decide who goes up, who goes down and you don't even understand us -- This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin
Each of you is born with the promise of salvation preordained
The cost of your redemption is simple belief
And yet you whine about impossible rules
Sometimes imagine you hardly deserve the gift you have been given
Gift
More like a curse the way you manage things
Gabriel stands and towers over John
am taking your situation into account, John, but don't push me
Why me, Gabriel
It's personal, isn't it
didn't go to church enough
didn't pray enough was five bucks short in the collection plate
Why
Gabriel moves right up to him, makes this very personal
You're going to die because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15
And you're going to Hell because of the life you took
Or to put it in a way that your kind would understand
You're fucked
- Angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour
She hears a cough, looks over to see John standing on the other side, looking equally frayed
They share another glance
() 40
: John fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket
Empty
He has a rotten sense of humor
(steps past) And his punch lines are killers
John tosses the cigarette pack, walks right into the , away from Chaz's taxi pulling up
(shouting out) John
It's raining
Hey
Angela watches John disappear in the rain, looks down at the empty cigarette pack
: '  - lies on the floor next to food wrappers, Coke bottles and stacks of newspapers
Hennessey sits amongst the garbage, slumped over
But he's not sleeping
He's surfing the ether
Allowing his sixth sense to guide him
His hands move down and across the stacks of newer periodicals, fingers probing the layers of information
Left hand suddenly stops
Hennessey's eyes open
He removes the layers of periodicals on top of his left hand, leans close
Edges his fingers away and sees an
name -- Isabel Dodson
- John walks the streets, numb to the world
rat scurries past near the curb
Then another
Several crows fly by
Above him is a  - "
" Doesn't matter that below it is -- "
" The point is crystal clear
John shakes his head, breaks out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit
He leans to a gutter
Another rat scoots past
John barely notices
Then a frog jumps past
But it's the crab crawling by that finally catches John's gaze
() 41
: (
) Hey, buddy, you got a light
John turns, settles on a silhouetted figure standing behind him, unlit cigarette butt in its mouth
(coughs) We gotta stick together, right
John gathers himself
As he walks over to this  , he rummages through his coat pocket, retrieves a matchbox
The box shudders as a high-pitch  filters from inside
Old Man winces as his entire body
John realizes -- this is Beeman's matchbox, the one with the screech beetle inside
And now he knows -- a beat too late
Old Man attacks
John is knocked onto his haunches
As the Old Man closes in, he's revealed in more detail
Body and face are actually an intricate puzzle, an assemblage of city vermin
Rats, insects, crows, frogs, crabs -- all held together in the shape of a man
John scampers backwards, just inches from this being's outstretched grasp
He shakes the matchbox and the screech beetle inside flutters again
Old Man/Demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart for a second, then snaps back together
He  onto John with fingers of squirming vermin
Snake wraps around his wrist
Crab snaps at his skin
John shakes the beetle box harder -- causing the parts to vibrate even further
Old Man grabs John's head and vermin of various leg count crawl right onto John's face
John's had enough -- shakes the matchbox violently, then smashes it against the sidewalk
lets out a death  and the Old Man stutters -- his parts vibrating so wildly you can actually see the b
g
through the seams
John scampers loose, grabs a road barricade and swings it with all his might
Old Man form shatters on impact
() 42
: The entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of scattering critters
John starts stomping on them as they scatter into the city
John stands there, shocked and concerned
What the hell is going on
'  - That surveillance   from Ravenscar plays again
There's Isabel in her nightgown walking across the roof
Spread out on a cluttered coffee table is Isabel's case file
'  is opened
Let's see " " and the biggie -- "Cause of Death --
" Angela sits on the couch in her robe
Disheveled and distraught
She's taking this hard
'm sorry, Isabel
She lowers her head
And in that brief moment of silence -- (
) (on ) Constantine
Angela snaps back to the , freezes in shock
There's Isabel ready to jump but this time she's looking right back  us -- at Angela
Then she's gone
Angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence again
This time Isabel doesn't look back
This time there is no name
But Angela did see it
Did hear it
She sits for a second
Stunned
' John paces as Midnite works on that Universal orrery, adjusting components but balance continues to elude him
few months, maybe a year
That's it
End of story
Game over
() () 43
: (') (as Midnite doesn't react) Well, don't break down on my account
What do you want from me shoulder to cry on
This bastard attacked me right out in the open -- on Sepulveda no less
They don't like you, John
You've deported how many back to Hell
That's just it -- this wasn't some possession or wayward half breed, it was a full-fledged demon
Here
On our plane
Right
know what  saw
You must have just crossed over and didn't even realize it -- didn't cross over -- It was on this side
Here
-- it's wet out, you're wandering around aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional -- Emotional
John slams a fist against the counter
The orrery almost topples but Midnite saves it
Decades of work almost lost
Midnite glares at a desperate John
() 44
: Okay, so you saw something
We've seen a few small ones slip through now and then
It's more than that
first the girl, then this
John, you know my connections
Any shifts or tremors in the planes and 'd hear about it
John just shakes his head, looks up -- convinced
Something's coming
Midnite sighs, gives up with him
- The name   is center screen on a monitor -- typed into the police station's
Angela sits alone in the squad room, rain streaking across the windows
Interpol comes back with results and a list of priors scroll under John's name
Must be a hundred
Several tickets and a few
In fact John's license has been
But it's the other incidents that draw Angela in
Of specific words in a few  -- "Occult activity on the rise
" "Claimed possession is refuted by Bishop
" "Satanic cult dissolved
" Accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos
--   on a  -- Odd  burned into a ceiling
cross burnt to a crisp
--  in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her son in her arms
younger and more noble Father Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful
() 45
: Another line -- "  to
" Angela scrolls, sees cities listed where John has made waves --  --  --  --  --
Stops on the one that matters --
And there's an address
Angela hits  and the   away
desk
Angela quickly looks around, sees she's the only one here
She gets up, answers it
This is Dodson, hello
Dead air
The next
Angela reaches for it when the   , and the , the
The   phone to phone in intimidating mockery
Angela freezes, forces herself to stay calm
Sure enough, the  abruptly
Angela reaches over, rips the page from the printer, leaves
- police guard scans passengers and a printout of the Prisoner
He walks past a man standing in the metal detector line
This is actually the Prisoner wearing the clothes and glasses of the Driver
Is that a blood stain on the lapel
Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver
He has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt
Watching the Prisoner
He looks back  us, suspicious
Nothing there
looks back nervously, as his bag goes through the detector
46
shows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and nothing else
The iron relic doesn't even produce an outline
Bag slides out, untouched
Prisoner can't believe his luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates
- of the city -- the contrasts between the bright and cheerful and the dark and mysterious
That abandoned mission behind Bob's Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged between competing banks
-- The towering statue of The Good Shepherd
His hands are welcoming us into the "
" Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley
20  - John drinks alone
Pissed at life
At death
That small black box of his lies on the table unopened
Spider runs across the table
John flips an empty glass, traps it underneath
He takes a drag on his cigarette, tips the glass and blows smoke inside
Spider can't escape the poison air, bumps the glass
Trapped
Dying
Welcome to my life
(
) Mr
Constantine
John looks up, spots Angela
Those eyes again
saw you at -- --  remember
And -- Yeah
() 47
: She did make an impression
'd like to ask you a few questions
'm not really in the talking mood right now
Could you just listen then
Angela sets her  detective badge on the table
Please
Always a catch
Angela sits across from him, puts the badge away
My sister was murdered last week
Sorry to hear
Her name was Isabel
Isabel Dodson
She looks for a reaction
None
You don't remember her
Never met her
You sure
She look anything like you
(as Angela nods) would've remembered
Another beat as their eyes meet
John looks away
() 48
: She was a patient at Ravenscar
Then last Tuesday she just decided to step off the roof
thought you said she was murdered
Isabel would never take her own life
You'd be surprised at what people will do
Look,  know 'm not making much sense -- hell 'm not really sure what 'm doing here
just feel -- the circles you travel in -- the occult, demonology, exorcisms
John just stares at that spider in the glass
Trapped
believe someone got to her, Mr
Constantine, brainwashed her into stepping off that roof
Some kind of legion or cult
Sounds like a theory
Good luck
Well  thought with your background and experience, you could at least point me in the right direction
Yeah, okay
Sure
John points -- toward the exit
Angela is not amused
But she's not giving up
My sister always talked about a world better than this
Heaven as some call it
She wasn't afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her
What everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life -- () 49
: -- she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity
(beat) That about right
The words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless
John sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it back -- but it's too late
She turns and starts out, slows -- You're not the only one afraid of Hell
John tries not to let that get to him
She leaves
He glances out the window, watches her pass by
So long
Good riddance
But something's not right
Those deep shadows on the buildings seem to be moving
John watches, confused, realizes they're heading in Angela's direction
Oh shit
He stands, gains his bearings
As he walks out he flicks the glass over
Spider runs free
20    - Cars are lined all the way down the street
Angela walks along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her
It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in with each step
(
) Detective
Angela looks back, sees John in the street
How open is your mind
() 50
: She doesn't answer, continues walking
What she doesn't see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes
But John does
He starts walking toward her
Do you believe in Heaven and Hell
(off no answer) How about what comes out of each
Angela keeps walking
He catches up with her
Hey
You mean like angels
And demons
Angela stares at him, continues walking
He keeps up
See, you don't have the mindset for this kind of work
They walk together down the lonely street
Look,  see terrible things every day
mother drowns her baby ten-year-old shoots his father
But it's not demons, it's the evil that men do
Behind them, a streetlight
Then another
They're not looking back so they don't see it
You're right, we're capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy
Another  , blinks out
Then sometimes, something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it
() 51
: don't believe in demons
You should
They believe in us
They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then blacks out
Both look up
The next   then
Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind them
She looks to John
But he's staring straight ahead
Because now the light in front of them is We should go
Second later it
John grabs her hand -- Fast
Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural races toward them
John jerks her into action
They run towards the next light
It blinks out right when they reach it
They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd
They make it through the gate, pass through an alley of overhanging trees
Something  through the branches -- flitters right past Angela's face
She swats at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek
They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights , fade out
Statues of saints become dark monoliths
John stops in an   between trees and a mausoleum
lit  on the wall provides the only illumination
Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of blood
Now she hears  in the darkness
Like Surrounding them
What is that
() 52
: John is just as surprised he's saying this -- Wings
Wings
John rummages through his trench coat -- fishes out that cloth Beeman gave him
The one supposedly wrapped around Moses
And maybe talons
The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer
Are you kidding
Of what
Something that's not supposed to be here
John quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand
Angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get -- ghastly sound of  in the fringes of light
The cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with every second the circle of light gets smaller and those John takes out his special lighter
Close your eyes
They are now standing in pitch darkness
Why
Suit yourself
John flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion -- sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand
Sacred cloth catches fire -- then  with a brilliant retina-searing  -- blinding Angela and illuminating a -- --     -- a roiling broth of reptilian death -- right there -- ready to pounce
() 53
: radiates from the cloth and   as they are instantly vaporized
John tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket, extinguishes the flame
He leans down to a rubbery stain left from one of the burnt demon carcasses
Shakes his head in disbelief
(to himself) ' accidentally crossed over
' don't think so
(coming up behind) What was that
saw wings -- and teeth -- they were flying
What the hell were those things
They weren't angels
John scans the area, trying to think this through
Seplavites, actually
Scavengers for the damned
(off her lost look) Demons
What
You can't be serious
this is impossible
Yeah
(to himself) And  don't think they were after me
John looks at her with renewed interest
You really believe she wouldn't commit suicide
(a bit thrown) My sister
(a beat) Never in a million years
John makes the decision
() 54
: Let's be sure
He starts walking
Angela is now compelled to follow
How
Simple
See if she's in Hell
- Not exactly an inviting place
Hennessey steps off the curb, looks up at his destination
'  - John stares at a photo of Angela and her father in police uniform
Obviously happier times
Angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box
That gray cat follows close to her heels
These are all Isabel's things
The cat too
Yeah, why
John ignores the box of items, picks up the cat
He studies it a bit, then sits back in a chair with it
Don't you need candles and a pentagram for this to work
(deadpan) Why, do you have any
John puts his feet, shoes and all into a
need you to step outside now
() 55
: Angela wants to stay
Angela
Please
Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit
John holds the cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes
There's a moment where animal and man seem to connect
The water around John's feet begins to
pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on its way to latch
Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down
The room flickers, is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John has now crossed over into -- Same layout, different decorator
John takes a deep, raspy breath, slowly stands
He turns to the wall behind him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed structure in Beirut
Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a nightscape but a sickly sepia glow
Not quite day, not quite night
John steps over the crumbling wall into -- John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze of intersecting freeways
Burnt-out husks of long- forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock
low penetrates the silence
Is she here
On the horizon is a dying
It strains to cut through the putrid brown haze
Is she here
His   to infinity
() 56
: John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down to the ribbons of twisting streets below
They're crammed with teeming masses of the damned
All walking down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief
That low     and John now spots a huge blanket-like  crawling over the cityscape, rapidly closing in on him
You get the feeling this isn't a safe place for the living
It's a simple question
Is she here or not
John suddenly locks on something far off
On top of a distant skyscraper is a   in a sheer white gown
John can't make out her face but knows she's looking right at him
Isabel
She lifts something and tosses it
John watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing darkness
'  - In that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes pushing the door closed
As it  -- (
) (weakly) Angela
come back in
Confused, Angela pushes the door back open
Cat out
Angela catches her breath, moves inside
John sits slumped in the chair, drained
Steam rises off his skin
Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost all boiled out
She walks in, kneels down to him
John
What happened
() 57
: Sweat drips off as he looks up
He opens his palm -- reveals to Angela a simple
The name " " is typed on it
Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors Angela
She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight -- tries to hold herself together
The adrenaline and pain overwhelm
Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor
John watches, isn't sure how to help
He finally reaches out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder
The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and Angela falls right into his arms
John hasn't been this close to anyone in a long time
Angela finally composes herself
How
How did you do this
John tries not to stare into those eyes too long
Fails
- Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel
Lying in a cold, sterile room of death
Hell of a different type
Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room again, makes sure he's still alone
He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and lowers his hand inside
Places it first on her forehead
Nothing
Then on her chest
Nothing
Wrist is last
Hennessey shudders
This is it
He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void -- (
) When  was a kid,  saw things
-
- -- John comes out of a corner store with milk in a bag
He slows, eyes a  at a mailbox
(
) Things  wasn't supposed to
The man looks right at young John as he passes
His face is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are dug into the ground
() 58
: (
) Coffee
Young John looks up toward the voice -- -  () John looks up at the Waitress
Tea
She leaves
Angela sits across from him
They're at the table by the window
My parents sent me to a doctor, a shrink, a priest
was in four different institutions by the time was eighteen
Angela notes him rubbing his wrist
The last place they put me was run by a church
rushes past their table
him
-
- The Doctor rushes toward distant
(
) The revered Father made the brilliant deduction that  was possessed, said  needed to be exorcised
- The Doctor runs in
Sees the revered Father below, leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is held down by three interns and that Doctor
John angrily screams at them all
(
) It was like someone trying to pull teeth that weren't there
Young John clamps his eyes shut tight
59
-  () Present-day John does the same, remembering the pain
So  took things into my own hands and  found a way out
You attempted suicide
John sees she's looking at his wrist
The hint of a jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve
never attempt anything
John's reflection in the window becomes -- - kneeling with a pair off scissors
He's inside a
Teenage John looks up at a room filled with people from all walks of life
Teachers, doctors, lawyers, garbage men
All somewhat different than normal
They sit in school chairs and wait for John to do the deed
He puts the blade to his wrist -- one swipe and the world around him accelerates away in a   -- () But you're still here
Alive
Not my doing
His chest suddenly  forward -- and we're on

Archer
Heart monitor is
There's little hope

The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming
From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version
(
) Officially  was dead for seven minutes
But believe me, seven minutes in Hell is a lifetime
Ambulance heads toward that dying
on the monitor suddenly  with a pulse -- () Hennessey's hand jerks back from the plastic
His eyes fix on Isabel's wrist
That odd circular  is back
Hennessey's unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed
He rushes out, slams right into a   coming in
Hey, what're you doing in here
Guard looks back into the body room, sees a drawer partially open
He walks over, pulls it out further -- sees the plastic cut away
Jesus
The symbol has already faded from Isabel's wrist
(
) When  returned  didn't just see demons anymore,  could do the one thing they couldn't -- come and go as  please
- runs as fast as a very obese man can -- aiming for that on the corner
He grabs the receiver, punches numbers as fast as he can
--  -- -- Be there, John
please
Something shivers up Hennessey's leg and into his body
Eyes glaze over and Hennessey settles on a
() 61
: (
) Heaven and Hell are right here, behind every wall, every face -- the world behind the world
It's crossing over that's the real trick
That's why most demons can only whisper in our ears
But even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare
barges in, squeezes past the  '
' Sir, you need a reservation
But Hennessey is on a quest
For food
And it's everywhere
He starts grabbing meals right off of plates
Fish, pasta, prime rib
Shovels it all in
Patrons are yelling -- screaming
He's eating as if his life depended on it
And even though he's devouring anything in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes
In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly eating his meal
Balthazar
Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside gets thinner
He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it back so he bites into his arm
She screams as her husband pulls her away
Hennessey's strength is withering away
Desperate, he grabs a , digs it into his own hand
Hispanic  rushes into the room, grabs onto Hennessey
(
) But the worst demons are the ones that are allowed to be here -- the ones that are half-human so they blend in
Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and starts toward the back
() 62
: (
) just like those with the angel's touch living alongside of us
The half-breeds
That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor
For a moment we see him framed against the front doorway
And in that instant we get a brief glimpse of -- An incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light
looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes
Bitter enemies
Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers
He leaves out the back exit
(
) They call it 'the Balance
' call it hypocritical bullshit
So when one of them gets a little cocky, peddles their influence or hijacks a soul --  deport their scaly ass right back to Hell
(takes a sip of tea) don't get them all but maybe enough to insure my retirement
Sounds like you're trying to buy your way into Heaven
Well, what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you
Not a serene image at all
Angela studies him
Why you
mean many go to Hell, why were you able to escape
() 63
: (sips tea) don't know
God has a plan for all of us
Not for me
John's bitterness is obvious
Angela just stares at him -- finally -- Isabel saw things too
John looks up
Moment is lost when her
The cop in her reacts, flips it open
Detective Dodson here
- The morgue is seen across the street
The Guard that chased Hennessey is just outside
(
) Security Guard spotted him near the body, chased him out
We   Angela standing with Weiss
Around them is a complete shambles of fine dining -- He comes over here, makes a run at the entire menu and pow -- deflates like a fricken Macy's day balloon
--     John's shattered face
He stares down at Hennessey
Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an assemblage of bones
Only that ragged black tie he wore is familiar now
John leans down to the remains of his friend
cop starts to intervene but Angela blocks him
Let him be
John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he himself removed from his friend
That's even more crushing
() 64
: Shit
(sympathetic) Why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch
John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of Hennessey's hands
He opens the fingers, studies the fork wound
The blood is already drying over it
John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and grabs a melting ice cube
He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried blood
It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random stabbings
This is a shape
John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses
Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin
It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist
John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important
(to Hennessey) Rest in peace, Father
20  - With a loud crowd and 20 huge the noise back here is
But this is Beeman's home
See the desk, the
The fold-away bed
Beeman is on the phone
There's a conversation but it's way too noisy to hear
All we see are the emotions on Beeman's face
No doubt news of Hennessey's death is one of the biggies
Beeman quickly reaches for a marker, puts it to paper and starts drawing -- listening and drawing -- He's finished, hangs up
Stares at the Symbol
That cabinet with the ancient books now gets his attention
(
) need to see where Isabel died
- Graffiti-adorned walls give way to a tall iron fence, heavily-shadowed grounds and finally the six-story hospital complex of
() 65
: rim-lit figure stands on the roof
But this one isn't wearing a hospital gown, he's wearing a trench coat
(
) Seances, crystals -- channeling
Our father thought she was just trying to get attention
She certainly did that
Angela stands behind John
large water tank is anchored to the roof next to her
Note the  logo
She'd tell everyone about things she said she saw
Crazy things
Things that hadn't happened yet
She'd scare my mother to death, talking on and on about Revelations and the end of the world
Then one day she just stopped
never said another word
So you put her in here
Angela doesn't need to be reminded
It hurts even more now
Show me her room
John and Angela head toward Isabel's room appears from around the corner walking with a boy
It's Barry, the boy in the courtyard
He locks on Angela and when she makes eye contact he breaks away from the Nurse, runs toward her with arms outstretched
Barry
He runs right into Angela's arms, hugs her tight
Angela is totally baffled
John is thoroughly intrigued
Oh God
() 66
: She rushes in, gently tugs the boy away
No, Barry, that's not Isabel
Barry stares at Angela
He reaches out, touches her face, confused
Nurse pulls him back even further
'm sorry
They were friends
He kind of had a crush on your sister
Angela nods, understanding
The Nurse leads Barry away
He doesn't take his eyes off Angela the entire time
Neither does John
You were twins
Angela nods, steps inside
John pauses, thinking
' John steps inside, gives the sterile room a thorough scan
So how long
Two months
(beat) This time
He pulls out a drawer, looks at the bottom
already did all that
John runs his hands under the steel bed frame
Now you're insulting me
You don't walk off a building without leaving something behind
You saw everything she left behind
In that box
() 67
: Maybe she left something else
Something more personal
Just for you
Angela doesn't like that look he's giving her
You were her twin, Angela
Twins tend to think alike
'm not like my sister
But you were at once time
When you were kids
When you'd spend every waking hour with each other
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it
You'd get hurt, she'd cry
That was a long time ago
That kind of bond doesn't just disappear
There's nothing here
Angela seems unbalanced
John gets more aggressive
She planned her death in this room, she thought it up right where you're standing -- Angela backs away
John advances
She knew you'd come -- She counted on you to see what she saw, to feel what she felt -- to do what she did
What did she do, Angela
How should  know
What did she do, Angela
() 68
: don't know
What would you do
Angela backs into a wall
Nowhere else to go now
What would you leave her
What would it be
Where would it be
Where would it be
Angela lashes out, shoves John hard, pushing him out of her way
She turns to the window, almost hyperventilating
John stays back, watches
Angela opens her eyes
The tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees -- The tree
- lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard
John and Angela approach it
Examine it
Nothing
John drops lower on the tree, to a child's height
Finally sees something near the ground, gestures to Angela
She kneels down next to him, sees what he sees
That same
The one Hennessey carved into his hand
But this time there's more
(trying to rationalize) There must have been a tree in our backyard
when we were kids
John may not be buying it but he's not saying anything
His fingers trace these words carved below the symbol -- ' 14:01
' Cor
Corinthians
() 69
: (shaking her head) There is no 14h act in Corinthians
John's face goes pale -- need a church
- Several families sit in solemn prayer
The pastor comforts a man and wife
John and Angela slip through, head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall
They whisper
Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of Ethenius
It's like a dark mirror of the Bible
It paints a different view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned
There's a difference
Depends on which side of the fence you're standing
John stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl of holy water near the altar
So why haven't  seen this book before
Because it doesn't exist here on this side
John closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to -- (
) What do you mean -- Flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching Angela mid-question and the room in that dim half-light
John turns and is inside -- 70
- The epitome of blasphemy --  church in Hell
Only they don't worship God in here
And that's not Christ on the cross
And those stained glass windows are now slate black
John is now facing books with completely different markings
He searches as a  rises in pitch and an begins to flow down the walls, getting closer to John with each heartbeat
He finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes -- -- not here on this side
John turns, covered in sweat
He's holding a book she's never seen, is already flipping through it
Where did that come from
(stopping to read) 13:29
13:30 -- Here
Corinthians 14:01
(skimming to this) 'The sins of the father would only be exceeded by the ego of the son
' Whose son
John stands, his brain going into overdrive
Symbol isn't a demon's
that's why  couldn't place it
not a normal possession
John, what are you talking about
But he can't cross over -- impossible for the son to cross over
Whose son
God's
() 71
: No
The other one
(off her look) Lucifer had a son too
20  - Beeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp
The narrow alley of machines stretches out behind him
He stares into the scrolls -- an ancient book with a single page folded a thousand times
Turns another page
Amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's closed
Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness, the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of beasts
(
) Oh my
Beeman has stopped turning pages
That's because he's now staring at an etching of the same symbol
Below are ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body
But it's what's above the beast that is most troubling
figure on a cross -- his arms outstretched -- seemingly welcoming the beast into this world
This is not good
hits a lane
Beeman spins to the sound
round and round, closer and closer until it dead against the back wall of one of the lanes
Beeman gets up, starts down the corridor of dormant pin machines
He stops at lane 13, leans way way down, past the machinery and peeks out the pin hole
John
72
- Angela's  races quickly through traffic while John gets her up to speed
(
) The myth says Mammon was conceived before his father's fall from grace but was born after
But unlike his old man, he's never been in the presence of the Creator so he has no fear of him, no respect either
That goes double for us -- God's most prized creations
Mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over
But demons can't come and go, that's what you said
Unless they found a bridge
(off her look) Some psychic with the chops to reach all the way to Hell and the grit to withstand whatever shit she'd pull out
Isabel
But even a bridge wouldn't help Mammon
Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get
Divine assistance
The help of God
Angela sits back, letting that sink in
So it's impossible
Impossible
Sure it's impossible
That's what makes it so dangerous
These things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes
If the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side
() 73
: John sits back, gut churning
Angela's in detective mode
She knew
That's why she killed herself
But it doesn't make sense
Makes sense to me
John, she sacrificed herself to beat him
John nods
Your point
Why is she in Hell
One of those rare moments where John has no answer
20 Something small and  is rolling down the alley
It lands in the trough, spins round and round -- Beeman leans out to try and see what it is
The silver object keeps spinning
He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face
Then another
Book on his desk ignites in flame
20  - pulls into the empty parking lot
John is out before Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door
few flies escape to freedom as he opens the door
John rushes in
20 Only a   pervades the dead stillness of the alley
Beeman
John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area
It's locked from the other side
() 74
: (pounds on door) Hey, Beeman
Beeman
The   fluctuates -- sounds like a
Maybe he's not here
He's always here
Several more flies flit by him
This time John notices, turns and spots the source of the  -- a cloud of near the center aisles
Angela follows his gaze, spots them as well
What
John heads across the lanes
Swarm gets thicker and thicker
Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth
They approach the pin area of the center lane
The source of the swarm is slowly revealed
In the catch trough is a solid mound of flies
John leans closer, spots a  protruding from the mound
Oh Jesus, no -- He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman
Ravaged
Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears -- (stepping back) Oh God -- John goes ballistic, screams to the walls -- Who are you
Answer me
Goddamit -- reveal yourself summon you
He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct on his forearms
Slams them together with all his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating -- Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode -- () 75
: Angela steps back in awe as the air around his outstretched arms begins to  -- to tear a faint hole from the bowling alley right into another world right here -- darker -- Hellish -- Into the light  command thee
Into the light  -- John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela just how ill he really is
She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor
this is my fault
sent them in
sent them right to their deaths
a damn one-man plague
John, you need a doctor
've seen a goddamn doctor
Angela glares at him -- understands now
He's dying
John stands, almost stumbles
Angela tries to help
Get away from me
John
Stay the hell away -- (tortured look to her) Please -- He uses the handrail to walk away
Angela stands there, confused by her own emotions
She turns back to the carnage, hears the distant
/
'  - John sits in his opened window, simmering
He holds a lit cigarette but doesn't dare put it to his lips
Outside the city goes about its unending churn
() 76
: Down on the street are several police vehicles and they drive away
Swirl of blue and red lights flash across John's moist eyes
(
) There were no trees in our back yard
John finds Angela across the room in his doorway
But you knew that already, didn't you
John meets her eyes
Sees the questions piling up
(walking towards him) You see something in me
Something Isabel had
Go home, Angela
need to understand -- John just shakes his head
Why not
Because you open up to that world, you're inviting whatever's out there back in
That's what happened to Isabel
'm not Isabel
No, she embraced her gift while you denied yours and that denial is exactly why you're still alive
Stick with me, that'll change
John gets off the window, starts walking away
And  don't need another ghost following me around
() 77
: Dammit, John -- they killed my sister
That stops him cold
can't let them get away with that
Even if it means going down the same path she did
Now if you won't help me get there, 'll find my own way
But  won't run
Never
The two stand there -- locked in this moment
Please
John can't believe this day -- looks her dead in the eye
You do this, there's no turning back
You see them -- they see you
Understand
Angela never blinks as she nods in agreement

) Do  take off my clothes or leave them on

) 'm thinking

) On is fine
John fills a 70-year-old porcelain
Angela stands in the center
() 78
: Why water
It's the universal conduit
Lubricates the transition from one plane to another
Now ask me if there's water in Hell
John turns off the faucet
Sit
Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself
When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck
Normally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course
(teeth chattering) What will  see
His eyes say it all
Enough
Lie down
(gesturing the depth) Lie down
You have to be fully submerged
For how long
As long as it takes
Here -- John cups the back of her neck, holds her face just above the water as she lowers down
Her breathing is picking up
John leans over the tub, looks straight down at her
Last chance
(off her look) Take a deep one
() 79
: Angela takes a deep breath, holds it
John pulls his hand away and she settles to the bottom, her eyes riveted on his the entire time
' silent John ripples above
His hand grips her arm, skin to skin
Angela lies there and panic sets in
She starts to surface but John pushes her head back to the bottom, holds it firm
Her eyes dart about
Air is running out
She can't hold her breath much longer
It's not working -- But the room's lighting begins to pulsate -- as if the current were ramping down
It slows to that dim half- light as -- '  --
single blink
is lying in now  , screaming for all of her life
Water muffles the sound but not the fury
Huge   hard -- snapping out of the hold down bolts
John is stunned -- how powerful is this woman
Another  and the inch-thick
Water starts streaming onto the tile
John lunges, grabs Angela and  her up from the water -- her muffled   the air as her mouth breaks the surface
She  hard against his chest -- arms wrapping tight -- fingers digging into his back -- leaving marks that might just scar
and the damn breaks
John and Angela go down -- hit the tile as one -- water washing over them both
lies there on top of John
Trembling
She looks up him, eyes filled with revelation
All those people
so sad
John nods, helping her understand
() 80
: 've always known
where the bad guys are
where to aim, when to duck
it's not luck
've always known
Tears stream down her cheeks
John reaches out to touch her when her eyes   in pain -- Angela
Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out
John pries himself from the tile, goes after her
Angela runs behind the vertebrae of machines, dripping water the entire way
John tries to keep up
It was rolling toward him -- not a ball -- something smaller
Shiny
She stops, kneels to the floor
John walks up to join her
Something glints in the catch trough
She reaches down, plucks it up and brings an odd    -- John's face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar coin
Balthazar
'  - Beeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are dumped onto a table
Powder, bugs and bullets go everywhere
John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets
Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also
are removed from a display cabinet
There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the petrified husk from the River of Life -- the hollow shaft of an iron cross -- all striking pieces individually but when twisted and locked together form a very imposing -- () 81
: --
He swings the cross down, pours a pound of blasting powder into the husk -- chambers a special bullet into one of the ten barrels, snaps it shut -- turns and
leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his endless apartment, blasts the center out of -- carton of Lucky Strikes
the Surgeon General's warning -- burning away

) Can you kill him
What about the Balance
'  - John is stuffing the bowling bag while Angela watches, now dressed in dry clothes
That shirt is John's
That half-breed tipped my scales when he started killing my friends
'm just adding a little counterweight
John lifts that holy shotgun --   -- What about me
can't stay here forever
John turns to her -- locks on those eyes
He reaches into his coat pocket as he walks up to her
She shudders as his arms wrap around her face and for a beat they're cheek to cheek
When he pulls back she sees he has clipped Hennessey's  around her neck
Think of it as a bulletproof vest
So 'm going

Across the room a stainless steal   open
John looks the other way as a Security Guard exits
Thick glides closed, seals with another
No way in
John notices the janitor down one hallway
It's Nico from Midnite's
He and John lock stares
Nico opens a "Security Only" door, steps inside -- leaves the door open
Monitors are powering up around the room

Balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug and successful businessman he is
He stops at a on one wall
Adjusts his collar, his hair
His "look
" What are we pushing today, sir
Phillip Morris
As Balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts slightly
The demon in him
He touches his face, does a vowel stretch
His face distorts even further
That's got him moving closer to the mirror
Balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears in motion, rippling as if liquefied
And just when he sees the surface of the mirror  and starts to move -- -- One way   outward on the front edge of a -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and flame
John stands on the other side in an   -- that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his holy shotgun
How's he doing it
John steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising from the floor

Cop instinct takes over and she gets out of the car
Checks the amulet
Intact
John turns his attention back to Balthazar, doesn't hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame
Suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else underneath
The true form
How's he doing it, you half-breed shit
John swings the flame aside so he can  Balthazar against the wall
But now his
Shit
Charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and grabs John by the throat
Balthazar rises from the ashes
He may be burned, but he's one tough son of a bitch
Balthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck
John can't break his hold
He's choking, frantically rummages through his coat    pockets
Comes out with those sacred on    his right hand
Balthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him across the face
The enhanced punch sends a dizzying ripple throughout Balthazar's body
But he doesn't let go
John is choking, starts whaling on him
Again and again -- each punch weakening this demon more
John finally gets him against the wall
Right arm's tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand, and with extreme pleasure -- continues punching away
Drives Balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of death

Watches in delight as Balthazar strains to take his final breaths

Not really, no
You can't cheat it this time
you're going back to Hell

But you're not
John removes that small   from his coat
Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses -- Bible
What are you doing
'm reading you your last rites
Balthazar reacts
This isn't good
Your remedial incantations have no relevance to my kind
Aren't you half human
Balthazar doesn't have to answer
You see, that makes you eligible to be forgiven
You do know what it is to truly be forgiven
To be welcomed into the kingdom of God
Balthazar's worst nightmare
demon in heaven -- love to be a fly on that wall
You're not a priest, you have no power

: --  escaped hell, who else do you know that has the power to do that
Balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs
Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over and you can go back to your shithole
Balthazar isn't convinced
John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read -- 'May the merciful God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins
' He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead
Balthazar glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding authority
'Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven

How's he doing it

He was finished off by a soldier's spear

blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible speed -- denting in roofs,  a  -- causing general chaos
Cars brake --  into each other
And still this thing keeps coming
Hang on -- slides into an alley, races toward the other end
() 90
: Angela looks back, sees their pursuer enter the alley
It makes huge strides along the walls, defying all manner of physics
Impossible
The beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the building
lost it
, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good foot
huge clawed  punches into the sheet metal, starts shredding it right over Angela
Talon thrusts in
Angela dodges it -- her amulet swinging wildly
John  the  and the beast flips off the roof and onto the hood -- right
muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably Balthazar's
He lashes against the windshield with an extra appendage
Thank God for safety glass
He jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood into the car
John throws the car into a spin, slamming the Barracuda into several parked cars
Balthazar is uprooted, is thrown from the car
Angela looks back, sees Balthazar rolling into traffic
He's down -- He's not down
Gimme your phone
Angela pulls out her cellular
sit in the back of Chaz's taxi, staring out at the seedy side of town as if it were "Wild Kingdom
" () 91
: They mark their territory with graffiti instead of urine but they're still very much animals
British woman takes documentary photos
Chaz's   over the  of a dispatch
This is a private line -- John
Chaz -- where are you
Ah
3rd and Figueroa
You still got that Sedrallus
(glancing to couple) Yeah, but 'm kind of busy right now, John
Dammit, Chaz, 'm trying to save my ass here
(under his breath) What else is new
Remember the Chalic of Enook incident
(remembering) Oh no, no, no, not that,  just paid off this car
West side of the 3rd Street Bridge, say
He checks the speedometer -- 90 mph
2 minutes
() 92
: 'm five blocks away
(as John  off) John
John
Ah
shit
Chaz downshifts, stops in cloud of dust -- Sorry, tour's over
The British start to argue
- John heads toward the skyline now -- at 90 mph -- to the 3rd Street Bridge on the horizon
Angela scans behind them, can't believe her eyes
He's back
Here comes Balthazar through traffic on all fours -- John, he's back and he's gaining
Of course he's gaining
John  the  to the floor
3RD Chaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge
He     across the roadway -- opens the glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a glass vial out of it
Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid
Chaz jumps out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears the sound of a
Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge's arched roadway
And what the hell is that running behind it
Shit -- shit -- shit -- () 93
: Chaz twists off the gas cap, drops the vial into the tank
He pulls out his , rips the cover off, exposing the electronics
He wedges the beeper into the tank inlet, then starts sprinting off the bridge while -- John gives Angela the number
9
5
4
Taxi in view
Angela punches in the number -- 9-5-4
They  past the taxi -- 6
6
6 Here comes Balthazar up the bridge
Like a supercharged cheetah, running full stride
And not even winded
6
6
6 Balthazar is almost to the taxi -- John waits -- then -- 6
Angela punches the last digit as -- -- Balthazar  to jump the taxi -- -- spark --   -- right under Balthazar in a tremendous
Initial impact only kicks him higher
It's when the Sedrallus in the tank truly ignites that the real begin
() 94
: Balthazar is caught in a haze of brilliant red particles that tear his body apart in midair
His final  is chilling
/ John smacks the wheel, victoriously -- looks over to Angela who sighs with relief
His expression changes as he centers on the empty necklace dangling around her neck
Where's the amulet
-- something reaches through the roof hole and right out of the car
John  the  home -- car spins and John is already jumping out before it comes to a stop
He runs to the rail
(running up) What the hell was that
Both leap onto the concrete rail, lean over and spot a just as it disappears below the bridge
Chaz is speechless as he turns to John
This is too much
John gives him the out he's been waiting for -- We're even
Chaz nods and John leaves him at the rail
He jumps back in the  and
Chaz watches him race away, looks back at his burning taxi
Even
- Prisoner walks out of the terminal, here at last
He stares at all the vehicles at his disposal
family crowds around the back of a minivan
Wife hugs the dad
95
Watches him from behind
Prisoner turns, looks back, suspiciously
Nothing
walks out to the street, slides into the minivan, tears away
Kids' toys tumble across the seats
-  - John bursts through a door -- Midnite right on his heels
Mammon has been trying to climb out of his father's shadow for eons
And this time he might just make it
(unconvinced) Because he's got the Spear
And the bridge
You're giving this girl way too much credit
You don't know her
And you do
That would be a first
John swings open a    -- looks in at large-scale relics -- statues, props, etc
Where's the chair
The chair
The delicate little number from Sing Sing
() 96
: Midnite just stares at him
It's a fine line that separates a hero from a fool
'll take my chances
And taint my establishment with your blood
don't think so
Midnite -- You know what that device can do to the ill-equipped -- Midnite -- -- and even in your most glorious days your brain was never your most powerful attribute -- Where the hell is the chair, you dumb shit
Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's seven feet
John knows he went too far
That was the cancer talking, you know that, right
(holds up his finger) Once
John nods
Fluorescents flicker,  boxes of toilet tissue, cooking supplies, etc
And sitting in one corner by the huge power transformer is -- () 97
: -- the chair
Heavy wooden monstrosity with straps and cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last time
Yeah, it's an electric chair right out of Sing Sing
What's in your bathroom, a Renoir
have insurance issues
John clears off the seat, starts to sit
Midnite blocks him
You haven't surfed in decades
Like riding a bike
He tries again
Midnite blocks him again
You'll be lucky to reach an elemental plane
Then just increase the juice
John tries again
Again Midnite stops him
In your condition your body won't take much
just need enough rope to find her
And if you do -- what then
One goddamn problem at a time -- John shoves past him, plops his ass in the huge chair
His feet dangle off the ground
Midnite stands by, won't help
So John starts strapping himself in the chair
His chest, his ankles
One wrist
He obviously can't strap the other
He looks to the big man
You want me to sign a waiver
() 98
: Midnite sighs -- finally straps the other wrist in -- pulls it
Ouch
Hang on, Angela
- moving in a surreal fashion across an evening sky
Below her the City of Angels sweep past
Her eyes drift open and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality -- The city is
It's a repeat of Isabel's prophetic vision before she jumped
(
) Listen to my voice inside
' - Midnite kneels in front of John who is now handcuffed to the chair, cables draped from every limb
'll try and guide you out
Try
Mammon was forced out of that girl when she jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in, he would have fallen back to Hell
No, he's still here
'm sure of it
Then watch yourself
He could be in anyone out there
John nods
Midnite lifts a palm of   in front of his face
Roach wings
What happened to using lilac pedals --
() 99
: Midnite cranks the  on the panel as he  and John reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind
His head slams back against the slats
His skin ripples from the force
his face as the sound of  courses through John
Peter do caelis, Deus, misere nobis
Fili Redemptor mundi, Deus, Miserere nobis
turns into a streak behind John's face -- stretching to infinity
(
) Find the possessor and the Spear will be revealed
find them
find them and follow
The flash whips back  us and John is suddenly somewhere else
He looks
that  , we watch the Prisoner hold the Spear for the first time
Like before, he turns and looks behind him where -- John now stands
Watching
John centers on the Spear in the Prisoner's hand
- That same   of the Prisoner in line
He turns as he did before and it's -- -- John behind him
Watching
Prisoner turns away
-
- is  the Prisoner at the exit doors
He looks back, suspiciously, and there's - John
Watching
Prisoner turns, heads to the minivan
-
-   - of a minivan still smoking from a recent impact against a large iron
Prisoner is running from it, glances back -- () 100
: John is there
Watches as the Prisoner enters the abandoned wing of -- Ravenscar
John reacts
How did he miss this
- Fifty beds with fifty patients
Asleep
The Prisoner kneels next to one of the beds
John walks over, touches him and he rocks to the floor
Dead
Body reveals the Spear on the blanket of the bed
John reaches out to touch it when the boy  suddenly from under the blanket and grabs him by the throat
the boy's
John struggles to pull him off but the boy's grip is locked tight
John grabs at his hands -- chokes out the name -- John's hands suddenly become ' as his ally pulls him back into -- ' - John's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of Midnite's grip
John gasps as he comes back -- nods to Midnite and finally -- Ravenscar
The abandoned wing
He's in the boy
-  - glides across the landscape, sweeps across manicured grounds and rises to reveal Ravenscar Hospital
'  - Midnite piles  , ,  onto a table
You know these won't kill them
John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan
() 101
: You probably won't even get close enough to use them
In the pan is that   he brought from India
It's now
Midnite has trouble watching it dissolve
And it's not just the boy
John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small casting blocks
You better worry about whoever's helping him
John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings into a pot of water --
As much as  admire your blind faith even in the most dire situations -- expecting to just waltz into a facility that is about to become the floodgate of Hell is reaching a bit, even for you
John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just knows what he's thinking
Midnite sighs, heavily
Well  suppose two fools can die just as easily as one
John almost smiles
Hey, you think 'm trusting you to save the world
John taps the casting and out falls a -
But we're going to need more than a few magic bullets to get inside
John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around the room
Just like John's
Hmmmm
() 102
: That ritual you do with the water, can you do more than one bottle at a time
Midnite raises an eyebrow
- The motorized   is jammed -- opening and closing on a crashed
The van the Prisoner carjacked
The abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit night
Vague figures move about near the emergency entrance
John's   up with its headlights off
John stares out, points up to the   -- on the roof
(sighs) Figures
- Therapy machines look like medieval torture devices in the dimly-lit room
stands waist deep in a large hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor
His skin is pale, sickly looking
Obviously containing Mammon takes its toll
Especially on a child
His hands are below his waist and now we see they're lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water
Her face floats just above the surface as he buckles restraining straps around her wrists
- Front glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly strut inside
Stop
the
of an unseen crowd
This   is crammed with people
Lawyers
Brokers
Soccer moms
Truck drivers
Etc
Most are crowded in front of a set of double doors
Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys
John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot cop
() 103
: Okay -- let's cut the scratch and call it a night
Meeting's over
That's got their attention
As entertainment
few chuckle
John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from the crowd
Still that bundle of sexual energy
Ellie
Oh, John, you know how much  love it on this side
This was just an opportunity to make it permanent
You think his son will be any different
He'll just turn this place into his own Hell and then where will you to party, Heaven
No need to get nasty
Never bothered you before
am so going to miss our little trysts
Ellie steps closer
The crowd starts to close in with her
'm sure you will
John pulls out his lighter, holds it up -- flicks it on
Now turn around and take your friends with you
Can he look more ridiculous
will deport you
All of you
You know  can
John steps back up onto a chair, thrusts the lighter higher -- () 104
: Oh, John, this is embarrassing
Where is your pride
-- right under a
Go to Hell
Ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger
Ellie and a room of half-humans -- all looking up as water sprays from every nozzle
John and Midnite tense because the first drops have no effect
beat -- a in the waterlines and suddenly --  fill the room as half human skin begins to
Holy water
Emergency lighting has snapped on -- throwing the room into a strobing nightmare of action
Flashes of human skin melting, revealing snippets of the true demons underneath
It's total pandemonium as their rage is directed toward the only real humans in the room
John and Midnite fling their coats open -- draw their and starts  away at the attacking horde
Sacred bullets cause major damage -- wounds that ripple out through demon bodies
John and Midnite slam back to back -- spinning under the protective shield of a showering sprinkler head -- shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture into the
One reloads while the other
It's a hellish form of a turkey shoot
Nothing sacred, nothing spared
John goes for the double doors
Midnite covers him -- blows away another two disintegrating demons
Two come up behind and he spins, takes them down
gets to the doors, starts to open them when Ellie jumps onto his back -- nails digging in
'm not going back there
() 105
: We are what we are, Ellie -- John  over his back, loosens her grip
He grabs hold, shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead sprinkler head
Legs flail about
Midnite comes out of the rain -- grabs John
Let's go
John drops Ellie to the floor
No more pretty face -- no face at all -- yet the screams still come
John and Midnite get to the doors -- shove through
Angela's body and face are completely submerged now
She comes to, sees Barry above her -- tries to rise but the boy pushes her head to the bottom, holds it there
Last bubbles are floating up from her mouth
Barry places his other hand on her arm, closes his eyes
Holy rain has stopped in here
fine mist floats in the air
John and Midnite make their way through
Only their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence
Another set of doors is ahead
Before they reach it a faint shadow crosses in the mist
Both pause, expecting something to reveal itself
But it doesn't
Faint waves undulate Barry's skin -- ripple from his chest, down his arms and into a submerged Angela
Every muscle in her body tenses in stark relief
' Barry's image ripples above her in silence
Room lighting starts to pulse -- slower and slower and when it's caught in that dim half-light -- Angela  and this time we    -- 106
Angela is lying in a bone-dry tank, lifts her head up to see a room not much different than the one she just left
Except for the
That low     -- those   scratching at the walls
And now those  splotches begin consuming the color and light from the walls
Moving in on Angela
Closer and closer -- whatever's coming is just about on her
(
) Angela
Angela  and for a split second comes face to face with the hideous form of
She
- John and Midnite burst into the room, spot Barry standing in the tank
His hands in the water
On Angela
(rushing toward him) Barry
Barry looks up, sees the two men rushing toward him
Guns aimed
Let her up
Let her up
beat as John meets Barry's eyes -- realizes he's staring at a frightened child
Barry backs away as -- -- Angela sits up behind John
Water rippling off, straps dangling free
John turns -- locks on her
Shit -- John thinks fast -- scans the area and sees every mirror in the room has been shattered
So much for the quick fix
He jumps into the water with her, grabs her face and pushes her against the tank walls
This is an exorcism on the fly
Amar natash bow basar
Rescind from the flesh  command thee -- () 107
: Angela's eyes snap open -- dark and dilated
John sees it -- clasps a hand over her mouth -- cutting off her air supply
Back to Hell, asshole -- Her body undulates as Mammon's shape tries to come through
Pulsating through her arms, her chest -- her face
Angela  into his palm
John recoils
She shoves him off and John hits the tile hard
Angela jumps from the tank, pushes past in a blur
John spins to see Midnite standing right there -- Angela now firmly in his size-twelve grasp
(to John) Finish it
: John coughs, struggles to stand
He tries to cover but it's obvious his end is nearing
Midnite positions Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides -- crucifixion-style
She tries but can't break free
John puts a hand to her forehead -- Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes
/ Rescind from the flesh  command thee -- Amar natash bow basar
Angela's body stops fighting
The darkness in her eyes and fingernails begins to fade
It's working
Midnite is suddenly  backwards with an agonizing Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness
John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is lifted right off the floor by an  , slammed into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible force against the floor
Midnite glares at John, tries to speak
But the words die on his lips
() 108
: Enraged, John scans the empty room, sees a large on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object
He holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves and slams those tattoos together -- Into the light  command thee
Into the light  command thee
It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes that familiar shape of
(
) Your ego is astounding
John strains to see the shadow become the real thing -- the majestic wings of an angel
Gabriel
John is too weak to even be surprised anymore
Figures
Gabriel touches down in front of him
Spear in his hand
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth
You presume to judge me, John
Betrayal, murder, genocide
Call me provincial
am seeking to inspire humankind to be all that was intended
By unleashing Hell on Earth
Good thinking
Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John
() 109
: You've had it too easy for too long
So what's a few thousand years of pain, right
You never deserved to be blessed
You've all been born with a silver spoon in your mouth, never really appreciating the gift you were given so freely -- unconditional love from your creator
And that just bugs the shit out of you
It's not your fault
Like the animals you are, you never learn unless sufficiently prodded
Pleasure has no lasting effect
But subject you to pain, unpleasantness -- suffering -- and you will take notice, you will fight to overcome, to earn your redemption
That is when you're at your best
Angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again
You're trying to teach us a lesson
No, 'm giving you the chance to rise above the suffering and truly earn the love of God
(a beat) The road to salvation begins tonight
Right now
John just stares at this rogue angel, centers on the Spear in his hand
He makes a break for it
Gabriel's wings beat once
The   John through the double doors, back into the -- 110
-- where he smashes against a mesh-screened window, drops to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses
Gabriel turns back to Angela
He approaches her -- his rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her -- pulling her in
Those eyes of his could melt Dracula
- can't even stand, let alone save the girl
Or humanity
It would be so easy to give up
To roll over and die
But instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long time
(whispering) know 'm not one of your favorites
'm not even allowed in your house these days
but could use a little attention
John waits for nothing
His body crumples, his cheek landing flat against the tile
Glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him
As he stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea
- ' begin to quiver
The color drains
Blackness is waiting
- slides his back up the wall as he reels in that shard of mirror
- ' posture begins to change
Mammon's form ripples through her -- starts to push out through her skin
Gabriel stands behind her, his wings cocooned around her waist
(whispering to her) Cross the bridge to your destiny
111
- pulls up his sleeve, exposes his old scar
He pauses a beat, closes his eyes
his face as he makes one swift  movement
But he's in a rush here -- makes that same motion across his other wrist as well
With both wrists purging his life away, John settles back into the corner and waits for the inevitable
Hurry
- reveals the Spear
- is dying
Eyes are starting to close as
- Raises the Spear over Angela's chest
the  of a million  inside of her ready to break free -- He holds the Spear high above her chest -- readies for the final thrust as -- Bulbs flicker as current ramps down and All we're left with is a distant  , like the reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago
John lies in that dim half-light
Motionless
Something starts to swirl near him and just like that, John is no longer alone
Shadow falls over his pathetic form
(
) The time has come at last to collect your soul
() 112
: John pries his eyes open
Hello, John
You're early
You're the one show  wouldn't miss
So 've heard
Satan sees John's slit wrists
didn't think you'd make the same mistake twice
John looks up at him
You didn't, did you
so how's your son
And why would that matter to you
he's topside
know
With Gabriel
Your point
He's helping your son create his own Hell on Earth
Well, boys will be boys
He has the Spear of Destiny
() 113
: Satan didn't know that
Now he's concerned
He studies this dying man
This is another one of your cons
Go look for yourself
Satan is still suspicious
You've waited twenty years for me, what's another twenty seconds
Satan contemplates his remark
Metallic reverberation is overtaken as  and  ramp back to real time -- - is about to be thrust into Angela's chest
(
) Gabriel
Gabriel looks up -- spots him in the room
Gabriel reacts -- pulls the spear toward her with all his might -- but Satan is faster -- Angela vanishes and Gabriel has now pierced dead air
Satan holds Angela tight -- covering her mouth like John did
She struggles and the demon inside appears -- reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on the floor
Hideous
The real
Say goodbye to the sun -- both of you
Mammon  and Gabriel's beautiful wings ignite in -- No
- is rocked by a major jolt that shakes the entire building to its foundation
moment later -- () 114
: Satan is back
John looks up, gives him that look -- you owe me
Satan hates admitting it but knows it's true
So
what do you want
An extension
John shakes his head, can barely utter a sound
Isabel
What about her
let her
go home
You would give up your life so she could go to Heaven
John manages a nod
Fine
(closes, opens eyes) It's done
gasps -- her first real breath's a strain
Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her eyes -- Stretches out  us
And here come those two swings, penduluming up in
Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again
But this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing
Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for what seems so close
so close
Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky
(
) Time to go
115
John relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable
Satan takes his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass
Try as he might, he can't budge John an inch
And now John's other hand leaves his side, and as if weightless, begins to rise toward something above
No sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the embrace of God
Satan sees this and recoils in absolute  -- The sacrifice
No John's rising hand drifts back down in front of Satan, the middle finger fully extended
Final straw
Satan goes rabid -- turns to   for a split second
His hands remain on fire
You will live, John Constantine, you will live so you'll have the chance to prove that your soul truly belongs in Hell
You will live
Satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into John's body -- John screams in agony
Satan tears through his tissue -- collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of diseased tissue with one vengeful pull
John's final blood-curdling   over -- / -- through every room
Every corridor
Rippling out across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills beyond
On his hands and knees, John takes that first breath
New lungs fill for the first time
No cough
Not even a wheeze
Face has renewed color
Wrists have sealed tight
() 116
: John is healed
He stands, steps back inside the -- John stops over the body of one seven-foot African warrior
He stands immobilized, wrecked with emotion draws his attention to the one thing that could cause him even greater rage -- -- is hunched over near a wall
Jagged cartilage stumps protrude from his back
pattern of sinew and bone is burned into the floor behind him
It's all that remains of his once majestic wings
John approaches, spots blood dripping from the former angel
He realizes what this means
Gets a kick out of it
Human
Gabriel looks up as John retrieves a gun from the wet floor
You don't deserve to be human
Then pass judgment on me now
John raises the gun -- puts it to Gabriel's forehead
Do it
Seek revenge
End my life
John's finger nudges the trigger
Kill me
Pull the trigger
Be the hand of God
John pauses, realizes what's happening here
and 'll be condemned again
Do it
() 117
: It takes everything John has not to pull that trigger
He lowers the gun, shaking his head
You're even worthless as bait
John starts to turn away -- Deny your true nature today, but what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow after that
It is only a matter of time before you end up right back where you belong
It is who you are, Constantine
Damned
John's fist starts behind his back, gains momentum the entire arc until it ends abruptly against Gabriel's face
The ex-angel is propelled all the way to the wall -- against the concrete
Body crumples on impact, slides down to the muck
You know this hurt like absolute hell
That's called pain
Get used to it
John turns toward the double doors -- stops cold
Huddled in the doorway, covered in grime is Angela and Barry
The experience has obviously left them both drained
John walks across the room, kneels down to them
Thank you, John
He nods, beat
Wipes a trace of blood off her brow, puts a hand on Barry's shoulder
a beat  this gritty family tableau
'  - ' the inoperative device strangely-shaped objects of platinum and gold, with names and symbols that make a bit more sense now
- Huge sun beats down on a lone  walking across a stretch of the most barren landscape on Earth
He stops, kneels to the heavily-cracked soil
Starts digging
118
'  - comes in, affixes an unseen object to a protruding rod
Its weight causes it to drop    but a moment later it rises back   and finds a balance
pulls back the protective hood from his face
Healthy and tan with a new lease on life
He pops a , then unwraps rolls of cloth from around the Spear of Destiny
He drops it in the hole, stares at it a long beat
'  - The entire mechanism shudders
And now miraculously, every globe, every moon, every obscure object in this miniature occult universe begins to rotate in complete sync
As it does, the defining object finally slides
John's lighter
watches it rotate past, nods in approval
John sighs, finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred relic
He stands, nods
Job done
breeze blows past and John senses being watched
He spins and finds -- nothing
For a hundred miles
He starts walking
(
) Some people are born to make a difference
had to die
Twice
: 20    - walking right in step
Something is closing in on her
new  pulls up
Chaz is driving
Angela gets in
(
) God does work in mysterious ways
119
John continues walking as something closes in on him at incredible speed
(
) Some people like it
Our view   him and gliding across the barren landscape are the  of
(
) Some people don't
