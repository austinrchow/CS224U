: Written by Andy Hurst & Ross Helford - perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless , glinting in the morning sun
Tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble
The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them 's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds
She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case
Not to touch the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted in the case below the priceless jewels
It's of a  cradling her
Today's the day, Mom
(
) You here again, Marie
Marie spins round, sees the bespectacled , 60's, standing behind her
Just leaving
Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case
'
' - Marie fires up her powerful , parked right outside the austere Museum building
The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds fluttering skywards
appear over
of a narrow highway, Marie's  streaking through the endless tract of Florida wetlands
In the water, , warm themselves in the early morning sun
over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant waters in their deafening
Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club
03/22/2004   2
Marie steers her  into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue Bay High School
'  - Marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when
She  on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car
Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt
She sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from the front bumper of the
The sudden jolt has changed the radio station
newscaster rambles on
(
) operation, aimed at finally capturing the Black Widow suspect after a six month trail of embezzlement and fraud, once again failed to snare its subject
, 17, stands defiantly in front of the , her don't-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me clothes
(
) Blue Bay Police Detective Michael Morrison was able to recover over $400,000 in stolen money, but the suspect, described as Female, between eighteen and thirty, remains at large
Marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo, then leans out of the car window
'm
so
sorry
Elena smiles wryly
You will be
And she means it
03/22/2004   3
- The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body
The natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back
Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still shocked by what happened out in the parking lot
(handing over a present) Happy birthday, babe
They ain't diamonds, but you're just gonna have to wait for those
Marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of
(unconvincing) Thank you
Thank you so much
Are you , hon
Marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the Goddess she is
yeah
'll be fine
It's just
that new girl
almost hit her in the parking lot
You mean the towel girl, the one who transferred in
Jesus, she's trouble
You know the only reason she's slinging towels is 'cos it's court ordered
Marie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea of hormonally challenged students as Principal  , his ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage
We're here today to address a growing epidemic that affects all of you
He pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down
National studies report sexual activity among students at an all-time high
03/22/2004   4
The students all cheer, naturally
We'll see who's cheering when you've got an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or get slapped with a paternity suit
Or arrested for date rape
But don't take my word for it
He motions behind him to  , early 30's, a natural beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and glasses, and  , late 20s, devilishly handsome
Miss Richards and Dr
Borman are here to tell you about the pitfalls first hand
Kristen steps up to the lectern
Good morning, my name is Kristen Richards
'm an officer for the Miami juvenile parole board, as some of you already know
Quick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes
But that's not what brings me here today
When  heard about Principal Mosster's sex education program  thought 'd volunteer my own personal story, in hopes that you might learn from the mistakes made
Back in High school all  wanted to do was get drunk, stoned and laid
The students roar their approval
By my junior year, my life was a blur of cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every night of the week
Elena covers her mouth, as if to cough
(through fake coughs) whore
Kristen ignores the slur
03/22/2004   5
And then, one night at some pathetic frat party, someone slipped a roofie in my drink
and raped me
This quiets the auditorium
There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't crawl when  think of the violation and humiliation  endured
can promise you that if you make the same kind of wrong- headed choices  did, you'll be seeing Dr
Borman
Chad steps to the podium
Thank you, Miss Richards
My name's Dr
Chad Borman
run the forensics lab at the police department, where my work has helped convict hundreds of sex offenders
Most teens like Ms
Richards never get their lives together
The physical scars may go away, but the emotional damage stays forever
While Chad drones on, , a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up on the back of the chair
He spots the ugly plastic bracelet locked around one of her ankles
That's not
what  think it is, is it
Whattchya think it is, bitch
The words catch in his throat
One of them
Parole leashes
Bingo
So you can't, like, go more than ten miles from the cop shop
Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet
03/22/2004   6
Five
got someone's panties in a bunch
Back at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words resonate with the student body
And as for the perpetrators of this heinous act, even if you are still a minor, you will be tried as an adult, and, if convicted, you will do hard time
He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students
Are there any questions
(calling out) Yeah,  got one for Miss Richards
Ask away
When they found the scumbag who took your precious flower of virginity, you sued his sorry ass, right
Kristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth
Uh, no, actually,  was never able to make a positive
All  remember was his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll never forget
" Elena cracks a sideways grin
So what you're really saying is you fucked for free
Kristen has no answer to that
Principal Mosster does his best to control the situation
Miss Sandoval
You're on thin ice, young lady
Like Elena cares
She leans back, nods
Job done

- The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full swing
(
) Blue Bay High School would like to welcome all participating diving teams from the tri-county region
Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area
But all eyes are on the home team
Masturbatory fantasies abound as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches
And as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white bathing suit
(
) First up, district champion Marie Clifford
The crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform twenty feet above
Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder
, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late thirties, focuses a    on Marie from the front row of the bleachers
'mon now baby, you can do it
Marie just rolls her eyes
Your stepfather's just got a lot invested in the team
Marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him
(to Marie) Just try to keep those legs together
(
) Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen Virgin
03/22/2004   8
Jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with the world's hottest towel girl
Excuse me
You're Mr
Clifford, right
As in Clifford construction
am, yes, but
'd love to see one of your erections
Whoa
Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into the air
It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form
She quickly resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with her teammates before crossing to Jay
Nice take off, gotta work on the landing
can't do any better
Jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately
No such word as 'can't
Now do it again
Only better
Marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more
As she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel
Bet you choke
Stops Marie in her tracks
What's your major malfunction
Just wanted to make a wager
Between best friends
9
Marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform
You blow this dive,  get those diamonds of yours
Marie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the ladder, shakes her head
How'd you know about my inheritance
Talk of the town, birthday girl
Today's the day, right
And what, pray tell, are you willing to wager when  win
Elena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile
'll stay away from your stepfather
You make it,  won't be your new stepmom anytime soon
Whattya say
Marie just stands there incredulous for a moment
Take your sorry ass back to the swamps
She ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind
Choke
Marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on the task at hand
But can't help but notice her nemesis below, walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him
Marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop looming beyond
She slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck
It's an odd design
Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond
She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne
03/22/2004   10
She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking beauty
Thank God this is in slow motion
And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks, does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash
Marie surfaces to roaring
Treading water, she can't help but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers
- Sickeningly expensive  and de-rigged  line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion
Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds
Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non- alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland
Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs and a bikini top, sidles up beside her
What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that one judge only gave you a 9
7
Marie forces a smile
Nah
'm cool
Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe
You got diamonds on the mind
(
) Have either of you seen my video camera
Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a bemused look to Jay's face
had it at the dive meet, 'm sure
He shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers
Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday
Everyone raises their fine crystal
03/22/2004   11
She's become every inch of the woman her Mother hoped she'd be
Wherever she is now, Julie's looking down and smiling
Tears well in Marie's eyes
And that's why, on your eighteenth birthday, Marie,  know your mother wanted you to have
He notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed standing at the entrance to his house
Whoever they are, Jay's instantly unnerved
He stumbles over his words
she wanted you to have
a wonderful birthday party surrounded by all your friends
e glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter
Please excuse me
and hurries after them
Marie is left dumbfounded
So close, but so far
Jay
What about my present
She chases after him
- Marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the opulent Clifford Mansion, past framed family photos, of Jay, Marie and the late Julie
Jay
e's nowhere to be found
Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in the kitchen
She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the cork
Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices
(
) It simply can't be done
Marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway, and down towards Jay's study
12
(
) (') In all construction there's delays
Marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack
What she sees makes the blood run cold in her veins
An imposing Cuban businessman,
, stands threateningly over a visibly frightened Jay
Another man, , dressed in designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn of this little operation
Four months is not a delay
It's a disaster
You have my word, Mr
Barajas, the building is almost finished
Just give me a week, two tops
Barajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning quickness, holds a Razor sharp  against his thumb
We are long past the negotiation stage
Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb
Marie has to cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood stain the spotless white carpet
(') For every day the building goes unfinished, we'll take a finger
sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips
Pray, Mr
Clifford, you finish before the eleventh day
And with that the Cuban men head to the door
Marie scrambles away, her heart pounding
She's halfway down the hallway when Mr
Barajas and Cicatriz exit Jay's study
She turns, tries to look innocent as the Cuban 'businessmen' stare her down
ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow
Marie
Shouldn't you be with your friends
03/22/2004   13
was just
Cicatriz takes a step towards her
(to Marie) 'll be right there
With your gift
just
wait outside,
Marie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating Cuban men
- Marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi-clad partygoers, in a daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne
Jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost sheep with open arms
So
Did you get the key
Are you Blue Bay's richest bitch
Marie's thoughts are drowned out by the  of a powerful engine
All attention turns to a rusted  as it streaks across the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of  in its wake
nd atop the bike
Elena, in skintight leathers
Holy shit, who invited her
Marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow
Elena brings the bike to a screeching halt inches from the surprised guests
The ultimate partycrasher
This is a private party
Don't mind me
ain't here for your stupid party
She's striding towards the Mansion, towards Jay who's standing at the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands
Get the hell outta here
Marie stumbles after Elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her back
There's a tense moment before
03/22/2004   14
Damn girl, whattcha been drinking
Stay away from my stepfather
Make me
And that's it
Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch
Connects on Elena's jaw and she goes reeling back
But it's ignited the street fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming into Marie and together they tumble to the ground
he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled and aroused
It's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing wrestling match, no holds barred
The drunken Marie has the upper hand, the alcohol fueling her rage
(
) What the hell's going on here
And that stops the fight right there and then
Marie looks up to see a red faced Jay standing over her
This
trash is just looking for a meal ticket
Elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip
Mr
Clifford
Betcha proud of little Marie now, huh
He hauls Marie to her feet, thrusts her towards the mansion
Party's over
Groans from the crowd, but Jay's mind is made up
But
what about
my present
Jay's already walking away
'm going to the condos
Sleep it off, whydontcha
Elena watches Jay stride away, like a lioness stalking her prey
03/22/2004   15
- Work lights illuminate the half finished condo building site, on prime beachfront real estate
These places would sell for millions, if they were ever finished
- In a concrete makeshift office, on the top floor of the condo building, Jay clicks open the lock on his large metal safe and the steel door swings open
Inside are stacks of , piled high, along with a shiny new Jay flicks through the money, shaking his head
(sotto) Not enough
Just not enough
clanking noise from outside has him quickly snatching the gun from the safe, before closing it once more, spinning the lock
- Jay walks out of his office, into the half-finished top floor of the condos
Exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind schedule Jay really is
Hello
Anyone there
He swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the flickering florescent light
Finally Jay lowers the weapon
It looks like he might collapse, until he catches himself, palms flat against the wall, head down
(') Fuck me
(
) Any time
Any place
He reels around, sees Elena moving toward him, brushing aside the thick plastic sheeting
She has a bottle of beer in one hand, a video camera in the other
Jay's video camera to be precise
What are you doing here
You promised to show me your erection
03/22/2004   16
Elena focuses the video camera on Jay's crotch
Makes him incredibly uncomfortable, obviously
Is that my
camera
Elena thrusts the bottle of beer at Jay
Lighten up, Jay
Jay takes the bottle from her, sets it down on the concrete floor
Enough's enough
think it's time you left
This brings a teasing pout to Elena's lips
Is that any way to treat Marie's new best friend
Jay's taken aback
You're best friends are you
Sure
We've been having sleepovers
Talking about boys, swapping tips
She's been teaching me about shopping, 've been teaching her about giving mind blowing head
Jay's taken aback once more
How much more aback can he be taken
He reaches out and blocks the video camera lens
Gimme the camera back
Elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him
Keeps the camera trained on his worried face
Come get it
Jay's reaching his elastic limit
He reaches for the camera, but Elena won't let go
They wrestle for control of the video camera
And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across the room and  on the concrete floor
03/22/2004   17
(slyly) Ooopppps
Elena runs her finger under Jay's chin, then turns and walks away, leaving Jay standing there, all taken aback
- drunken Marie brings her  to a swerving halt outside the construction site
She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on the passenger seat for dutch courage
(sotto) It's present time
She reaches for the car door handle, but comes up short
When she looks back up she's in for some taking aback of her own
Elena comes walking out of the building site, and the two girls lock eyes
There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a satisfied smile and walks away
What the hell
Marie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car
What are you doing here at this time of night
Marie stammers to find the words
just
wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier
was out of line
Jay's mood lightens
When we admit our mistakes we grow
You've made an important step
So
what about my present
Meet me at the Museum
Before school tomorrow
Now go home, get some sleep, 'm gonna finish up here
03/22/2004    18
He walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face
: - perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother Daughter , glinting in the morning sun
Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels
(
) You really think you're ready for your inheritance
Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in the same clothes as yesterday
It was
it was what Mom wanted
Jay looks at her sternly
You're the only one who can open that lock, but 'm the one with the key
She wanted you to have the diamonds when you were responsible enough to know what to do with them
'm
responsible
Jay shakes his head slowly, deliberately
Really
Underage drinking, prying into my personal affairs, fighting
But they're mine
Mom left them to me
They're yours when  say they're yours
For the time being, 've got some major problems at the construction site
Deadlines have to be met
We'll talk again when you've done some growing up
Jay puts an arm around his stepdaughter, starts walking her back towards the massive wooden doors
03/22/2004    19
Please, don't fight me on this
We're Team Clifford, remember
(without conviction) Team Clifford
She's stuck in an awkward embrace with her Step Father
- Jay leads Marie down the stone steps outside the quaint Museum building
But as they approach his car they're hit by
and The whine of sirens has Jay spinning around in surprise, looking over to see four Police Cruisers come to a screeching halt
What the hell
Half a dozen of Blue Bay's finest, lead by the dashing young , draw their badges, approach Jay
Mr
Clifford
Can  help you, Officer
You're under arrest on suspicion of rape
Jay's jaw drops to the ground
There must be some mistake, this isn't possible
Jay, what's going on
Entwistle puts a powerful hand on Jay, leads him to the first Police cruiser Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me down the station
This is outrageous
Entwistle gets into the Police car's passenger seat
03/22/2004   20
didn't do anything,  swear
'm afraid she's got a different story
Who's 'she'
- Elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger
She stops in front of the two way mirror, examines her reflection
Tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab on her lip, covering the wound Marie inflicted at the party
And slowly Elena starts to press on the cut, until the blood starts to flow once more
There's a quiet knock on the door and Elena quickly lowers her hand, looks round
Kristen Richards, the young Parole Officer who so heart wrenchingly told her story at Blue Bay High earlier, comes quietly into the gray room
Elena
Elena just looks up at her pitifully
Could you tell me what happened
Through stifled sobs, Elena states
It was Jay Clifford
He raped me
The interview room door swings open and , 30's, enters
He's the personification of the term "overworked, underpaid
" You understand the seriousness of this allegation, young lady
Elena nods weakly
And you know that we'll leave no stone un- turned in the investigation
21
(') There'll be a battery of forensics tests you'll have to take, humiliating stuff
And background checks, digging up all kinds of dirt
And you'll have to testify in court, face the man you're accusing
Crocodile tears roll down Elena's cheeks
You sure you want to go through with this
No harm, no foul, you can just walk away right now
Kristen interjects
Please, Detective, this isn't the right time
ain't lying
You think 'm lying
Kristen turns to her young ward
If you're telling the truth, you won't find a more sympathetic ear
'If' 'm telling the truth
And if you're not, there's gonna be trouble, you understand
This is already trouble
The man you're accusing happens to be a friend of mine, and when the  tests prove you're lying 'm gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks, mark my words
Elena withers under his glare
- Jay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and , his sharp suited attorney
We're gonna sue their asses til time runs backwards
03/22/2004   22
(to Marie) You've gotta believe me,  would never, could never do anything like this, you know that don't you
Marie takes his hand, squeezes it
We're team Clifford
Jay forces a tired smile
That's my girl
The door swings open and Morrison enters
Jay
Marie
Mr
Bloom
Jay stands, shakes Morrison's hand
(to Marie) Would you mind waiting outside while me and your stepdad have a little chat
Marie looks to Jay, doesn't want to leave
It's  honey
Michael and  are old pals
Reluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her
Jay sits back down
Morrison takes a chair opposite
How's the divorce treating you
She's taken me for everything 'm worth
swear to God, 'm never trusting another woman as long as  live
heo intervenes
This is most egregious, Detective, my client has pressing matters at his construction site
He can't afford to waste time with this frivolous nonsense
03/22/2004   23
(to Jay) Look, we're taking her statement right now, gonna run every forensic test in the book
Guarantee the case'll come apart like a $2 watch
Jay nods, certain he can beat this rap
She had my camcorder
Recorded what happened
It should still be at the construction site
It'll clear my name
Morrison nods
You'll be outta here by tonight
- Marie waits out in the anonymous hallway, talking a mile-a-minute on her cell phone
( ) can't believe it, Jenny
It just doesn't make sense
mean,  know Jay
know he'd never
When a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly, only to see Kristen come out, walk towards her, followed by someone
Marie's view is blocked by Kristen until the Parole Officer passes her and reveals
Elena
This can't be
look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on Marie's beautiful face
Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss
No such word as 'can't'
- Police cars line the driveway outside the beach front building site
Officers cordon off the road as Forensics teams photograph every inch of the building
Standing amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate Mr
Barajas, accompanied, as ever, by Cicatriz
They are both on , both talking angry, fast Spanish
03/22/2004   24
- Plastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished condos
The white suited   work meticulously, led by the tireless Dr
Chad Borman, delicately dusting anything and everything that might yield evidence
Morrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by He's looking at Jay's smashed   , now bagged and tagged as evidence
(
) Sexual predators often keep a trophy
Morrison spins, sees Kristen
He stumbles with his words, not used to talking to beautiful women
'm sorry
Maybe he recorded the rape
Morrison looks at the remains of the camera
And maybe he didn't
We'll never know
Tape's mangled
Forensics said it'd take months to fix it
He looks up into Kristen's hypnotic eyes
We were never properly introduced
Michael Morrison
She offers her hand, and Morrison shakes it
Miss Richards
Kristen
Miami Parole
Was just in town for a couple days checking in on some parolees when all this went down
She hands Morrison a  , which he absently stuffs into his pocket
You think maybe you could lean on the girl
Get her to drop this nonsense
We all know she's lying
With all this Black widow shit going down, we just don't have the time or manpower to
03/22/2004   25
She might not be lying, you know
What makes you think that
Just a look in her eye
have some experience
Morrison doesn't want to push her further
All of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the Forensics team, leaving everyone in pitch darkness
What the hell
Slowly an eerie    fills the room
The white suited forensics technicians, glowing under the black light, wait patiently for evidence to show itself
Suddenly the clear  of hands on the wall become clear, along with the black stains of
Gotcha
What is it
Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle
'd say we've got a rape on our hands, Detective, but we won't know for sure until we run the tests
Morrison's head is spinning
Fine
Just do it
- Elena sits on the edge of a gurney in the high tech forensics lab, rubbing her arm where a band-aid covers a fresh needle mark
Chad appears at the doorway and she stares daggers at him
You vampires really need five pints of my blood
That's like an armful
03/22/2004   26
Chad's surprised by her venom
It's standard procedure in a rape test
Test for drugs and such
And such
She continues to pace as Chad makes his way into the room, rounds the desk and takes down a plastic beaker from the metal shelf
We're going to need a urine sample
Do you think you could fill this
From here
Chad goes red
Puts the plastic cup down on the desk and Elena grabs it If
you wouldn't mind
removing your clothes
'll leave the room, give you some priv
The breath catches in Chad's throat as Elena takes her shirt off without hesitation
Stands there in just her black bra
Done
Next
Chad's jaw drops
Not just because Elena's in her underwear, but because of the clear   on her neck and arms
Those are
Bite marks
He chowed down
They're clear evidence markers
He reaches out, grabs a Polaroid Camera from the desk, starts snapping away like an ornithologist at a bird convention
The of the camera fills the room
03/22/2004   27
- explode as Marie accompanies her stepfather up the steps of the austere Blue Bay courthouse, surrounded by a gaggle of sound bite hungry pressmen
1 Any comment, Mr
Clifford
Jay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses
He disappears quickly into the shelter of the courthouse
2 (to Marie) Did your stepfather rape that girl
How could he do something like that
Marie stops in her tracks, wheels around and addresses the throng of reporters
Jay
is innocent
Says it like she means it
- The packed courthouse is abuzz and the elderly   is forced to slam his gavel down
Order
Jay sits at the defendant's table, suit impeccable, hair immaculate, game face on
Theo sits beside him, scribbling notes
Marie is in the front row of the gallery, surrounded by her coiffured peers
She tries to smile stoically at Jay
Kristen sits beside Elena at the prosecution table
had is on the stand as  , 35, the slick District Attorney, steps forward
Dr
Borman, do your tests show that Elena Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the night of the 25th
Yes they do
Do they show that it was forced
03/22/2004   28
Yes
There was extensive bruising and tearing
We found no semen evidence
The latex abrasions point to the use of protection
This is quite common in cases of premeditated rape
And what can you tell us about Miss Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor
Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common date rape drug
Traces were also found on the bottle of beer at the crime scene
Both Mr
Clifford and Miss Sandoval's fingerprints were all over the bottle
took it from her
She was far too young to be drinking
slam of the gavel silences Jay
Dr
Borman  am going to show you what's been marked as state's exhibit number 1
He nods to the bailiff and a  whirs to life
An that Chad took of Elena's wounds is displayed on a screen beside him
What does this slide show
Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous bite marks on her upper torso that occurred during the rape
What about those other markings
Chad looks confused, studies the slide, sees four equidistant dots aligned in a small circle
wasn't able to determine
Fingernail markings, possibly
(to Meese) Please continue
03/22/2004   29
Marie can barely breathe
'm going to show you another slide that's been marked as state's exhibit number 2
Meese nods to the bailiff, who dutifully changes the slide
The court goes dark for a second before the next slide is displayed
It's a close up of Jay's teeth mouldings compared to the bite marks
What can you tell us about these mouldings
They were made from the defendant's teeth, and the tests  conducted show there's simply no other conclusion
The bite marks on Miss Sandoval's body were made by the defendant, Mr
Jay Clifford
That's it
The Court erupts, flashbulbs exploding
Jay slumps back in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant
He looks back at Marie, utter disbelief on his face
The tears well in her eyes
The Judge bangs his gavel in a vain attempt to regain control
Court's adjourned
- news gleefully reports Jay's trial like a sordid soap opera
( ) in the face of damning evidence, Jay Clifford remained defiant
It's thought that his stepdaughter, Marie Clifford will testify in his defense tomorrow
And in other news, officials from the gave a press conference today, commenting on their involvement in the Black widow case
walking suit,   , steps up to the podium
( ) After numerous mistakes on behalf of the local authorities in Blue Bay, the  is mobilizing its task force
03/22/2004   30
Click
Morrison tosses the  remote aside, sits down behind his desk, piled high with files, mostly marked  , and reaches down to pick up Jay's broken video camera, still in the evidence bag
(
) It's a long shot
Morrison looks up, smiles faintly when he sees Kristen at the door
Not a fan of 'Hey, how you doing', are you
Kristen smiles, enters Morrison's cluttered office
Used to play at being a spider when  was a kid, creeping around silently
Guess haven't grown out of it
Morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag
It's the only thing standing between my friend and a ten year stretch
The forensics lab will have time to look at it now
the Feds have taken over the Black widow case
Goddamn gloryhounds
They knew  was close
They just want to come in and take all the credit
You got a chance, Detective
To help your friend
Don't let this case slip away as well
Morrison tightens his jaw, knows what he has to do
- The Forensics lab is crammed with evidence bags and files
Chad is working diligently, painstakingly scanning a stack of $100 one by one
He barely has time to look round when the door opens and Detective Morrison comes in
03/22/2004   31
Chad,  got a rush job for you
Chad rolls his eyes
No can do, boss
We're sifting through the Black Widow evidence
Feds are movin' in
They'll be taking over by the case by the end of the week
Chad's dumbstruck, but dutifully takes the shattered video camera
You find anything on that tape, you let me know,
Whatever you say, boss
And make sure you get that money back into the evidence locker
nd Chad's left alone with the shattered remains of the video camera, and a whole shit load of work ahead
: - The early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the smooth-as-glass surface of the school swimming pool
Marie steps back up onto the high diving platform
Tries to focus
Slides the soon-to-be-diamond ring off her finger and throws it tentatively into the water
She takes a breath and then dives, straight and true, into the perfect blue water below
- Marie's lithe, taught body comes arcing through the water, darting down to the bottom of the pool to retrieve the ring
- Marie surfaces, reaches out and puts the ring on the side of the pool, before looking up to see an old pair of sneakers, an electronic ankle bracelet locked around one leg
03/22/2004     32
Nice take off
Gotta work on the landing
Marie's blood boils
What the hell are you doing here
Elena just reaches down and picks up Marie's unfinished ring
Looks like your bling ain't blinging
Give me that back
It was my Mother's
Marie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena
Looks like she got ripped off Princess, where's the rock
Marie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger
Is that what this is all about
Elena reaches out, tries to stroke the wet hair off Marie's face
She recoils before she'll let Elena touch her
You're not a dumb as you look
enny, followed by the rest of the diving team, come marching out of the locker room and see the two arch-enemies confronting each other
(to her team mates) We got trouble
Elena won't back down
You're ruining my life, and my stepfather's
It can end
Just like that
She snaps her fingers and Marie's on the verge of tears
03/22/2004   33
Jenny and the rest of the diving team approach, stand behind Marie, a seething mass of bikini-clad mindless hate
Why are you doing this
Because  can
As she turns and walks away
(') Good luck in court
- The usual assortment of paparazzi and spectators crowd into the small courtroom
Marie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her stepfather at the defendant's table
Gone is the immaculate suit, the perfect hair, the poker face
He's looking worried now
Theo paces in front of Marie, running her through a series of well- rehearsed questions
And why did you go to your stepfather's building site that night, Miss Clifford
It was my birthday
Jay left the party before giving me my present
And you say you saw Miss Sandoval leaving
Marie takes a moment, looks to Elena at the Prosecution table
did
And how would you describe her appearance
She was
she looked fine
She smiled at me
Actually smiled
No further questions
03/22/2004   34
He takes a seat next to Jay, whispers in his ear
Meese starts his cross-examination
Would it be fair to say you don't like Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford
We don't see
eye to eye
Is that why you attacked her at your party earlier that night
Marie squirms
No
was
she wasn't invited
You'd had a few drinks, correct
(reluctantly) 'd had a drink
Yes
So by the time you allege to have seen Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court exactly how much you'd had to drink
glass of Champagne
Or two, but
No further questions
Jay sinks a few inches lower in his seat
Going down
- bleary eyed Chad sits in front of a bank of monitors, working the image enhancement equipment, fighting to get a watchable picture from the fuzzy static in front of him
Kristen sits behind him, fighting to stay awake
(to himself) Take out the chroma, raise the luminescence
He clumsily reaches over the control panel, hitting almost every button on the way
And that does the trick
03/22/2004   35
Suddenly the picture on the monitors becomes clear
Kristen's eyes snap open
oly shit
The pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the
(') Call Detective Morrison
Now
' - The shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the
Soon enough though her smile fades
( ) You're kidding right
Jay's voice can be heard behind the camera
(
) 'mon now baby, you can do it
The video shows Elena cowering
( ) Please
you can't do this
(
) No such word as can't
hand reaches out from behind the video camera and grabs Elena, throws her violently against a concrete wall
(
) Fuck me
flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus
When the camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall and she's sobbing ( ) Please, Mr
Clifford, don't
(
) Just try to keep those legs together
And then static
03/22/2004   36
Pulling back from the  we find ourselves in the courtroom, completely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all staring in shock at the blank  screen
If Mr
Clifford would plead guilty to rape, the state is prepared to drop the charges of kidnapping and assault
(to Jay) If  were you  would seriously consider the offer
- In the cold stone jail visiting room, Jay sits behind the wire mesh, an emotion Marie and Theo opposite
The   waits by the barred door, keeping his beady eyes on Jay
'm gonna lose this trial
'm not so sure about that
The tape's a fake, right
So all we need to do is
Jay holds up a hand, instantly silencing his attorney
You had your chance
(to Marie) If we're gonna win at all costs, we're gonna have to change the game
(to Theo) Do you have it
Theo nods regretfully, reaches into a breast pocket, pulls out a 'm still dead set against this, Jay
couldn't care less
What's the key for
The diamonds
If that's what it takes, then that's what it takes
03/22/2004   37
But
they're my inheritance
All my assets are tied up in the condos, Marie
We have to pay this girl off, make her testify that she faked the tape, faked the evidence
But, Jay
they're my diamonds
As soon as 'm out of here, you'll have them back
swear
know people, who can
persuade her to hand them over
Marie shoots an uncomfortable look to Theo, then back at Jay, uncertain what to say
t's wrong
More wrong than what she's doing to us
We're team Clifford, right
You know 'm not guilty
You know  could never do anything like this
So do the right thing and get me out of this hellhole
Marie's cracking
can't
(tenderly) No such word as 'can't
' Please
The tears well in her eyes
- The key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling Mother Daughter diamonds
The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems
The Curator stands behind her in the empty Museum hall, ruefully watching his prize exhibit being removed
knew the day would come, still doesn't make it any easier
03/22/2004   38
Marie, tears welling in her eyes, takes a hold of the diamonds, carefully takes them from the case
The offer still stands, Marie
If you ever decide to sell them, please give us a first chance
Marie turns to him, the emotions overwhelming her
don't think 'll be able to, 'm sorry
She scampers towards the door, past the security guards
(sotto) Me too
- Theo's  drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to the swamp, past countless rusted airboats, and into the '' trailer park, finally coming to a halt in front of Elena's rotting trailer
Theo gets out carefully, his $1000 shoes sinking into the mud
Marie reluctantly steps out of the car
blinding   flicks on
Theo and Marie spin round, squint through the light to see Elena standing in her trailer doorway Well, well, well
Look what the cat dragged in
(to Theo) know you're here
Theo squirms
We need to talk
So talk
Somewhere private, maybe
03/22/2004   39
'  - An elderly man,  , in a sweat-stained -shirt and ratty underwear, snores on the tattered recliner, a half-drunk bottle of hanging from one limp hand
Theo freezes when he sees him
Who's this
Uncle Marty
Legal Guardian
Drunken pervert, take your pick
Chill
He's out til morning
Uncle Marty's deafening  confirm the assertion as Elena leads them into her bedroom
Let's just get this over with
(to Elena) You won
You got what you wanted
(mocking) just wanted justice
Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the jury you faked the evidence, faked the tape
(sarcastic) Really
We are prepared to make it worth your while
She holds the Daughter diamond in front of Elena's greedy little eyes
(poker face) Not bad
But  always wanted a family
Theo nudges Marie
She sighs, holds out the Mother diamond in the other hand
broad grin stretches across Elena's face
03/22/2004   40
They're yours after you exonerate my client
'm afraid 'm gonna need that payment up front
No, that's not the deal
It is now
Take it or leave it
Marie takes a deep breath
It's the most difficult thing she's ever had to do in her young life
Dead silence, except for Uncle Marty's snoring from the front room
inally, with a very heavy heart, Marie hands over the diamonds
When this is all over, you'll leave town
For good
Elena points to the ankle bracelet
go more than five miles from the police station and 'm straight back in juvie
understand your Parole term is up next week
Elena smiles
You've done your homework
Fine
(points to the ankle bracelet) As soon as this thing comes off, 'm outta here
She reaches down and grabs the diamonds
Dances past Marie
May  suggest a little discretion, Miss Sandoval
Certain
questions might be asked about this
arrangement if you were to
say
turn up to Blue Bay High wearing a tiara
Elena winks
03/22/2004   41
ain't gonna flaunt it, mate
gots too much class for that shit
You're going to tell the truth on the stand tomorrow, yes
Elena raises her right hand
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth
- The court Bailiff nods, takes the Bible from Elena's hands
She's dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her wardrobe; a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt
The courtroom is packed with journalists,  cameras and nosey neighbors
Everyone wants a piece of this story
At the defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo approach the witness box with a new-found confidence
Sitting in the front row of the public gallery, Marie is riveted on the action
At the back of the courtroom, Kristen fidgets nervously beside Morrison as Theo steps up, ready to question the newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial
It's your assertion that my client, Mr
Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you on the night of the 25th
Is that true
hushed silence
Marie, Jay, Theo all wait expectantly
Is that what you say happened
Elena clears her throat
He
He didn't
collective intake of breath from the crowd
just sexually assault me
Theo's balls shrink instantly
03/22/2004   42
What
did you just say
He didn't just sexually assault me
He threatened to kill me if  told anyone
he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy
Theo's reeling, caught off-guard, stumbling over his words, trying to give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise
Isn't it true that you were inebriated during the assault, that it may not in fact have been Mr
Clifford
Or anyone
smirking Meese doesn't even bother to stand up
Objection
Leading the witness
Sustained
Council will please rephrase the question
Theo's stumped
His eyes plead with Elena to take the ball and run with it
She does
Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone
was messed up, alright
In fact, only two things  remember
One was that bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that Goddamn video camera while he violated me
The other was what he whispered in my ear, right before  blacked out
She pauses, for emphasis
Judge, jury, gallery, press corps, the town of Blue Bay, the state of Florida hangs on her every word
He said, "You won't remember, but you'll never forget
" That's it
The court goes berserk, flashbulbs exploding, along with the veins in Jay's head
Kristen's reeling from shock
(to Morrison) What did she just say
Marie leaps to her feet, screams
03/22/2004   43
Lying bitch
Marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to claw Elena's tear stained eyes out
- small Television blares out today's top story
The young victim's wrenching testimonial proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Jay Clifford
It took less than an hour for the jury to deliberate and sentence Mr
Clifford to 15 years
cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs
( ) You can't do this to me
You can't '
The  turns off
Marie sits huddled in Jay's unfinished concrete building site office, staring at the darkened television set
Mascara laden tear tracks line her perfect face
(mumbling) No such thing as can't
She lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it smashes on the concrete floor
Strangely the dregs of the champagne start running down the floor
Marie's heart suddenly skips a beat as she thinks she hears the rustling of plastic from outside the office
Who's there
No answer
She steels herself, gets shakily to her feet, stumbling drunkenly toward the door
'  - Kristen stands in the darkened doorway of Elena's less-than- welcoming trailer
She knocks
Elena
Open up
03/22/2004   44
No answer
She tries the door handle
It's unlocked
She takes a deep breath, steps inside
'  - Kristen flips on a light switch
The room is illuminated for a split second before the bulb surges and burns out, leaving Kristen in the near-darkness
Elena
Hello
She takes out a , creeps through the front room, stepping over the discarded pizza boxes and assorted detritus
The beam of light finds a small   nestled in the carpeting
Kristen picks it up, slides it into her pocket
- Marie steps cautiously through the unfinished concrete top floor, past the crime scene tape
In the dim light, her eyes dart to every corner, every shadow
he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged into darkness
Slowly the eerie forensic switch on, filling the room with black light
And with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly turns, coming face to face with
Elena, her arch-nemesis
'  - Kristen moves slowly into Elena's bedroom, shines her light on the walls
What she sees makes the blood run chill in her veins
Barely able to breathe, she takes out her cell phone
(into phone) Detective Morrison
- Elena and Marie stare each other down
You could cut the tension with a chainsaw, until
Who invited you
03/22/2004   45
sinister grin spreads across Elena's face as she holds up the breathtaking Mother-Daughter diamonds, reflecting an unearthly glow under the  lights
Mother and Daughter
This brings a mile-wide smile to Marie as she dances into Elena's arms
Their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands dance over each other's trembling bodies
When they finally break
was sure you'd blow it on the stand, going on about forgetting and remembering
Gotta make it seem authentic
God's in the details
And they kiss again, lips locked tighter than Jay's jail cell
'  - Morrison's unmarked sedan pulls to a stop beside Kristen's car, and the harried Detective steps out, looking extremely unhappy
This couldn't wait 'til morning, Miss Richards
Call me Kristen
The Feds just arrived to take over the Black Widow case, 'm up to my knees in paperwork
You remember what Elena said, right at the end of the trial
"You won't remember
" (finishing) "
but you'll never forget
" What about it
Elena's fucking with us
03/22/2004   46
- Elena and Marie are locked in their carnal embrace, failing to notice the florescent lights flickering back on
Suddenly Elena feels the sharp pain of teeth biting into her neck
She looks down to see    of Jay's teeth being held by a smiling Chad
Mind if Chad joins
The girls look up to see a beaming Chad, holding the teeth molding
Elena just shakes her head
Fuck me
Chad works the spring hinge of the dentures like a deranged ventriloquist act
Any time
Any place
He sets the dentures down on the concrete floor, and takes in the sight of the magnificent diamonds
(re: diamonds) Two beauties
(turning to Marie and Elena) Two beauties
He and Elena help Marie out of her blouse while Elena runs her hands all over him
'  - Morrison and Kristen's flashlights cut through the darkness as they move back into Elena's bedroom
Just so you know, this is called 'breaking and entering'
know all about it
Especially having something stolen
Like what
03/22/2004   47
They get into the bedroom and Morrison's jaw goes slack as Kristen shines her light on the walls
Like my life
The walls are covered with  , all concerning Kristen's rape: "Police unable to find frat house rapist," "Teenage victim wants 'justice' in rape case," "'You may not remember, but you'll never forget,' only thing victim remembers" risten tears some of the articles off the wall
Once a thief, always a thief
They suddenly freeze as the front door swings open, the blood running cold in their veins as Uncle Marty stumbles inside
They hold their breath, praying he doesn't see them, standing in Elena's doorway
Uncle Marty just mumbles something incoherent and collapses face first onto the couch, out like a light
- Chad reaches into an evidence bag filled with
He removes three
Little blue pills
One of the perks of the job
Laughter as   the girl's accept the roofies, swallowing them like candy
Chad   gulps down the third as Elena begins to run her hands up and down   Marie's back and shoulders
Chad's hands are all over Marie as he   helps slip off her bra
Elena's lips move hungrily across Chad's face, until they find his mouth
They kiss deeply
hen they pull apart, Chad helps Elena pull off her -top, as Marie runs her hands up and down Elena's bare back
Elena turns back to her with a mischievous grin
You won't remember
But you'll never forget
Damn straight
03/22/2004   48
- The early morning sun illuminates a massive slab of windowless concrete surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of nowhere
- Jay takes a seat on an uncomfortable metal chair in front of bullet-proof glass
He's half the man he used to be, broken, trembling, smoking like a chimney
His mind's still a steel trap, just one that's rusted shut
He picks up the -
(into phone) Mr
Clifford, this is Kristen Richards, Elena Sandoval's probation officer
She want to pin me for some more crimes
Kristen takes the phone from Theo
No, Mr
Clifford
just have a few questions
've noticed some inconsistencies
You've noticed some inconsistencies
Here's one big fucking glaring inconsistency for you:  was set up
Maybe so, but that's not good enough
Why were you set up
What would Elena Sandoval have gained from all this
Jay hesitates, unsure how, or if, to proceed
Theo shifts nervously
Jay gives up
What the hell
'm already in jail
How much worse can it get
paid her off, okay
My assets were tied up in the condos so we used Marie's diamonds
defensive) It wasn't like  had a choice
She had me by the short an' curlies, understand
03/22/2004   49
But Elena's testimony was damning
Why wouldn't she play ball
What is this, the Spanish Inquisition
How the fuck should  know
Manipulative little skank probably figured she could bleed me for some more money down the road
But 'll tell you this much, 'm gonna get those diamonds back, make her wish she was never born
Kristen's mind is racing, trying to piece together the puzzle
- Elena's airboat blasts through the reeds out into the middle of nowhere
She cuts the engine, lets the boat drift, unwraps the moldings of Jay's teeth from a cloth, as well as a marked "   /' ", looks them over one last time
Later potato
And tosses them into the mire, where they're soon gobbled by ravenous Gators
- Elena glides her airboat to a stop on the muddy banks of the trailer park, stomps over to her trailer, when she sees
Two sets of tire tracks in the mud
'  - Elena stands in her bedroom, disbelief washing over her
No sign of the newspaper articles
Her walls are barren
(sotto) Oh shit
- The diving team emerges from the locker room on their way to practice
Lagging behind is Marie
She's about to catch up when she runs smack dab into a panicked Elena
What the
If anyone sees us together
03/22/2004   50
What choice did  have
We got big problems
Before anyone can see them, Marie pulls her away, to the outdoor shower area, out of sight from her teammates
She turns on all the shower heads
Gotta be careful
Make sure no one's listening
Now what's the 411
think  fucked up
Marie gently takes a hold of Elena's face
How
don't know for sure
but  think that bitch Parole officer's made me
she was at my trailer last night
Marie smiles, pulls Elena close as the steam rises all around
No bigee
You disposed of everything, right
The teeth, the video, all the research
Elena can't fess up
Not now
did, but
She's got a hard on for me
Wants to see me back in Juvie
Marie kisses her softly on the forehead
Her cheek
won't let the big bad wolf get you promise
Elena's damp tank top clings to her perfect body
just want outta here
Marie brushes a strand of hair away from Elena's face
03/22/2004   51
Be patient
'll call the Museum Curator, have him prepare the funds to buy back the diamonds
Then we're outta here, right
mile wide smile stretches across Marie's lips
Just sit back, relax, enjoy the trip
Don't forget to come again
heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets
- Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating Marie's lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until
Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool
- Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool
She places the ring onto the deck, pulls herself out of the water
She tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with Kristen, who's picked up her ring, runs it around her fingers
Can  help you
was wondering if  could have a moment of your time
Ask a couple questions
Marie glances nervously back at the pool, where other members of the diving team go about their workout
'm in the middle of practice
It'll only take a moment, Marie
Might even help Jay
Remember your loving stepfather
You want to help him, don't you
Of course
03/22/2004   52
Kristen studies the ring for a moment, then ventures
Why'd you agree to part with your diamonds
This time Marie can't hide her shock
How
Jay told me
But why
They were your inheritance
Jay needed help
We're a team
Team Clifford
Right
It's just
You must've been pretty unhappy when Jay didn't give you those diamonds for your birthday
Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing
He said  wasn't ready
You're 18
That's heiress payday, no
Must've crossed your mind that Jay might never let you have them
No, of course not
She's a bad liar
And then this little scam artist saunters in and just takes them
With your help, no less
Kristen moves in for the kill
But what  don't get is, why wouldn't Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name
After all, she'd gotten what she wanted
How should  know
03/22/2004   53
Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the ring against the back of her hand
Hard
Winces, then
mean, the only way  can make sense of it is if somehow getting Jay released from prison would spoil the plan
What plan
She hands the ring back to Marie
Not so lucky anymore
You tell me
- Chad strolls gingerly down the hallway, opens the door to the forensics lab, freezing when he sees
- Kristen, waiting patiently for him
Miss
Richards
Is
Is there something can do for you
was wondering if you'd do me the favor of running a quick test
Uh, sure,  guess
Whatcha got for me
She hands him the Blue Pill she found in Elena's trailer
Could you tell me what this is
Chad tries to keep his cool
No problemo
It'll only take a minute
While Chad goes about his work, Kristen begins nosing around the office
Chad looks over his shoulder
Be careful,  got lots of evidence here
She starts flipping through
03/22/2004   54
Are these the evidence photos from the Elena Sandoval rape
They are, but
Ever find out what caused these markings
She holds up the photograph of the four circular indentations the Judge questioned Chad about in court
Like  told the Judge,  guess they're finger nail markings
They don't look like finger nail markings to me
They look more like this
She holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the indentation with Marie's ring
Would you say these markings are the same
-where did you get that
Kristen smiles
Marie gave it to me
But you already knew that, didn't you, Doc
Chad has no answer to that
He can only blink stupidly and pray his silence doesn't incriminate him further
Kristen heads for the door
(calling after) The pill
It's Rohypnol
Uh, Roofies
Been there
Done that
- The massive front door swings open and Marie crosses the foyer, and is about to ascend the magnificent staircases when she hears the clanking of glass coming from the kitchen
03/22/2004   55
Her heart is in her throat as she calls out
Hello
No answer
-  - Marie enters the lavish kitchen, stops in her tracks when she sees Chad standing at the full bar, mixing the strongest drink known to man
What the hell, Chad
Chad fidgets nervously
That parole officer was sniffin' around today
Marie scoffs, steps up to the bar, gets in Chad's face
Not you too
She's just trying to prove her worthless excuse for an existence
She doesn't have a thing on us
Yeah, but she's askin' the right questions
It's only a matter of time
We gotta make our move
Marie shakes her head, resolute
No
We stick to the plan
Give the Curator time to come up with the money
Chad's trembling hands pour the drink, most of the liquid making it in to two
We gotta move fast, keep the heat off
You can't take the heat, get outta the kitchen
wanna see 'em
The diamonds
Make sure they're safe
56
They're safe
She downs half the drink in one giant gulp
just wanna see 'em
thought we were supposed to be partners here
Chad's trembling, looking like he could lose it at any second
You're gonna be the death of me
She slugs the rest of the drink, strides away and Chad follows like a lapdog
- '  - Nothing's been touched in Jay's office, the drops of blood the Cubans extracted from his thumb as a warning stain the white carpet black
Marie walks over to his desk, opens a draw
Removes a metallic lock box
Open it
wanna see those puppies
Marie rolls her eyes, takes a key from a delicate chain around her neck and fumbles with the lock
Finally she opens the box, revealing the Mother-Daughter diamonds, resting on velvet lining
The sparkling diamonds seem to have a calming effect on Chad
He stops shaking, his voice becoming more steady
called the museum
The deal's goin' down tomorrow
8 am
Marie stumbles as she takes a step toward him
What did you
She looks to the empty glass in her hand, then begins to sway, watching in horror as Chad drops the diamonds into his pocket
'm sorry, okay
But it's not like  had a choice
03/22/2004    57
Marie falls flat on her face, her world crashing to
: - The blinding morning sunlight climbs the horizon, the still water of the endless swampland glistening like diamonds
Elena sits out on her idling airboat, in the midst of the sawgrass, smoking
The peace is shattered by her ringing Yello
- '  - Marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear, rubbing her aching head, slowly getting her wits back
Nothing like good old fashioned vengeful rage to combat a nasty hangover
(into phone) Chad fucked us
(
) (deadpan) know
was there
No,  mean he really fucked us
He drugged me an' took the diamonds
- Elena stands on the edge of the airboat, fear rising in her
ell me you're kidding
(
) Yeah, it's all a big joke
He stole the diamonds
Elena lets out an anguished wail
(
) Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as it is
We've gotta stop him
03/22/2004   58
-  - Marie's fevered mind is racing as she glances at the wall clock
7:30
Finally a desperate plan scratches its way to the surface
He's heading to the museum, got himself an 8am meeting
(
) He's gonna sell the diamonds
Not if we find him first
- The deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass, speeding across the endless swampland expanse
Elena expertly maneuvers the machine, the wind racing through her hair
- Chad's speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty  bangs down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees
Every hundred feet or so, the road runs parallel with the water, then cuts back into the trees
had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him
He does a double take just as the road disappears back into the trees
That wasn't
it couldn't be, could it
The winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and Chad's worst fears come true
Elena's racing along side of him in the , fighting to keep up
Pull over
'  - The road runs parallel to the swamp again and Chad's eyes nearly burst from their sockets as he sees the airboat now alongside him, matching his speed
Give us back the diamonds
Chad's heart stops
Us
03/22/2004   59
He spins round, looks straight ahead at the He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's shoots past, missing his car by inches
'  - Marie slams on her brakes, brings her  to a skidding halt on the dirt road
She looks back over her shoulder, at the swaying Melaluca trees
No sign of Chad's car
- Elena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side, leaps into the reeds and clambers up to the dirt road
There's no sign of Chad's car, just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed through
Marie comes running up to join Elena, a tire iron in hand
(sternly) We're not hurting him, Marie, got it
We just get the diamonds back
'm not gonna hurt him
No way
Marie stalks down the path Chad's car took off the dirt road
'm gonna kill him
Elena's breath catches in her throat
Marie disappears into the trees and she's alone, out on the deserted swamp road
Marie
Don't do this
She hears a scream, a girl's scream
Marie
Elena sprints into the thick of the trees
03/22/2004   60
- Kristen is sitting at Detective Morrison's cluttered desk, her brow furrowed as she shuffles through the stack of newspaper articles she pulled from Elena's wall
Morrison stands in the doorway, watching her
You look like you could use a drink
Kristen looks up from the articles, into Morrison's smiling face
She smiles back
When this is all over, 'd like that
Morrison turns and walks right into a suit with an  badge identifying him as
The buzzcut agent drops at Morrison's feet
More Black Widow leads
need you to put them in the evidence locker, Morrison
That's not my job, Agent Dammers
It is now
- Marie is standing in a clearing, staring at Chad's wrecked car, at the top of a small slope, wrapped around a Melaluca tree like a Christmas present
Her piercing screams force Elena to come running
You okay
Marie stops screaming, her face contorting in anger
No, 'm pretty damn far from okay
She points to the front seat of the crashed car
Elena can barely bring herself to look inside
Marie shoves her in the back, pushing her towards the open driver's side door
Elena gasps when she looks inside the car
Chad's not there
03/22/2004   61
He bolted
Marie clambers up the wreckage of the car, stands on the roof
She surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is
With the diamonds
- Morrison grumbles as he scans his key card, opening the wire mesh door to the evidence locker
He picks up a box and enters, Kristen, also carrying a box, a step behind
appreciate the help
Right back at ya
Morrison blushes as he absently adds the boxes to the groaning shelves stuffed with Black Widow evidence
Kristen notices the bundles of cash stored in and amongst the Black Widow evidence
You could have a helluva holiday on that money
Recovered from the Black Widow's last score
If 'd gotten to the scene just five minutes earlier,  woulda gotten her as well
Morrison shakes his head, ruefully, when a sudden sharp beeping has Kristen reaching into her pocket, fishing out a handheld
What the hell
red flashing dot moves quickly in the middle of the map
Elena
- Elena runs full pelt after Marie, through dense swampland, the plastic ankle bracelet around her leg silently flashing red
03/22/2004   62
Chad
There's nowhere to run to, you little weasel
She swings around, finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of the ashen tree trunks
Gotcha
She races off in hot pursuit
Elena's about to follow when she notices the red light flashing on her ankle bracelet
This can't be happening
Marie slows, looks back to Elena
What now
'm more than five miles away from the Police station
go beyond five miles and the alarm goes off
Marie snarls
You telling me your Parole Officer knows you're out here
Elena can barely speak
She knows
- Chad's face is drained of color as he runs through the dense swampland, hugging the priceless diamonds
Sweat cascades from his brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body swirl in the stagnant waters
Most gruesome of all is a broken   embedded in his right leg
As the water gets knee-deep, the last of Chad's reserve energy goes
He collapses in the stagnant marsh
Not far off,  circle
It's only a matter of time before they notice the blood in the water
03/22/2004   63
- The small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland
Elena steps into the water, her Ankle Bracelet
Call it off, Marie
We gotta go or she'll find us here
splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls
You hear that
The sound echoes off the dense trees
Marie points left
You go that way
Marie heads off in the opposite direction
Elena hesitates, wants to follow, but does as she's told, and goes left, soon enveloped by canopy of trees
'  - Kristen blasts down the Blue Bay streets, a siren in the windshield blaring
The handheld  continues to monitor Elena's exact position in the midst of the swamp
- Elena stumbles through the thick, stagnant water, scouring the horizon for any sign of Chad
(sotto) Please
rustling sound stops her in her tracks
Dead silence, until
,     , - Marie hacks her way through the overgrown foliage with the tire iron, like a Prada clad big-game hunter
(calling out to Elena) You see him
03/22/2004   64
No reply, just her own voice echoing back
Elena
She rolls her eyes
Useless bitch
- Kristen's unmarked car races across the desolate swamp road
'  - She checks the flashing  signal
Getting closer
- Elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water, gasps for breath
Looking down she sees Chad, holding on to her like his life depends on it
It does
He pulls her back down into the water, just as she catches a glance of the circling
Using her as leverage, Chad pulls himself out of the swamp, climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid ground
Elena coughs and splutters, floundering in the blood soaked water
The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy
Don't move
Don't splash, they can sense you in the water, they'll rip you to pieces
Elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill
Hel
help me
She reaches out a hand to Chad, only a few feet away
e hesitates, then reaches out to her
But stops short of grabbing her trembling hand
Just balls his fist, squeezing every last drop of blood out of the open wounds on his palm
The dark blood cascades down into the water around Elena
65
No
And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws
Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose, ears and mouth
He falls forward, stiff as a board, and down into the water next to an apoplectic Elena
Behind him stands Marie, the    in hand
Marie reaches out a hand, pulls Elena out of the water
She collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air
What are you doing
Our diamonds are about to become dinner
Elena can't move, leaving Marie to wade into the swamp
- Kristen approaches a fork in the swamp road at high speed
She checks the  scanner
It doesn't show her which way to turn
Which way, which way
Split second decision
Left
She spins the wheel, takes the left hand fork
Bad choice
Just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned , an idle airboat, a crashed car, one dead man and two wild, wild things
- Elena and Marie, soaked to the bone, drag Chad's cold, dead corpse out of the trees
Marie drops the body, heads straight for her abandoned
Elena follows, stumbling through the vines, her clothes dripping wet, shivering more from nerves than cold
Get rid of the body
And his car
Where are you going
Where do you think
66
don't
don't have a clue
Marie spins round, a vicious look in her eyes
She holds the blood soaked diamonds in her hand
Chad made us an appointment to sell these
'm gonna keep it
Elena looks down to her flashing ankle bracelet
It's only a matter of time before my Parole Officer finds me
Marie turns back around, flings open the  door and gets in
Then  suggest you get to work
She fires up the powerful engine, speeds away in a cloud of dust, leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life
'   - Elena struggles to drag Chad's bloody body back to his crashed car
The tail lights flicker, throwing an ominous red glow over the dense thicket of overhanging trees
(sotto) Jesus
With a Herculean effort she manages to stuff Chad's inert body into the driver's seat
She stumbles back, horrified at the grim tableau before her
- Marie's car comes barreling into the parking lot outside the stone Museum building
- The Curator paces back and forth, like an expectant father, in front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds
Marie bursts into the Museum, and he strides up to meet her, shocked when he sees Marie's covered in blood, sweat and guilt
Marie
Are you alright
03/22/2004   67
Never better
Got the money
The Curator nods nervously
convinced the board of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding
Good
he fishes in her bag for the diamonds
received a call from your 'associate'
He said he would be handling the transaction
Change of plans
My 'associate' got tied up at work
Completely swamped
The Curator nods, unsure if he inquire further
Marie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag, thrusts them at the Curator
He screws up his wrinkled face, afraid to touch them
Calm down
It's just blood
'  - With trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car
She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground
She carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match
She can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in fear
Finally she pulls out a , still sopping wet from the swamp
She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until, finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then smoulders out
Don't do this to me, please
03/22/2004   68
In frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately for a lighter, climbing all the way in
Because of the slight slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her
Elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove compartment
You gotta have a lighter or some
She's cut off as the  '
Deafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth
Elena's heart skips a beat
Chad's corpse has slumped forward against the steering wheel
Jesus
She struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the horn
ilence reigns once more
Elena takes short, sharp breaths
Looks over at Chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the driver's side door
'm sorry
'm so sorry
Not as sorry as she's going to be
The match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to smoulder for a second, then
- The Curator carefully examines the diamond, turning it over and over in his hands
Marie stands over him, impatiently tapping her muddy shoe on the marble floor
So
'm not sure
Can you get the cash or not
The Curator looks up to her, bemused
can get the cash
it's just
03/22/2004   69
Marie smiles a wicked grin
Then let's have those dead presidents
'  - The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car
Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes
Satisfied, she turns to get out, only to find the passenger side door
She tries the handle
Tries it again
Desperately yanks it
Not opening, no sir
Elena looks over, see Chad's limp elbow on the door lock
The small brush fire reaches the pooled gasoline and
Elena can't help but hear the unmistakable sound of Through the smashed rear window she sees the line of racing towards the car she's trapped in
She reaches over, clawing her way past Chad's corpse, trying to reach the door lock
Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable to pull it up
's  towards the crashed car, only a few feet away
Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face
The line of fire hits the crashed car, and  it instantly
Bright   cover the wreckage
- The Curator carefully sets down the diamonds on the marble floor
Marie looks at him like he's mad
What the hell are you doing
03/22/2004   70
One last test
The Curator hovers his heel over the biggest Diamond
Marie screams out
He slams his foot down and the
'   - Elena  as the passenger side window next to her , into a million glass fragments
Hands reach in and grab her, pulling her through the
Seconds later Elena finds herself on the swamp floor, in Kristen's singed arms
You okay
Elena can barely talk, looking back at the flaming wreckage in front of her
Care to explain
It was
it was an accident
The flames reflect in her tear-filled eyes
- Marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds, in a million tiny pieces on the museum's marble floor
Fakes, 'm afraid
Made of glass
Can't believe they were our top attraction all these years
Every muscle in Marie's body contracts
She stands before the empty diamond exhibit case, runs her fingers over the portrait of her mother cradling her as a baby
That's my inheritance is it, Mom
Goddamn Christmas ornaments
03/22/2004   71
And as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from the case and tears it to shreds
Marie, please
There's no stopping her now
Red-faced, she lashes out at the display case with a devastating kick, the glass
Marie, stop this instant
She continues her rampage regardless, ripping a from the wall and hurling it through another display case
hate you, Mom
'm glad you're dead
- Storm clouds gather over the whitewashed Police station
- Elena sits with her head in her hands, across from Kristen in an anonymous interview room
told you
Elena looks up, tears streaking her mascara
Told me what
That if you were telling the truth 'd back you all the way
If you lied to me there'd be trouble
Elena slumps back down, her head on the table
Chad swerved off the road,  swear
Just swerved for no reason
Just decided to take a shortcut through the swamp
Elena sobs, can't look Kristen in the eye
It was an accident
03/22/2004   72
The door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer  in his hands
Accident my ass
He flips the pages of the report
Forensics finds the head trauma that killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a single blow from behind
lena looks up, through Panda eyes
The crash
He
he hit his head
Was that before or after you dragged him through the swamp
Elena has no answers as Morrison takes the cuffs from his belt, snaps them on Elena's wrists
You got the right to remain silent, which in your case is probably best, cos of the shit you come up with
Kristen stands up, shaking her head
That's two strikes, Elena
One more and you're out
Elena looks at her pleadingly
'll do whatever you want
Kristen stops
Thinks for a moment
Nods to Morrison as he drags Elena to her feet
Yeah
Yeah you will
'll tell you the truth
'll tell you what happened
She killed him, and took the diamonds
Marie, it was Marie Clifford
03/22/2004   73
Morrison just sneers
Keep bleeting, Missy
All the way to the Judge
think its time he heard the truth about Jay Clifford's accuser
Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be cleared, you know that
You need Marie, you need the proof they set him up
Morrison considers this
You came so close to nailing the Black Widow, don't let this slip through your fingers, Detective
He's about to speak, when Elena's cell phone rings
Kristen takes it from Elena, looks at the  , sees Marie's name
Speak of the Devil
She holds the phone up
You're gonna answer it
And you're gonna say that everything went fine
No one found Chad's body
The plan's still on
Do you understand me
Elena nods slowly
Morrison turns to Kristen
You thinking what 'm thinking
risten's patient with him
This is your chance
Feds can't take this one from you
Morrison weighs his options, then finally nods
Kristen clicks the phone , holds it to Elena's ear
Yello
03/22/2004   74
'  - Marie speeds wildly down the deserted Blue Bay streets, one trembling hand holding a cigarette, the other her cellphone
( ) The diamonds are fakes
Totally worthless
(
) No
That can't be true
Believe it
'm leaving
Tonight
(
) You can't
what about
me
Marie takes a long drag from her cigarette
Don't you understand
There's no money
Nothing
Zip
Zilch
Zero
How am supposed to take care of your broke ass
- Kristen is listening in on the whole conversation
She cups her hand over the phone, whispers to Elena
Tell her she has to meet you
Tell her she can't leave
Elena nods and Kristen puts the phone back to her lips
gotta see you
(
) 'll send you a photo
Please
Just one last time
(
) 'm gone, gone, gonski
Elena's reeling
Kristen motions for her to continue
think maybe
maybe there's a way we could still get some money
03/22/2004   75
Silence on the end of the line
'  - Marie considers this for a long moment
Finally
Okay, talk
(
) Not over the phone
We gotta meet
School swimming pool
One hour
- Click
She's hung up
Kristen nods to Morrison
Where'd you keep the wire taps
Evidence locker
Gimme the key
He tosses her his electronic keycard
- The Blue Bay High pool is illuminated in the dead of night, casting blue ripples over the bleachers where Elena waits nervously
She can't help but fiddle with the wire hidden beneath her shirt
(whispering) Can you hear me
'  - Morrison listens nervously to Elena's tinny voice coming in through the speaker
(
) Is this thing working
The Detective shoots Kristen a concerned look
She's gonna blow it
03/22/2004   76
- Elena adjusts the mic taped to her chest, wincing as the tape pulls her delicate skin
don't think  can do this
(
) It's already done
Elena looks up guiltily
Marie is standing by the side of the pool
How much did she see
So
The word's stick in Elena's throat
had no choice
Blah, blah, blah
Get over it
He's dead
Now you told me you had a plan
Spit it out
Jay's got cash
At the building site saw it
Marie rolls her eyes
That's your brilliant plan
It's in a safe, dumb ass
You a safecracker
Have you got magic fingers, gonna pick that lock
don't think so
Next
'  - Kristen winces as she listens to the girls' conversation
(
) (through the speakers) We're gonna go to Jay
Tell him what we did
(
) Like hell we are
03/22/2004   77
- Elena walks down the bleachers, approaching a skeptical Marie
Listen to me
We go to the jail, tell him we'll come clean, tell the police everything, if he gives us the combination
'm still a minor, they'll send me back to Juvie
Shit,  could do that time standing on my head
Marie's wavering
How much money
Elena reaches Marie, puts her hands on her hips
Enough for you and me
Grinds against her
Slowly, sensually
We don't have to tell the cops anything
We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking
But, we got rid of the real one
kept a copy
Never trusted you backstabbers
Elena tries to pull away, but Marie drags her back until their faces are inches apart
You're trembling
There's no denying it
Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's face, down her neck, to her chest
So close to the wire
Finally places her palm over Elena's heart
Marie,
Ssshhhh
,  ,
03/22/2004   78
'  - Morrison and Kristen listen intently in their headphones, unable to breath
- Elena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity, unblinking
,  ,
Finally Marie smiles
Alright
Let's do it
- Jay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by an inch of bullet proof glass
Theo stands by the door
Well, well, well
Who'd have thought
What a pleasant surprise
guess you guys have kissed and made up
Very funny
Did you know the diamonds were fakes
Jay nods slowly
Your Mom hocked them years ago
Boozed it all away
You already know the end of her sorry story
Marie's jaw tightens
Jay leans back
So, to what do  owe the pleasure
We want money
Whatever you've got in your safe at the beach condos
Jay bursts out laughing again
Of course you do
Of course you do
03/22/2004    79
We'll get you out of here
Jay stops laughing, leans back in to the inch thick glass
You will
Marie holds up a
Is that what  think it is
You give us the combination and this goes in the nearest mail box, tied with a pretty pink bow
How do  know it's the real tape
You're gonna have to trust us
've been down that road before
Marie opens the cassette housing, ready to rip the tape apart
This is non-negotiable
Theo interjects
Sir, we have no grounds for appeal
This could be our only chance
What's the combination
The tortured screams of inmates echo in Jay's ears
can't
No such word as 'can't'
puts a massive hand on Jay's shoulder
Time's up, Mr
Clifford
03/22/2004   80
Jay sighs
(to Marie) Fine
08-20-99
Marie shakes her head
The combination's the day Mom died, you sick fuck
Jay's led away in shackles
- Marie's  flies down the deserted Blue Bay streets, blasting through red lights
'  - Marie handles the car like a Formula One driver, and with twice the intensity
The -force pins Elena back against the seat
Slow down
Marie steps on the gas
We're in a world of shit
Marie steps on the gas
We'll never get away with this
You know that don't you
Marie steps on the gas
She ain't saying a word, and time's running out for Elena
'   - Morrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving
Kristen stays focused on the one-sided conversation in her headphones
Come on, Elena
Keep pushing
03/22/2004   81
- Marie's  screeches to a stop outside the beachfront condos, and Marie strides towards the construction site entrance
Elena gets out the car, feeling decidedly sick
She circuitously adjusts the microphone taped to her chest, then follows Marie into the dark, unfinished building '  - Marie enters the makeshift office like a wolf stalking her prey, heading straight for the safe
With a rock steady hand, she works the lock
One down
- Morrison brings his clunky Police sedan to a halt around the back of the building site
'  - Kristen listens intently to the live feed
(
) (over headphones) Marie
Please,  can't do this
'  - Marie's working the safe combination like a master thief, spinning it nimbly between her buffed nails
Two down
Elena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips
told you not to kill Chad
'll tell it to the police
Marie doesn't even look round, concentrating on the job at hand
Elena's reeling
03/22/2004   82
'll tell 'em you made me lie about your stepfather raping me, made me perjure myself on the stand, went and killed Chad, and now
(sotto) 99
very good year
Third and final tumbler falls
The safe door swings open, revealing a  of  and Jay's
'  - Kristen shakes her head
It's hopeless, Elena can't get Marie to say an incriminating word
This has gotta end
It's gonna end
One way or another
'  - Marie pulls out a wad of crisp, clean bills, draws them across her nose like a wine connoisseur
Money
Always in style
She dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face
Why'd you do it
Why'd Chad have to die
Marie slides up against Elena, fluttering the cash over her in the world's most expensive shower
Elena couldn't be less interested, focused on getting that confession
You killed him, Marie
You murdered him in cold blood
Marie presses up against Elena, pushing her up against the unfinished dry wall
Kisses her passionately, finally silencing her for a few, brief, electric seconds
And when she pulls away her fingers dance down Elena's shirt until
he rips the microphone from Elena's chest
Stands there with the dangling cord in her hands, her face caught in a permanent snarl
The blood drains from Elena's face
03/22/2004   83
'   - piercing feedback forces Kristen to throw aside the headphones
She looks to Morrison
She's been made
Morrison draws his gun
Stay here
Kristen shakes her head resolutely
got us into this
echoes in the darkness
Just stay in the car
Please
Morrison sprints over to the building site, leaving Kristen in the car, alone
'  - Elena stands with her hands up, an ugly bullet hole in the wall just beside her
Marie keeps Jay's gun trained on her as she unloads the cash from the safe
You stupid fucking Sherbert
You think you could sell me out
They made me do it
Morrison doesn't know his prick from a pogo stick
And that bitch Parole Officer, she hasn't got the balls for this
Marie takes dead aim once more
Please, don't
Marie's finger tightens on the trigger
'   - 03/22/2004     84
Kristen tenses as the gunshot echoes throughout the construction site
She reaches across to the driver's seat, grabs the - Elena scrambles across the concrete floor, desperately trying to make it to the relative safety of one of the support pillars
She sees the forensic  light switch on the floor, reaches for it
stands in the shattered doorway, surveys the expansive, unfinished floor
Is about to unleash a hail of bullets when
The   flicker out, replaced by the eerie scattered around the unfinished floor
Bathed in the florescent blue glow of the lights, Elena scrambles to safety behind a pillar
Her shirt , her eyes like beacons
Sweeps through the second floor, meticulously checking every corner, every shadow
Runs towards the unfinished building, looking up to the  glow on the fourth floor
She sprints for the
scours the bizarre darkness, hears a sound
The orange muzzle flash illuminates the floor briefly as Marie shoots randomly
The flimsy plaster walls
Enters the third floor from the fire escape, continues his meticulous sweep of the building
Stands in the industrial elevator, jabbing the 4th floor button, hyperventilating as more gunshots
She clutches Morrison's shotgun to her chest, getting closer to the top floor
shields herself as plaster rains down on her, unable to see through the cloud of dust under the  lights, until
03/22/2004   85
bullet sparks off rebar inches from her foot
She looks up to see the barrel of Jay's gun
Marie's face is contorted maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger
Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening rings out
Followed by
He rips open the fourth floor fire door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic sheeting until he finds himself under the  glow
hick plumes of blood, black under the  light, stain the walls and floor
He sees Elena, in a fetal ball, trembling uncontrollably
Beside her, Marie lies dead, her chest a gaping crimson mess, Jay's gun still clutched tightly in her cold, dead hands
Kristen looks up at him, almost too shocked to speak
Morrison's shotgun is still smoking in her hands
didn't have a choice
She was gonna kill Elena
Morrison steps forward, calmly, takes the gun from her
It's gonna be okay
- The new crime scene is alive with activity
Cops, reporters, bystanders
Morrison sips coffee as  wheel Marie's corpse to the ambulance
One of them hands something to Morrison
blood-splattered digital video tape
We found this on the body
Morrison takes it without a word
(
) Just got off the phone with the Parole board
Morrison turns around, sees Kristen approaching, still visibly shaken
03/22/2004    86
They want me to bring Elena back to Miami in the morning
She hesitates
'm
sorry for this whole mess
Morrison considers this, picks his words carefully
Don't be
It was my gun that fired the shots, so it must've been me who pulled the trigger
'll take the credit on this one
After all the Black widow crap  had to put up with, 've earnt it
Kristen nods
You did the right thing
We did the right thing
risten smiles, almost, moves in, and wraps her arms around the Detective
He closes his eyes, savors the moment
As she pulls away, she hands him a card
You call me, promise
Morrison beams
will
will
Now that this is all over, maybe we can have that drink soon
She leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips
Morrison watches her walk away
In spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of Blue Bay
- Morrison's unmarked Sedan idles outside the barbed wire fences of the County Jail
The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight
03/22/2004   87
Morrison gets out of the car, meets Jay
How you holdin' up, Jay
Been better
He sure has
So what's next
No idea
Everything's gone
Repossessed
Guess there's nowhere to go but up
It's all he can do to keep from breaking down
can't help but feel partially responsible
If there's anything
Jay shakes his head
don't think so, but thanks
Can  at least give you a ride somewhere
Ain't got nowhere to go
Morrison watches sadly as Jay stumbles past him, walking to nowhere in particular
(hopeful) but up, right
No reply
The Detective heads back to his car, stops for a second, reaches into his pocket and pulls out Kristen's already-dog eared card
He can't resist
Dials the number After four rings there's no message
Just a
(into phone) Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again
Haven't heard from you
Hope you're doing okay
Everything's fine here
03/22/2004   88
(') Haven't been any questions asked that can't answer, an' no one's brought your name up
So give me a call back and maybe we can go for that drink
e's cut off by
The mail box you are trying to reach is full
Your message has been deleted
Morrison's disconnected
Puzzled, he gets into his car
- Morrison gets the shock of his life when he enters the usually quiet police station and finds himself in the midst of utter pandemonium
Federal Officers are everywhere
He tries to pick his way through the crowd when he's intercepted by Officer Entwistle
You better come with me, Detective
- '  - Entwistle leads Morrison into his office, where Agent Dammers sits behind his desk
Detective Morrison
So good to finally see you
What the hell, Dammers
should be asking you the same question
- Morrison stands in the middle of the evidence locker, dumbfounded
Dammers watches him, his arms crossed
It's
gone
That's right, Morrison
Every last bit of evidence from the Black Widow case
03/22/2004   89
(') Not to mention the money you confiscated
All $427,000
But how
was hoping you'd be able to answer that question
What in God's name are you talking about
didn't have anything to do with it
Well, your key card was the last one that opened this locker
Morrison's heart is beating a mile a minute
Holy shit
Kristen
- sits behind a sparse desk when the phone rings
ade County Parole
How can  direct your call
- Morrison paces back and forth, on the phone, as Dammers watches, not saying a word
(into phone) This is Detective Morrison, Blue Bay
was wondering if you had a forwarding number for Kristen Richards
(
) Who
Kristen Richards
She's one of your officers
Has cases up here in Blue Bay
- The receptionist's fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in front of her
90
'm sorry, Detective
There's no one here by that name
No, of course there is
worked with her personally
have no record of a Kristen Richards ever working here
Besides, Blue Bay's out of our jurisdiction
- Morrison struggles to control his emotions
Oh no
No, no, no
- Soft waves lap against a pristine beach
Palm trees sway in the warm breeze
steady  is the only sound that disturbs the serenity
Is it a lawn mower
leaf blower
There's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this idyllic scene
The swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical Caribbean Sunlight
And stretched out on a recliner in the sheerest of bikinis is none other than Kristen Richards, soaking up rays
At her side is a  , and between sips from a pina colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped in red ink
Kristen looks over at Elena, equally stunning in a matching bikini
can't believe Morrison just handed me the key to the evidence locker
broad grin stretches across her lips as Elena empties the contents of a velvet pouch onto a table
he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight
These are
genuine
Elena nods
03/22/2004   91
Nothin' like the real thing
Switched 'em for the fakes right after Marie tried to pay me off
They're
So beautiful
Elena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to Kristen
The mother
Kristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to Elena
The daughter
- Morrison paces the infamous crime scene, at wit's end
Dammers stands off to the side, just watching him with a bemused look etched across his face
She was the Black Widow
Her and that little
He tries to think of an appropriate slur for Elena
Can't come up with anything, continues pacing frantically
Played me like a fool
Dammers shrugs
Hind sight's 20-20
No need to be so hard on yourself, Morrison
(beat, smile) That's my job
You smug son of a bitch
It's not like you knew who she was anymore than  did
Dammers nods slowly
That's the God's honest truth
But at least  didn't give her my evidence locker keycard
03/22/2004   92
(') And  didn't lie about who fired the shots that killed the Clifford kid
Morrison's heart sinks
He looks like he's going to faint
Steadies himself, placing both hands against the wall, just as Jay did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago
- Dammers leads Morrison to his awaiting car
They pass
Barajas and Cicatriz
Mr
Barajas is in his usual foul mood
Un pinche sink hole
No lo puedo creer
Morrison stops, regards Barajas
What did you say
The foundation is sinking
The entire site is a sink hole
It's completely worthless
'm going to kill Jay Clifford
You and me both
- Elena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the sun, when a voice rouses them
(
) Poor Detective Morrison
It's hard to do that to a friend
Especially one going through such a nasty divorce
They look up to see Jay, standing before them in a pair of colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini
Told me he'd never trust another woman as long as he lived
And then along came a spider
black widow
Jay glances at Elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink
03/22/2004   93
More like widows
Gotta say  was a little taken aback when you wanted to snuff Marie, but you know what, 'm over the bitch
Elena suddenly gets to her feet
You want me to top you off
That'd be fine, just fine
He hands Elena his empty glass, then kisses Kristen tenderly
When they break
She's got a good head on her shoulders
Kristen doesn't reply
Just smiles, watches Elena over by the outside bar, mixing Jay's drink
You two got me out of a mountain of shit, 'll tell you that
Craziest Goddamn scheme 've ever heard of
But hell, you played it perfectly
My job was easy
It was Elena who had to keep it all together
(
) We've had some practice along the way
Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink
Here you go, Mr
Clifford
Jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off to the swimming pool
Well, all that nasty business, it's behind us
Forever
From here on out, it's the good life
He starts to climb the high dive
When he gets to the top, he looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles
03/22/2004   94
You two look so good, it's difficult to tell which one's the mother and which one's the daughter
Kristen calls back up at him
That's just the roofies talking
Says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for Jay to register the sinister implications
What did you say
His eyes are blood shot
He starts to sway atop the high dive
Delta Chi, class of '88
Hellova party
'd never really tasted cocktails like that
Jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform
don't
whattya talking about
It was like being awake though an operation
could feel everything happening, but  couldn't do anything to stop it
Oh
shit
You took something from me that night
But you left something behind
Jay's head is spinning as he looks to Kristen, to Elena
Your daughter
He can't quite get his mind around it
Everything's becoming blurry
don't remember
03/22/2004   95
He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below, shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds
lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him
You may not remember
broad grin stretches across Elena's lips as she finishes
But you'll never forget
Jay tries to take a step forward
He stumbles
Tries in vain to regain his balance
It's too late
He falls
20 feet to the unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with vegetable soup
Nice take off
Gotta work on the landing
They stand back, watching Jay's pancaked body draining its precious blood into the ice blue pool
Let's go get our money
They gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson red
As the credits roll
- An anonymous, luxurious office
fat, balding, semi-conscious lies curled up on the floor as Elena, half undressed and wearing a black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse
There's a crackle on her -
(
) We got problems
From outside, she can hear the wailing of
Getting closer
Almost done here
(
) Leave it
Come on
96
Elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her pocket for good measure
(
) He gonna be able to make an
Elena glances at the Man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over like a jelly donut
Not on your life
gave him enough roofies to make an elephant forget
- Elena gets into a waiting car outside the bank
The getaway driver
Kristen, of course
can't believe we just gave up all that cash
Forget it
The Black Widow's finally got an angle on our real prey
We goin' to Blue Bay
He won't know what hit him
smile crosses Elena's perfect lips
'bout time
And the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank
- '  - Jay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his unfinished office
(
) That's an awful lot of money
Jay spins round, flabbergasted that someone's watching him
Who the hell
03/22/2004   97
Not enough though
Gonna need those Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this disaster
What
What the hell do you mean
Kristen calmly reaches into her purse, pulls out a handful of marbles
Throws them onto the ground, letting them roll towards Jay
ut they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a small circle, until they come to rest in the middle of the concrete floor
The building's built on a sink hole, Jay
You know it, and  know it
Gonna need to think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans off your back
Jay's tiny mind can't take it all in
How'd you
how'd you know all this
It's what we do
We
Elena walks seductively into the unfinished office
It's on
- Marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool, looking at her Mother's soon-to-be-diamond ring through teary eyes
just want what's mine
Elena stalks the bleachers behind her
The diamonds are your inheritance
You deserve them
My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me the Goddamn key
03/22/2004   98
Elena jumps down the bleachers, sits down next to Marie
So you take it, one way or another
'  - Behind closed doors, Chad's completing yet another dubious transaction, handing over a bag of roofies
The buyer this time
Marie
You take a check
Money talks, bullshit walks
got strippers to feed
Marie fishes out the money from her purse
How'd you like to make some real cash
Chad likes the sound of that
And it's that simple
- Chad uses Jay's teeth mouldings to bite Elena, as Marie trains Jay's video camera on her, wailing on her in a drunken stupor
Hey, that hurt
Shut it, bitch
No pain, no gain
Elena's face is pressed against the concrete wall
- Chad sits at his video console, all alone, expertly manipulating the audio and video footage
We'll put you right here, and
Chad presses play
On the video screen a frightened Elena is huddled against the wall
03/22/2004   99
(
) 'mon now baby, you can do it
'  - Elena watches as Marie and Theo drive away, then turns to the glistening Mother Daughter diamonds
She opens a case with two identical  , and replaces the diamonds
All the while, Uncle Marty  his head off
(to Uncle Marty, irritated) Will you knock that off
They're gone
Uncle Marty's eyes snap open
- Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their sizzling bodies
You're blocking our sun
Looks over her sunglasses at
Uncle Marty
Only all cleaned up, in a pair of Bermuda shorts that show off his milky white legs
He clutches a briefcase
Ladies
Hellova job back there
Your best ever if  might be so bold
This is our biggest score
You sure you can move it
Not a problem
Kristen nods to the briefcase in Uncle Marty's hand
Let's see the green
Uncle Marty lays the case down on the lounger, opens it, revealing stacks of cash
Got another lead, if you're interested
Was just up in Boston, surveying a mansion that's just been sold
03/22/2004   100
(') Termites already eaten most of it
Owner's shitting bricks
There's gotta be an angle for the Black Widows
Kristen and Elena look to each other
It's over
We had a good run
Uncle Marty shrugs
Shame
Guess all good things come to an end
So, the diamonds
Elena reaches down, pulls the diamonds from the sand
Hands them over and is about to take the case of money when
How do  know these are the real thing
Elena looks to Kristen
They smile
You're going to have to trust us
Like fuck
