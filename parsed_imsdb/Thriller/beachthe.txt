The Beach The Beach Written by John Hodge Based on the Novel by Alex Garland Figment Films ltd
15 June 1998 single headlamp in close up shines directly and brightly out Extreme noise and light
Beyond its glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle ("tuk-tud") and its Thai driver young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him, swaying with the motion of the vehicle
He is worn and sweating
They travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, road works, food vendors, dogs, tourists
Music and credits
The bright headlight comes to a halt
Richard climbs down from the tuk-tuk (
) When you hit Bangkok, there's really only one place to go
The street is busy, full of Thai's and travelers
Richard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his back
He absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, and the shops and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, travel tickets, and international phone calls
Restaurantes are filled with western travelers watching American films or European sport
(
) (continuing) The Khao San Road is a decompression chamber between east and west
It's where you learn to breathe car fumes and tropical air for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange your memories before you catch your flight home
Richard is approached by a young male Thai Hustler who walks backwards in front of him while making his pitch
You need somewhere to stay
'll be , Thanks
Richard politely ignores each of his subsequent offers
What do you want
Sell your passport
Buy passport
Airline tickets
You want silk
'll take you to the best silk place
You get a suit in twenty-four hours
Diamonds
You want to come with me, you get present for your girlfriend
Maybe no girlfriend
You want a girl, no problem
Good time
Boy girl fucking no problem
You want to drink some snake blood
At this last one Richard stops and addresses the Hustler
No thanks
Richard walks on, the hustler fading out behind him
You want designer clothes
get you Versache, Gucci, Armani, no problem
You want a camera, all the best makes: Nikon, Leica, Canon  can get you
(
) Yeah, it's all here: you an phone home, meet up with strangers, split up with your friends, watch Hollywood movies while you sip Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and green chicken soup
You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only find it here
And what do they want, all these people
/
Various young travelers, male and female, in snapsho9t exerpts, address their comments to the camera or each other
1 Where you been
2 Where you going
3 've been there 4 It's a waste of time TRAVELER1 We just got back TRAVELER2 Fantastic 3 How much did it cost
TRAVELER5 complete rip off
TRAVELER3 Too many people
There's a much better place along the coast
4 We're going exploring
We've read this book
It tells us all the best places to explore
2 know a place that everyone says is really unspoiled
1 heard they built a big hotel there
5 Some sort of sewage problem, apparently
1 We're going anyway: all the rooms have got air conditioning
(
) But for me it's all about finding out something about a place, and something about yourself
And when you get off the beaten track, that's where you find out what there is to find out
Richard turns into one of the restaurants
The restaurant extends deeply back away from the street
Richard passes many diners not dissimilar to himself
Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video entertainment
At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops his pack
Thai female   sits behind the desk
She immediately shows Richard a "menu" of available rooms
The menu offers a spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom
Richard points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht
The Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at
worn, disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a bottle in his hand, studying Richard
This is Daffy
Good evening
Daffy says nothing but continues to stare and takes a drink
Richard will not be stared down
Neither turns away
The Receptionist passes over a key and smiles broadly
Welcome to Thailand
Richard turns to her
Thank you
In a small windowless shower room, Richard stands motionless, eyes closed, facing with pleasure the spray of cold water
The sound of the shower can be heard through a door marked with a shower sign
The sound stops and the door is opened
Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist, carrying his key and washbag
He walks the short distance to his room
He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor
While he is doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard
There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle
Richard turns to the source of the whistle
beautiful European woman is smiling at him
This is Francoise
She approaches and takes the key from his hand
She turns the key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle
Et voila
The door swings gently open
She stands back Thank you
Footsteps approach from the stair
Francoise is joined by a young man, , who catches up with her
He nods at Richard as he takes her arm
They walk away from Richard to the next door
Bonsoir
Eh - bonsoir
Goodnight
The couple reach their door
They enter their room and the door is closed behind them
Alone in the corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence
(
) was traveling alone for two reasons
First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your experiences on a personal level
Secondly, and this  felt acutely at that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me
Richard is in the restaurant which is quiet now
He is alone at a table eating and drinking
On a high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car chases, and explosions, plays on the television
Most of the tables around him are empty
Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier, Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him
Excuse me
Yes
'm Daffy
Richard
Hi
Look, 'm sorry to bother you but  was wondering if you could help me out
Help you out
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe
'm sorry,  don't think so
'm waiting on some money coming through
It's just that at the moment, you know, 'm short
They're going to chuck me out
On the street in Bangkok, that's bad
'm really sorry but  just arrived; 'm on a pretty tight budget myself
just can't afford it
Just five dollars, please
He leans in close to Richard (continuing) 'll share something with you
'm sorry
can't lend you any money
Daffy retreats
Richard turns back to the video and his food
Daffy approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table
Excuse me, ladies, is there any chance you could help me out
'm down on my luck at the moment
The two young women seem uncomfortable
Richard notices
(continuing) if you could see your way to lending me some cash - Here
He leans across and holds out a ten dollar note for Daffy
Thank you, sir
Thank you
promise  will repay you
Just take it,
Daffy takes it
Richard returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected on his face
'
Some light enters from the street through a small window
Richard lies on his bed, watching the fan rotate above him
He is listening to the sound of Etienne and Francoise engaging in noisy sex
They reach the climax of their activity and fall silent
Richard just has time to enjoy the silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in the other direction
It is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above Richard's head and shouting in time
(
) Have
You
Got
Anything
To
Smoke
Have
You
Got
Anything
To
- Richard knocks sharply on the door of Daffy's room
The door is opened immediately by Daffy, looking even worse then before
No,  don't have anything to smoke
Daffy stares at him for a moment
Recognition dawns
You
You're the guy that lent me the money
Yeah, that's right
Now could you be quiet so  can get some sleep
Ten dollars
'll find a way to pay you back
How would you like to know About somewhere special
The perfect beach
Paradise
No one else knows about it
That's got to be worth something
What do you say
Look  don't care about the money right now:  just want some sleep
So if you could be quiet - Yea,
will be,  will be,  promise
Thanks
Richard turns away
Richard - He turns back
(Continuing) Been nice knowing you
He sticks his hand out
Richard politely reciprocates
Sure
They shake hands
The restaurant fronts on to the street where a new day's activity is beginning
Richard watches this as he eats his breakfast
He notices Etienne and Francoise sti down at the next table
Bonjour
Good morning
Did you sleep well
Not too bad
hope our noise did not keep you awake
Richard looks from one to the other
The noise
Don't worry
You're on holiday
She means your neighbor
The Scotsman Oh, that noise
Yes, he certainly did
We moved rooms because of him
He tried to borrow money from us
What idiot would lend him money
It would disappear
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach
It's on an island that no one get to
But he has been there, off course
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that
You know, that no one could get to
Of course, but look; all these people
If that place existed, they'd all be there
' On a large board are details, photographs and prices of various standard excursions
Thai   reels them off at great speed
Nakhon - Pathom - Phra Ptahom Chedi - Damnoen Sadual floating market - eight hundred baht
Kanchanburi - Erwan national Park Phrathat Cave, huang Khamin Falls - six hundred baht
Nam Tok, hellfire Pass, Three Pagodas, Sai Yok National Park - fifteen hundred baht
Bang Pa In Royal Palace, Ayatthaya, Wat Phra Manhathat, Wat Raburna - one thousand baht
What do you want
Richard studies the board but is not excited
Twenty Marlboro light, please
Instantly the Travel Agent produces the packet of cigarettes from a shelf and lays them on the counter
Richard lights up and looks around
He looks through the tapes at a stall
Richard walks along the corridor towards his room, his new tape playing on his walkman
On his door, a folded sheet of paper is attached with a pin
Richard lifts it off and unfolds it
It is a detailed and carefully drawn map of a cluster of islands
Some are named
One is unnamed
On it, some features are marked; hills, forest, river and a letter
In the corner it reads " = beach"
Richard switches his Walkman off
He studies the map then walks to Daffy's door and knocks
No reply
Richard twists the handle and pushes gently
The door opens
'
The room is dim, be even so the blood can be seen sprayed and smeared around the walls, sheets and floor
There is no sign of Daffy
Richard treads carefully, avoiding the pools of blood on the floor
He reaches the other side of the room
There, wedged in the narrow gap between bed and wall, is Daffy's corpse
His wrists have been cut
Richard studies the map again
(
) You hope and you dream, but you never believe that something's going to happen for you, not like it does in the movies
And when it does, you sort of expect it to feel different
More visceral
More real
Like  maybe
was waiting for it to hit me, but it didn't
And just for the record,  never did get my ten dollars back
Richard switches his walkman back on
In an office, two policemen, one in  and the other a , stand over Richard while he signs a statement
(
) The police didn't want to waste any time on it
They were just pissed off becase he was traveling on a false passport, name of Mr Daffy Duck, birthplace Ruritania, which kind of fucked up all the paperwork
They pulled everyone in from the hotel, but all they wanted form me was a statement saying  found him and it looked like he cut his wrists
No problem
The detective studies Richard's passport
What are you doing in Thailand
Tourist
Traveler
You go to Patpong
See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy
don't think so
Why not
Thai girls best in the world
Thai food best in the world
Thai dope best in the world
wouldn't know anything about that, sir
The door of the office opens and Richard walks out
Lined up in the corridor, slouching against the walls, are several other travelers from the hotel
At the front of the queue are Francoise and Etienne
The officer beckons Etienne into the office and closes the door
Richard and Francoise acknowledge each other with a smile
'
Richard is seated at the top of his bed, addressing his speech out of shot while he holds the map
, this island may not actually exist
And even if it does, we might not be able to get there
But look at it like this: what else is there to do around here
Richard is alone
(continuing) So what do you think
Are you going to come or not
'd be thrilled if you'd join me, you and your
you and your boyfriend
Richard knocks on his neighbors' door
Etienne opens it
Hi
You want to take a hike
mean a trip
journey
With your girlfriend and me
mean the two of you, and me
It's a secret island
Paradise
You know the kind of thing 'm talking about
Francoise appears behind Etienne
Hi
Hi there
Here, take a look
He shows Etienne the map
(continuing) It's a map
The dead guy left it for me;  think it's the place he tried to sell you
It's going to be just fucking great
You want to come
'd be thrileld if
Francoise and Etienne are looking at him
(
) realized that  had absolutely no idea of how  was going to get there
/
train travels at night alongside fields
Richard is awake
Opposite him, Etienne and Francoise are slumped together in sleep
(
) Etienne, however, and  have to hand it to the guy, was fucking great
He organized the whole thing: tickets, timetables, best route, the whole damn trip
The bow of a passenger ferry crashes through a wave
The decks are crowded with travelers and their packs
Amongst them are Richard, Francoise, and Etienne
Maps and guidebooks are being studied by many
The noise of the engines and the wind deters conversation
(
) Thanks to him we hit the final stop on the tourist trail inside twenty-four hours, where, Etienne assured me, we would hire what he called a "local fisherman" to take us on the last stage of our journey
Inside back of a covered, converted pick-up, four people are seated down each side, amongst them Richard, Francoise, and Etienne
Behind them as they bump along, can be seen the dusty red road bordered with dense green shrubs
The truck stops
Richard unloads the final of the three rucksacks from the roof of the truck, passing it down to Etienne who stands at the back with Francoise
The truck pulls away, revealing as sign, "Seashell Bungalows"
simple wooden shack on stilts, one of several standing in a line at the edge of the beach
There is a small porch to the front
spartan room: bed, mosquito nets, chair, cupboard, fan
Richard dumps his rucksack
